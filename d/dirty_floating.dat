A well-known example of the first case was the European Monetary System between 1979 and 1992. An example of the latter is the <b>dirty</b> <b>floating</b> of the dollar against the Dmark and yen after the so-called Louvre Accord in 1987. The analysis shows that the instantaneous effectiveness of intervention tends to be larger the more implicit the band policy is.

Our study of the archives of the Bank of France and the French Ministry of Finance, as well as a thourough examination of the exchange rates (FRF/USD) and (FRF/GBP) during the 1920 ś reveal that the French authorities did intervene on several occasions. How ever from these first direct actions, as well as some over abortive attempts, several lessons can be drawn about the effectiveness of interventions on a ‘modern’ echange rate market.

40|$|A {{group of}} {{developing}} countries bear high rates of financial dollarisation. Under this circumstance, monetary-policy makers are uncertain about the presence and scale of potentially harmful effects that might appear because of balance sheet mismatches arising from high and unexpected depreciations of the domestic currency. We build a setup whereby central bankers have two competing models in mind. Model A is a standard model for a small open economy whereas Model B has a built-in non-linear balance sheet effect. Whether the balance sheet mismatch problem exists or not, a Bayesian optimization procedure that assigns a positive probability to Model B, perpetuates model-indeterminacy. This happens because the optimal Bayesian regulator does not allow sizeable exchange rate swings (<b>dirty</b> <b>floating),</b> and therefore blurs the information to distinguish among models. We call this effect the Balance Sheet Trap. We show that, given {{the presence of the}} Balance Sheet Trap, introducing the learning dynamics into the central banker’s problem is optimal. Thus, we argue that intentional policy experimentation is highly desirable since it provides for an escape to the Balanc...|$|E
50|$|Managed float {{regime is}} the current {{international}} financial environment in which exchange rates fluctuate from day to day, but central banks attempt to influence their countries' exchange rates by buying and selling currencies. It {{is also known as}} a <b>dirty</b> <b>float.</b>|$|R
50|$|Floating {{rates are}} the most common {{exchange}} rate regime today. For example, the dollar, euro, yen, and British pound all are floating currencies.

25|$|The mere {{expectation}} or rumor of {{a central}} bank foreign exchange intervention might be enough to stabilize a currency. However, aggressive intervention might be used several times each year in countries with a <b>dirty</b> <b>float</b> currency regime. Central banks do not always achieve their objectives. The combined resources of the market can easily overwhelm any central bank. Several scenarios of this nature were seen in the 1992–93 European Exchange Rate Mechanism collapse, and in more recent times in Asia.|$|R
40|$|During the 1990 s {{a number}} of African central banks succeeded in {{bringing}} inflation to relatively low levels while maintaining a market-determined exchange rate. These central banks were generally reluctant to fully subordinate exchange rate targets to monetary targets, however, particularly {{in the face of}} large external shocks. We focus on the management of highly persistent shocks to aid flows, including PRSP-related increases in net flows, in the presence of currency substitution by the domestic private sector. Such shocks have beneficent long-run effects, but when currency substitution is high they can produce dramatic macroeconomic management problems in the short run. What is the appropriate mix of money and exchange rate targeting in such cases, and the role of temporary sterilization? We analyze these and related issues in an intertemporal optimizing model that allows a portion of aid to be devoted to reducing the government's seigniorage requirement. This creates a strong link between official aid flows and private capital flows, giving rise to tradeoffs reminiscent of the literature on private capital inflows in emerging markets. When the credibility of policymakers' commitment to low inflation is firm, some degree of <b>dirty</b> <b>floating,</b> with little or no sterilization of increases in the monetary base, is the most attractive approach. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the investigation of}} the surprisingly slow and weak international transmission of inflation indicated by the Mark III International Transmission Model. The Mark IV Simulation Model is presented. This is a simplified version of the Mark III Model which retains the transmission channels found significant in the Mark III and is suitable for simulation experiments. Separate versions of the Mark IV model describe the pegged and (<b>dirty)</b> <b>floating</b> exchange regimes. In order to be consistent with the stochastic processes governing policy variables in the sample period, policy experiments involved one percentage point increases in the disturbances of those processes for a single quarter with the behavior thereafter governed by the estimated process. U. S. money shocks were immediately mimicked (in accord with the monetary approach) in Germany but only with a lag (specie-flow mechanism) in the Netherlands. Canada and the U. K. showed only Keynesian absorption transmission. Weaker transmission is generally found under floating exchange rates with a J-curve important in the dynamics. No significant international transmission was found in experiments involving money shocks in the U. K. and Germany and real government spending shocks in the U. S., U. K., and Germany. The money shock experiments indicated short-run money control in U. K. and Germany, although less under pegged than floating rates. ...|$|E

40|$|Despite almost 10 {{years of}} low inflation, Croatia {{continues}} to experience {{high levels of}} dollarisation/‘euroisation’. Roughly, three-quarters of bank deposits and currency in circulation are held in foreign currency. This limits the manoeuvering room for monetary policy. Banks try to avoid balance sheet mismatches by indexing lending to the exchange rate, but this creates credit risk. In addition, strong currency depreciation could lead to flight from the currency, and inflation pass-through, while apparently moderate in recent years, could easily become a problem.

40|$|It {{is usually}} conjectured that the nominal {{exchange}} rate {{should be more}} volatile under a free float than under a <b>dirty</b> <b>float</b> regime. This paper examines this issue for the Chilean economy. Specifically, in September 1999 the Central Bank of Chile eliminated the floating band for the nominal exchange rate, which operated since 1984, and established a free float. This lasted until the burst of the last Argentinean economic crisis in July 2001. Since then, the Central Bank has smoothed out the exchange rate path by selling US dollars and/or issuing US dollar-denominated bonds. We examine the free float period by assessing whether the increase in exchange rate volatility was as sharp as expected. We show that volatility went up, but only slightly. ...|$|R

The objective is to measure the relative size of currency exchange interventions during 2004 and 2006, a period of appreciation of the peso, and to calculate its effectiveness regarding the effects over the mean and variance of the nominal exchange rate. The determination of the exchange rate through a portfolio balance model {{and the use of}} currency exchange market intervention indexes show that interventions of the Central Bank seeking to protect the controlled floating regime have had small and transitory effects on the level and variance of the exchange ratestylized interventions, exchange regime, <b>dirty</b> <b>float,</b> exchange market, exchange rate, portfolio model. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the determinants of economic growth, and, in particular, with the role of policy in directing the pat-tern of growth in developing economies. Over the years, economists and policymakers have focused primarily on fiscal and exchange rate policy. While the role of fiscal deficits is well understood, the same agreement does not hold with regard to exchange rate policy. Part of the reason for the controversial nature of exchange rate pol-icy is that it comes in various styles—floating, <b>dirty</b> <b>float,</b> managed, <b>dirty</b> managed, pegged, and fixed. Besides floating, the success or fail-ure of a particular exchange rate policy appears to be contingent not {{on the nature of the}} regime but rather on the direction of the mis-alignment of the currency. Bad exchange rate policy, in the form of an overvalued exchange rate, has been much analyzed and the results are well known. A persistently overvalued exchange rate leads to factor misallocations, loss in efficiency, higher inflation, and lower GDP growth. This conclusion is widely accepted, but the parallel theoreti-cal and analytically equivalent conclusion—that exchange rate under-valuation is helpful to growth—is not. Moreover, even if accepted in theory, in practice the discussion gets involved with definitional and measurement issues. How do we define the real exchange rate? How does one measure it? Most important, how does one measure equi-librium? It is the latter that allows misalignment to be measured...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{challenge}} couple of dangerous theoretical misconceptions in open‐economy macro, namely, in respect to desirability or sustainability of available exchange rate regimes and inflation targeting framework and their mutual compatibility in small open economies with incomplete (emerging) markets. First of all, we dismiss the ruling »two corner solution« as dogma in scientific disguise. Furthermore, all the benefits of more flexible intermediate regimes (sliding currency bands) as well as empirical support of their wellbeing have been put forward. As to the monetary policies, majority of transition countries recognised superiority of inflation targeting over alternative monetary concepts. However, until very recently some emerging market economies failed to realize the benefits of full‐fledged ‐let alone flexible‐ inflation targeting. In what follows, the article counters another theoretical dogma: that inflation targeting in emerging market economies must go hand in hand with fully flexible exchange rate regime. Having said that, and again contrary to the mainstream literature in the field, paper exposes some serious weaknesses of the so‐called <b>dirty</b> (or managed) <b>floating</b> as an intermediate regime: in particular, its potential sub optimality in practice and its hidden incompatibility with widespread inflation targeting strategies. Paper concludes by reiterating the inevitability of close relationship between inflation targeting and exchange rate targeting and hence suggests several possible reaction functions for the monetary authorities in emerging markets among those already laid out in the related literature...|$|R
