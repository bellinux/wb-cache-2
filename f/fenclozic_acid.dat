5000|$|<b>Fenclozic</b> <b>acid</b> is an analgesic, antipyretic, and {{anti-inflammatory}} drug. It {{has been}} withdrawn in 1970 due to jaundice.|$|E
50|$|Compared to <b>fenclozic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{piprozolin}} shows choleretic {{rather than}} antiinflammatory activity. That is, the compound {{is useful in}} those conditions where the flow of bile is to be increased.Condensation of ethyl mercaptoacetate with ethyl cyanoacetate leads to thiazolinone (4); an intermediate such as 3, involving addition of the mercaptide to the nitrile function can reasonably be invoked. M/ethylation with di(m)ethyl sulfate proceeds on nitrogen with the comcomitant shift of the enamine to afford olefin (5). Bromination of the active methylene (6) followed by displacement of halogen by piperidine affords the choleretic piprozolin (7).|$|E
40|$|<b>Fenclozic</b> <b>acid</b> (MyalexTM) was {{developed}} by ICI pharmaceuticals in the 1960 s {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis and was a promising compound with a good preclinical safety profile and efficacy. Whilst it did not show adverse hepatic effects in preclinical animal tests or initial studies in man[1, 2] it was later withdrawn from clinical development. Hepatotoxicity was observed in humans at daily doses of 400 mg but was not replicated in any of the animal species tested. Rodrigues et al (2013) [3] published a mechanistic investigation using modern in vitro assays/techniques in order to investigate the hepatotoxicity, however, only the covalent binding in rat, dog and human microsomes was identified as a potential indicator for hepatoxicity. Metabolites associated with or responsible for covalent binding could not be detected, likely due to the low in vitro metabolic turnover of <b>fenclozic</b> <b>acid</b> in microsomes. Foulkes (1970) [4] investigated the in vivo metabolism of <b>fenclozic</b> <b>acid</b> which included a rat BDC study characterising the biliary and urinary metabolites, however no reactive metabolites were identified. This study aimed to re-investigate the in vivo metabolism of <b>fenclozic</b> <b>acid</b> in rat, with a focus on identifying any reactive metabolites that could explain the in vitro covalent binding in microsomes observed across the species. Using modern analytical techniques we were successful in identifying an epoxide reactive metabolite, which upon conjugation with GSH formed up to 16 GSH-related products including positional and diastereoisomers. Not including the GSH related conjugates 7 additional metabolites were identified compared to these previous metabolism studies...|$|E
40|$|The distribution, metabolism, {{excretion}} and hepatic {{effects of}} the human hepatotoxin <b>fenclozic</b> <b>acid</b> were investigated following single oral doses of 10 mg/kg to normal and bile-duct cannulated male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Whole body autoradiography showed distribution into all tissues except the brain, with radioactivity still detectable in blood, kidney and liver at 72 h post dose. Mice dosed with [14 C]-fenclozic acid showed acute centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis but no {{other regions of the}} liver were affected. The majority of the [14 C]-fenclozic acid-related material recovered was found in the urine/aqueous cage wash, (49 %) whilst a smaller portion (13 %) was eliminated via the faeces. Metabolic profiles for urine, bile and faecal extracts, obtained using liquid chromatography and a combination of mass spectrometric and radioactivity detection, revealed extensive metabolism of <b>fenclozic</b> <b>acid</b> in mice that involved biotransformations via both oxidation and conjugation. These profiling studies also revealed the presence of glutathione-derived metabolites providing evidence for the production of reactive species by mice administered <b>fenclozic</b> <b>acid.</b> Covalent binding to proteins from liver, kidney and plasma was also demonstrated, although this binding was relatively low (less than 50 pmol eq. /mg protein) ...|$|E
40|$|Hepatic NADPH-cytochrome P 450 {{oxidoreductase}} null (HRN™) mice exhibit no functional {{expression of}} hepatic cytochrome P 450 (P 450) {{when compared to}} wild type (WT) mice, but have normal hepatic and extrahepatic expression of other biotransformation enzymes. We have assessed the utility of HRN™ mice for investigation {{of the role of}} metabolic bioactivation in liver toxicity caused by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) <b>fenclozic</b> <b>acid.</b> In vitro studies revealed significant NADPH-dependent (i. e. P 450 -mediated) covalent binding of [14 C]-fenclozic acid to liver microsomes from WT mice and HRN™ mice, whereas no in vitro covalent binding was observed {{in the presence of the}} UDP-glucuronyltransferase cofactor UDPGA. Oral <b>fenclozic</b> <b>acid</b> administration did not alter the liver histopathology or elevate the plasma liver enzyme activities of WT mice, or affect their hepatic miRNA contents. Livers from HRN™ mice exhibited abnormal liver histopathology (enhanced lipid accumulation, bile duct proliferation, hepatocellular degeneration, necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration) and plasma clinical chemistry (elevated alanine aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activities). Modest apparent improvements in these abnormalities were observed when HRN™ mice dosed orally with <b>fenclozic</b> <b>acid</b> for 7 days at 100 mg/kg/day. Previously we observed more marked effects on liver histopathology and integrity in HRN™ mice dosed orally with the NSAID diclofenac for 7 days at 30 mg/kg/day. We conclude that HRN™ mice are valuable for assessing P 450 -related hepatic drug biotransformation, but not for drug toxicity studies due to underlying liver dysfunction. Nonetheless, HRN™ mice may provide novel insights into the role of inflammation in liver injury, thereby aiding its treatment...|$|E
40|$|Many carboxylic-acid-containing drugs cause liver {{injury in}} humans. Examples include <b>fenclozic</b> <b>acid</b> (FA), which was {{withdrawn}} due to jaundice observed in clinical trials, and diclofenac (DFC) which remains widely prescribed despite {{being associated with}} liver damage. To explore whether these toxicities {{could be due to}} metabolic bioactivation mediated by cytochrome P 450 (CYP) or conjugative enzymes, covalent binding (CVB) assays were done using liver microsomal incubations from wild-type and hepatic cytochrome P 450 reductase null (HRN™) mice, which are deficient in CYP activity. High levels of CYP-mediated CVB of [14 C]-FA and [14 C]-DFC were observed in wild-type microsomes, but not in HRN™ microsomes. No UDPGAmediated CVB was detected in microsomes incubated with [14 C]-FA. Wild-type and HRN™ mice were orally administered DFC or FA orally for 7 days. At 100 mg/kg, FA caused a significant (p< 0. 05) time-dependent increase in plasma alanine amino transferase (ALT) in wild-type but not HRN™ mice. Aberrant liver histopathology and liver clinical chemistry were evident in HRNTM mice and treatment with DFC and FA “normalised” the elevated ALT levels. These data demonstrate that FA undergoes CYP mediated bioactivation and that HRNTM mice are well suited to investigations of metabolism, but not of liver toxicity, due to impaired liver function...|$|E
