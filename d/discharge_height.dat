40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) {{analysis is}} a reliable tool {{to assess the}} integrity of electrical insulation. Representation and interpretation of the data, obtained from e. g. online PD monitoring, are key issues to reveal the discharge source, i. e. defect type, {{as well as the}} physical phenomena behind the occurrence. Analyses of various PD patterns such as <b>discharge</b> <b>height</b> distribution presented in this work provide useful statistical parameters to identify the discharge source. Research shows that the 2 -parameter Weibull distribution is a reliable model to quantify the characteristics of the patterns of the defect. The model fits well to the charge-height distribution. In addition, trends in the discharge density pattern that occur over long times, can be used as complementary information to discover the discharge nature. It alerts for a possible failure and therefore assists in taking corrective measures to prevent failure. This paper presents the application of such statistical modeling to the area of on-line power cable diagnostics.

The flow {{is characterized by a}} longitudinal variation of curvature, skewed impingement onto a flat surface, a recirculating region, {{and the development of a}} wall jet region. A numerical simulation is used, by means of the finite volume method with the second order turbulent closure model: the Reynolds stress Model (RSM), to investigate the influence of certain parameters such as jet <b>discharge</b> <b>height</b> and the geometric nozzle. Flow structure is described in the preimpingement, recirculation and impingement regions. Interdependence is shown among the offset height (h) and the geometric nozzle (plane jet and circular jet). The obtained results are presented in terms of the jet dimensionless velocity distribution, maximum velocity decay and vectors velocity of the flow. The jet decay is presented. The recirculation region is fed by a relatively strong backflow for the reported high offset height and it is shown that the reattachment point depends strongly with the jet form and the offset height...|$|E

This study {{was carried out}} in 11 steep (0. 27 - 0. 65 m m- 1) catchments (0. 4 - 25 km 2) in the western Rift Valley escarpment of Northern Ethiopia, which experienced severe deforestation and degradation until {{the first half of the}} 1980 s and considerable reforestation thereafter. We measured the peak <b>discharge</b> <b>height</b> of 332 events and the median diameter of the 10 coarsest bedload particles (Max 10) moved in after each event in three rainy seasons (2012 - 2014) with the objective of analyzing {{variability in}} peak discharge and bedload movement in relation to vegetation cover change. Seven rain gauges were installed at different altitudes (1623 - 2851 m a. s. l.) in and nearby the catchments. Peak discharge events were calculated using the Manning’s equation from measurements of maximum <b>discharge</b> <b>height</b> at 11 crest stage gauges. Hydraulic competence analysis for the entrainment of the average Max 10 was carried out using peak discharge, stream power and critical shear stress approaches. Land cover class percentages were detected from Google Earth Imagery (February 1, 2014). Morphometric characteristics of the catchments were computed both from ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and topographic maps. Average catchment-specific peak discharge coefficient (Cp) showed a strong decreasing relation with vegetation cover (R 2 = 0. 85, P< 0. 01), catchment length (R 2 = 0. 37, P< 0. 05), time of concentration (R 2 = 0. 43, P< 0. 05) and average soil depth (R 2 = 0. 42, P< 0. 01), while positively with catchment slope gradient (R 2 = 0. 37, P< 0. 05). Max 10 was negatively related with vegetation cover (R 2 = 0. 58, P< 0. 05), while positively with scar density on the surrounding slopes (R 2 = 0. 50, P< 0. 05) and catchment area (R 2 = 0. 36, P< 0. 05). Multiple regression analysis revealed that 99 % (P< 0. 01) of the variability of catchment-specific peak discharge coefficient in the catchments can be predicted by vegetation cover and infiltration number, while 98 % of the variability in Max 10 is explained by scar density and catchment area. Entrainment of Max 10 was positively related to peak discharge (Qp) (R 2 = 0. 60, P< 0. 01, stream power (R 2 = 0. 71, P< 0. 01) and critical shear stress (τc) with reference to D 50 (r 50) (R 2 = 0. 96, P< 0. 01) and D 84 (r 84) (R 2 = 0. 93, P< 0. 01). Overall, this study demonstrates that in reforesting steep tropical mountain catchments, runoff response of catchments and bedload movement is strongly determined by vegetation cover...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Decisions on maintaining, repairing, {{refurbishing}} {{and replacing}} cable systems are usually {{a compromise between}} what technically is advised and what economically is feasible. To implement an optimal maintenance and/or replacement strategy, asset managers and/or maintenance engineers need appropriate tools {{to provide them with}} reliable information on the condition of the cable systems. Partial discharge analysis has a long record as reliable diagnostic tool to assess the integrity and the quality of electrical insulation of power systems. For assessing the condition of MV cable systems, it often is the only source of information. Proper interpretation of the observed discharge patterns, from e. g. on-line PD monitoring, can be used to reveal the discharge source i. e. defect type as well as the physical phenomena behind it. In contrary with a deterministic approach, probabilistic analyses appear to be more appropriate to model the discharge behavior initiated from unknown sources. Analyses of various PD patterns such as <b>discharge</b> <b>height</b> distribution and discharge density distribution as a function of time may provide characteristic statistical parameters to determine the discharge source as well as the degradation process. Research shows that the 2 -parameter Weibull distribution provides a potential model to quantify the characteristics of the observed patterns.

The operation of the gate is considered an important process. The up and down movement of the gate would affect the velocity and cause local scour as the result of fluctuating rate. This research aims to assess the effects of discharge and gate-opening height variations, as well as the type of bedchannel material, on the change of depth of scour (ds). The research was conducted of open channel flow model with a sluice gate able to up and down movement. The discharges used in the research were 9 types ranging from 1. 0 to 5. 0 dm 3 ·s− 1. There were 5 variations in the height of gate-opening ranging from 0. 5 to 2. 5 cm at intervals of 0. 5 and types of channel-bed material. The results of the research showed that the depth of scour can be analysed as a function of <b>discharge,</b> <b>height</b> of gate-opening, height of water level upstream and downstream, and the type of bed material used.

40|$|A well-functioning, {{energy-efficient}} {{ventilation system}} is of vital importance to offices, {{not only to}} {{provide the kind of}} comfortable, healthy indoor environment necessary for the well-being and productive work performance of occupants, but also to reduce energy use in buildings and the associated impact of CO 2 emissions on the environment. To achieve these goals impinging jet ventilation has been developed as an innovative ventilation concept. In an impinging jet ventilation system, a high momentum of air jet is discharged downwards, strikes the floor and spreads over it, thus distributing the fresh air along the floor {{in the form of a}} very thin shear layer. This system retains advantages of mixing and stratification from conventional air distribution methods, while capable of overcoming their shortcomings. The aim of this thesis is to reach a thorough understanding of impinging jet ventilation for providing a good thermal environment for an office, by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) supported by detailed measurements. The full-field measurements were carried out in two test rooms located in a large enclosure giving relatively stable climate conditions. This study has been divided into three parts where the first focuses on validation of numerical investigations against measurements, the second addresses impacts of a number of design parameters on the impinging jet flow field and thermal comfort level, and the third compares ventilation performance of the impinging jet supply device with other air supply devices intended for mixing, wall confluent jets and displacement ventilation, under specific room conditions. In the first part, velocity and temperature distributions of the impinging jet flow field predicted by different turbulence models are compared with detailed measurements. Results from the non-isothermal validation studies show that the accuracy of the simulation results is to a great extent dependent on the complexity of the turbulence models, due to complicated flow phenomena related to jet impingement, such as recirculation, curvature and instability. The v 2 -f turbulence model shows the best performance with measurements, which is slightly better than the SST k-ω model but much better than the RNG k-ε model. The difference is assumed to be essentially related to the magnitude of turbulent kinetic energy predicted in the vicinity of the stagnation region. Results from the isothermal study show that both the SST k-ω and RNG k-ε models predict similar wall jet behaviours of the impinging jet flow. In the second part, three sets of parametric studies were carried out by using validated CFD models. The first parametric study shows that the geometry of the air supply system has the most significant impact on the flow field. The rectangular air supply device, especially the one with larger aspect ratio, provides a longer penetration distance to the room, which is suitable for industrial ventilation. The second study reveals that the interaction effect of cooling ceiling, heat sources and impinging jet ventilation results in complex flow phenomena but with a notable feature of air circulation, which consequently decreases thermal stratification in the room and increases draught discomfort at the foot level. The third study demonstrates the advantage of using response surface methodology to study simultaneous effects on changes in four parameters, i. e. shape of air supply device, jet <b>discharge</b> <b>height,</b> supply airflow rate and supply air temperature. Analysis of the flow field reveals that at a low <b>discharge</b> <b>height,</b> the shape of air supply device has a major impact on the flow pattern in the vicinity of the supply device. Correlations between the studied parameters and local thermal discomfort indices were derived. Supply airflow rates and temperatures are shown to be the most important parameter for draught and stratification discomfort, respectively. In the third part, the impinging jet supply device was shown to provide a better overall performance than other air supply devices used for mixing, wall confluent jets and displacement ventilation, with respect to thermal comfort, heat removal effectiveness, air exchange efficiency and energy-saving potential related to fan power...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigation {{examines the}} thermal behaviour of single and arrays of fluid jets impinging at heated surfaces, and formulates enhancement schemes for the jet impingement heat transfer processes for high-intensity cooling applications. The proposed techniques are numerically modelled and analysed {{over a wide}} parametric range to identify flow characteristics leading to thermal enhancement and optimum performance. The first scheme applies to a single fluid jet and incorporates a protruding object at the impingement surface to improve heat transfer. In this, a conical protrusion of high thermal conductivity {{is attached to the}} heated surface directly beneath the jet. Three different aspect ratios of 0. 5, 1 and 2 are investigated for the protrusion while the inclusion of a fillet {{at the base of the}} cone is also studied. Jet Reynolds numbers between 100 and 30, 000 are modelled. The observed thermal performance is compared with a reference case having no surface attachment. With this arrangement, the heat transfer rate typically varies between 10 and 40 percent above the reference case although depending on certain parametric combinations, the heat transfer may increase above or decrease below the reference performance. The highest indicated increase in heat transfer is about 90 percent while 15 percent below is the lowest. Careful selection of cone surface profile creates potential for further thermal enhancement. The second scheme applies to a single fluid jet and incorporates a recess in the impingement surface to improve heat transfer. In this, a cylindrical cavity is introduced to the surface beneath the jet into which the fluid jet impinges. The effects of the cavity on heat transfer are examined for a number of different cavity diameters, cavity depths and jet <b>discharge</b> <b>heights</b> wherein a surface without a cavity is taken as the reference surface. Cavity diameters of 2, 3 and 4 times the jet diameter are investigated at cavity depths between zero and 4 times the jet diameter. Jet <b>discharge</b> <b>heights</b> range between 2 jet diameters above the reference surface to 2 jet diameters below the reference surface. The jet Reynolds number is varied between 100 and 30, 000. With this enhancement technique, increases in heat transfer rates of up to 45 percent are observed when compared to the reference performance. The thermal performance of fluid jet arrays is examined by altering square or hexagonal array configurations to identify flow characteristics leading to optimal heat transfer rates. For this, the jet to jet spacing is varied between 1. 5 and 7 times the jet diameter while the jet to surface height is varied between 2 and 6 times the jet diameter. Jet Reynolds numbers between 100 and 30, 000 are investigated. For each configuration, a critical jet-to-jet spacing is identified below which the heat transfer is observed to reduce significantly. Correlations for the expected heat transfer for a square or hexagonal array are presented in terms of the jet to jet spacing, jet height and jet Reynolds number...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{air distribution}} {{systems that are}} based on confluent jets; this system can be of interest for the establishment of indoor environments, to fulfill the goals of indoor climate and energy-efficient usage. The main objective {{of this study is to}} provide deeper understanding of the flow field development of a supply device that is designed based on wall confluent jets and to investigate the ventilation performance by experimental and numerical methods. In this study, the supply device can be described as an array of round jets on a flat surface attached to a side wall. Multiple round jets that issue from supply device apertures are combined at a certain distance downstream from the device and behave as a united jet or so-called confluent jets. Multiple round jets that are generated from the supply device move downward and are attached to the wall at the primary region, due to the Coanda effect, and then they become wall confluent jets until the floor wall is reached. A wall jet in a secondary region is formed along the floor after the stagnation region. The characteristics of the flow field and the ventilation performance of conventional wall confluent jets and modified wall confluent jets supply devices are investigated experimentally in an office test room. The study of the modified wall confluent jets is intended to improve the efficiency of the conventional one while maintaining acceptable thermal comfort in an office environment. The results show that the modified wall confluent jets supply device can provide acceptable thermal comfort for the occupant with lower airflow rate compared to the conventional wall confluent jets supply device. Numerical predictions using three turbulence models (renormalization group (RNG k– ε), realizable (Re k– ε), and shear stress transport (SST k– ω) are evaluated by measurement results. The computational box and nozzle plate models are used to model the inlet boundary conditions of the nozzle device. In the isothermal study, the wall confluent jets in the primary region and the wall jet in the secondary region, when predicted by the three turbulence models, are in good agreement with the measurements. The non-isothermal validation studies show that the SST k– ω model is slightly better at predicting the wall confluent jets than the other two models. The SST k– ω model is used to investigate the effects of the nozzle diameter, number of nozzles, nozzle array configuration, and inlet <b>discharge</b> <b>height</b> on the ventilation performance of the proposed wall confluent jets supply device. The nozzle diameter and number of nozzles play important roles in determining the airflow pattern, temperature field, and draught distribution. Increased temperature stratification and less draught distribution are achieved by increasing the nozzle diameter and number of nozzles. The supply device with smaller nozzle diameters and fewer nozzles yields rather uniform temperature distribution due to the dominant effect of mixing. The flow behavior is nearly independent of the inlet <b>discharge</b> <b>height</b> for the studied range. The proposed wall confluent jets supply device is compared with a mixing supply device, impinging supply device and displacement supply device. The results show that the proposed wall confluent jets supply device has the combined behavior of both mixing and stratification principles. The proposed wall confluent jets supply device provides better overall ventilation performance than the mixing and displacement supply devices used in this study. This study covers also another application of confluent jets that is based on impinging technology. The supply device under consideration has an array of round jets on a curve. Multiple jets issue from the supply device aperture, in which the supply device is positioned vertically and the jets are directed against a target wall. The flow behavior and ventilation performance of the impinging confluent jets supply device is studied experimentally in an industrial premise. The results show that the impinging confluent jets supply device maintains acceptable thermal comfort in the occupied zone by creating well-distributed airflow during cold and hot seasons...|$|E
40|$|Total {{lightning}} (TL) {{data has}} been found to provide valuable information about the internal dynamics of a thunderstorm allowing conclusions about its further development as well as indicating potential of thunderstorm-related severe weather at the ground. This paper investigates electrical discharge correlations of strokes and flashes with respect to the temporal evolution of thunderstorms in case studies as well as by statistical means. The recently developed algorithm li-TRAM (tracking and monitoring of lightning-cells, Meyer et al., 2012) has been employed to track and monitor thunderstorms based on three-dimensionally resolved TL lightning data provided as stroke events by the European lightning location network LINET. From statistical investigation of 863 suited thunderstorm life-cycles the cell area turned out to correlate well with (a) the total discharge rate, (b) the in-cloud (IC) discharge rate, and (c) the mean IC <b>discharge</b> <b>height</b> per lightning-cell as identified by li-TRAM. All three parameter correlations consistently show an abrupt change in discharge characteristics around a cell area of 170 km 2 . Statistical investigations supported by the comparison of three case studies – selected to represent a single storm, a multi-cell and a supercell – strongly suggest that the correlation functions include the temporal evolution as well as the storm type. With the help of volumetric radar data, it can also be suggested that the well defined break observed at 170 km 2 marks the region, where the transition occurs from short-lived and rather simple structured single storm cells to better organized, more persistent, and more complex structured thunderstorm forms, e. g. multi-cells and super-cells. All three storm-types experience similar discharge characteristics during their growing and dissipating phases. However, while the poorly organized and short-lived cells preferentially remain small during a short mature phase, mainly the more persistent thunderstorm types develop to sizes above 170 km 2 during a pronounced mature stage. At that stage they exhibit on average higher discharge rates at higher altitudes as compared with matured single-cells. With the maximum stroke distance set to 10 km and a flash duration set to 1 s the parameterisation functions found for the stroke rate as function of the cell area has been transformed to a flash rate. The presented study suggests that, with respect to the storm type, stroke and flash correlations can be parameterized. There is also strong evidence, that parameterization functions include the time parameter, so that altogether TL stroke information has good potential to pre-estimate the further evolution (nowcast) of a currently observed storm in an object-oriented thunderstorm nowcasting approach...|$|E

There is described a legal framework defining competencies, division, as well as the working of each fire protection units. Information on the various types of water pumps used not only in fire protection, working principles and specifics of mobile water pumps are also described here in a retrieval of information resources. The second part, which is my own research, is analysis of condition of mobile water pumps on selected sample of fire protection units from the region of Liberec. This practical task was realized by my myself questionnaires that I sent out to chosen fire protection units. Additional information was acquired thanks to personal interviews with representatives of the units. My field of interest was the quality of condition of mobile water pumps. The finally condition depends on the fact if the fire units own the pumps and their technical level. The monitored parameters were old pumps, maximum power, maximum <b>discharge</b> <b>height,</b> weight and maximum flow rate of the pump. The quality of the conditions of mobile water pumps of fire protection units was evaluated by using my own modification of operational analysis. The index of condition as a unique identifier was the outcome of the evaluation. The hypothesis The condition of mobile water pumps of chosen fire protection units corresponds today's technical possibilities - had prescientific character and it was formulated intuitively. The hypothesis also contained expectations of high and technically adequate condition of mobile water pumps of chosen fire protection units. Basis for the hypothesis flowed from the experience of recent years, when the fire brigade were gradually upgraded its founders. Based on the results it is possible to confirm the hypothesis and indicate the condition of chosen fire protection units from the region of Liberec as a sufficient because all of them pass the basic limit. To achieve four specific aims of this work the comparison of monitored technical parameters and the number of pumps with limit for condition was used. These aims of the thesis were complete thanks to these methods except one. It was the plan of modernization at the fire protection unit, which does not correspond amenities. Since the confirmation of the hypothesis, which states that mobile pumps amenities for today's technical possibilities, no need to drive to modernize the newer models.

This study focuses on the modeling of the discharge of the collected water in order to establish relationships between the geometrical characteristics of an open deck or damaged hull - its beam, height of the gap (e. g. freeing port) - and wave parameters such as wave length and wave height.

This program interpolates values from a large data base of drift distances originally calculated for single droplets with a flow simulation program (FLUENT). The simulations of drift distances up to 200 m (656 ft) included temperatures (10 - 30 °C; 50 - 86 °F), <b>discharge</b> <b>heights</b> (0 - 2. 0 m; 0 - 6. 56 ft), initial downward droplet velocities (0 - 50 m/s; 0 - 164 ft/s), relative humidity (10 - 100 %), wind velocities (0 - 10. 0 m/s; 0 - 32. 8 ft/s), droplet sizes (10 - 2000 µm), droplet size distribution in Dv. 1, Dv. 5 and Dv. 9, and 20 % turbulence intensity.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to assess the benefit of total-lightning {{information}} as independent data source for thunderstorm tracking and short-term prediction (nowcasting) of storm evolution. Special focus has been laid on the three-dimensional lightning information and the in-cloud and cloud-to-ground discrimination provided by the lightning detection network LINET. The reliability of the lightning information and its usability for nowcasting purposes have been tested both separately and {{in combination with other}} data sources which are commonly used for thunderstorm nowcasting. The new thunderstorm tracker ec-TRAM (tracking and monitoring of electrically charged cells; Meyer et al. (2009)) has been developed to identify, track, and monitor thunderstorms in high temporal and spatial resolution by combining the information of independently tracked convective ground-precipitation cells and lightning-cells to new cell objects. The algorithm builds on the autonomously operating routines rad-TRAM (tracking and monitoring of radar cells; Kober and Tafferner (2009)) and li-TRAM (tracking and monitoring of lightning cells). The latter has also been developed within this work. The new tracking algorithm has been tested based on a thunderstorm data set of more than 500 storm tracks which were recorded by ec-TRAM in southern Germany during summer 2008. It is found that the newly composed cell objects comprehensively describe simple as well as complex thunderstorm structures and the cell tracking method of ec-TRAM proves to be more coherent and stable in comparison with the tracking performances of rad-TRAM and li-TRAM. For two selected thunderstorms the time series of cell parameters monitored by ec-TRAM have been complemented with three-dimensional polarimetric radar data and satellite data to assess how the temporal evolution and parameter correlation of total lightning strokes, hydrometeor formation, ground precipitation patterns, and cloud top temperature can be used to estimate the storm state and predict its development. The parameter evolutions are found to be consistent with the current state of knowledge. A principal life-cycle scheme can be identified for the cell parameters on large time scales. The stronger fluctuating short-term parameter evolutions are found to refl ect the momentary storm dynamic. Based on the lifetime diagrams several warning parameters for subsequent storm events can be suggested. Significant cell parameter correlations, which can be parameterized, are also found in statistical analyses over the complete data set. Strong positive correlations are found between cell extension, discharge frequency, and in-cloud <b>discharge</b> <b>height.</b> Two cell regimes, sharply separated at a specific cell characteristic, can clearly be identified in all correlation diagrams. Interpreted on the basis of previous studies {{and in terms of the}} current state of knowledge, it seems most likely that the two cell-regimes refl ect the storm characteristics of different storm organization forms. The parameterized correlation curves could then be used as cell parameterizations in operational nowcasting tools to predict the dynamic evolution, duration, and danger potential of a storm, provided that the storm system can be classified. Finally, it can be concluded that this study demonstrates the usability and the promising potential of total-lightning data as reliable and independent data source for future nowcasting tools...|$|E

The results indicate that the fraction - 3. 55 mm cutting size in stage 2 does not affect bulk density significantly, while the increase of do. s decreases bulk density to a minimum and then increases. Particle size distribution does not affect angle of repose much. The increase of moisture content decreases bulk density and increases angle of repose significantly. The increase of oil addition increases bulk density while decreases angle of repose significantly. The correlation between bulk density and angle of repose can also be observed: the higher bulk density, the lower angle of repose. There are other variables affecting bulk density and angle of repose. They include oil type, absorption time <b>discharging</b> <b>height</b> and external loading. Their effects on bulk density and angle of repose are quantified in stage 4. The results suggest that, a higher discharging position or larger external loading increase bulk density significantly. Angle of repose decreases when increase the <b>height</b> of <b>discharging</b> position. Diesel oil performed better than waste oil addition in terms of bulk density enhancement. For most of the cases examined, bulk density and angle of repose become stable after ~ 24 hours oil absorption time...|$|R

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 The {{ecology of}} {{eulachon}} (Thaleichthys pacificus) was studied at Twentymile River, a tributory of Turnagain Arm located in southcentral Alaska. In 2000 and 2001, we investigated the environmental {{factors associated with}} the migration of adult eulachon and downstream drift of larval eulachon. We assessed run timing, freshwater duration, length, weight, age, {{presence or absence of}} teeth, fecundity, and gear selectivity for dip and gill nets. Catch per unit effort of migrating adult fish were correlated with water temperature, tide <b>height,</b> river <b>discharge,</b> light intensity, and the density of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Water temperature, river <b>discharge,</b> tide <b>height,</b> and light intensity were related to downstream drift intensity of larvae.

40|$|International audienceNon-luminous {{relativistic}} electron beams above thunderclouds {{have been}} detected by the radio signals of low frequency ∼ 40 - 400 kHz which they radiate. The electron beams occur ∼ 2 - 9 ms after positive cloud-to-ground lightning <b>discharges</b> at <b>heights</b> between ∼ 22 - 72 km above thunderclouds. Intense positive lightning discharges can also cause sprites which occur either above or prior to the electron beam. One electron beam was detected without any luminous sprite which suggests that electron beams may also occur independently of sprites. Numerical simulations show that beams of electrons partially discharge the lightning electric field above thunderclouds and thereby gain a mean energy of ∼ 7 MeV to transport a total charge of ∼− 10 mC upwards. The impulsive current ∼ 3 × 10 − 3 Am− 2 associated with relativistic electron beams above thunderclouds is directed downwards {{and needs to be}} considered as a novel element of the global atmospheric electric circuit...|$|R

The comparison between the CPFD predictions and the experimental results in terms of solid discharge rates, surface cone shape during discharge and pressure drops in the standpipe. The comparison allowed to assess on the possibility to use the CPFD modelling approach to simulate the powder flow in the hopper-standpipe system even accounting for the rather complex interactions between the interstitial gas and the particles occurring {{in the presence of a}} standpipe. Furthermore, the effect of hopper geometry on powder discharge was investigated with the CPFD model and verified experimentally in some purposely built hoppers. Finally, the relationships between the hopper geometry parameters (hopper outlet diameter and hopper half angle) and the flow parameters (solid <b>discharge</b> rate, <b>height</b> of characteristic surface, particle volume fraction, particle velocity, gas pressure and flow pattern) were obtained...|$|R
40|$|This study {{intends to}} bridge the gap between global- and local-scale {{hydrological}} studies in the Amazon basin by assessing the hydrological response of the Negro basin. The large basin model from the Institute of Hydraulic Research (MGB-IPH hydrological model) has been used to simulate the hydrological processes over the basin during the period 1997 - 2006. The model was forced with a precipitation field for the Amazon basin derived from the Hybam observatory and climatological data provided by NCEP. Calibration and validation procedures were developed based on daily discharge datasets from 22 gauge stations. In addition, this paper focusses on ENVISAT spatial altimetry data from 27 virtual stations (VS). The spatial altimetry datasets were used as a complement to the model validation. For each computational cell, water heights could be derived from a robust <b>discharge</b> x <b>height</b> relationship generalized to most parts of the basin. The modelled <b>discharges</b> and water <b>heights</b> feature adequate performance levels at gauge and VS along the main river and tributaries with drainage areas varying from 5900 to 712 500 km(2). Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of modelled discharges varied from 0. 47 to 0. 94 and correlation coefficients of water heights averaged 0. 86 for the entire basin. According to the water balance provided by the model, the amount of precipitation received over the basin is 7. 2 mm day(- 1) during the study period with an evapotranspiration (ET) rate of 3. 2 mm day(- 1). The model could also capture the different ET rates over the basin, as presented in previous studies. Results suggest relatively low ET values in the Northern basin, in the Roraima State, of about 3. 1 mm day(- 1), and higher values near Manaus (3. 8 mm day(- 1)) ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} the fundamental behaviour of granular materials in packed/moving beds under simplified blast furnace conditions. Such study {{has a significant}} impact on the development of new technology such as pulverized coal injection and the performance of blast furnace operation. Experiments have shown that a number of interesting phenomena appear in blast furnace operation. These phenomena involve rich granular dynamics which currently attract strong interest from a wide scientific and engineering. However, previous work on this area, limited by the research techniques, is predominantly at large scales focusing on phenomenological descriptions, but rarely touching on the basic fundamentals governing these phenomena. A novel discrete element simulation at an individual particle level can overcome these problems. For this purpose, this work conducts a systematic study of these important phenomena, including crater formation, coke collapse, creep motion and particle percolation, by use of the discrete element method (DEM). The experiments and simulations conducted in the impact of a particle stream onto a particle bed using a 20 slot model suggest that the DEM can reproduce the experimental results well under comparative conditions. The crater size is shown to be affected by the <b>discharging</b> rate, <b>discharging</b> <b>height</b> and materials properties, and is related to the ratio of the input energy from the falling stream to the inertial energy from the original packing. Fundamental understanding of coke collapse based on three different configurations: batch charging, self loading and load impact have been investigated. It was found that coke collapse is a kind of continuous avalanche due to top layer particles spreading. Apparent frozen layer under rapidly flowing layer is not stationary and slowly creep motion can be detected at an arbitrary depth. The mean velocity of creep motion decays exponentially with depth. Percolation happens due to both gravity and strain. The percolation velocity under gravity is much greater than that under shear. Size ratio effect is most significant. For size ratio smaller than threshold gravity induced percolation dominate otherwise shear due to the descending of the packed bed. Additionally, this work demonstrates the value of DEM as a tool for complementing experimental observations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In high {{velocity}} open channel flows, air is entrained at the free surface. This process is called self-aeration. In air-water flows {{the presence of}} air bubbles within the flow increases substantially the amount of air-water interface area and enhances the air-water transfer of atmospheric gases (e. g. nitrogen and oxygen). This paper presents a method to estimate the air-water interface area in uniform self-aerated flows on chutes and spillways. It is shown that the interface area {{is a function of}} the channel slope, <b>discharge</b> and roughness <b>height</b> only. The results provide a simple estimation of the air-water interface area and hence enable more accurate calculations of air-water gas transfer in hydraulic structures...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of basin discharge {{has been discussed}} by the experts in various construction projects and this important issue has considerable influence {{on the design of}} the required structures and their cost. Basin discharge can be calculated according to different methods. According to the conditions of the basins under study, the accuracy of these approaches varies and the obtained results often show relatively large differences. To estimate the annual average flow of the basin, the obtained results of discharge stations are analyzed by different methods and regional relations discharge are obtained. To this end, in this study four regional models consists of an area – discharge, area – standard deviation, area - specific <b>discharge</b> and <b>height</b> - <b>discharge</b> have been used. Also, basin discharge estimation is presented based on flow shortage methods. For this purpose, the method of empirical relations, like ICAR, Justin and Coutange catchment were used to calculate discharge then regional models were compared. The obtained results indicate the accuracy of the results of flow shortage methods to determine the discharge basin.

This study is aimed at the stability of open deck ferries and fishing vessels. The effective parameters on the discharge rate are the beam, depth of the water collected on the deck and the <b>discharge</b> gap <b>height.</b> In this study, CFD analyses for water discharge from a ship deck were conducted, and the commercial code FLUENT was used to conduct the simulations. A two dimensional unsteady 2 nd order solver in time and space was used for the simulation. The two-phase free surface model was simulated by the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model. Using the water discharge, the instantaneous depth Froude number was calculated {{as a part of the}} non-dimensional simulation. The effect of geometric parameters on the water discharge rate was investigated by keeping two parameters fixed while changing the third parameter.
