40|$|The {{study on}} limit points of {{eigenvalues}} of undirected graphs <b>was</b> initiated by <b>A.</b> J. Hoffman in 1972. Now we extend {{the study to}} digraphs. We prove: 1. Every real number <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> point of eigenvalues of graphs. Every complex number <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> point of eigenvalues of digraphs. 2. For a digraph D, the set of limit points of eigenvalues of iterated subdivision digraphs of D is the unit circle in the complex plane {{if and only if}} D has a directed cycle. 3. Every limit point of eigenvalues of a set D of digraphs (graphs) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> point of eigenvalues of a set of bipartite digraphs (graphs), where consists of the double covers of the members in D. 4. Every limit point of eigenvalues of a set D of digraphs <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> point of eigenvalues of line digraphs of the digraphs in D. 5. If M <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> point of the largest eigenvalues of graphs, then -M <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> point of the smallest eigenvalues of graphs...|$|R

Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.|$|E

On its routing from Thomasville to Stokesdale, NC68 passes through urban High Point, the western outskirts of Greensboro, {{and the town of}} Oak Ridge.

5|$|About 190 {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} park have been registered, {{most of which are}} part of the natural composition of the Siberian taiga. Marsh Labrador tea is the most common, the park being one of only three locations in Norway where it occurs. The most common berry plant is lingonberry; common bilberry and bog bilberry are also common, but do not carry good yields of berries. In August there is normally a good yield of cloudberry, and occasionally there can be found Arctic raspberry. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> number of marine plants. The steep cliffs at Revsaksskaret allow mountainous plants to thrive, such as Alpine chickweed, white bluegrass and brittle bladder-fern. These were common throughout the area after the last glacial period, but have vanished with forestation. Other mountainous plants common in the region are not found in Pasvik because of low oxygen levels in the lower soil levels.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} process, the Proprietors leased {{the canal}} to British Waterways in 2005. However, British Waterways had to {{withdraw}} from the scheme in 2008, due to financial difficulties, and the role of project leaders was taken over by Stroud District Council. Following the re-organisation, the Stroud Valleys Canal Company was established in March 2009. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> company, with two independent directors and three directors representing Stroud District Council, the Proprietors, and the Cotswold Canals Trust. Its purpose is to hold the assets for the canals, and its charitable status means that stamp duty land tax {{does not have to be}} paid. The company will be responsible for management and maintenance of the canal once it is re-opened. The Department for Transport is in the process of reorganising how funding for major transport schemes is managed, and this has enabled Stroud District Council to submit a bid for £1.5 million to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board. This is to fund the replacement of Ocean railway culvert with a bridge. A second application for £650,000 has been made to enable part of the Thames and Severn Way long distance footpath to be created. The funding is for the section from Saul Junction to Chalford.|$|E
5|$|Groesbeck Highway runs {{northeast}} from Hoover Street crossing out of Wayne County into Macomb County at 8 Mile Road. The trunkline here is {{parallel to}} railroad tracks through Warren. M-97 crosses Interstate 696 (I-696) at an interchange located on the Warren–Roseville line. This interchange is also located at the 11 Mile Road location in the Mile Road System. M-97 crosses through {{the southeast corner of}} Fraser between 13 Mile and 14 Mile roads after which it enters Clinton Township. There is a major intersection with Metropolitan Parkway, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> access county primary road that occupies the 16 Mile location Detroit Mile Road System. Between this intersection and Harrington Street, Groesbeck Highway curves around to the north, crossing the Clinton River and the railroad then entering Mt. Clemens. M-97 continues to curve around the west side of downtown Mt. Clemens before re-entering Clinton Township. Groesbeck Highway and M-97 ends at M-59/Hall Road, another limited access county primary road in Macomb County located in place of 20 Mile Road. The northern terminus is on the Clinton Township–Macomb Township line northwest of Selfridge Field, an Air National Guard facility on Lake St. Clair. The road continues north as a county road known as North Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Obsidian have {{temporarily}} {{abandoned the}} vessel {{in order to allow}} it to pass through a black hole. The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one member of the crew has the skills necessary to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's flight path, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut through the black hole without being shielded.|$|E
