5000|$|The album's {{subject matter}} is droll, stark, and confessional, and focuses on the pains of love, romance, and sex. Songs such as [...] "Anything (To Get Your Attention)" [...] and [...] "Down Here (In Hell with You)" [...] deal with {{dysfunctional}} relationships. On the latter track, Hunt asks [...] "What would <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were perfect / Where would I go for disappointment?" [...] "Highlights" [...] has him musing on a failed affair, as he uses a metaphor: [...] "Old lovers turned critics curse at you on the [...] ". [...] "Precious" [...] features a predominant Prince influence.|$|E
5000|$|The {{community}} functioned {{in these}} difficult {{times with the}} most strict economy. The Prior suggested: [...] "we seek to save on everything", he wrote, [...] "except on food, as we simply eat what remains". Outside purchases were reduced; the bread was henceforth baked in the monastery. The orchard and the kitchen garden provided fruit and vegetables and, during autumn, everyone helped in jam making. [...] "We already have 700 - 800 boxes of tomatoes". These efforts and sacrifices were not in vain. The situation slowly improved as the ruinous practice loans was brought to an end. However, on April 21, 1934, Father Crenier wrote [...] "that does not me from being blocked and even frustrated from time to time.. The Lord punishes me for my iniquities, while sending me what I need at the critical moment, but no more. I find that good. Poverty obliges me to hang with God, so to speak. I certainly would not ask for as much <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were comfortable." [...] His firmness {{in the exercise of}} his authority was combined with a paternalistic kindness, sensitive to the needs for each one of his monks. But it was that everyone should reach a healthy level of austerity. Amongst his immediate entourage, there were those who would allow the use of tobacco in order to gain recruits, [...] "Me, never... I hold good on this point [...] ".The [...] "chaises berceuses", another Canadian passion were also prohibited... "Life passes by as one sits there smoking and reading a breviary, etc." [...] His decisive argument was, [...] "the Trappists of Oka, do without all that and their recruitment is excellent". With this program of austerity, the Prior attracted trust and confidence. He succeeded where his predecessor had failed, in making a bond with the local community. He told the abbot, [...] "there is on the whole a real desire for sanctification. And, remarkably, the tighter the discipline, the happier everyone is". Thirty years later, when he wrote his autobiography, Father Crenier told how of all the years he spent at St-Benoit-du-Lac, those of the great restrictions were happiest, adding [...] "I noticed that real poverty, where one misses so many things, attracts singular graces amongst the monks, and in particular spiritual peace and joy." ...|$|E

60|$|On Christmas Day, William was crowned in Westminster Abbey, {{under the}} title of WILLIAM THE FIRST; but he {{is best known as}} WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR. It was a strange coronation. One of the bishops who {{performed}} the ceremony asked the Normans, in French, if they would have Duke William for their king? They answered Yes. Another of the bishops put the same question to the Saxons, in English. They too answered Yes, with a loud shout. The noise being heard by a guard of Norman horse-soldiers outside, was mistaken for resistance {{on the part of the}} English. The guard instantly set fire to the neighbouring houses, and a tumult ensued; in the midst of which the King, being left alone in the Abbey, with a few priests (and they all being in a terrible fright together), was hurriedly crowned. When the crown was placed upon his head, he swore to govern the English as well as the best of their own monarchs. I dare say you think, as <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> except the Great Alfred, he might pretty easily have done that.|$|R

It was a risky venture, but Carole gave me a check and then left me alone. She had some major balls.|$|R
40|$|Joint {{practical}} deliberation is {{the activity}} of deciding together what to do. 1 When two colleagues discuss where to meet for coffee, when two partners have a conversation about whether {{to have a second}} child, when friends on a road trip argue about whether to take the scenic route or the freeway, they are engaged in joint practical deliberation. They are trying to arrive at a single plan of action that expresses and governs both of their wills. This paper begins from two basic observations about this activity. First, we can make joint decisions regarding not just what we will do, but also what you will <b>do</b> or what <b>I</b> will <b>do.</b> For example: <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are deliberating together about how to write a coauthored paper, we might jointly decide that I will write the introduction, leaving it quite open what you will <b>do.</b> Second, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> in fact deliberate together, we must have some speech acts by means of which we propose potential joint decisions, putting them forward for joint consideration. Combining these two ideas, we can infer that there are speech acts the force of which is to propose joint decisions regarding what you will <b>do</b> or what <b>I</b> will <b>do.</b> <b>If</b> <b>we</b> investigate what such speech acts would look like, they are surprisingly similar to speech acts we already have: requests, demands, offers, and promises. This suggests a hypothesis: these speech acts just are proposals within joint practical deliberation. Requests and demands are two ways of proposing joint decisions about what you will do; offers and promises are two ways of proposing joint decisions about what <b>I</b> will <b>do.</b> In this paper, I defend one part of this hypothesis: the claim that promises are proposals to make joint decisions about what the speaker will do. ...|$|R
5000|$|Bringing Down the Horse further explores roots sounds {{heard on}} the band's {{previous}} self-titled album but used a more refined approach. This album features an array of instruments normally associated with roots music including banjos, dobros and pedal steel guitars. Dylan commented on {{the sound of the}} record by saying, [...] "You can counter different sounds and different things. We were in a certain channel already, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> remember thinking <b>if</b> <b>we</b> mixed it organically, and we kept chasing that sound, it probably would sound dated. I wasn’t interested in making a throwback record from the 60's or 70's. I didn’t have any interest in doing that. And {{that was one of the}} reasons we had Tom Lord-Alge, who was a very current mixer at the time. We thought that he could counter a lot of these acoustic sounds with something that sounded really fresh and up to date." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hutchins was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of a}} separate graduate school from the undergraduate school. He wanted it to be [...] "tough" [...] even if only half the students got in. On January 19, 1910, Hutchins made a speech to the New York University of Michigan Club which was published in the New Yorker; it read, “many of these graduate schools work too hard to get students and too little for results. Some of them are not a credit to the country, and Michigan is not without fault of her own in this respect, but we are working at Ann Arbor to remedy this condition, and we expect soon to have a graduate school in the true sense of the word. There are men in many of the schools who ought to be pushed out into the world to do a man’s work instead of hanging around the universities. A reorganization of the system is needed, and at Michigan we are trying to accomplish a renascence. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not care <b>if</b> <b>we</b> have only thirty students in the school <b>if</b> <b>we</b> only have one real one.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Now Diabolus {{had waited}} for his return, for he had heard {{that they had been}} at their points. So when he was come into the chamber of state, Diabolus saluted him with 'Welcome, my Lord, how went matters betwixt you to-day?' So the Lord Incredulity, with a low conge,[125] told him the whole of the matter, saying, Thus and thus said the captains of Shaddai, and thus and thus said I. The which when it was told to Diabolus, he was very glad to hear it, and said, 'My Lord Mayor, my {{faithful}} Incredulity, I have proved thy fidelity above ten times already, but never yet found thee false. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> promise thee, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> rub over this brunt, to prefer thee to a place of honour, a place far better than to be Lord Mayor of Mansoul. I will make thee my Universal Deputy, and thou shalt, next to me, have all nations under thy hand; yea, and thou shalt lay bands upon them that they may not resist thee, nor shall any of our vassals walk more at liberty, but those that shall be content to walk in thy fetters.' ...|$|R
60|$|I nodded, {{and stood}} by the door. My first feeling of fear had passed away, and I thrilled now with a keener zest than I had ever enjoyed when we were the {{defenders}} of the law instead of its defiers. The high object of our mission, the consciousness that it was unselfish and chivalrous, the villainous character of our opponent, all added to the sporting interest of the adventure. Far from feeling guilty, I rejoiced and exulted in our dangers. With a glow of admiration I watched Holmes unrolling his case of instruments and choosing his tool with the calm, scientific accuracy of a surgeon who performs a delicate operation. I knew that the opening of safes was a particular hobby with him, and I understood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this green and gold monster, the dragon which held in its maw the reputations of many fair ladies. Turning up the cuffs of his dress-coat--he had placed his overcoat on a chair--Holmes laid out two drills, a jemmy, and several skeleton keys. I stood at the centre door with my eyes glancing {{at each of the}} others, ready for any emergency, though, indeed, my plans were somewhat vague as to what <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were interrupted. For half an hour, Holmes worked with concentrated energy, laying down one tool, picking up another, handling each with the strength and delicacy of the trained mechanic. Finally I heard a click, the broad green door swung open, and inside I had a glimpse of a number of paper packets, each tied, sealed, and inscribed. Holmes picked one out, but it was as hard to read by the flickering fire, and he drew out his little dark lantern, for it was too dangerous, with Milverton in the next room, to switch on the electric light. Suddenly I saw him halt, listen intently, and then in an instant he had swung the door of the safe to, picked up his coat, stuffed his tools into the pockets, and darted behind the window curtain, motioning me to do the same.|$|R
6000|$|Amidst many a [...] "good lack" [...] and exclamation of {{pity and}} indignation from Perronel, Ambrose told his tale of that strange night, and entreated {{her to come}} with him {{to do what was}} {{possible}} for Abenali and his daughter. She hesitated a little; her kind heart was touched, but she hardly liked to leave her house, in case her husband should come in, as he generally contrived to do in the early morning, now that the Cardinal's household was lodged so near her. Sheltered as she was by the buildings of the Temple, she had heard little or nothing of the noise of the riot, though she had been alarmed at her nephew's absence, and an officious neighbour had run in to tell her first that the prentice lads were up and sacking the houses of the strangers, and next that the Tower was firing on them, and the Lord Mayor's guard and the gentlemen of the Inns of Court were up in arms to put them down. She said several times, [...] "Poor soul!" [...] and [...] "Yea, it were a shame to leave her to the old Dutchkin," [...] but with true Flemish deliberation she continued her household arrangements, and insisted that the bowl of broth, which she set on the table, should be partaken of by herself and Ambrose before she would stir a step. [...] "Not eat! Now out on thee, lad! what good dost thou think thou or <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> come in faint and famished, where there's neither bite nor sup to be had? As for me, not a foot will I budge, till I have seen thee empty that bowl. So to it, my lad! Thou hast been afoot all night, and lookst so grimed and ill- favoured a varlet that no man would think thou camest from an honest wife's house. Wash thee at the pail! Get thee into thy chamber and put on clean garments, or I'll not walk the street with thee! 'Tis not safe--thou wilt be put in ward for one of the rioters." ...|$|R
6000|$|It will {{be judged}} from all this that [...] "Grendon House" [...] was a model academy, and indeed it was. The only wonder is {{that it did not}} turn us all into the stiffest pieces of prim propriety possible; but somehow it <b>did</b> not; for <b>I</b> think, on looking back, that a merrier and more lively set of girls it would be {{difficult}} to have found, and yet we most certainly had not much to be merry about. [...] "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." [...] It may be so, but it decidedly did not have that effect upon Jack's sisters. We certainly did work very hard. I suppose it was necessary in order to cram all the accomplishments girls are expected to know into our heads; but however it was, I am quite sure that in those two years I was at school, I worked more hours and steadier at them, than Harry ever did in four; he allows it himself, and I am sure it is generally the case, that girls work infinitely harder than their brothers, and certainly have no amusement or recreation at all in proportion. I suppose it is all right, but yet <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> worked a good deal less, and played a great deal more, we should know quite as much, and be far more healthy and natural than we are.|$|R
60|$|I believe I was {{the only}} person in our own sleigh who felt any alarm, after the {{occurrence}} of this little incident. Why uneasiness beset me, I cannot precisely say. It must have been altogether on Anneke's account, and not in the least on my own. Such accidents as sleighs breaking through, on our New York lakes and rivers, happened almost every winter, and horses were often drowned; though it was seldom the consequences proved so serious to their owners. I recalled to mind the fragile nature of ice, the necessary effects of the great thaw and the heavy rains, remembering that frozen water might still retain most of its apparent thickness, after its consistency was greatly impaired. But, <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> nothing! <b>If</b> <b>we</b> landed, the roads were impassable for runners, almost for wheels, and another hour might carry the ladies, by means of the river, to their comfortable homes. That day, however, which, down to the moment of meeting the unknown sleigh, had been the very happiest of my life, was entirely changed in its aspect, and I no longer regarded it with any satisfaction. Had Anneke been at home, I could gladly have entered into a contract to pass a week on the river myself, as the condition of her safety, I thought but little of the others, to my shame be it said, though <b>I</b> cannot <b>do</b> myself the injustice to imagine, had Anneke been away, that I would have deserted even a horse, while there was a hope of saving him.|$|R

But I'd LIKE to do it. I'd like to call a meeting of the Ladies Aid and W.M.S. and the Girls Sewing Society, and include in the audience all and any Methodists who have been criticizing the Merediths--although <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think <b>if</b> <b>we</b> Presbyterians stopped criticizing and excusing we would find that other denominations would trouble themselves very little about our manse folks. I would say to them, 'Dear Christian friends'--with marked emphasis on 'Christian'--I have something to say to you and I want to say it good and hard, that you may take it home and repeat it to your families. You Methodists need not pity us, and we Presbyterians need not pity ourselves. We are not going to do it any more. And we are going to say, boldly and truthfully, to all critics and sympathizers, 'We are PROUD of our minister and his family. Mr. Meredith is the best preacher Glen St. Mary church ever had. Moreover, he is a sincere, earnest teacher of truth and Christian charity. He is a faithful friend, a judicious pastor in all essentials, and a refined, scholarly, well-bred man. His family are worthy of him. Gerald Meredith is the cleverest pupil in the Glen school, and Mr. Hazard says that he is destined to a brilliant career. He is a manly, honourable, truthful little fellow. Faith Meredith is a beauty, and as inspiring and original as she is beautiful. There is nothing commonplace about her. All the other girls in the Glen put together haven't the vim, and wit, and joyousness and 'spunk' she has. She has not an enemy in the world. Every one who knows her loves her. Of how many, children or grown-ups, can that be said? Una Meredith is sweetness personified. She will make a most lovable woman. Carl Meredith, with his love for ants and frogs and spiders, will some day be a naturalist whom all Canada--nay, all the world, will delight to honour. Do you know of any other family in the Glen, or out of it, of whom all these things can be said? Away with shamefaced excuses and apologies. We REJOICE in our minister and his splendid boys and girls!" ...|$|R

I am glad to bring to every one of you the best greetings of us all, and to assure you that, when three years hence you come to Italy to the next Physio logical Congress, and next year when some of you go to Padua for the Zoological Congress, we hope you will gather in the Stazione Zoologica in as great a number as you have gathered here. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>if</b> <b>we</b> shall be able to arrange things as well as you <b>did</b> here, but <b>I</b> can promise that our welcome will be as hearty as yours and that we shall do our best to this purpose. Ladies and gentlemen, it is impossible to look at the beautiful play of the chromatophores of the cephalopodsâ€”the object of our lecture this eveningâ€”without being filled with wonder at the complication and the perfection of the play itself. Old Aristotle was the first to study these animals with the eyes of tbe scientist, and he was also the first to connect some of the different appearances shown by the animals with various conditions of their minds: that is, fear and anger, and so on. He was also the first to suggest that these animals were able to change their colour according to the colour of the environment, giving, in this way, one of the first instances of this fundamental law of living beings, namely, mimicry. It may be of interest to remember that this opinion of his has been confirmed in a most brilliant way quite recently by the careful experiments of some German scientists (Kuehn and Heberdey, 1929).
