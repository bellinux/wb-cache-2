500|$|Although {{the film}} leaves it mysterious, early script drafts {{made clear that}} HAL's {{breakdown}} is triggered by authorities on Earth who order him to withhold information from the astronauts about {{the purpose of the}} mission (this is also explained in the film's sequel 2010). Frederick Ordway, Kubrick's science advisor and technical consultant, stated that in an earlier script Poole tells HAL there is [...] "...something about this mission that we weren't told. Something {{the rest of the crew}} knows and that you know. We would like to know whether this is true", to which HAL responds: [...] "I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> that question without knowing everything that all of you know." [...] HAL then falsely predicts a failure of the hardware maintaining radio contact with Earth (the source of HAL's difficult orders) during the broadcast of Frank Poole's birthday greetings from his parents.|$|E
2500|$|Prosecutor Abdul Wasei said {{he doubted}} claims {{regarding}} Abdul Rahman's mental instability. [...] "I {{did not see}} any kind of mental problem in this case," [...] he said. Wasei said that Rahman, {{when asked about his}} mental health, insisted that it was fine. [...] "I am O.K., you can prosecute me, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> your questions," [...] Wasei said Rahman told him.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Mervyn, {{you make}} me so angry that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>answer!</b> You boast of what you think she has {{suffered}} for you all this time, and make light of it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, Dombey, what's {{become of}} it?' asked the Major. 'Where's it gone?

60|$|He {{led me to}} a chair. I have an indistinct remembrance that he {{was very}} affectionate. I don't think he put his arm round my waist to support me--but I am not sure. I was quite helpless, and his ways with ladies were very endearing. At any rate, we sat down. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> for that, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>answer</b> for nothing more.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, my child, {{you used}} to {{complain}} of it when it wasn't such a contrast as it must be now. Upon my word, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>answer,</b> because you are so much improved.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>answer</b> you?" [...] he asked. [...] "At Blakely I was {{as happy}} as I knew how to be, and until you came I was content! But to-day, well, there are {{different}} things. How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>answer</b> your question, indeed? Tell me what happiness means! Tell me whether it is an ignoble or a praiseworthy state!" ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>answer,</b> {{that if this}} be a fault on my part, it is a {{deliberate}} one. I have spoken, whether rightly or wrongly, concerning what I know--concerning matters which are to me articles of faith altogether indubitable, irreversible, Divine.|$|R

5000|$|Embree {{snapped a}} number of {{pictures}} of the attack, but eventually stopped. In an 2001 interview, he explained [...] "Many people have asked me why I didn't take more photos from the air... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>answer</b> that <b>I</b> was so flabbergasted at what I saw that I forgot about the camera that was in my hand." ...|$|R
