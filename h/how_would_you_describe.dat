Metaphor analysis, as a means to uncover organizational culture, is an increasingly popular strategy for qualitative researchers. In interpretative qualitative studies, metaphors comprise a form of linguistic analysis which assists researchers who are interested in an intensive but short-term evaluation of organizational culture (Patton, 2002; Schmitt, 2005). Since language serves as a pivotal cultural artifact, metaphors emerge from that sphere as a particularly expressive language form...|$|E

When that reference point comes from patient reports of noticeable improvement or decline, it may be considered a meaningful level of change. [24] Patients reporting meaningful change (much worse, worse, improved, much improved) were included in the responsiveness analysis to detect the ability of the PROs to measure meaningful levels of change.
