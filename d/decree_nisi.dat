5|$|Wallis {{had already}} {{filed for divorce}} from her second husband {{on the grounds that}} he had {{committed}} adultery with her childhood friend Mary Kirk and the <b>decree</b> <b>nisi</b> was granted on 27 October 1936. In November, the King consulted with the British Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, on a way to marry Wallis and keep the throne. The King suggested a morganatic marriage, where he would remain king but Wallis would not be queen, but this was rejected by Baldwin and the Prime Ministers of Australia, Canada, and South Africa. If the King were to marry Wallis against Baldwin's advice, the Government would be required to resign, causing a constitutional crisis.|$|E

He continued working as a judge while chairing the daily committee. The committee was appointed on 26 June 1946 and published its first report in July, which reduced the time between <b>decree</b> <b>nisi</b> and decree absolute from 6 months to 6 weeks. The second report was published in November, recommending that County Court judges should be appointed to try cases, and the final report was published in February 1947 recommending {{the establishment of a}} Marriage Welfare Service. The reports were well received by the public and led to Denning being invited in 1949 to become President of the National Marriage Guidance Council.|$|E
5|$|Lawton married Rosaleen May Kavanagh in January 1941; the {{marriage}} bore one child, Amanda. Rosaleen never watched Lawton play football during their ten-year marriage. Divorce was granted with a <b>decree</b> <b>nisi</b> in March 1951 after Rosaleen {{was found to}} have committed adultery with Notts County director Adrian Van Geffen; Lawton never saw Amanda again and was not required to pay child support. He would not hear from his daughter until she was convicted of stealing from playwright George Axelrod in 1968, by which time Rosaleen was on her fourth marriage and living in Jamaica. Lawton married second wife Gladys Rose in September 1952, who bore him a son, Thomas Junior. Gladys was also divorced, and her ex-husband cited Lawton as a co-respondent in the divorce proceedings as the pair had begun their relationship whilst Gladys was still married; her family were staunch Catholics, and Gladys was ostracised by her family following her divorce. Gladys had a daughter, Carol, from her previous marriage, who Lawton raised as his own. Thomas Junior went on to play rugby union for Leicester Tigers.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores issues {{concerning}} access between non-custodial {{parents and children}} following marital breakdown. The literature concerning access is reviewed, with reference particularly {{to the problem of}} evaluating the possible benefits of a dean break between non-custodial parent and the children at the time of separation. The findings of a research study, in which probation officers reported on {{issues concerning}} custody and access in 65 cases on which they were preparing welfare reports, are reported. The study highlights the generally problematic nature of access, discusses the behaviour problems exhibited by the children {{at the time of the}} breakdown, and points to the importance of outside help at an early stage in the divorce process. The backcloth of the study discussed in this paper is the unprecedented level which the divorce rate in England and Wales has reached in the last decade, with 150, 385 divorce <b>decrees</b> <b>nisi</b> being granted in 1980, 102, 967 of which involved children (C.

5|$|Life with My Sister Madonna, {{a book by}} Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted {{at number}} two on The New York Times bestseller list. The book caused some {{friction}} between Madonna and her brother, because of the unsolicited publication. Madonna eventually filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences. On December 15, 2008, Madonna's spokeswoman announced that the singer had agreed to a divorce settlement with Ritchie, the terms of which grant him between £50 million and £60 million, a figure that includes {{the value of the}} couple's London pub and residence and Wiltshire estate in England. Madonna and Guy Ritchie's marriage was dissolved by District Judge Reid by <b>decree</b> <b>nisi</b> at the clinical Principal Registry of the Family Division in High Holborn, London. Madonna and Ritchie entered into a compromise agreement for Rocco and David, then ages eight and three respectively, and divided the children's time between Ritchie's London home and Madonna's in New York, where the two will be joined by her daughter, Lourdes, from a previous relationship.|$|E

He selfishly takes money from the family to buy a motorbike, but then sells it to help pay the mortgage. When Zainab says she will stop interfering in people's lives, AJ uses the opportunity to annoy her. AJ and Aliyah receive their <b>decree</b> <b>nisi.</b> When Zainab has a job interview, AJ tells the interviewer she has short-term memory loss. However, when he apologises via a Post-It note, she returns the apology. AJ supports Masood when his relationship with Zainab ends. When AJ has to look after Masood's young son Kamil Masood (Arian Chikhlia), {{he admits that he}} is not good with children, and was scared when Aliyah wanted one, because he feels he cannot look after himself properly, let alone a child.

500|$|The {{principle}} in English law that a husband could not rape {{his wife had}} long been supposed to be correct, although R v R was the first {{case in which the}} marital rape exemption reached the House of Lords. [...] As late {{as the end of the}} nineteenth century family judges were still prepared to make orders for [...] "restitution of conjugal rights" [...] against estranged wives. [...] However by that time the statement in Hale had already been doubted by some judges. R v R followed several cases earlier in the 20th century which had progressively narrowed the exemption. In R v Clarke [...] 2 All ER 448; 33 Cr App R 216 a husband was found guilty of raping his estranged wife, as it was held that a court order for non-cohabitation had revoked the consent. [...] A similar result was reached in R v O’Brien [...] 3 All ER 663 after the grant of a <b>decree</b> <b>nisi</b> for divorce. [...] In R v Steele (1976) 65 Cr App R 22 the husband was convicted after had given an undertaking to the court not to molest his wife; and in R v Roberts [...] Crim LR 188 a formal separation agreement was in place. R v S held that the granting of a family protection order was sufficient to negate any implied consent.|$|E
500|$|Lennon seemed {{absolutely}} normal {{when she}} returned home the next day, and steadfastly maintained his love for her and their son, saying: [...] "It's you I love Cyn ... I love you {{now more than ever}} before". [...] Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after, but as Cynthia was specifically not invited, a trip to Pesaro, in Italy, was arranged with her mother. After an evening with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, Mardas was waiting at the hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and [...] "send her back to Hoylake". She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that 'Magic Alex' [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy" ... "to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad." [...] As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: [...] "Suing me for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?" [...] When the news of Ono's pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon's refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., telling her on the phone that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more. The settlement was then raised to £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., £2,400 annually (equivalent to £ in [...] )., and custody of Julian. Another £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit when he was 21. Until that time, his mother would receive the interest payments. Their <b>decree</b> <b>nisi</b> was granted on 8 November 1968. The trust fund had one codicil, which provided for any further children by Lennon, so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975, Julian's inheritance was cut to £50,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )..|$|E

He had had to borrow a great deal from his bank, and his decision to stand down from Parliament was actually prompted by financial difficulties: in 1958 his affairs were placed in the hands of accountants and a committee of creditors. He was declared bankrupt, and disclosed liabilities of £6,956 compared with assets of £662.

Mr. Champers-Haswell remarked that the weather was very cold for April, and Alan agreed with him, while Sir Robert found his hat and brushed it with his sleeve.

To establish cruelty I should have to strike you, or something of that sort, before witnesses. That's impossible--but it's simple to desert you legally. I have to go away from you; that's all. I can go on sending you money--and you bring a suit, what is it?--for Restitution of Conjugal Rights. The Court orders me to return. I disobey. Then you can go on to divorce me.

Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited {{two or three times a}} week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.

He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic fracas when the fallen leader's, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the Insuppressible or no it was United Ireland (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell's) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying: Thank you, sir, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.|$|E
