The preparation of emulsion fuel with and without FWM-CV cells was conducted using ultrasound to overcome the problems of large size microalgae colonies and to form homogenized emulsions. The <b>emulsified</b> <b>water</b> fuels, prepared using ultrasound, were found to be stable and the size of FWM-CV colonies were effectively reduced to pass through the engine nozzle safely.

The engine power, exhaust gas temperature, NOx and CO 2 were significantly lower than that produced by CS-B 100.

40|$|<b>Emulsified</b> <b>water</b> {{separation}} from ultralow sulfur diesel {{fuel on board}} a vehicle is critical for modern diesel engine protection. However, such a separation poses great challenges to the commonly used coalescence filter media. These media must be designed {{to be able to}} cope with surfactants in the fuel typically by chemical surface modification. In this work, we examined several chemical coatings on glass slide and studied their response to water wetting in both air and diesel fuels containing monoolein, a designated fuel additive for SAE j 1488 test standard. It was found that one coating behaved dramatically differently than others. This coating is a fluorochemical (FC) with undisclosed chemistry, which leads to uncommon but favorable water wetting under fuel that further boosts coalescence separation of <b>emulsified</b> <b>water</b> with a commercial stainless steel filter felt. The feature and the chemistry of the coating were then revealed and rationalized with SEM, XPS, FTIR, NMR, GPC-LS and MALDI-TOF MS analyses. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was also used to determine the characteristics of monoolein adsorption on the coatings. The results show that the FC coating chemistry is unique as it provides in one molecule a hard hydrophobic segment and a soft hydrophilic segment, both of which are desired for effective coalescence separation in light of easy capture of small droplets and easy release of gown droplets, even subject to the presence of surfactants in the fuel. Such a chemistry also results in surprisingly intensive adsorption of monoolein. Based on further observation of the relatively faster coalescene of two water droplets under static conditions in fuel on the FC coating surface, it is speculated that the strong adsorption forces the surfactant molecules to be pulled away from the fuel/water interface, thus triggering the subsequent coalescence. It is also postulated that the unique chemistry allows the adsorbed surfactant molecules to redistribute, leading to the very wetting phenomenon first time observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|Biodiesel {{derived from}} palm kernel oil, orange peel oil or mustard oil is {{employed}} as a neat fuel or in blends with diesel in a compression ignition (CI) engine (Joy et al. 2017; Venu and Madhavan 2017). The major drawback of using neat biodiesel in CI engines is its superior NOx emissions and lower thermal efficiency (Pandian et al. 2018). NOx emissions should be controlled by suitable methods to meet the emission standards (Anbarasu et al. 2015).

The first three experimental chapters concern the synthesis, characterisation and application of Janus particles fabricated by heterogeneous polymerisation techniques. Initially in Chapter 2 we describe an optimised one pot seeded emulsion polymerisation strategy to render submicron amphiphilic Janus particles exhibiting surface active behaviour which can be tuned by the variation of hydrophilic to hydrophobic lobe volume ratios. These particles have been shown to inhibit ice recrystallisation in aqueous systems. In Chapter 3 we explore the synthesis of hard-soft Janus particles comprising of respective high and low glass transition temperature lobes. Although the rate of polymerisation is unaffected by available seed particle surface area, particles with multiple soft lobes and secondary nucleation occur below a seed surface area threshold. We additionally demonstrate the ability to fabricate sub-micron hard-soft Janus particles. Chapter 4 utilises the particles made in the previous chapter as building blocks to fabricate ‘colloidal molecules’ and colloidosomes. In the former case, cluster morphology of particles is shown to be governed by surface area minimisation of the central soft domain. The final two experimental chapters explore two different strategies to <b>emulsify</b> <b>water</b> into chocolate whilst retaining the desirable physical characteristics of the confectionery. In Chapter 5 we utilise colloidal silica and a cationic polyelectrolyte to generate highly stable quiescent Pickering emulsions, allowing up to 50...|$|R

The {{basis of this}} method is the classical Schotten-Baumann reaction between an acid chloride and a compound containing an active hydrogen atom, such as an amine or alcohol, polyesters, polyurea, polyurethane. Under the right conditions, thin flexible walls form rapidly at the interface. A solution of the pesticide and a diacid chloride are <b>emulsified</b> in <b>water</b> and an aqueous solution containing an amine and a polyfunctional isocyanate is added. Base is present to neutralize the acid formed during the reaction. Condensed polymer walls form instantaneously at the interface of the emulsion droplets.|$|R
