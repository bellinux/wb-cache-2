In this later style, which is influenced by 19th century French symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud, the poetry is more allusive, filled with [...] "chains of flashing images." [...] In this song, rather than support a specific cause as in his earlier protest songs, he finds solidarity with all people who are downtrodden or otherwise treated unjustly, including unwed mothers, the disabled, refugees, outcasts, those unfairly jailed, [...] "the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked," [...] and, in the final [...] verse, [...] "the countless confused, accused, misused, strung out ones and worse" [...] and [...] "every <b>hung-up</b> person in the whole wide universe." [...] By having the chimes of freedom toll for both rebels and rakes, the song is more inclusive in its sympathies than previous protest songs, such as [...] "The Times They Are A-Changin'", written just the prior year.

Out of such came only gore and wreck, infernal rage and misery; desperation quenched in annihilation. Behold it, I bid thee, behold there, and consider! What is it that thou have a hundred thousand-pound bills laid-up in thy strong-room, a hundred scalps <b>hung-up</b> in thy wigwam? I value not them or thee. Thy scalps and thy thousand-pound bills are as yet nothing, if no nobleness from within irradiate them; if no Chivalry, in action, or in embryo ever struggling towards birth and action, be there.|$|E
60|$|For, {{the people}} who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest--laughing heartily if it went right, and not less heartily if it went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the {{waistcoats}} of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the <b>hung-up</b> mistletoe. There were pears and apples clustered high in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence, to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people's mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags, and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.|$|E
60|$|Isabel {{saw it all}} as {{distinctly}} as if it {{had been}} reflected in a large clear glass. It might have been a great moment for her, for it might have been a moment of triumph. That Madame Merle had lost her pluck and saw before her the phantom of exposure--this in itself was a revenge, this in itself was almost the promise of a brighter day. And for a moment during which she stood apparently looking out of the window, with her back half-turned, Isabel enjoyed that knowledge. On the other side of the window lay the garden of the convent; but this is not what she saw; she saw nothing of the budding plants and the glowing afternoon. She saw, in the crude light of that revelation which had already become a part of experience and to which the very frailty of the vessel in which it had been offered her only gave an intrinsic price, the dry staring fact that she had been an applied handled <b>hung-up</b> tool, as senseless and convenient as mere shaped wood and iron. All the bitterness of this knowledge surged into her soul again; it was as if she felt on her lips the taste of dishonour. There was a moment during which, if she had turned and spoken, she would have said something that would hiss like a lash. But she closed her eyes, and then the hideous vision dropped. What remained was the cleverest woman in the world standing there within a few feet of her and knowing as little what to think as the meanest. Isabel's only revenge was to be silent still--to leave Madame Merle in this unprecedented situation. She left her there for a period that must have seemed long to this lady, who at last seated herself with a movement which was in itself a confession of helplessness. Then Isabel turned slow eyes, looking down at her. Madame Merle was very pale; her own eyes covered Isabel's face. She might see what she would, but her danger was over. Isabel would never accuse her, never reproach her; perhaps because she never would give her the opportunity to defend herself.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no sleep}} on board that night. Most seamen {{remember}} {{in their life}} one or two such nights of a culminating gale. Nothing seems left of the whole universe but darkness, clamour, fury--and the ship. And like the last vestige of a shattered creation she drifts, bearing an anguished remnant of sinful mankind, through the distress, tumult, and pain of an avenging terror. No one slept in the forecastle. The tin oil-lamp suspended on a long string, smoking, described wide circles; wet clothing made dark heaps on the glistening floor; {{a thin layer of}} water rushed to and fro. In the bed-places men lay booted, resting on elbows and with open eyes. <b>Hung-up</b> suits of oilskin swung out and in, lively and disquieting like reckless ghosts of decapitated seamen dancing in a tempest. No one spoke and all listened. Outside the night moaned and sobbed to the accompaniment of a continuous loud tremor as of innumerable drums beating far off. Shrieks passed through the air. Tremendous dull blows made the ship tremble while she rolled {{under the weight of the}} seas toppling on her deck. At times she soared up swiftly as if to leave this earth for ever, then during interminable moments fell through a void with all the hearts on board of her standing still, till a frightful shock, expected and sudden, started them off again with a big thump. After every dislocating jerk of the ship, Wamibo, stretched full length, his face on the pillow, groaned slightly with the pain of his tormented universe. Now and then, for the fraction of an intolerable second, the ship, in the fiercer burst of a terrible uproar, remained on her side, vibrating and still, with a stillness more appalling than the wildest motion. Then upon all those prone bodies a stir would pass, a shiver of suspense. A man would protrude his anxious head and a pair of eyes glistened in the sway of light glaring wildly. Some moved their legs a little as if making ready to jump out. But several, motionless on their backs and with one hand gripping hard the edge of the bunk, smoked nervously with quick puffs, staring upwards; immobilised in a great craving for peace.|$|E
6000|$|... ...Everything is of {{the last}} abnormalism now, and no convulsion, no {{historic}} event of any such immensity can ever {{have taken place in}} such a turn-over of a few hours and with such a measureless rush--the whole thing being, in other words, such an unprecedented combination of size and suddenness. There has never surely, since the world began, been any suddenness so big, so instantly mobilised, any more than there has been an equal enormity so sudden (if, after all, that can be called sudden, or more than comparatively so, which, it is now clearly visible, had been brewing in the councils of the two awful Kaisers from a good while back.) The entrance of this country into the fray has been supremely inevitable--never doubt for an instant of that; up to a few short days ago she was still multiplying herself over Europe, in the magnificent energy and pertinacity of Edward Grey, for peace, and nothing but peace, in any way in which he could by any effort or any service help to preserve it; and has now only been beaten by what one can only call the huge immorality, the deep conspiracy for violence, for violence and wrong, of the Austrian and the German Emperors. Till the solemnly guaranteed neutrality of Belgium was three or four days ago deliberately violated by Germany, in defiance of every right, in her ferocious push to get at France by that least fortified way, we still hung in the balance here; but with that no [...] "balance" [...] was any longer possible, and the impulse to participate to the utmost in resistance and redress became as unanimous and as sweeping a thing in the House of Commons and throughout the land as it is possible to conceive. That is the one light, as one may call it, in so much sickening blackness--that in an hour, here, all breaches instantly healed, all divisions dropped, the Irish dissension, on which Germany had so clearly counted, dried up in a night--so that there is at once the most striking and interesting spectacle of united purpose. For myself, I draw a long breath that we are not to have failed France or shirked any shadow of a single one of the implications of the Entente; for the reason that we go in only under the last compulsion, and with cleaner hands than we have ever had, I think, in any such matter since such matters were. (You see how I talk of [...] "we" [...] and [...] "our"--which is so absolutely instinctive and irresistible with me that I should feel quite abject if I didn't!) However I don't want, for today, to disquisitionise on this great public trouble, but only to give you our personal news in the midst of it--for it's astonishing in how few days we have jumped into the sense of being in the midst of it. England and the Continent are at the present hour full of <b>hung-up</b> and stranded Americans--those unable to get home and waiting for some re-establishment of violently interrupted traffic.... But good-bye, dearest Harry, now. It's a great blessing to be able to write you under this aid to lucidity--it's in fact everything, so I shall keep at it. I hope the American receipt of news is getting organised on the strong and sound lines it should be.

50|$|Gentleman Junkie and Other Stories of the <b>Hung-Up</b> Generation is {{an early}} {{collection}} of short stories by Harlan Ellison, originally published in paperback in 1961. Most of the stories were written while Ellison was a draftee in the United States army between 1957 and 1959. These were sold to Rogue Magazine, a pulp fiction magazine of the era. Other stories in the collection had appeared previously in publications ranging from Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine to a Chicago weekly newspaper.|$|E

5000|$|Dovidio and Gaertner showed {{evidence}} of aversive {{racism in the}} 1970s and 1980s with their field research.

The confederate called from a pay phone and was out of change to make another call and asked the participant to make the call for them. The independent variable, or the variable the experimenter changed, was the dialect of the confederate to convince the participant that the [...] "wrong number" [...] caller was either white or black.

5000|$|The biggest {{controversy}} involving Goldstein as {{a referee}} occurred in on March 24, 1962 when he refereed the Benny [...] "Kid" [...] Paret-Emile Griffith world welterweight championship fight, which was televised live by American Broadcasting Company in Madison Square Garden. Paret was <b>hung-up</b> against the ropes in the 12th round when Griffith delivered {{a barrage of}} unanswered punches {{to the head of}} the seemingly helpless Paret as Goldstein looked on. When Goldstein finally did intervene, Paret slumped to the canvas, unconscious. He died 10 days later from the injuries he suffered in that bout. Goldstein refereed only one more fight, two years later. Some have said the reason Goldstein was ineffective in the fight was that he was recovering from a recent heart attack. Ironically, before the fatal bout, Goldstein had been regarded by many as the finest referee in boxing. His son Herb pointed out that he had often been criticized for stopping other fights too early.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954, Corso {{moved to}} Cambridge, where several {{important}} poets, including Edward Marshall and John Wieners, were experimenting with the poetics of voice. The center for Corso's life {{there was not}} [...] "the School of Boston," [...] as these poets were called, but Harvard University's Widener Library, where he spent his days reading the great works of poetry and also auditing classes in the Greek and Roman Classics. Corso's appreciation of the classics {{had come from the}} Durants' books that he had read in prison. At Harvard he considered becoming a classics scholar. Corso, penniless, lived on a dorm room floor in Elliott house, welcomed by students Peter Sourian, Bobby Sedgwick (brother of Edie), and Paul Grand. He would dress up for dinner and not be noticed. Members of the elite Porcellian Club reported Corso to the Harvard administration as an interloper. Dean Archibald MacLeish met with Corso intending to expel him, but Corso showed him his poems and MacLeish relented and allowed Corso to be a non-matriculating student — a poet in residence. Corso's first published poems appeared in the Harvard Advocate in 1954, and his play In This <b>Hung-up</b> Age—concerning a group of Americans who, after their bus breaks down midway across the continent, are trampled by buffalo— was performed by the esteemed Poets' Theater the following year, along with T.S.

Aitken told the officers he was not suicidal at which point Officer Michael Joy asked Aitken to return to Mount Laurel. Aitken asked if he was legally required to return to which Officer Joy responded {{that he did not have}} to return to Mount Laurel. Aitken thanked Officer Joy and stated that he would not be returning, however, minutes later Officer Joy made another call to Aitken notifying him that a 'General Alert' had been issued to New Jersey jurisdictions and that the Police would [...] "pick him up" [...] and [...] "bring him back" [...] if he did not return on his own.

5000|$|In Chimes of Freedom: The Politics of Bob Dylan's Art, author Mike Marqusee {{notes that}} the song marks a {{transition}} between Dylan's earlier protest song style (a litany of the down-trodden and oppressed, {{in the second half}} of each verse) and his later more free-flowing poetic style (the fusion of images of lightning, storm and bells in the first half).

[...] In this song, rather than support a specific cause as in his earlier protest songs, he finds solidarity with all people who are downtrodden or otherwise treated unjustly, including unwed mothers, the disabled, refugees, outcasts, those unfairly jailed, [...] "the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked," [...] and, in the final verse, [...] "the countless confused, accused, misused, strung out ones and worse" [...] and [...] "every <b>hung-up</b> person in the whole wide universe."

5000|$|Another {{specialized}} application {{space of}} agent-assisted automation goes under numerous headings including outbound prospecting, cold calling, solicitation, fund-raising, etc. Turnover is high among agents {{engaged in this}} kind of work because the task is tedious and emotionally difficult. It is tedious because you spend the bulk of your day, not talking to qualified leads, but in getting wrong numbers and answering machines. As good and as ubiquitous as predictive dialing technology has become, it still makes a lot of mistakes because the phone number inputs are outdated. It is emotionally difficult work because, beyond the tedium, {{you spend a lot of}} time hearing the word “No!”, getting <b>hung-up</b> on, and cussed at. The pre-recorded audio allows you to dispense with wrong numbers and answering machines while you move onto the next call. Agents can easily handle two or three overlapping calls, an immediate productivity hit. Additionally, agents using the technology don’t seem to take the gruff treatment as personally. They report that it feels as if the customer is saying “no” to the software, not to them. Finally, contribution amounts and conversion rates can be improved by adding some intelligence into the scripts, for example by raising and lowering the initial contribution amount based on the wealth of the area you are calling into or using pre-recorded audio with different accents, Southern when calling in the South, for example. Another benefit of the technology is that it enables the work to be done by lower cost agents in offshore locations.|$|E
5000|$|The Jiuhuang bencao {{entry for}} Sagittaria sagittifolia [...] "arrowhead" [...] exemplifies famine food plants that were first {{described}} by Zhu Xiao {{and later became}} normal Chinese crop plants. In the present day, this edible tuber, traditionally associated with Chinese New Year, is known as cígū (慈菇, lit. [...] "kindly mushroom", also written 慈姑 [...] "kindly aunt" [...] or 茨菰 [...] "thatch wild-rice"), jiǎndāocǎo (剪刀草, [...] "scissors herb"), or yànwěicǎo (燕尾草, [...] "swallow tail herb"). Zhu Xiao used the names shuǐcígū (水慈菰, [...] "water kindly wild-rice"), using gū (菰, [...] "wild rice") instead of gū (菇, [...] "mushroom"), jiǎndāocǎo, and jiàndācǎo (箭搭草, [...] "arrow hang herb"). Shuicigu The common name for this is scissors herb jiandaocao or else jiandacao (<b>hung-up</b> arrows herb). It grows in water, the item is grooved on one side (wā 窊) and squarish on the other, with stringy fibres. The leaves are three-horned, resembling indeed a pair of scissors. From amidst the leaf-stalks rise up scapes which fork and bear three-petalled white flowers with yellow centres. Each of these gives a blue-green fruit follicle (蓇葖) {{like that of the}} 青楮桃 [...] "paper mulberry" [...] but rather smaller. The (tuberous) root is of the same kind as that of the onion (葱) but coarser and larger and of a sweet taste. In case of hunger collect the young and tender shoots near the (tuberous) roots and scald them, then add oil and salt, and eat. (tr. Needham 1984: 344) Needham remarks on the high degree of precision in 14th-century Chinese phytographic language (gūtū 蓇葖 for [...] "fruit follicle" [...] generally - Sagittaria has many carpels - rather than the modern specification of [...] "one-carpelled unilocular ovary"). Both Read (1946: 40) and Needham (1984: 344) note it is curious that Xu Xiao only recommended the shoots or turions for food, and not the starchy corms as a whole.|$|E
30|$|Detail is less {{important}} than information relevancy and evaluator expertise. Do not get <b>hung-up</b> on missing data during the early phases of the project evaluation.

40|$|Unhappy Consciousness is a {{study of}} {{recognition}} scenes in the Victorian novel and their relation to Marx's concept of commodity fetishism. Victorian recognition scenes often show a hero's self-discovery as a retrospective identification with things. When, for example, in Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, Isabel Archer learns the truth about her marriage: "She saw, in the crude light of that revelation [...] . the dry staring {{fact that she had}} been an applied handled <b>hung-up</b> tool, as senseless and convenient as mere shaped wood and iron. " The retrospective discovery of identity in Victorian novels is often figured as a catastrophic falling-apart of a stable self that is also an economic object or instrument: a bank check, a debt, a forgery, an inheritance, or an accumulated principal. Recognition scenes cannot be considered in the light of a timeless "master plot" or the classical poetics of Aristotelian anagnorisis, but need to be interpreted in terms of historical forms of social misrecognition (such as Marx's analysis of fetishism). Unhappy Consciousness contends that, {{if we are going to}} talk about nineteenth century things, we will have to take into account the novelistic misrecognition of the self, insofar as the heroes misrecognize themselves in forms of commodity fetishism. The thing is so often the subject herself insofar as "barred," dispersed among retrospective or delayed object identifications. I respond to the historical contextualization in Victorian cultural studies of "commodity culture," insisting that the economic structure of the commodity is not only a topic for realist notation, but makes up the inner logic of the novel form. Unhappy Consciousness urges a return to questions of novel theory which were perhaps set aside during New Historicism, arguing for a particularly novelistic mode of "objectification" (the form of the hero's activity) seen in interaction with the historical mode of objectification found in the capitalist value-form. I advance this argument through studies of several canonical Victorian works. Chapter One looks at the tension in Charles Dickens's Little Dorrit between the ideological closure attained in the "family romance" plot of buried wills and restored parents, and the dead-end of interpretation and retrospection found in the plot of financial crisis and stock swindles. Chapter Two argues that, in Anthony Trollope's The Last Chronicle of Barset, the tautological nature of interest rate is not confined to the urban financial plot but is displaced and affectively diffused over the provincial mystery plot. Chapter Three {{is a study}} of the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in which I read the detective as an exaggerated portrait of the subjective effects of capitalist alienation, a monad whose only intervention in the world is to link predictive results with opaque processes, to "produce" recognition scenes (the solutions to each case) as a salable commodity. He is a machine for retrospection who has no personal past. In Chapter Four, I read Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady as a critique of the fetishizing of autonomous consciousness, using Marx's definition of fetishism as the misrecognition of a social form as the content of a thing. Isabel's mistake is to misconstrue the structure of the male gaze that constitutes her "freedom" as the inherent property of her individuality [...] until it is unmasked as a trap. As so often in the Victorian novel, fetishism is a mode of self-knowledge...|$|E
