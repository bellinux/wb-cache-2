25|$|Object {{composition}} and inheritance: Whereas explicit function-based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation already <b>happens</b> <b>every</b> time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find {{a method that}} {{might be related to}} but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object's context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.|$|E

25|$|In Judaism, {{the day of}} {{judgment}} <b>happens</b> <b>every</b> year on Rosh Hashanah; therefore, the belief in a last day {{of judgment}} for all mankind is disputed. Some rabbis hold {{that there will be}} such a day following the resurrection of the dead. Others hold that {{there is no need for}} that because of Rosh Hashanah. Yet others hold that this accounting and judgment happens when one dies. Other rabbis hold that the last judgment only applies to the gentile nations and not the Jewish people.|$|E

25|$|For instance, a daily {{process should}} expect a 3σ event once per year (of {{calendar}} days; once {{every year and}} a half of business days), while a 4σ event <b>happens</b> on average <b>every</b> 40 years of calendar days, 60 years of business days (once in a lifetime), 5σ events <b>happen</b> <b>every</b> 5,000 years (once in recorded history), and 6σ events <b>happen</b> <b>every</b> 1.5 million years (essentially never).

25|$|Chromosomes are {{normally}} visible under a light microscope {{only when the}} cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division. Before this <b>happens,</b> <b>every</b> chromosome is copied once (S phase), and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere, resulting in an X-shaped structure. The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome. In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study. In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during segregation.|$|E
25|$|The arch, {{which was}} {{constructed}} between 312 and 315 AD, was dedicated by the Senate to commemorate ten years (decennalia) of Constantine's reign (306–337) and his {{victory over the}} then reigning emperor Maxentius (306–312) at the Battle of Milvian Bridge on 28 October 312, as described on its attic inscription, and officially opened on 25 July 315. Not only did the Roman senate give the arch for Constantine's victory, they also were celebratingdecennia,a series of games that <b>happens</b> <b>every</b> decade for the romans. In this occasion they also said many prayers. However, Constantine had actually entered Rome on 29 October 312, amidst great rejoicing, and the Senate then commissioned the monument. Constantine then left Rome within two months and did not return till 326.|$|E
25|$|In many states, {{fundamental}} mistakes, misrepresentations {{and similar}} defects {{may make a}} contract void ab initio, i.e. the defect is so serious that it prevents an agreement from ever coming into being. If this <b>happens,</b> <b>every</b> term in the contract including the express selection of the proper law, would be unenforceable. This {{raises the question of}} whether the lex fori should operate a policy of saving the validity of contracts wherever possible. Suppose that a contract would be valid under many potentially relevant laws but not under the putative proper law, and that, until problems arose, the parties have acted in good faith on the assumption that they will be bound by the agreement, some courts might be tempted to ignore the apparent proper law and choose another that would give effect to the parties general contractual intentions.|$|E
