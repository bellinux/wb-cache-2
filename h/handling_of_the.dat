The role of the future marshals becomes more clear in the campaigns of 1797, {{and especially in the}} Italian campaign; her <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material kept it fully focused on the future marshals Massena, Augereau, Berthier, and Brune.|$|E

A big set-piece offensive played into his hands.|$|E

5|$|A Republican in a {{primarily}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats {{for public}} office, but was elected governor of Kentucky {{on his second}} attempt. Due to his <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Patch Tobacco Wars and his pardoning of several individuals involved in the assassination of Democratic governor William Goebel, Willson drew the ire of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. As a result, few of his proposed reforms were considered by the legislature. His term ended in 1911, and in 1914, he made an unsuccessful bid for {{a seat in the}} U.S. Senate. Following this defeat, Willson retired to Louisville, where he died in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Amid the {{continuing}} uproar, Playford decided to grant clemency. The Royal Commission {{concluded that the}} guilty verdict was sound. Although a majority of those who spoke out against the <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter—including Dunstan—thought that Stuart was probably guilty, the events provoked heated and bitter debate in South Australian society and destabilised Playford's administration, while bringing much publicity to Dunstan.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{economic}} conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions in the run-up to Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{approach}} to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes, which saw over 8,000 taxi drivers {{take to the}} streets for two days in protests over high fees, unregulated competition and rising fuel costs. Similar protests in China were frequently suppressed—sometimes forcefully—with official media sometimes blaming labor unrest on criminal instigation. Bo's government instead held a televised roundtable dialogues with the protesters and citizens, and agreed to allow the formation of a trade union. His <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation earned him praise as a comparatively restrained and progressive leader.|$|E
5|$|Browne was {{eventually}} exchanged for American general William Alexander (Lord Stirling), and was roundly criticized for his <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole affair.

5|$|During the 11th century, {{political}} rivalries divided {{members of}} the court due to the ministers' differing approaches, opinions, and policies regarding the <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Song's complex society and thriving economy. The idealist Chancellor, Fan Zhongyan (989–1052), was the first to receive a heated political backlash when he attempted to institute the Qingli Reforms, which included measures such as improving the recruitment system of officials, increasing the salaries for minor officials, and establishing sponsorship programs to allow a wider range of people to be well educated and eligible for state service.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{controversy}} and {{the demolition of}} the Star Ferry Pier in Edinburgh Place in early 2007, activists declared Queen's Pier the next battle-ground against the conservation policy of the Government of Hong Kong. The criticism received over its <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Star Ferry Pier caused Michael Suen, the Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands, to propose a piece-by-piece relocation of the pier to a new location on the reclaimed waterfront during a Legco session on 21 March 2007. The Government later unveiled four design options for such relocation. The intended closure of the pier was 26 April 2007.|$|E

He also dealt with the 1976 shootings and Axe Murder Incident in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, and oversaw the Panama Canal Treaty in 1977.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing {{concern that the}} United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010 Christine Pratt, {{founder of}} the National Bullying Helpline said that the {{helpline}} had taken calls from Downing Street staff, although she later stated that the calls did not refer to Brown himself.

The Charity Commission later said that it had received over 160 complaints about the helpline's <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation.

5|$|In the Senate, Nixon took a {{prominent}} position in opposing global communism, traveling frequently and {{speaking out against}} it. He maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti-communist, the controversial Wisconsin senator, Joseph McCarthy, but was careful to keep some distance between himself and McCarthy's allegations. Nixon also criticized President Harry S. Truman's <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Korean War. He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii, {{voted in favor of}} civil rights for minorities, and supported federal disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia. He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions, benefits for illegal immigrants, and public power.|$|E

To Hamilton, the proper <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would also be a stimulant to the economy.|$|E
