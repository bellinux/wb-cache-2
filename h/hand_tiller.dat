50|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} the Inca Empire in 1533 led to a {{demographic}} collapse in the Andes as the Indigenous population precipitously declined due to European diseases and war. With lessened population pressure, many farmers relocated or were relocated by force {{in accordance with the}} Spanish policy of reductions to flatter and more easily cultivated lands. Also, the Spanish introduced oxen and horses as draft animals and plows. Andenes were difficult to access by these innovations, being most suitable for the <b>hand</b> <b>tiller.</b> In the 19th century with population growth, a number of andenes came back into use, but in the late 20th century 60 to 80 percent of andenes had been abandoned for growing crops, although they may be used for grazing.|$|E

There was also, as generally happened when he was occupied, a suggestion of reserved force {{in his face and}} attitude. He was, she realized, a man one could have confidence in when there were difficult things to be done.

The seasickness would pass, and grappling with the winds of heaven and the charging seas seemed a finer thing than adding up the price of flour or sticking stamps on letters. Here man's skill, nerve and quickness were pitted against the variable elements, and Frank had a suspicion--which, as it happened, was quite justified--that if Jake made a blunder the next white-topped comber would come foaming across the bows of the craft.

5000|$|Tillage, {{also known}} as cultivation, is the turning over of the soil. This method is more often used in {{agricultural}} crops. [...] Tillage can be performed {{on a small scale}} with tools such as small, <b>hand</b> pushed rotary <b>tillers</b> or on a large scale with tractor mounted plows. [...] Tillage is able to control weeds because when the soil is overturned, the vegetative parts of the plants are damaged and the root systems are exposed causing desiccation. [...] Generally, the younger the weed is, the more readily it can be controlled with tillage. [...] To control mature perennial weeds, repeated tillage is necessary. By continually destroying new growth and damaging the root system, the weed's food stores are depleted until it can no longer re-sprout. [...] Also, when the soil is overturned, the soil seed bank is disrupted which can cause dormant weed seeds to germinate {{in the absence of the}} previous competitors. These new weeds can also be controlled by continued tillage until the soil seed bank is depleted.|$|R

You could not have guessed within {{a quarter of a mile}} of Long Wharf. Nevertheless, we were to be blown to a crevice amid them,--steering right into the maze. Down goes the mainsail, and only the jib draws us along. Now we are within four rods of the shipping, having already dodged several outsiders; but it is still only a maze of spars, and rigging, and hulls,--not a crack can be seen. Down goes the jib, but still we advance.

6000|$|But mainly Nostromo {{is what he}} {{is because}} I {{received}} the inspiration for him in my early days from a Mediterranean sailor. Those who have read certain pages of mine will see at once what I mean when I say that Dominic, the padrone of the Tremolino, might under given circumstances have been a Nostromo. At any rate Dominic would have understood the younger man perfectly--if scornfully. He and I were engaged together in a rather absurd adventure, but the absurdity does not matter. It is a real satisfaction to think that in my very young days there must, after all, have been something in me worthy to command that man's half-bitter fidelity, his half-ironic devotion. Many of Nostromo's speeches I have heard first in Dominic's voice. His <b>hand</b> on the <b>tiller</b> and his fearless eyes roaming the horizon from within the monkish hood shadowing his face, he would utter the usual exordium of his remorseless wisdom: [...] "Vous autres gentilhommes!" [...] in a caustic tone that hangs on my ear yet. Like Nostromo! [...] "You hombres finos!" [...] Very much like Nostromo. But Dominic the Corsican nursed a certain pride of ancestry from which my Nostromo is free; for Nostromo's lineage had to be more ancient still. He is a man with the weight of countless generations behind him and no parentage to boast of. [...] . Like the People.|$|R
60|$|For the Scilly Isles {{had been}} sighted by Timmy Durrant lying like mountain-tops almost a-wash in {{precisely}} the right place.

Jacob, of course, was not a woman. The sight of Timmy Durrant was no sight for him, nothing to set against the sky and worship; far from it. They had quarrelled. Why the right way to open a tin of beef, with Shakespeare on board, under conditions of such splendour, should have turned them to sulky schoolboys, none can tell. Tinned beef is cold eating, though; and salt water spoils biscuits; and the waves tumble and lollop much the same hour after hour--tumble and lollop all across the horizon. Now a spray of seaweed floats past-now a log of wood. Ships have been wrecked here. One or two go past, keeping their own side of the road. Timmy knew where they were bound, what their cargoes were, and, by looking through his glass, could tell the name of the line, and even guess what dividends it paid its shareholders. Yet that was no reason for Jacob to turn sulky.|$|R
6000|$|Fortunately my {{companion}} was quick-witted and cool, and, {{standing at the}} helm, followed my instructions promptly, while I dragged at the halliards, and the loose folds of sailcloth rose thrashing overhead.

The boat swayed down until her leeward deck was buried in a rush of foam and her bending mast slanted half way to the horizontal. Little clouds of spray shot up from her weather bow as, gathering way, she swept ahead, and then they gave place to sheets of water, which lashed our faces, and, sluicing deep along the decks, poured over the coaming ledge into the open well. Still, we were in comparatively smooth water where one could risk a little, and while the straining mainsheet, which I dare not make fast, sawed into my wrist, I glanced at {{my companion}}.

Yet it was still confident, and her voice was level as she said: [...] "Let me help you. That rope is cutting your wrist." ...|$|R
40|$|Seeding density {{adjustments}} {{is one of}} {{the practices}} that most influence grain yield, as well as other agronomic traits. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine the ideal plant stand to achieve the maximum grain yield in genotypes showing differential tillering ability. Also, to establish the associations between the genotypes used with tillering and other agronomically important traits as weight of a thousand grains. Two experiments were conducted in 2005 and 2006 in Capão do Leão, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Five low (JURITI, BR 18, CEP 29, BR 18 and CD 108) and five high (CD 114, SAFIRA, FIGUEIRA, BRS 177 and UMBU) tillering potential wheat cultivars were tested for two years on a split-plot design. The results indicate the need for recommending cultivars based on more than one year of cultivation, especially when dealing with contrasting genotypes for the trait fertile tillers. Regarding the ideal plant stand, seeding density of low tillering ability genotypes ranges from 417 to 555 seeds m- 2, in order to obtain maximum yield and grain weight. On the other <b>hand,</b> for high <b>tillering</b> ability genotypes, the ideal stand ranges from 221 to 422 seeds m-². These results were year independent. Furthermore, low tillering ability genotypes showed a closer association of number of fertile tillers with grain yield. However, an inverse association was found between number of fertile tillers and weight of a thousand grains...|$|R
6000|$|The {{white man}} who spoke as if that sea was all his own, or as if people intruded upon his privacy by taking the liberty of getting wrecked on a coast {{where he and his}} friends did some queer business, seemed to him an {{undesirable}} helper. That the boat had been lowered to communicate with the praus seen and avoided by him in the evening he had no doubt. The thought had flashed on him at once. It had an ugly look. Yet {{the best thing to do}} after all was to hang on and get back to the yacht and warn them. [...] . Warn them against whom? The man had been perfectly open with him. Warn them against what?

6000|$|But that night, in particular, {{a strange}} (and ever since inexplicable) thing {{occurred}} to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned against it; {{in my ears}} was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on {{was not so much}} bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern.
