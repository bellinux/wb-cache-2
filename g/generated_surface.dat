The developed method uses the known NURBS surfaces modeling methods, combined with the input in CAD environment of the relative cutting motions between tool and gear. The cutting motions are also divided in relative motion steps, the cutting tool profiles are reduced to discreet points, fixed in 3 dpolyline vertexes, and theirs coordinates are read and stored after each moving steps. The obtained points contain discreet points from the <b>generated</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Using this points, and usual NURBS modeling methods, the <b>generated</b> <b>surfaces</b> are built. In final stage, this method should be a much faster alternative to the very slow, and huge calculating power consuming, solid modeling with Boolean operations...|$|R

By digitizing the radar video signal {{it can be}} processed by a digital computer. Sea surface parameters may be calculated {{on the basis of}} these digitized images. The marine navigation radar operates in low grazing angle mode and wind <b>generated</b> <b>surface</b> ripple must be present.The marine navigation radar is non-coherent and is a typical example of an indirect wave sensor, because there is no direct relation between wave height and radar back-scatter modulation amplitude. An empirical method of wave spectrum scaling is normally employed. Marine navigation radar based wave sensors are excellent tools for wave direction measurements. A marine navigation radar may also be a tool for surface current measurements. Point measurements of the current vector as well as current maps up to a distance of a few km can be provided (Gangeskar, 2002). Miros WAVEX has its main area of application as directional wave measurements from moving ships. Another example of a marine radar based system is OceanWaves WaMoS II.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany {{scientists}} use {{a global}} characterization of bare soil surface random roughness. Surface roughness is often characterized by statistical parameters deduced from its autocorrelation function. Assuming an autocorrelation model and a Gaussian height distribution, some authors have developed algorithms for numerical generation of soil surfaces {{that have the}} same statistical properties. This approach is widespread and {{does not take into}} account morphological aspects of the soil surface micro-topography. Now a detail surface roughness analysis reveals that the micro-topography is structured by holes, aggregates and clods. In the present study, we clearly show that when describing surface roughness as a whole, some information related to morphological aspects is lost. Two Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of a same natural seedbed surface were recorded by stereo photogrammetry. After estimating global parameters of these natural <b>surfaces,</b> we <b>generated</b> numerical <b>surfaces</b> of the same average characteristics by linear filtering.
