5|$|Appointed {{to lead a}} {{division}} in Italy in 1805, Vukassovich was soon sacked for failing to halt a French attack. The year 1809 found him leading {{a division}} in the invasion of Bavaria. He fought capably in several actions near Regensburg in April. He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Wagram in July while leading his troops. Among Austrian generals, <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> above-average initiative and skill, particularly in 1796 and 1809. He was Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian infantry regiment.|$|E
5|$|As a boy, Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) {{read the}} Comte de Buffon's Histoire Naturelle from the {{previous}} century, as well as Linnaeus and Fabricius. He was brought to Paris by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1795, {{not long after the}} French Revolution. He soon became a professor of animal anatomy at the Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle, surviving changes of government from revolutionary to Napoleonic to monarchy. Essentially on his own he created the discipline of vertebrate palaeontology and the accompanying comparative method. <b>He</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that animals had become extinct.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels {{captured}} {{the ebb and flow of}} society, and <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. <b>He</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E
5|$|In Copenhagen in 1927 Heisenberg {{developed}} his uncertainty principle, which Bohr embraced. In a paper he {{presented at the}} Volta Conference at Como in September 1927, <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that the uncertainty principle could be derived from classical arguments, without quantum terminology or matrices. Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed. Philosophical issues that arose from the novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion. Einstein and Bohr had good-natured arguments over such issues throughout their lives.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton, in his Principia Mathematica of 1687, {{proved that}} an object moving under the {{influence}} of gravity must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the conic sections, and <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> how to fit a comet's path through the sky to a parabolic orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.|$|E

5|$|The 1906 {{exhibition}} of Gauguin's work left Picasso {{more than ever}} in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated,</b> by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping {{a new source of}} divine energy.|$|E
5|$|Based only on {{uncertain}} {{descriptions of}} the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608, Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification. He later made improved versions with up to about 30x magnification. With a Galilean telescope, the observer could see magnified, upright images on the earth—it was what {{is commonly known as}} a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time {{he was one of those}} who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to Venetian lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger).|$|E
5|$|Brought up by poor but musically talented {{parents on}} the island of Funen, <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> his musical {{abilities}} at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his Op. 1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Academy and continued to work there until his death.|$|E

5|$|Groningen placed Robben {{in their}} first team for the 1999–2000 season. He scored three goals in league play. Manager Jan van Dijk added the winger to the first team before Groningen's November 2000 away game against Twente, {{but he did not}} play until 3 December 2000 against RKC Waalwijk as a {{substitute}} for the injured Leonardo dos Santos in the 79th minute. During the winter, Robben managed to play himself into the starting lineup. In 18starts for Groningen over the 2000–01 season, he scored two goals. Robben was named player of the year for his first season with the club, and with teammate Jordi Hoogstrate, <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> the strength of the Groningen youth academy. Robben stayed with Groningen and improved steadily during the 2001–02 season, playing in 28matches and scoring six goals. Robben transferred to PSV for €3.9million before the 2002–03 season.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recovered}} from his broken ankle {{in time for}} the 1941–42 season, Richard returned to the QSHL Canadiens, with whom he played 31 games and recorded 17 points before he was again injured. He suffered a broken wrist after becoming entangled with a defenceman and crashed into the net. Richard rejoined the team for the playoffs. The skills <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in the QSHL, combined with the NHL parent club's loss of players to the war and struggles to draw fans due to its poor record and a lack of francophone players, earned Richard a tryout with the Canadiens for the 1942–43 season. He signed a contract worth $3,500 for the year and, wearing sweater number 15, made his NHL debut with the team. Richard's first goal was against the New York Rangers on November 8, 1942.|$|E
5|$|He {{is known}} to have absorbed the {{abilities}} of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|E

50|$|The {{premise of}} the film is that Bugs Bunny is {{competing}} for the Academy Award for Best Actor. <b>He</b> <b>demonstrates</b> his acting ability by transforming into Jerry Colonna, Bing Crosby, Cecil B. DeMille, Katharine Hepburn, and Edward G. Robinson. As the announcer lists the winner's traits, Bugs transforms to illustrate that they all apply to him: dramatic acting, refined comedy, skill at character roles, and prowess as a screen lover. <b>He</b> <b>demonstrates</b> his character acting by becoming Frankenstein's monster and his romantic acting by changing into Charles Boyer and romancing a carrot.|$|R
5|$|Hess, {{the oldest}} of three children, was born on 26 April 1894 in Alexandria, Egypt, into the ethnic German family of Fritz Hess, a prosperous {{merchant}} from Bavaria, and Clara Hess (née Münch). His brother, Alfred, was born in 1897 and his sister, Margarete, was born in 1908. The family lived in a villa on the Egyptian coast near Alexandria, and visited Germany often from 1900, staying at their summer home in Reicholdsgrün (now part of Kirchenlamitz) in the Fichtel Mountains. Hess attended a German language Protestant school in Alexandria from 1900 to 1908, when he {{was sent back to}} Germany to study at a boarding school in Bad Godesberg. <b>He</b> <b>demonstrated</b> aptitudes for science and mathematics, but his father wished him to join the family business, Hess & Co., so he sent him in 1911 to study at the École supérieure de commerce in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. After a year there, Hess took an apprenticeship at a trading company in Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Compton {{moved to}} the University of Chicago as Professor of Physics, a {{position}} he would occupy for the next 22 years. In 1925, <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> that the scattering of 130,000-volt X-rays from the first sixteen elements in the periodic table (hydrogen through sulfur) were polarized, a result predicted by J. J. Thomson. William Duane from Harvard University spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong. Duane carried {{out a series of}} experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found evidence that Compton was correct. In 1924, Duane conceded that this was the case.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Abbe {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom. He went at {{the invitation}} of the London Judo Society (LJS), and was the first master to teach aikido in the UK. That year, <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience two problems at the LJS: first, he felt that the students there were more concerned with competition than his theories, and second, he felt that the students did not treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank and experience in the martial arts. According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E
50|$|Vila greatly enjoys {{drinking}} and gambling, making the Liberator crew keep {{him away from}} situations where his vices could compromise the mission (Shadow, Killer, Gambit). However, <b>he</b> <b>demonstrates</b> courage and resourcefulness when needed, choosing to join with Blake instead of staying on Cygnus Alpha, grabbing Orac before being teleported off the Liberator in Terminal and re-entering the Terminal complex to save Tarrant (Rescue). <b>He</b> <b>demonstrates</b> immense skill and heroism in City at the Edge of the World, where he develops a short-lived but intense romance with Kerril, a female gunfighter.|$|R

5|$|In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French {{and their}} Indian allies ambushed Braddock's reduced {{forces and the}} general was mortally wounded. After {{suffering}} devastating casualties, the British panicked and retreated in disarray. Washington rode {{back and forth across}} the battlefield, rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces into an organized retreat. In the process, <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> bravery and stamina, despite his lingering illness. He had two horses shot from underneath him, while his hat and coat were pierced by several bullets. Two-thirds of the British force of 976 men were killed or wounded in the battle. Washington's conduct in the battle redeemed his reputation among many who had criticized his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity.|$|E
5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E
5|$|Jennings was {{determined}} to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. The next year, <b>he</b> <b>demonstrated</b> his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with {{the intricacies of the}} Arab–Israeli conflict, including the rise of the Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.|$|E
