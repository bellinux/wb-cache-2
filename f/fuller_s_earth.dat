30|$|Contemporary {{co-ordinate}} numbering of the HBV genome assigns {{a position}} of 1 to the first “T” nucleotide after the EcoR 1 restriction site (G|AA T TC) when sequenced in the forward direction. Prior to this convention, {{the start of the}} Core region (position 1901 in the contemporary system) was considered to be the first position of the HBV genome. The HBV genome is circular and position 1 happens to occur within the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> (surface) ORF. Therefore, the full nucleotide sequence of the S gene straddles position 1, and the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> ORF does not run contiguously within a linear sequence in the standard orientation. Thus, the start of the S ORF varies depending on the genotype, being 2854 for genotype A, 2848 for genotypes B to F and H, and 2884 for genotype G. In all genotypes, the S ORF ends at position 835. Extracting the <b>full</b> <b>S</b> gene sequence from linear sequence data therefore requires additional sequence processing.|$|R

In 1998, DEVELOP began with three students and {{has evolved into a}} nationwide internship program with over 200 students participating each year. DEVELOP is a NASA Applied Sciences training and development program extending NASA Earth science research and technology to society. Part of the NASA Science Mission Directorate <b>s</b> <b>Earth</b> Science Division, the Applied Sciences Program focuses on bridging the gap between NASA technology and the public by conducting projects that innovatively use NASA Earth science resources to research environmental issues. Project outcomes focus on assisting communities to better understand environmental change over time. This is accomplished through research with global, national, and regional partners to identify the widest array of practical uses of NASA data. DEVELOP students conduct research in areas that examine how NASA science can better serve society. Projects focus on practical applications of NASA <b>s</b> <b>Earth</b> science research results. Each project is designed to address {{at least one of the}} Applied Sciences focus areas, use NASA <b>s</b> <b>Earth</b> observation sources and meet partners needs.

EOSDIS is currently handling an extraordinary amount of NASA scientific data. To give an idea of the volume of information it receives, NASA s Terra Earth-observing satellite, just one of many NASA satellites sending down data, sends it hundreds of gigabytes a day, almost as much data as the Hubble Space Telescope acquires in an entire year, or about equal to the amount of information that could be found in hundreds of pickup trucks filled with books. To make EOSDIS data completely accessible to the Earth science community, NASA teamed up with private industry in 2000 to develop an Earth science "marketplace" registry that lets public users quickly drill down to the exact information they need. It also enables them to publish their research and resources alongside of NASA s research and resources. This registry is known as the Earth Observing System ClearingHOuse, or ECHO. The charter for this project focused on having an infrastructure completely independent from EOSDIS that would allow for more contributors and open up additional data access options. Accordingly, it is only fitting that the term ECHO is more than just an acronym; it represents the functionality of the system in that it can echo out and create interoperability among other systems, all while maturing with time as industry technologies and standards change and improve...|$|R
