50|$|By {{the onset}} of the Civil War, the company began the {{production}} of munitions and armaments for the Union Army. Also around this time began the manufacturing of parts for railroad cars and locomotives. The holdings of the Brookes family were organized into The Birdsboro Iron Foundry Co. by 1867, and later for a short time, the E&G Brooke Iron Co. This marks the beginning of steel production for the company. In the 1880s, a tool manufacturing company called <b>Diamond</b> <b>Drill</b> and Machine Co from Pottsville, Pennsylvania began to operate a division on the Birdsboro Iron Foundry's property.

The rig is first set up to drill as an RC rig and once the desired metres are drilled, the rig is set up for <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling.</b> This way the deeper metres of the hole can be drilled without moving the rig and waiting for a diamond rig to set up on the pad.|$|R
