25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{clinical}} experience with brachial plexus block in both peacetime and wartime surgery was extensive, and {{new approaches to}} this technique began to be described. For example, In 1946, F. Paul Ansbro {{was the first to}} describe a continuous brachial plexus block technique. He secured a needle in the supraclavicular fossa and attached tubing connected to a syringe through which he could inject incremental doses of local anesthetic. The subclavian perivascular block was first described by Winnie and Collins in 1964. This approach became popular due to its lower risk of pneumothorax compared to the traditional Kulenkampff approach. The infraclavicular approach was first developed by Raj. In 1977, Selander described a technique for continuous brachial plexus block using an <b>intravenous</b> <b>catheter</b> secured in the axilla.|$|E
25|$|Fluids are {{commonly}} given, either orally by nasogastric tube or by <b>intravenous</b> <b>catheter,</b> to restore proper hydration and electrolyte balance. In cases of strangulating obstruction or enteritis, the intestine will have decreased absorption and increased secretion of fluid into the intestinal lumen, making oral fluids ineffective and possibly dangerous if they cause gastric distention and rupture. This process of secretion into the intestinal lumen leads to dehydration, and these horse require {{large amounts of}} IV fluids to prevent hypotension and subsequent cardiovascular collapse. Fluid rates are calculated by adding the fluid lost during each collection of gastric reflux to the daily maintenance requirement of the horse. Due {{to the fact that}} horses absorb water in the cecum and colon, the IV fluid requirement of horses with simple obstruction is dependent on the location of the obstruction. Those that are obstructed further distally, such as at the pelvic flexure, are able to absorb more oral fluid than those obstructed in the small intestine, and therefore require less IV fluid support. Impactions are usually managed with fluids for 3–5 days before surgery is considered. Fluids are given based on results of the physical examination, such as mucous membrane quality, PCV, and electrolyte levels. Horses in circulatory shock, such as those suffering from endotoxemia, require very high rates of IV fluid administration. Oral fluids via nasogastric tube are often given in the case of impactions to help lubricate the obstruction. Oral fluids should not be given if significant amounts of nasogastric reflux are obtained. Access to food and water will often be denied to allow careful monitoring and administration of what is taken in by the horse.|$|E
500|$|The easiest {{method to}} perform this {{technique}} is the needle cricothyrotomy (also {{referred to as a}} percutaneous dilational cricothyrotomy), in which a large-bore (12–14 gauge) <b>intravenous</b> <b>catheter</b> is used to puncture the cricothyroid membrane. Oxygen can then be administered through this catheter via jet insufflation. However, while needle cricothyrotomy may be life-saving in extreme circumstances, {{this technique is}} only intended to be a temporizing measure until a definitive airway can be established. While needle cricothyrotomy can provide adequate oxygenation, the small diameter of the cricothyrotomy catheter is insufficient for elimination of carbon dioxide (ventilation). After one hour of apneic oxygenation through a needle cricothyrotomy, one can expect a PaCO2 of greater than 250mm Hg and an arterial pH of less than 6.72, despite an oxygen saturation of 98% or greater. A more definitive airway can be established by performing a surgical cricothyrotomy, in which a [...] endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube can be inserted through a larger incision.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this prospective study is to verify the incidence of phlebitis among patients with peripheral <b>intravenous</b> <b>catheters</b> and to identify possible relations between this complication and catheter-related variables.

40|$|ObjectiveMany {{children}} undergoing {{surgery for}} {{congenital heart disease}} have had prior operations. Reoperative sternotomy carries with it the risk of cardiac injury {{and the need for}} emergency peripheral cannulation. Unfortunately, in smaller children, many of the standard sites are occluded, stenosed, or too small for the smallest manufactured cannulas. Using a model, we evaluated the feasibility of using peripheral <b>intravenous</b> <b>catheters</b> for establishing cardiopulmonary support. MethodsA model cardiopulmonary bypass circuit was created. Catheters of varying diameter and length were used to simulate arterial cannulation. With each catheter, flows were incrementally increased until a maximum arterial line pressure was achieved. Data were recorded. ResultsCatheter diameters increased from 24 to 14 gauge, and catheter lengths increased from 1 inch to 1. 88 inches. Flow could not be established through the 24 -gauge catheter without an unacceptably high arterial line pressure. From the next smallest catheter (22 gauge × 1 inch) to the largest catheter (14 gauge × 1. 88 inches), maximum achievable flow rates ranged from 70 to 540 mL/min, respectively. ConclusionsPeripheral arterial cannulation may be lifesaving in cases of complicated sternal re-entry in children. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>catheters</b> can be used when vessels are too small for standard cannulas. Flow rates that provide adequate support while maintaining acceptable arterial line pressures are achievable with peripheral <b>intravenous</b> <b>catheters</b> until central cannulation can be accomplished safely...|$|R
40|$|Aims.   To design {{clinical}} guidelines on timing for replacing peripheral <b>intravenous</b> <b>catheters,</b> {{in an attempt}} to decrease complications and lower related expenditures. Background.   Intravenous therapy is a common intervention for patients in hospitals and some other clinical settings. However, the currently available international and local guidelines have come under criticism. There is a need to develop evidence-based guidelines to benefit patients as well as to save on the resources of healthcare systems. Design.   A discursive paper. Methods.   The evidence-based health care of Dawes et al. (BioMed Central Medical Education 5, 2005, 1) was adopted to guide the development of this guideline. Cochrane Library Database was searched with four keywords: (1) Intravenous, (2) Infusion, (3) Infection, and (4) Timing, which identified one systematic review. Guideline on timing for replacing peripheral <b>intravenous</b> <b>catheters</b> was proposed based on the systematic review. Further recommendation for application in clinical settings and quality management are given. An algorithm on the replacement of peripheral <b>intravenous</b> <b>catheters</b> was included.
