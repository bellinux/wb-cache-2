40|$|The {{question}} of least-squares weights versus equal weights {{has been a}} subject {{of great interest to}} researchers for over 60 years. Several researchers have compared the efficiency of equal weights and that of least-squares weights under different conditions. Recently, S. V. Paunonen and R. C. Gardner stressed that the necessary and sufficient condition for equal-weights aggregation is that the predictors satisfy the requirements of psychometric parallelism. In this study, the effect of psychometric parallelism on the <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> for equal weights and least-squares weights was investigated with the combination of different numbers of predictors, sample sizes, and intercorrelations. The findings indicate that equal weights always perform more precisely than least-squares weights as long as the following situations are satisfied: (1) the number of predictors is small; (2) the ratio of observation to predictor is small, {{less than or equal to}} 10; and (3) the magnitude of the mean intercorrelation is high, a...|$|E

Twelve male subjects aging from 62 to 82 years and weighting 66 - 88 kg, were orally administered with single dose of T (200 mg/BW). Two ml of stabilizer-solution (CH 3 OH/CH 3 CN, 1 / 1 (v/v) +CH 3 COOH 2 %) were added to 1 ml of human plasma and stoked to - 80 degrees C until analyses.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to determine}} the size distribution curve of the ROM was developed in a Brazilian iron ore mine. The size of the larger fragments was determined taking photographs and setting {{the scale of the}} images to analyze their dimensions (length of their edges and areas).

During the sampling process, larger fragments were separated and smaller size material was screened. The methodology was developed initially in order to preview the performance of a primary gyratory crusher that is fed directly from trucks. Operational conditions of the equipment such as closed and open-side settings could be adjusted previously, obtaining different product size distributions. Variability of size of the fragments affects subsequent stages of crushing and can increase circulating load in the circuit. This leads to a decrease of productivity or recovery of the ore dressing.

The risk of fracture increases with decreasing bone mineral density, which can be measured using several different techniques. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry is the most commonly used technique today. A further facility of the new bone densitometry technology is the option for vertebral morphometry. There are <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> in all bone densitometry techniques and also in the interpretation of the data they provide.

Broadband ultrasound attenuation of the calcaneus predicts the risk of hip fracture in elderly women almost or equally as well as bone densitometry. Ultrasound does not expose to radiation and the equipment is portable. However, bone ultrasound cannot replace bone densitometry. Biochemical bone markers do not differentiate osteoporotic patients from healthy adults. However, they can be useful in deciding on interventions and in monitoring the efficacy of treatment. Their predictive value in individuals suffers from large variability. Biochemistry is widely used in the differential diagnosis of secondary osteoporosis.

40|$|Statistical {{estimation}} protocols {{are one of}} the {{key means}} to ensure that independent and objective information on product accuracy is communicated to end-users. Methods for validating burned area products have been developed based on a probability sample of a space by time partitioning of the population. We extend this basic methodology to improve stratification and sample allocation, key elements of a sampling design used to collect burned area reference data. We developed and evaluated an approach to partition each year and biome into low and high burned area (BA) strata. Because the threshold used to separate the sampling units into low and high BA can vary by year and biome, this approach offers a more targeted stratification than used in previous studies for which a common threshold was applied to all biomes. A hypothetical population of validation data was then used to quantitatively compare the precision <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> estimates derived from different stratification and sample size allocation options. We evaluated two options that had been previously examined in the BA validation literature, and extended previous studies by adding two new options specifically developed for ratio estimates. Stratification based on mapped BA reduced standard <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> the global burned area accuracy estimates from one-half to one-eighth relative to standard <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> simple random sampling. Stratifying by mapped BA was also found to reduce standard <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>accuracy</b> estimates for most year by biome strata indicating that this advantage of stratification and sample allocation applies generally to a range of conditions (i. e., biomes and years). The most precise estimates were obtained using a sample size per stratum allocation n[subscript h] ∝N[subscript h] x SQRT(BAR(BA[subscript h])) where N[subscript h] is the number of units in stratum h and BAR(BA[subscript h]) is the mean mapped BA for stratum h. The best sampling design from our analyses was then used to select a set of 1, 000 samples from a hypothetical population of validation data and confidence intervals were computed for each sample. Close to 95 % of these confidence intervals contained the true population value thus confirming the validity of confidence intervals produced from the estimates and standard errors.
