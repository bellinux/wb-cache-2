These particles have energies ranging from about 106eV up to an extreme 1020eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The peak <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{scale of}} {{ecological}} organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. Ecological relationships regulate the <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> energy, nutrients, and climate {{all the way}} up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO2 and O2 composition has been affected by the biogenic <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback loop generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.|$|E

5|$|Anisotropy {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and {{is so strong that}} usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.|$|E
5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have {{little effect on the}} <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.|$|E
5|$|Both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, {{meaning that}} they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, leading to {{applications}} in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Plutonium-240 exhibits {{a high rate of}} spontaneous fission, raising the neutron <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its grade (weapons-grade, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles. It is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used to power some spacecraft. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.|$|E

The highest level of emission occurs over the radius 35–75 AU from Epsilon Eridani and is substantially reduced inside 30AU.

40|$|Investigations of the {{atmospheric}} fallout of 7 Be and 210 Pb {{in many places}} around the globe indicate that there are seasonal variations on the depositional <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> these nuclides: high in winter in a few places, while in most places the high occurs in spring. However, these earlier studies did not address quantitatively the corresponding seasonal variations {{of the amount of}} precipitation during these periods. Data on the depositional <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> 7 Be and 210 Pb in Galveston, Texas, during the years 1989 – 1991 indicate that the seasonal variation is not uniform from year to year, and the amount of precipitation primarily controls the depositional fluxes. All the recently published data on the depositional <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> these radionuclides to date are synthesized. Also, the seasonal variations <b>of</b> the depositional <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> 7 Be and 210 Pb due to the variations in the amounts of precipitation during these seasons are discussed. This study clearly shows that the depositional <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> 7 Be and 210 Pb during fall were minimum, {{and most of the time}} the fallout maxima were confined to either spring and/or summer. Interseasonal variations <b>of</b> the depositional <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> these nuclides do not remain the same. The data presented in this paper in conjunction with earlier published data seem to indicate that the observed seasonal increase in the depositional <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> 7 Be during spring is not due to the troposphere-stratosphere exchange of air masses during that season. The 7 Be/ 210 Pb activity ratio values remain the highest in summer and this is attributed to the increased rate of vertical transport of 7 Be (from the upper troposphere to the middle and lower troposphere) and 210 Pb (from the lower troposphere to upper troposphere) due to decreased stability of the troposphere during summer months...|$|R

5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E

In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a convection zone. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high opacity (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.|$|E
