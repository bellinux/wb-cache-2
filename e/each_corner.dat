50|$|This {{numbering}} {{comes about}} because as one {{moves down the}} table from row to row only one variable at a time changes its value. Gray code is derived from this notion. This notion can be extended to three and four-dimensional hypercubes called Hasse diagrams where <b>each</b> <b>corner's</b> variables change only {{one at a time}} as one moves {{around the edges of the}} cube. Hasse diagrams (hypercubes) flattened into two dimensions are either Veitch diagrams or Karnaugh maps (these are virtually the same thing).|$|R
5|$|In <b>each</b> <b>corner</b> of {{the chapel}} is a {{triangular}} pendentive filling {{the space between the}} walls and the arch of the vault and forming the spandrel above the windows nearest the corners.

Her secondary armament consisted of ten 9.2-inch (234mm) guns, eight in twin gun turrets on <b>each</b> <b>corner</b> of the superstructure, {{and a single}} gun turret between them. For defence against torpedo boats, Lord Nelson carried twenty-four QF 12-pounder 18 cwt guns and two 3-pounder guns. She also mounted five submerged 18-inch (457mm) torpedo tubes for which 23 torpedoes were stowed aboard.|$|E
5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally {{designed for use}} by high-energy physicists studying subatomic particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This ring is actually not a perfect circle, but a many-sided polygon. At <b>each</b> <b>corner</b> of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons’ path is bent, they emit bursts {{of energy in the}} form of X-rays.|$|E
50|$|Renaissance in its style, {{the tower}} {{consists}} of three sections mounted upon a rusticated base and surrounded on four sides by iron street lamps which feature dolphins at their base.

Each column group supports a 150 tons cornice and contains a pedestal in its center that originally carried a statue. Out of sixteen columns, only one is original while the rest are from reconstruction work by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities in 1963, using concrete. The original columns were brought from Egypt and carved out of pink granite.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} chapel (Ohel) at the Jewish {{burial ground}} is Grade II-listed.

5|$|The {{plans for}} Holkham {{were of a}} large central block of two floors only, {{containing}} on the piano nobile level a series of symmetrically balanced state rooms situated around two courtyards. No hint of these courtyards is given externally; they are intended for lighting rather than recreation or architectural value. This great central block is flanked by four smaller, rectangular blocks, or wings, and at <b>each</b> <b>corners</b> {{is linked to the}} main house not by long colonnadesas would have been the norm in Palladian architecturebut by short two-storey wings of only one bay.|$|R

5|$|The towers are semi-circular. Their inner flanks have lobed arches as decorations, a North African motif {{introduced}} to Egypt by the Fatimids. The vestibule {{to the right}} contains a half-domed recess with elegantly carved arches at <b>each</b> <b>corner.</b> The gates were massive, weighing four tons. The gates today have two minarets, open to visitors, from which the area may be viewed. Additions were made during the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|The west {{tower is}} surmounted with crenellations and pinnacles and is {{supported}} by stepped buttresses at <b>each</b> <b>corner.</b> The buttresses are constructed from flint and stone, and have arched insets on the faces. They rest on stone plinths, each bearing carved shields, that on the north buttress with an inaccurate rendering of {{the arms of the}} see, and the other with a cross and a dolphin. The tower has three Perpendicular windows in the belfry and a large Perpendicular window in its western face, giving light to the west end of the nave.|$|E
5|$|Wressle Castle is {{a ruined}} palace-fortress in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, built for Thomas Percy in the 1390s. It is privately owned and {{not open to}} the public.

50|$|The {{bottlenose}} skate is a benthic predator of bony fishes, other elasmobranchs, fish offal, crabs, shrimps, mysids, octopus, and cuttlefish. Younger, smaller {{fish are}} usually found in shallower water. Like other skates, this species is oviparous, with females producing 55-156 ova per {{year after a}} gestation period of 15 months. The egg cases are oblong in shape, with stiff pointed horns at <b>each</b> <b>corners</b> and the larger horns flattened. They are deposited in sandy or muddy flats in the spring. The capsules measure 12.5-18.3 cm long and 10.0-13.9 cm wide. This species is estimated to mature at 130 cm for males and 120 cm for females.|$|R
50|$|The second-generation Celica {{can also}} {{be broken down into}} two series of release (known as Series A and Series B). These two Celicas were only {{distinguishable}} by appearance - both having the same engine capacity. The original Series A Celica (1978-1979) was released with round headlights and chrome bumpers for lower grades. The higher grades such as GT and all US models have black rubber bumpers. The facelift model Series B Celica (1979-1981) was released with square headlights, revised tail lights. They came with chrome bumpers with rubber protectors on <b>each</b> <b>corners,</b> or for certain models with all polyurethane black bumpers such on the GT and all US spec cars.|$|R

5|$|A quadrangular castle, Wressle Castle {{was laid}} out with four ranges in a square around a courtyard. At <b>each</b> <b>corner</b> was a tower, and in {{the centre of the}} east side was a five-storey gatehouse. Clockwise from north east the corner towers were named the Constable Tower (where the constable who ran the castle on a daily basis lived), the Chapel Tower, the Lord’s Tower, and the Kitchen Tower. Opposite the gatehouse, in the castle's west range, was the great hall and the Lord's Tower in the south west {{contained}} the owner's accommodation and private rooms.|$|E
5|$|After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did {{not return}} to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch, the County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their {{acquisitions}} were designed mostly by Syrian master-masons. Their design was very similar to that of a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia which were square in plan and had square towers at <b>each</b> <b>corner</b> that did not project much beyond the curtain wall. The keep of these Crusader castles would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.|$|E
5|$|In 1750, now well-known, the {{architect}} received an important commission to remodel Euston Hall in East Anglia, the Suffolk country {{seat of the}} influential 2nd Duke of Grafton. The original house, built circa 1666 in the French style, was built around a central court with large pavilions at <b>each</b> <b>corner.</b> While keeping the original layout, Brettingham formalised the fenestration and imposed a more classically severe order whereby the pavilions were transformed to towers in the Palladian fashion (similar to those of Inigo Jones's at Wilton House). The pavilions' domes were replaced by low pyramid roofs similar to those at Holkham. Brettingham also created the large service courtyard at Euston that now acts as the entrance court to the mansion, which today is {{only a fraction of}} its former size.|$|E

50|$|Ngawen {{is thought}} to be {{connected}} with the other three Buddhist temples nearby — Mendut, Pawon and Borobudur — all of which were built during the Sailendra dynasty (8th - 9th centuries). According to the satellite map observation, the four temples; Borobudur, Pawon, Mendut and Ngawen are actually forming a straight line spanning west to east slightly tilted northeast with eastern end pointing to the peak of Mount Merapi. From the detail and style of its carving, this temple is estimated to be slightly older than Borobudur. The temple is notable for its exquisite statues of rampant lions on <b>each</b> <b>corners</b> of the temples. Since its discovery in 1874, the temple has suffered looting and artifact theft.|$|R
