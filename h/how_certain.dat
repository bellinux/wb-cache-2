5|$|The {{same basic}} {{procedure}} {{was used by}} all of the above-mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. At a later time, they judge the same problem again but with information of <b>how</b> <b>certain</b> groups or prestigious people have evaluated the same problem. If the subject changes his judgment {{in the same direction as}} the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.|$|E
5|$|The god Hermes {{is not in}} the game, but in the novel, he is {{responsible}} for informing Athena that Kratos is committing suicide. New characters include Coeus, the First Officer of Kratos' ship, and the two servants of Medusa: Jurr and a blind man. The twins encountered in the sex mini-game are revealed to be the daughters of Aphrodite named Zora and Lora. The book also explains <b>how</b> <b>certain</b> creatures of the mythology that were slain by heroes are, apparently, still alive. For example, Zeus recollects that Hercules slew the Hydra, and Athena confirms this, but informs Zeus that the new Hydra is a newborn spawn of the Titans Typhon and Echidna, and was released by Ares.|$|E

25|$|The paper {{concludes with}} {{comparisons}} of the vegetation of the Congo with those of West Africa, South Africa, St. Helena and Madagascar; West Africa {{is found to be}} very much similar, and South Africa remarkably different. Comparisons are then made with South America, and consideration is given to <b>how</b> <b>certain</b> distributions might have come about. Noting that the collection contains around 250 new species and about 32 new genera, yet no new family, Brown concludes with the observation that there are no plant families endemic to tropical Africa.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there was}} an {{established}} aristocracy, the pyramidal social structure is not similar to the feudal system of the much later Medieval Age. Beside other factors, {{it has been suggested}} that agricultural production was insufficient to supply an élite that itself did not participate. In general, it is considered as unlikely that the élite possessed total power. Furthermore, power may not only have been based on weapons. Also religious and ancestral factors are important when explaining <b>how</b> <b>certain</b> persons or families managed to maintain authority for generations. For example, impressive burial mounds could consolidate imaginations of a clan's right to an area.|$|E
25|$|However, in the Roman West, our {{knowledge}} of practicing midwives comes mainly from funerary epitaphs. Two hypotheses are suggested by looking at {{a small sample of}} these epitaphs. The first is the midwifery was not a profession to which freeborn women of families that had enjoyed free status of several generations were attracted; therefore it seems that most midwives were of servile origin. Second, since most of these funeral epitaphs describe the women as freed, it can be proposed that midwives were generally valued enough, and earned enough income, to be able to gain their freedom. It is not known from these epitaphs <b>how</b> <b>certain</b> slave women were selected for training as midwives. Slave girls may have been apprenticed, and it is most likely that mothers taught their daughters.|$|E

25|$|Mixed member {{systems are}} {{susceptible}} to gerrymandering for the local seats that remain a part of such systems. Under parallel voting, a semi-proportional system, there is no compensation for the effects that such gerrymandering might have. Under MMP, the use of compensatory list seats makes gerrymandering less of an issue. However, its effectiveness in this regard depends upon {{the features of the}} system, including the size of the regional districts, the relative share of list seats in the total, and opportunities for collusion that might exist. A striking example of how the compensatory mechanism can be undermined {{can be seen in the}} 2014 Hungarian parliamentary election, where the leading party, Fidesz, combined gerrymandering and decoy lists, which resulted in a two-thirds parliamentary majority from a 45% vote. This illustrates <b>how</b> <b>certain</b> implementations of MMP can produce moderately proportional outcomes, similar to parallel voting.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge about {{nutrition}} in Ghana {{is obtained}} through formal education, community health services, friends and families, cultural practices, traditions, {{and beliefs of}} the community. The majority of foods consumed by Ghanaian women during pregnancy were foods indigenous to Ghanaian diets in general such as green leafy vegetables, meats, fish, fruits, and legumes. They also consume foreign foods such as dairy products, biscuits, and beverages such as tea and powdered mixes. Recommended raw foods during pregnancy include: bananas, oranges, papaya, pineapples, carrots, cabbage, lettuce, honey, and kwawu nsua/nsaman troba. Recommended cooked foods include bean stew with palm oil and boiled white rice, bread, fried anchovies, smoked mackerel, snails in soup, stews with eggs and vegetables, palm nut soup with fufu and rice, and Nkontomire stew which is made with palm oil and boiled sweet cassava, or plantain, or yam. The beliefs about beneficial foods during pregnancy are based on their understanding of <b>how</b> <b>certain</b> foods can prevent anemia, enhance physical strength, support {{the development of the}} fetus, and minimize physiological disruption.|$|E
25|$|Edge's {{second term}} as {{governor}} {{was marked by}} numerous battles with Hague. In 1944, Edge and Hague fought over <b>how</b> <b>certain</b> railroad tax money should be allocated (with Hague’s position ultimately prevailing), while Edge won the passage of legislation that required the use of voting machines in Hudson County to reduce the chance of electoral fraud. Edge also obtained legislation authorizing the governor to appoint jury commissioners for each county, bypassing county sheriffs, who had previously hand-picked grand jurors who they knew would refuse to indict those engaged in illegal activities protected by political bosses like Hague. The most important battle between Edge and Hague involved constitutional revision. In early 1944, Republican legislators drafted a new proposed constitution that would have, among other things, deprived Hague of {{a major source of}} patronage by restructuring the judiciary. Hague strongly opposed the revised constitution, and several weeks prior to the November 1944 election he launched a multi-pronged attack on it, charging that it would restrict the activities of labor unions, inhibit advancement opportunities for returning veterans, and subject all church owned property to taxation. Voters rejected the proposed constitution.|$|E
