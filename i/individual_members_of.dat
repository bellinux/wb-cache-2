5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary problem is that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to <b>individual</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E

5|$|Mahaleo {{performs}} a genre they pioneered, called tsentsigat, that draws from the acoustic folk and protest song genres {{as well as}} the diverse musical traditions of Madagascar. Each of the band members sings, and all but one also play acoustic guitar. In addition, the band makes use of traditional instruments like the kabosy guitar and sodina flute. While the band is acclaimed for its large catalog of hits, with over 300 songs composed since 1972, its members are also admired for their commitment to live the message of solidarity for national development that features in most of their music. Each band member has gone on to cultivate a primary career in addition to his participation in Mahaleo in areas ranging from medical care and sociology to farming and politics.

5|$|The Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame is a {{professional}} wrestling hall of fame that recognizes people who make significant contributions to the sport. It was founded in 1996 by Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Like other wrestling halls of fame, such as the WWE, TNA, and WCW hall of fames, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame is not contained in a building, {{and there are no}} ceremonies for inductions other than a highly detailed biographical documentation of their career in the newsletter. Inductees include wrestlers, managers, promoters, trainers, and commentators. On seven occasions, tag teams have been inducted rather than the <b>individual</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the team. This first occurred in 1996, when The Dusek family, The Fabulous Kangaroos, and The Road Warriors entered the hall. The Fabulous Freebirds, The Midnight Express, The Rock 'n' Roll Express and The Assassins have also been inducted as a group.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>individual</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the {{regiment}} {{had served as}} advisors with the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) since 1962, {{it was not until}} April 1965 that the government announced that a battalion would be deployed to Vietnam. Between June 1965 and March 1972 the units of {{the regiment}} would conduct sixteen rotations in Vietnam, with the first seven battalions completing two 12-month tours, while 8 and 9 RAR would each serve one. Consequently, following a period of hurried training and administration 1 RAR joined the US 173rd Airborne Brigade at Bien Hoa airbase outside of Saigon in June 1965. After initially defending the airbase, 1 RAR steadily increased the scope of its patrols. For example, in January 1966, 1 RAR assaulted a large Viet Cong headquarters complex in the Ho Bo Woods as a part of Operation Crimp; which the Americans hailed as the first strategic intelligence victory of the war. The battalion subsequently completed a 12 month-tour attached to US forces, during which it developed new tactics and techniques that later became standard for Australian battalions and supporting arms and services that would subsequently operate in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The census {{enumeration}} {{was carried}} out from 16 October to 15 November 2010 by 25,000 school leavers and 8,400 census supervisors deputed by the Census Statistical Office of Zambia. Civil servants from various government departments trained the enumerators. There were two forms: Form A, which had basic details like full name, sex, membership status, expected to be answered by senior members of each household; Form B which had details about <b>individual</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the family. When the respondent was a minor, proxy members having knowledge about the family were questioned. The details in form B were not sufficiently captured in the forms answered by the proxy members, most of whom did not have full information about all the family members. All buildings that were complete, incomplete, abandoned, habitable or inhabitable were accounted by the enumerators. Compared to the form used during 2000 census enumeration, there were additional details on death of household members, maternal deaths, albimism, orphanhood and fosterhood in the forms used in 2010. The enumeration was completed by 15 November 2010 for majority of the regions, while all the remaining {{regions of the country}} were completed by 30 November 2010. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the Central Statistical Office started processing the forms from April 2011. OMR and ICR technologies were used for data processing.|$|E
