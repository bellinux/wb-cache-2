She simply sits in the club with her band and sings for her small, mostly black and Latino audience. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes {{of people living in}} Harlem, doing their daily chores, including a supporting cast of transvestite prostitutes, a pimp, and a black gang member who shows off the scars on his body. During the intermediate verses, Madonna is shown writhing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> <b>of</b> an older, maternal woman, who symbolically baptizes her by splashing water on her forehead. Near the video's end, Madonna walks through the neighborhood and climbs a set of stairs to have a reunion with her family, a young Latin man and their supposed son. The video ends with Madonna smiling towards the camera while sitting at the nightclub.|$|E

500|$|Professor Ralph A.

[...] However, more recently, Martin Cherry warned against seeing the feud as {{the same as the}} later civil wars writ small; they were, he says, [...] "qualitatively" [...] different, resulting in the ultimate disintegration of the earl's affinity, rather than symptomatic of his violence. Michael Hicks has pointed out that although there were many other regional feuds at this time (including the Lisle-Berkeley dispute, also waged in the west country), they did not have the same causes, or were necessarily caused by weak government at all: for instance, whereas the Bonville–Courtenay feud had territorial domination at its root, others, such as the Berkeley–Lisle dispute, were begun over contested inheritances. Cherry has also suggested that the main cause of the Bonville–Courtenay dispute was the desperation of the earl to [...] "gain access to crown patronage for himself and his clients" [...] – something he was gradually failing to do in the face of competition.|$|E

500|$|Production {{started from}} December 5, 1994, at Universal Studios. When Shaffer arrived there, {{he found that}} his storyboards were glued on a giant {{blackboard}} along with the schedule for each shot. He also observed {{that many of his}} storyboard ideas had evolved, but they retained the core concepts. The preliminary shots used a Madonna body double and the singer arrived afterwards, proceeding with the shots in a water tank. Filming stopped for few hours when a minor earthquake shook the film studio. Few complications were encountered like Madonna getting dyed in blue color from sitting in the water tank, as well as technical difficulties leading to cancellation of a storyboard showing the singer opening her chest cavity. One shot involving Madonna laying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> <b>of</b> a skeleton had to be postponed since the skeleton was too small for the singer, and had to be rebuilt from scratch. The last scene filmed was the one involving the laboratory where Madonna was shown sleeping in a futuristic dress.

Tom Foden was the video's production designer and it was shot by cinematographer Harris Savides, on 35 mm film lens. Due to the vast number of digital effects required for the video, post-production lasted for weeks.

2500|$|In using circulars to knit flat {{pieces of}} fabric the two ends are used just as two {{separate}} needles would be.

[...] Using circular needles has some advantages, for example, the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed, therefore less taxing, on the arms and wrists of the knitter and, the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> <b>of</b> the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms.|$|E

2500|$|Andal {{is one of}} the best-loved poet-saints of the Tamils. Pious {{tradition}} {{holds her}} to be the incarnation of Bhūmi Devi (Sri Lakshmi as Mother Earth) to show humanity the way to Lord Vishnu's lotus feet. Representations of her next to Vishnu are present in all Srivaishnava temples. During the month of Margazhi, discourses on the Thiruppavai in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi take place all over India. The Andal Temple at Srivilliputhur consists of twin temples, one of which is dedicated to Andal. Most South Indian Vishnu temples have a separate shrine for Andal. There are a number of festivals dedicated to Andal, among the most notable being the Pavai Nonbu in the Tamil month of Margazhi (December – January), Andal Thirukalyanam in Panguni, Pagalpathu, Rapathu, Adi Thiruvizha, when Andal is depicted seated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> <b>of</b> Ranganathar. Andal is known for her unwavering devotion to god Vishnu, the God of the Srivaishnavas. [...] Adopted by her father, Periyalvar, Andal avoided earthly marriage, the normal and expected path for women of her culture, to marry Vishnu, both spiritually and physically. In many places in India, particularly in Tamil Nadu, Andal is treated more than a saint and as a form of god herself and a shrine for Andal is dedicated in most Vishnu temples.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Erotica" [...] was {{directed}} by fashion photographer Fabien Baron.

Shooting for the footage of Madonna singing the song, took place on August 22, 1992 at The Kitchen in New York City while shootings for Sex took place at Hotel Chelsea and Times Square's all-male burlesque Gaiety Theatre. In order to imitate the look of old home movies and stag films, the entire video was shot with super 8mm film. The video had its world premiere on MTV, on October 2, 1992. Upon its release, it was met with controversy; Susan Bibisi, from Los Angeles Daily News, called it a [...] "virtual advertisement" [...] for Sex".
