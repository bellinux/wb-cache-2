5|$|As the war ended, the Holt {{company was}} left with huge surplus <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> {{heavy-duty}} tractors ill-suited for the agricultural market, which had been dominated during the war by the Holt Company's primary competitor, C.L.Best. The company decided to focus instead on heavy construction equipment and sought {{to capitalize on the}} passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. Laden with debt and needing more capital to switch its product line, the company struggled to move forward.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{location}} {{in the middle of}} the trade network of the ancient world, the cultural and social landscape of the city was complex, as the inhabitants had to deal with traders and envoys who brought with them different customs from distant regions.

5|$|Halos arsenal {{consists}} of weapons from science fiction. The game has been praised for giving each weapon a unique purpose, thus making each useful in different scenarios. For example, plasma weapons {{need time to}} cool if fired too rapidly, but cannot be reloaded and must be discarded upon depletion of their batteries, whereas conventional firearms cannot overheat, but require reloading and ammunition. In contrast to the large weapon <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> contemporary FPS games, Halo players may carry only two weapons at once, calling for strategy when managing firearms.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X {{had been}} {{defined in the}} early 1960s as a system to defend US cities and {{industrial}} centers against a heavy Soviet attack during the 1970s. By 1965 the growing fleets of ICBMs in the <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> both the US and USSR were making the cost of such a system very expensive. NIE 11-8-63, published 18 October 1963, estimated the Soviets would have 400–700 ICBMs deployed by 1969, and their deployment eventually reached 1,601 launchers, limited by the SALT agreements.|$|E
5|$|The <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> both 1514 and 1546 also list {{several hundred}} heavy darts and lime pots that were {{designed}} to be thrown onto the deck of enemy ships from the fighting tops, although no physical evidence of either of these weapon types has been identified. Of the 50 handguns listed in the Anthony Roll, the complete stocks of five matchlock muskets and fragments of another eleven have been found.

5|$|Earlier, in April and May 1521, five Portuguese ships docked at Tuen Mun {{to begin}} trading, but {{were ordered to}} leave once {{officials}} came to the region to announce the emperor's death. The Portuguese refused this demand, so the Chinese sent a naval squadron to drive them out, sinking one ship, killing many, and taking the rest as prisoners (First Battle of Tamao). Two more Portuguese vessels arrived in June, were attacked by Chinese ships, but were able {{to fend off the}} Chinese attack. Three more Portuguese ships barely fended off another attack in September, the same month that Fernão Pires de Andrade and Tomé Pires arrived back at Canton. Ming authorities would not permit Fernão and Pires to see the prisoners captured in the sea battles and made <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> their goods and the goods captured from the Portuguese ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{avenues for}} {{research}} {{have been limited}} by many historical factors. Many archives were destroyed in bombing campaigns in the two world wars, and {{a great number of}} works for which records do exist are themselves lost or destroyed. The record-keeping in the region was inconsistent, and often the export of works by major artists was, owing to the pressures of commercial demand, not adequately recorded. The practice of signing and dating works was rare until the 1420s, and while the <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> collectors may have elaborately described the works, they attached little importance to recording the artist or workshop that produced them. Surviving documentation tends to come from inventories, wills, payment accounts, employment contracts and guild records and regulations.|$|E
5|$|The {{maker of}} the work is unknown; it is not signed or marked, and goldsmiths of the period rarely did this. There are a number of goldsmiths' names known from {{accounts}} and other records, but none of the few surviving works can be attached to a particular maker. Paris was the centre of production for the great numbers of joyaux, secular and religious, produced for the extended Valois royal family and other buyers. Berry and his brothers and nephews had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for what must have been a continuous flow of commissions, whose results are tersely catalogued in various <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> the period, but of which there are now only a handful of survivals. Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary, but this was made after 1401, which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry. Another possibility is that the reliquary was made and given as a gift, as many such pieces were, in between inventories.|$|E

5|$|Another {{concern of}} the chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm track}} brought Mireille {{west of the}} most {{populated}} island of Honshu, limiting damage there compared to Kyushu. At Misawa Air Base, the strong winds knocked over trees and blew off the roofs of several warehouses, and also knocked off storage sheds off their foundation. Ahead of the storm, advance warning allowed the American military to shelter aircraft and warn the population. Damage was estimated between $500,000$1.5million. Two of Mazda's loading docks in Hiroshima were completely destroyed, affecting American <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> 1992 Mazda 929's {{until the end of}} November 1991. Also in the city, 1.1million residents, or 80% of households, lost power due to winds and storm surge. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company was flooded with 0.6m (2ft) of waters, forcing workers to move to another plant in the United States. The strong winds and waves damaged the Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima and Kenroku-en northwest of Tokyo. In Okayama Prefecture, salt spray damaged railways and shut down lines for three days. High winds in Naka-ku collapsed scaffolding from a parking garage, and another damaged scaffolding nearby forced a road to shut down. There were extensive crop losses in northern Honshu. In Toyama Prefecture, the winds destroyed 192greenhouses and exasperated a fire that caused further crop damage.|$|E
5|$|Poorly {{developed}} handicraft {{and limited}} resources for metal working {{are characteristic of}} the communities of all early Slavic cultures. There were no major iron production centers, but metal founding techniques were known; among the metal objects occasionally found are iron knives and hooks, as well as bronze decorative items (as {{can be found in}} 7th-century finds in Haćki, Bielsk Podlaski County, a site of one of the earliest fortified settlements). The <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> the typical small open settlements also normally include various utensils made of stone, horn and clay (including weights used for weaving). The settlements were arranged as clusters of cabins along river or stream valleys, but above their flood levels, they were usually irregular and typically faced south. The wooden frame or pillar-supported square houses covered with a straw roof had each sides of 2.5 to 4.5 meters in length. Fertile lowlands were sought, but also forested areas with diversified plant and animal environment to provide additional sustenance. The settlements were self-sufficient; the early Slavs functioned without significant long-distance trade. Potter's wheels were used from the turn of the 7th century on. Some villages larger than a few homes have been discovered in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region from the 6th to 9th century, for example a complex of 11 settlements on the left bank of the Vistula in the direction of Igołomia. The original furnishings of Slavic huts are difficult to determine, because equipment was often made of perishable materials such as wood, leather or fabrics. Free- standing clay dome stoves for bread baking have been found on some locations. Another large 6th– to 9th-century settlement complex existed in the vicinity of Głogów in Silesia.|$|E
