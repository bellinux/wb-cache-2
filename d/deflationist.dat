40|$|Truth {{theories}} {{like the}} Friedman-Sheard's truth theory (FS) have two rules, T-in rule and T-out rule, about introduction and {{elimination of the}} truth predicate. They look like the introduction rule and the elimination rule of a logical connective. From the proof theoretic semantics viewpoint, one might think that the truth predicate is a logical connective which is governed by these two rules. From this proof theoretic semantics viewpoint, the nature of truth is like <b>deflationist's</b> nature of truth. Additionally {{one of the most}} important things is that the truth predicate does not disturb the traceability of the argument from the premises to a conclusion. However, a crucial problem has been known: any criteria to be a logical connective, known as a "harmony" of the introduction rule and the elimination rule, are not satisfied because of the ω-inconsistency of FS. Such ω-inconsistency is caused by the fact that the truth predicate enables us to define paradoxical formulae of seemingly infinite-length. These formulae can be regarded as coinductive objects in terms of computer science. The reason of the failure of the harmony is that these criteria are defined not for coinductively defined paradoxical formulae but for inductively defined formulae.

40|$|One of {{the main}} logical {{functions}} of the truth predicate is to enable us to express so-called `infi nite conjunctions'. Several authors claim that the truth predicate can serve this function {{only if it is}} fully disquotational (transparent), which leads to triviality in classical logic. As a consequence, many have concluded that classical logic should be rejected. The {{purpose of this paper is}} threefold. First, we consider two accounts available in the literature of what it means to express infi nite conjunctions with a truth predicate and argue that they fail to support the necessity of trans- parency for that purpose. Second, we show that, with the aid of some regimentation, many expressive functions of the truth predicate can actually be performed using truth principles that are consistent in classical logic. Finally, we suggest a reconceptualisation of deflationism, according to which the principles that govern the use of the truth predicate in natural language are largely irrelevant for the question of what formal theory of truth we should adopt.

40|$|ABSTRACT: One common {{criticism}} of deflationism {{is that it}} does not have the resources to explain defective discourse (e. g., vagueness, referential indeterminacy, confusion, etc.). This problem is especially pressing for someone like Robert Brandom, who not only endorses <b>deflationist</b> accounts of truth, reference, and predication, but also refuses to use representational relations to explain content and propositional attitudes. To address this problem, I suggest that Brandom should explain defective discourse in terms of what it is to treat some portion of discourse as defective. To illustrate this strategy, I present an extension of his theory of content and use it to provide an explanation of confusion. The result is a theory of confusion based on Joseph Camp’s recent treatment. The extension of Brandom’s theory of content involves additions to his account of scorekeeping that allow members of a discursive practice to accept different standards of inferential correctness. 0.

40|$|The {{main concern}} {{of this work}} is to {{understand}} and evaluate the debate between substantivism and deflationism {{in the theory of}} truth. According to substantive theories, truth consists in, and has to be explained in terms of, a special relation between the truth bearing item and reality. According to deflationism, such theories offer a needlessly inflated account of truth. Chapter one sketches a paradigmatic substantive theory of truth that explains the notion of truth by invoking the notions of representation and states of affairs. It says that for something to be true is for it to represent a state of affairs that obtains. Chapter two introduces physicalism, i. e., the thesis that everything there is can be explained in terms amenable to physics. For physicalism to be correct one of the following has to be the case: either the notion of representation (and the notion of a state of affairs) can be explained in physicalistic terms, or there simply are no representations (and no states of affairs). So if the relevant explanations are not to be had, the physicalist has to become an eliminativist with respect to representations (and states of affairs). Such an eliminative physicalism provides the major motivation for a <b>deflationist</b> attitude towards truth. It engenders the need to search for a <b>deflationist</b> ersatz-account of truth; an account that does not invoke substantive notions like representation. Chapter three develops the best, most prominent, and so far only serious candidate for a <b>deflationist</b> account: the thesis that truth is disquotation. Chapter four raises four grave problems for disquotationalism and discusses the costs of solving these problems. Chapter five concludes that the costs are too high. Disquotationalism is not an acceptable ersatz-theory of truth. As long as there is no other serious candidate for a <b>deflationist</b> account of truth that does not succumb to the same problems as disquotationalism, the substantive theory of truth has to be accepted. That means, if physicalism is to succeed it {{has to be able to}} provide explanations of substantive notions like representation. If no such explanations are to be had, it is more plausible to relinquish physicalism than to embrace deflationism with respect to truth...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of bivalence says that every item {{of a certain}} kind- every truth- bearer- is either true or false. A counterexample to bivalence should be a truth-bearer that is neither. Call such counterexamples to bivalence, if existing, genuine truth-value gaps. Timothy Williamson argues in his Vagueness (1994 : pp. 188 - 9) that the supposition of genuine cases of truth-value gaps is incoherent. Williamson's argument relies fundamentally on disquotational (or equivalence) schemas for truth and falsehood, and explores the inconsistency between holding the correctness of the schemas for truth and falsehood and supposing that there are genuine truth-value gaps. This inconsistency {{is a problem for}} <b>deflationists</b> not inclined to endorse bivalence: how can the meaning of the truth predicate be fully given in instances of a disquotational or equivalence schema, if some of such apparently legitimate instances entail contradictions? But if Williamson's argument stands strong, then there cannot be genuine truth-value gaps. Some recent proposals purport to avoid the inconsistency that results from the supposition of truth-value gaps. Thus, JC Beall (2002) proposes that deflationism is compatible with the existence of gaps, as long as we recognize the difference between two senses of negation: strong and weak. A slightly distinct proposal has been put forward by Mark Richard (2000), who argues that the supposition of truth-value gaps need not lead to contradictions, if we recognize the distinction between denying a sentence and asserting its negation.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyMany {{criticisms of}} the {{prevalent}} deflationary theories of truth stem from some misunderstanding. Clarification can be found from considering Quine's reasoning on the disquotational feature of the truth predicate. Quine's disquotationalism and Horwich's minimalism are similar theses {{with respect to the}} concept of truth, though the difference between the choices of the primary truth bearers and the divergence in their accounts of meaning and reference are striking. Chapter Two is devoted to making plain Quine's reasoning regarding the disquotational concept of truth, and to constructing a disquotational theory of truth. Also in this chapter, the topic of how to enhance the deductive power of this theory is discussed. The following chapter aims to square Quine's theses of inscrutability of reference and ontological relativity, with an account of the disquotational schema of reference. Whether or not a disquotational schema of reference and all its instances can be seen as providing a genuine reference scheme, as claimed by Horwich and most <b>deflationists,</b> is also discussed. In Chapter Four, after an introduction of Horwich's minimalist conception of truth, {{there are a number of}} issues considered, in particular Horwich’s use-theoretic account of meaning and compositionality, along with the divergence between his account of meaning and Quine's. The final chapter, Chapter Five, provides a thorough analysis of three important factors regarding the disquotational theory and the minimal theory of truth. Among them, the first factor discussed is what sort of equivalence relation occurs within each instance of the disquotational schema or each axiom of the equivalence schema. Following this, there is an analysis of in what way the disquotationalist and the minimalist can explain all general facts involving truth. The last factor involves considering the proper ascription of the disquotational or the minimal truth predicate. Along with the analysis of these three factors, the issue regarding which theory of truth is preferable is elaborated...|$|R
40|$|Ontology {{attempts}} {{to answer the}} question What is there? Trying to pursue this question, contemporary analytic philosophers argue over whether there are tables over and above parti-cles arranged tablewise, whether ordinary objects persist through time by having instantane-ous temporal parts and whether particles can compose both a lump and a distinct statue at the same time. The disputes are highly technical and contrived, yet ontologists carry on. But there is trouble in paradise. So-called ontological <b>deflationists</b> attempt to undermine the disputes by arguing that the disputes are insubstantial; they are not about the world, but rather about the correct use of language. Eli Hirsch is one of the philosophers who have challenged ontology, and his flavor of deflationism, quantifier variantism, says that there are many ontological languages with different answers to the ontological question. Ontologists merely disagree about which language to speak – they are engaged in a verbal dispute. Furthermore, ontology conducted in English (or any other natural language) is pointless, for the ontological beliefs of ordinary people – their beliefs in the existence of tables and chairs, statues and lumps – are trivially true. In sum: either ontologists speak different languages, in which case their ontolog-ical theses will merely reflect their linguistic choice, or they speak English, in which case any results will be trivial. In any case, ontology as we know it is undermined. This thesis explores Hirsch s view in more detail with the purpose of critically examin-ing his arguments. I provide two main lines of argument against Hirsch: (1) The idea of differ-ent ontological languages is more radical and problematic than it is usually assumed, poten-tially undercutting the philosophical significance of Hirsch s arguments; (2) Commonsensical ontological claims are not trivially true in English, and {{it might be possible to}} conduct ontolo-gy in English after all. I also consider a recent reply to Hirsch by Theodore Sider to the effect that ontologists should leave English for a dedicated ontological language. I show how this reply will rehabilitate ontology, but argue that it is not entirely successful.

40|$|How to {{understand}} Brentano’s account of truth {{is a question}} of some controversy. A number of different views have been put forward as positions that Brentano held at some stage in his career. The received view has it that the early Brentano subscribed to a form of correspondence theory which he later rejected in favor of a definition of truth in terms of correct judging, where the correctness of a judgment is defined in terms of the notion of self-evidence (see Kraus 1966, Szrednicki 1965, Stegmüller 1969, Kamitz 1983, Chrudzimski 2001). This fundamental shift in Brentano’s view is regarded as a change from an ontological to a “gnoseological”, i. e. epistemic, theory of truth (see Kastil 1934). Brentano’s mature view is sometimes said to resemble a neo-Kantian conception of truth or related views (see Kraus 1966, van der Schaar 1999, 2003), it has been compared with a coherence theory of truth (see Krantz 1990 / 91), and it is regarded as embracing a form of alethic anti-realism that places a substantial epistemic constraint on the concept of truth (see Künne 2003). More recently, Charles Parsons suggested that the early Brentano may also be regarded as a precursor of a <b>deflationist</b> theory of truth (see Parsons 2004). Following up on this proposal, the received view has been challenged by a new interpretation that ascribes to Brentano a <b>deflationist</b> position that he held throughout his career in combination with the view that truth pertains primarily to self-evident judgment (see Brandl forthcoming). Section 1 first summarizes the received view and then indicates two problems raised by this interpretation. Section 2 explains in which sense Brentano may have been a <b>deflationist</b> and how this interpretation avoids the problems of the received view...|$|E
40|$|I {{defend the}} {{correspondence}} theory of truth, {{according to which}} a statement’s truth consists in a relation of correspondence with extralinguistic fact. There are well-known objections to this view, which I consider and rebut, and also important rival accounts, principal among which are so-called <b>deflationist</b> theories and epistemic theories. Epistemic theories relate the concept of truth to our state of knowledge, but fail, I argue, to respect the crucial distinction between a criterion of truth {{and the meaning of}} truth: the view that one cannot do semantics, or metaphysics, without addressing epistemic issues is rejected by this work. Against epistemic theories, I illustrate how truth is independent of epistemic considerations. Deflationism is the more popular of the rival accounts and has gained considerable momentum over the past two decades. It is therefore dealt with in greater detail by this work. <b>Deflationist</b> theories exploit the paradigmatic ‘“Snow is white” is true iff snow is white’ biconditional to argue for an insubstantialist account, according to which truth is conservative with respect to non-semantical facts. On this view, truth’s raison d’être is merely to perform the useful expressive function of generalising over possibly infinite sets of assertions. Against <b>deflationist</b> theories, I claim that the work done by Jeffrey Ketland and Stewart Shapiro conclusively demonstrates how truth is informationally additive over non-semantic facts, while deflationism itself is also an excessively impoverishing theory, inadequate to the tasks it purports to accomplish. This work also defends the thesis that Alfred Tarski’s well-known theory of truth is an authentic correspondence theory. To say this is to say that the clauses of a Tarskian truth-definition can be interpreted in terms of a relation of correspondence that holds between true sentences and the states of affairs they describe. I provide a precise account of what the correspondence in question consists in, claiming that true sentences are homomorphic images of facts, i. e. a true sentence represents, in a form-preserving manner, the truth-making facts in it. This gives precise expression to Wittgenstein’s thesis that true sentences picture the world...|$|E
40|$|Philosophical enquiry on {{the notion}} of truth has {{traditionally}} involved the identification of a class of objects to which truth is ascribed. At the same time, formal investigations are often required when the notion of truth is at issue: semantic paradoxes force in fact philosophers to shape their arguments in a precise way. Objects of truth, in formal context, are always reduced to other, more manageable objects that mimic their structural properties such as numbers or sets. This form of reduction renders the distinction between linguistic or syntactic objects, to which truth is usually applied, and their mathematical counterparts opaque, at least {{from the point of view}} of the theory of truth. In informal metatheoretic discussion, in fact, they are clearly different entities. In this thesis we focus on an alternative way of constructing axiomatic theories of truth in which syntactic objects and mathematical objects belong to different universes. A brief introduction tries to situate the proposed theories in the context of different investigations on axiomatic truth. Chapter 2 is devoted to the discussion of historical and more theoretical motivations behind the proposed alternative. Chapter 3 will present the syntactic koinè spoken by our theories. Morphological categories of the object language and logical concepts concerning the object theory will be formalised in a recent axiomatisation of hereditarily finite sets. In Chapter 4 we finally introduce theories of truth with a built-in syntactic theory and examine some of their consequences. We briefly focus on disquotational truth, then consider compositional axioms for truth. Chapter 5 investigates a possible application of the setting just introduced: a realisation of the all-present interaction, in metamathematical practice, between informal metatheoretic claims and their (suitably chosen) coded counterparts. In the final chapter, after a brief characterisation of the key doctrines of the delflationary conception of truth, we evaluate the impact that the theories of truth studied in this work can have on the debate on the so-called conservativeness argument, which tries to match the alleged insubstantiality of the notion of truth, advocated by <b>deflationists,</b> with the deductive power of deflationary acceptable theories of truth.

40|$|Deflationists {{have argued}} that truth is an ontologically thin {{property}} which has only an expressive function to perform, that is, it makes possible to express semantic generalizations like ‘All the the-orems are true’, ‘Everything Peter said is true’, etc. Some of the deflationists have also argued that although truth is ontologically thin, it suffices in conjunctions with other facts not involving truth to explain all the facts about truth. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show that in the case of arith-metic, it is difficult to combine the expressive with the explanatory function of truth if the latter is understood in a <b>deflationist</b> way. We will make our point by investigating several logical sys-tems: first-order logic, full second-order logic, and existential second-order (! 1 1 –) logic. 1 <b>Deflationist</b> truth and conservativity Deflationism is a syndrome of related views which deny that truth is a sub-stantial or naturalist property with a hidden structure to be revealed by a sys-tematic investigation. Instead, deflationists proclaim either that to attribute truth is not to attribute a property at all (Field) or that it amounts to attribut-ing a logical property, that is, a metaphysically “thin ” property which is not ontologically committing, like the logical property expressed by the predicate “exist ” (Horwich). Much too often in the history of philosophy, the deflation-ists claim, truth has been unnecessarily inflated (by correspondence, coher-ence and pragmatic theories) because traditional truth-theorists have wanted it to perform explanatory functions it is not supposed to perform. The time has come to provide a theory of truth that is a theory of nothing else, but which is sufficient, in combination with theories of other phenomena, to explain all the facts about truth (Horwich, 1991, 26). Now the theory of truth that is “a theory of nothing else ” provided by the <b>deflationist</b> takes usually the form of infinite T-equivalences well known to u...|$|E
40|$|This paper argues {{against a}} broad {{category}} of <b>deflationist</b> theories of truth. It does so by asking two seemingly unrelated questions. The first {{is about the}} well-known logical and semantic paradoxes: Why is there no strengthened version of Russell’s paradox, {{as there is a}} strengthened version of the Liar paradox? Oddly, this question is rarely asked. It does have a fairly standard answer, which I shall not dispute for purposes of this paper. But I shall argue that asking it ultimately leads to a fundamental challenge to some popular versions of deflationism. The challenge comes about by pairing this question with a second question: What is the theory of truth about? For many theorists, there is an obvious answer to this question: the theory of truth is about truth bearers and what makes them true. But this answer appears to bring with it a commitment to a substantial notion of truth, which deflationists cannot bear. Deflationists might prefer a very different answer: the theory of truth is not really about anything. There is no substantial property of truth, so there is no domain which the theory of truth properly describes. Not all positions under the name ‘deflationism ’ subscribe to this view, but I shall argue that the important class of so-called minimalist views do. I shall argue that this sort of <b>deflationist</b> answer is untenable, and thus argue in broad strokes against minimalism. I shall argue by way of a comparison of the theory of truth with the theory of sets, and consideration of where paradoxes, especially strengthened versions of the paradoxes, may arise in each. This will bring the two seemingly unrelated questions together to form an antideflationist argument. I shall show that <b>deflationist</b> positions that accept the idea that truth is This is a revised and expanded version of my “Minimalism and Paradoxes ” Synthese 135 (2003) : 13 – 36.
