The region where the averaged phase shift between the north-south and the east-west components has some finite value appeared systematically around the auroral oval, indicating an existence of the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> component of comparable magnitude with the magnetic fluctuation generated by small-scale field-aligned currents. The low frequency waves (0. 125 - 0. 25 Hz) showed left-handed polarization (L-mode) and the amplitude was around 5 - 10 nT.

It was found that although existing sensors are inadequate in terms of resolution, dynamic range, and frequency range, they can be modified {{to make the necessary}} measurements. It is shown that since the sensor cannot be mounted on the shuttle itself because of high levels of magnetic noise, a free subsatellite that can be positioned and stabilized may be used for locating the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> sensor.

30|$|We {{consider}} that the westward drift is a manifestation of hydromagnetic process near {{the surface of the}} core, where the dipole field is dominant. From a nature of the drifting field, we assume that the surface layer of the core is rotating westwards as a whole. The uniform drift rate, one of the characteristic features of the drifting field, implies that the drift velocity is nondispersive. It has long been a matter of controversy whether the westward drift is due to a material flow or a <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> (Bullard et al. 1950; Hide 1966; Holme 2015). The uniform drift rate seems to favor the material flow, in which the field is generated and conveyed together. Because the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> is a dispersive wave in general, the wave velocity is highly dependent on harmonics. We assume here that the surface layer is rotating westwards, in which the sectorial type field is produced by interaction of fluid flow with the dipole field.|$|E
40|$|Whistler mode {{signals from}} the NAA {{transmitter}} (24 kHz) received at Faraday, Antarctica are processed to obtain the Doppler shift {{at a much higher}} time resolution than has previously been possible. This has allowed the observation of pulsations of about 13 mHz frequency which are believed to be associated with hydromagnetic waves in the magnetosphere. The pulsations are observed separately on signals with a number of discrete group delay features that can be interpreted as individual whistler ducts. Using the measured pulsation phase over the array of ducts the phase velocity and wave normal direction of the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> in the equatorial plane are estimated. The direction of propagation is consistent with a source on the dayside magnetopause. The association between whistler mode Doppler shifts and hydromagnetic waves has been reported before but not, as far as we are aware, using an experimental technique that allows measurements on individual ducts {{in order to determine the}} direction of propagation of the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave...</b>|$|E

An analysis is conducted of the coupled spatial and temporal evolution of upstream protons and <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> by means of a simple model in which the protons are represented by counterstreaming beams which resonate with <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves,</b> exciting the outward propagating modes and damping the inward propagating modes at a single wave number...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the propagation of}} <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> generated by a compact turbulent source in low ionized plasmas, applying the Lighthill theory. We assume the plasma to be isothermal, and adopt a uniform, stationary medium thread by ordered magnetic fields as an initial condition. Then, the distinct properties of the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> originating from a source oscillating with a fixed frequency are studied in the linear regime. As is well known, in low ionized plasmas, the generated waves dissipate due to ion–neutral damping. In this paper, the dependence of the dissipation rate on {{the frequency of the}} oscillating source is investigated. The larger the frequency becomes, the more substantial is the wave dissipation. Implications of our results on the energy source in molecular clouds are also discussed. Interestingly, since the outflow lobes associated with young stellar objects act as compact turbulent sources, <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> are generated by them. From our order-estimations, about 70 % of the energy of the outflow itself propagates as waves or turbulences, while the remaining 30 % dissipates and heats the neutrals via ion– neutral damping. Then, we confirm that the outflows are significant energy sources in molecular clouds {{in the context of the}} Lighthill theory...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} for the generation of upstream <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> by proton beams reflected at the earth's bow shock. It is assumed that the reflection process can produce some gyrophase bunching of the protons, thus creating a gyrophase disturbance that propagates with the beam as it streams back along interplanetary field lines. This leads {{to the production of}} driven <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> in the left-hand mode. The resulting theory predicts a wave amplitude, frequency, and polarization in the solar wind rest frame. The amplitude depends on the fraction of protons assumed to be phase coherent in their gyromotion and on the plasma beta, beam velocity, temperatures, and the Alfven Mach number. The theory also predicts the Doppler-shifted frequencies and the apparent sense of polarization that would be observed in satellite measurement frames...|$|R
