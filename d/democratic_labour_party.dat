5|$|At {{the age of}} twenty, {{he formed}} a workers' soviet in Echmiadzin. In 1915 Mikoyan {{formally}} joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (later known as the Bolshevik Party) and became {{a leader of the}} revolutionary movement in the Caucasus. His interactions with Soviet revolutionaries led him to Baku, where he became the co-editor for the Armenian-language newspaper Sotsyal-Demokrat and later for the Russian-language paper Izvestia Bakinskogo Soveta. During this time, he is said to have robbed a bank in Tiflis with TNT and had his nose broken in street fighting.|$|E
5|$|Editor Larssen and subeditor Solbakken both {{joined the}} Communist Party in 1923 and {{continued}} running the newspaper. As Olav Larssen {{was asked by}} the party to be the acting editor of Norges Kommunistblad in the winter of 1924–1925, Fredrik Monsen, Evald Solbakken, and Knut Olai Thornæs were acting editors between 1924 and 1925. Larssen eventually drifted away from the mainstream of the Communist Party. In late 1926 and early 1927 he voiced his opinion in columns that the Communist Party should contribute to the imminent merger of the Labour Party and the Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party.</b> A local party convention strongly rebuked this opinion. Larssen was thus replaced in January 1927 and left the Communist Party, and Solbakken soon followed suit. Fredrik Monsen left the party at the same time.|$|E
5|$|His exile over, in 1900 {{he moved}} to Western Europe, where he joined the {{editorial}} board of Iskra, the publication of the Marxist Russian Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (RSDLP). Iskras base was moved from Munich to London and then to Geneva, each time accompanied by Lenin. At the party's second congress, held in London in 1902, a major schism erupted between Lenin and his supporters (the Bolsheviks) and Julius Martov and his supporters (the Mensheviks); Lenin emphasised a strongly centralised party controlled largely by the leadership, whereas Martov accepted a wider party with more independence of thought. Lenin returned to Russia briefly during the Revolution of 1905, but fled again when the Tsarist authorities defeated the revolutionary forces and cracked down on dissent.|$|E

5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist {{politics}} following his brother's 1887 execution. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University {{for participating in}} protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist government, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, {{he was arrested for}} sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he later campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play {{a leading role in the}} October Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.|$|E
5|$|His exile over, Vladimir {{was banned}} from Saint Petersburg, instead {{settling}} in Pskov, {{a small town}} two hours' train ride from the capital, in February 1900. His wife, who had not served the entirety of her sentence, remained in exile in Ufa, where she fell ill. Intent on founding a newspaper, Vladimir and Struve raised money for the publication of Iskra (The Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist movement, now calling itself the Russian Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (RSDLP). After visiting his wife, on 29 July 1900, Vladimir left Russia for Western Europe. In Switzerland and Germany, he met with Axelrod, Plekhanov and Potresov, and lectured on the Russian situation. On 24 August 1900, a conference of Russian Marxists {{was held in the}} Swiss town of Corsier to discuss Iskra, but both Vladimir and Potresov were shocked at Plekhanov's controlling nature and antisemitism. It was agreed that the paper would be produced in Munich, where Vladimir moved in September 1900. The first issue was printed on Christmas Eve, and contained an article written by Vladimir decrying European intervention in the Boxer Rebellion. A second RSDLP publication, Zarya, appeared in March 1901, and would run for four issues, but Iskra was far more successful, being smuggled into Russia illegally, becoming the most successful Russian underground publication for 50 years. It contained contributions from such figures as the Polish Rosa Luxemburg, the Czech-German Karl Kautsky, and a young Ukrainian Marxist, Leon Trotsky, who became a regular contributor from the autumn of 1902.|$|E

25|$|In Western Europe, liberal {{parties have}} often cooperated with socialist and social {{democratic}} parties, {{as evidenced by}} the Purple Coalition in the Netherlands during the late 1990s and into the 21st century. The Purple Coalition, one of the most consequential in Dutch history, brought together the progressive left-liberal D66, the economic liberal and centre-right VVD, and the social <b>democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> – an unusual combination that ultimately legalised same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and prostitution while also instituting a non-enforcement policy on marijuana.|$|E

25|$|The {{opposition}} to {{the government in the}} Sixth Seimas was twofold: Homeland Union-Lithuanian Conservatives led the radical opposition, relentlessly criticizing the government, while the Social Democrats and the Centre Union formed the moderate opposition. During the term there were several cases of departures or expulsions from both the ruling political group of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> and the opposition political groups. However, due to the vast gulf between the ruling and opposition parties, there were few defections across ideological borders.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for the first federal elections, two Federation-wide parties were organised as confederations of local political parties. Both were organised by Jamaican politicians: the West Indies Federal Labour Party by Norman Manley, and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> by Alexander Bustamante. In broad terms, the WIFLP consisted of the urban-based parties throughout the Federation, while the DLP consisted of the rural-based parties. A small third party, the Federal Democratic Party was founded in November 1957 {{by a group of}} Trinidadians, although it did not win any seats.|$|E
25|$|The main {{challenger}} to {{the ruling}} Sąjūdis nationalist movement, which had controlled the Supreme Council since February 1990 and spearheaded the move to independence, was the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> of Lithuania (LDDP). In {{the run-up to the}} elections, Sąjūdis portrayed the opposing political groups as communist and reactionary, opposed to independence and democracy. The LDDP declared their commitment to maintaining foreign policy goals, including joining Council of Europe and agreements with other international organizations, while also promising friendlier relations and better trade with Russia.|$|E

25|$|After departing the PMDB in {{the early}} 1980s, Unger began looking for {{political}} agents who would serve as vehicles for his national alternative. In 1981, he jointed the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> of Brazil (PDT) led by Leonel Brizola, a former governor of Rio de Janeiro and a figure of the left prior to the dictatorship. Brizola had founded the PDT and Unger saw it as the authentic opposition to the military regime. Throughout the 1980s he worked with Brizola to travel the country recruiting members, and developing policy positions and a political language.|$|E
25|$|Nikolay Voronov {{was born}} on 5 May 1899 in Saint Petersburg to Nikolai Terentyvich Voronov, a clerk, and Valentina Voronov. After the Revolution of 1905, Voronov's father became {{unemployed}} due to his Russian Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> sympathies. On 30 November 1908, his poverty-stricken mother committed suicide by taking cyanide. Voronov dropped out of a private school in 1914 due to financial problems and in 1915 got a job working as a secretary for an attorney. In the fall of 1916, his father was drafted. In 1917, Voronov passed an external degree examination.|$|E
25|$|Fortuyn {{changed the}} Dutch {{political}} landscape and political culture. The 2002 elections, only weeks after Fortuyn's death, {{were marked by}} large losses for the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and especially the social <b>democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (whose parliamentary group was halved in size); both parties replaced their leaders shortly after their losses. The election winners were the Pim Fortuyn List, and the Christian democratic Christian Democratic Appeal. Some commentators think that Fortuyn's perceived martyrdom created greater support for the LPF, which seems likely given its quick later decline.|$|E

25|$|Although Lenin found ethnic anti-Semitism abhorrent, {{the regime}} was hostile toward Judaism from the beginning. In 1919 the Soviet {{authorities}} abolished Jewish community councils, which were traditionally responsible for maintaining synagogues. They created a special Jewish {{section of the}} party, whose tasks included propaganda against Jewish clergy and religion. To offset Jewish national and religious aspirations, and to reflect the Zionist heritage within the Jewish intelligentsia of the Russian Empire (for example, Trotsky was first {{a member of the}} Jewish Bund, not the Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party),</b> an alternative to the Land of Israel was established in 1934.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day of the term, 26 November 1992, the {{following}} parliamentary groups were registered: Christian Democrats, Sąjūdis, Citizen Charter, <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> of Lithuania, Social Democrats of Lithuania. While politically aligned, Christian Democrats, Sąjūdis and Citizen Charter formed three separate political groups in the Seimas in order to secure more seats in parliamentary committees. Nevertheless, the alignment fractured, as the Political Prisoners and Deportees and the Democratic Party left the political group of Christian Democrats, while only 23 of the 30 members of Sąjūdis and Citizen Charter joined the parliamentary group of Homeland Union-Lithuanian Conservatives.|$|E
25|$|According to {{an article}} by Fabíola Ortiz on March 25 on the online {{magazine}} Upside Down World, two small protests were organized in Brazil against the decision for military intervention in Libya. On March 18, during the visit of Barack Obama to Brazil, a protest of about 200 people from social movements, the Workers' Party, the Brazilian Communist Party and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> was held in Rio de Janeiro. The demonstration was peaceful until it reached the U.S. consulate, when two molotov cocktails were thrown (injuring the building's security guard).
