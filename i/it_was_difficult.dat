5|$|As a {{classical}} singer, Turunen sings with classical vocal technique. She explained {{that in the}} early days of Nightwish, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to combine classical technique with the metal sound in a way that gave her liberty of action without damaging her vocal cords. Classical techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.|$|E

5|$|Bristol lies {{on one of}} the UK's lesser coalfields, {{and from}} the 17th century collieries opened in Bristol, and what is now North Somerset and South Gloucestershire.

5|$|In 1906 72 {{percent of}} Christian Scientists in the United States were female, against 49 {{percent of the}} population. The church was {{attractive}} to women because it offered professional opportunities when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> for women to find work outside the home. As Christian Scientists they could become practitioners after just 12 lessons. Of the 14 practitioners listed in {{the first edition of}} the Christian Science Journal, 12 were women.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, much {{research}} {{focused on the}} abundances of iron-group elements in the Sun. Although significant research was done, until 1978 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to determine the abundances of some iron-group elements (e.g. cobalt and manganese) via spectrography because of their hyperfine structures.|$|E

5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations.

5|$|Judge Appleby {{eventually}} cut off {{funds for}} any further expert defense testimony. Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in Inadmissible Evidence, both claim that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to find expert witnesses for the trial, {{because of the}} expense and because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined {{on the grounds of}} a conflict of interest when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.|$|E
5|$|One of Chamberlin's {{challenges}} {{was working}} with the Australians. Their decentralized mode of planning was entirely different from the top-down approach used by GHQ, and Chamberlin found this a source of frustration, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to extract information from them. Nonetheless, he established a good working relationship with the Australian Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Frank Berryman.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the airframe was fairly conventional, with a semi-monocoque frame and multi-spar wing. The aircraft used a measure of magnesium and titanium in the fuselage, the latter limited largely to {{the area around the}} engines and to fasteners. Titanium was still expensive and not widely used because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to machine.|$|E
5|$|The working {{title was}} 24: Exile. The {{concept of the}} film started since the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which delayed the seventh season for a year thus leaving {{a gap in the}} series during 2008. Redemption was {{somewhat}} inspired by the Rwandan Genocide in 1994. The majority of Redemption was filmed on location outside Cape Town, South Africa since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to mimic an authentic African scenery in America.|$|E
5|$|Whilst nearly {{fifteen of}} the tenders {{remained}} wedded {{to their original}} locomotives, others received new partners - the very first tender to be manufactured swapped partners seven times. After the Second World War, when the streamlined tenders were de-streamlined, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to spot any mismatches. The most readily visible mismatches were those of locomotives Nos. 6249–6252 where pre-produced Type 'A' streamlined tenders were married to unstreamlined locomotives.|$|E

5|$|A {{remake of}} Conker's Bad Fur Day, titled , was {{ultimately}} released for the Xbox in 2005 to generally favourable critical reception. Developers noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to port {{the game to}} the Xbox system because Bad Fur Days microcoded performance optimisations had been deeply customised for the Nintendo 64 hardware. Conker: Live & Reloaded features updated graphics and a multiplayer mode that supports the Xbox Live service. Additionally, some aspects in the single-player mode were adjusted: several minor obscenities within the voice dialogue that {{are present in the}} Nintendo 64 game were censored at Microsoft's request, the camera control was refined and improved with a zoom function, and an auto-targeting system was added to the game.|$|E
5|$|After leaving False Bay on 1 July, Bounty set {{out across}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Tasmania. They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, {{but he did not}} attempt a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E
5|$|After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd {{had little}} {{influence}} over Ukraine. Khrushchev {{was elected to}} the worker's council (or soviet) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to keep them all straight.|$|E

5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E
5|$|Although Tyler's {{family was}} dear to him, during his {{political}} rise {{he was often}} {{away from home for}} extended periods. When Tyler chose not to seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 1821 because of illness, he nevertheless expressed concern as he anticipated the proper education his growing family. While in office <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to practice law being away in Washington part of the year, and his plantation was also more profitable when Tyler was available to manage it himself. By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he had resigned himself to spending part of the year away from his family. Still, he sought to remain close to his children through letters.|$|E
5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
