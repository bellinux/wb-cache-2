50|$|In 1015 {{and again}} in 1016 the Emir Mujahid al-'Āmirī of <b>Denya</b> (Latinized as Museto) from the taifa of Denia, in the east of Muslim Spain (al-Andalus), {{attacked}} Sardinia and attempted to establish control over it. The twelfth-century Pisan Liber maiolichinus, {{a history of the}} 1113-1115 Balearic Islands expedition, records that Mujāhid controlled all of the Sardinian coastal plain. The local Sardinian ruler, Salusio, the judge of Cagliari, was killed in the fighting and the organised resistance broke down. In both these years joint expeditions from the maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa repulsed the invaders and preserved Sardinia as a part of Christendom. These Pisan-Genoese expeditions to Sardinia were approved and supported by the Papacy, making them precursors of the Crusades, which began eighty years later. In 1022 new attempts were made by other Saracens, until in 1052 the people of Pisa, after long and bloody fighting in alliance with Genoa and Sardinian Giudicati, were able to drive them from the island.|$|E
5000|$|Denia (דֵּנְיָה; other spellings Danya, Dania, <b>Denya)</b> is a {{district}} of Haifa, Israel, located on Mount Carmel. Denia {{and its associated}} neighborhoods capture the southernmost part of Haifa's jurisdiction area, {{which is also the}} highest-elevated topographically, and make up the city's altogether most affluent and least densely populated residential borough, with a population count of slightly more than 11,000 in 2008. It lies approximately 5 kilometers in a beeline from downtown Haifa (whereas twisting roads due to intervening hills and wadis make actual distance bigger) and is crossed by Aba Hushi Avenue, which has made the district sometimes be referred to as the [...] "Aba Hushi Axis". It is bordered by Nesher to the east, Nave Sha'anan to northeast, Ahuza to the north, Tirat Carmel to the west and the Mount Carmel National Park, among which portions of Hof HaCarmel Regional Council are interspersed, to the south.

50|$|Yotam Ottolenghi {{was born}} in Jerusalem {{and grew up in}} Jerusalem's Ramat <b>Denya</b> neighbourhood. He has an older sister, Tirza Florentin and a late younger brother, Yiftach. His father was a {{chemistry}} teacher at the Hebrew University and his mother a teacher. As a child, he often spent his summers in Italy. His grandparents were Italian, and he and his family stayed with them in their house, in the hills outside Florence.He served in the IDF intelligence headquarters. He studied at Tel Aviv University before completing a master's degree in comparative literature. At this time he also worked on the news desk of Haaretz, one of Israel's largest daily papers. He moved to Amsterdam with his then-partner Noam Bar. By 1997 he had completed his master's degree in philosophy and comparative literature; his thesis was on the ontological status of the photographic image in aesthetic and analytic philosophy. During his time there, Ottolenghi edited the Hebrew pages of a Dutch-Jewish weekly, NIW. Later in 1997, he moved again, this time to the UK, planning to start a PhD but before he enrolled he signed up to train at Le Cordon Bleu cookery school in London for six months. He got a job as head pastry chef at the London boutique bakery Baker & Spice and this is where he met Sami Tamimi and Dan Lepard.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the second}} episode of season 9, it is shown {{that not all}} Humans in the Ori Home Galaxy believe their gods to be benevolent as {{is seen in the}} case of the Anti-Ori Underground. This group of humans live a {{dangerous}} life in hiding from purges and the fanatical followers. Their purpose is simply to collect enough evidence to prove to their brethren that the claims of the Ori are false. Despite this, they do believe that the Ori are very powerful; it is only their intentions they doubt. Even though the group lives in the shadows of Ori society, they have collected a number of artifacts that they have kept hidden, since such pieces of technology contradict the book of Origin and thus would be destroyed if discovered. The group also has a number of followers in high positions even within the City of the Gods. All known members of this movement [...] - [...] Harrid (played by Stephen Park), Sallis (April Amber Telek), Fannis (Paul Moniz de Sa), Seevis (Michael Ironside), and <b>Denya</b> (Daniella Evangelista) [...] - [...] die shortly after their introduction. Another member is introduced in Stargate: The Ark of Truth: Hertis (Chris Gauthier). Tomin somehow finds him and takes him to meet with Daniel and Vala in order to find the location of Ortus Malum where the team believes the Ark of Truth to be. He is somewhat suspicious of Daniel and Vala as they are unaware that the fires of Celestis are out (an indication that the Ori are dead) which should have spread very far. Apparently Tomin told him they were from far away but just not how far (another galaxy). In order to give him proof of their story, Daniel, Vala and Tomin take him to the Odyssey which is in orbit which is proof enough for him. He tells them what is believed to be the location: a mountain high above the Plains of Celestis on another planet. Presumably he is then returned to his home planet as he is not seen again.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{for using the}} Ghanaian lesser utilised hardwoods esa (Celtis mildbraedii), <b>denya</b> (Cylicodiscus gabunensis) and dahoma (Piptadeniastrum africana) for garden furniture and decking in the UK is investigated. Specific properties are examined using field and laboratory experiments against reference species; iroko (Milicia excelsa), African mahogany (Khaya ivorensis), teak (Tectona grandis) and European oak (Quercus robur). The effectiveness of decking and teak oil coatings at reducing weathering defects is described. With weathering colours of all species changed over the six month exposure period though the greatest rate of change is seen in iroko and oak. There {{is an increase in}} lightness (L* value) and greying (a* and b* values). Oil treatments delay the rate of colour change but do not prevent it. Oil treatments reduce checking during weathering which is worse in oak, esa and <b>denya.</b> Analysis of samples during outdoor exposure using FTIR show a loss in lignin at the surface, with the absorbance peak at (1505 cm) - 1 absent following 1 month for untreated samples and two months for oiled samples. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that teak and deck oil formed thin films on the surfaces of wood but do not coat vessel lumens. Following six months exposure a number of defects were apparent, including raised wood fibres, fungal colonisation and cell wall and pit checking. Defects are observed in coated and uncoated wood. Natural durability using the method described in BS EN 350 - 1 show <b>denya</b> to be very durable, dahoma moderately durable and esa not durable. Field exposure shows esa is liable to blue stain in service though no decay is detected in lap joints after nine months exposure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExamining {{what seems}} {{at first to}} be purely aspecto-temporal morphemes in Wolof (Niger-Congo, Atlantic group, Senegal), such as Present Perfect and Ongoing Present conjugations, or {{perfective}} and imperfective suffixes, this paper first brings to light the recurring polysemy of these and their modal values in particular. A thorough examination of their uses in discourse shows that the variation in meaning is quite similar in the different aspecto-temporal morphemes and can be expressed by the following rule: aspecto-temporal specifications yield a temporal expression with dynamic verbs (which is well known) and turn into modal specifications with stative verbs as in the following examples:(1) Present perfect with an action verblekk naa (ba noppi) eat PFT 1 sg (until stop) I have eaten (untill it is finished) (2) Present perfect with a stative verbAt {{the end of a}} discussion where the interlocutors disagree :tàng na !be-cold PFT 3 sg(but I tell you) it is hot !gloss : it is certain, there is no more discussion, there is nothing to be added(3) Perfective suffix () with a stative verbPicc bii moo mel ni ndobinbird this SUBJ. FOC ( =PERF) resemble like calaoThis bird looks (definitely) like a calao (4) Imperfective suffix with a stative verbPicc bii mooy mel ni ndobinbird this SUBJ. FOC+IMPERF resemble like calaoThis bird tends to look like a calaoMore precisely, with the stative verbs, the various aspecto-temporal morphemes in Wolof convey an attitude {{on the part of the}} speaker with regard to the certainty (perfective) vs uncertainty (imperfective) or to the completeness (perfective) vs uncompleteness (imperfective) of the process (it is really / not really P), which we may characterize respectively as epistemic and appreciative modality. Moreover, these epistemic values are also associated with regular argumentative effects (the discussion is over / I disagree / I agree / I am relieved / you should do something…) corresponding to what De Smet and Verstraete (2006) call « interpersonal subjectivity ». Thus, through discourse chaining, the same aspecto-temporal morphemes are also used to express various types of engagement on the part of the speaker. It is then argued that in the different uses of these aspecto-temporal morphemes, the same semantic structure is applied to different Aktionsarten producing various semantic effects, that is temporal vs. modal values. These various modal values (ranging from epistemicity to engagement and argumentation) are analysed here as by-products implied by the verb inflection’s aspectual meaning, Eventually, the emergence of these modal senses for aspectual morphemes is described through regular conditioning mechanisms involving Aktionsarten and clause chaining in discourse: the different argumentative effects of the Perfect can be described in terms of various positions of the interlocutors in relation to the process. Therefore the functioning of these Wolof aspectual morphemes shows a regular mechanism of subjectification that may grammaticalize (cf Bybee et al. 1994 : 74, Traugott 1995) but is also attested in synchrony (Abangma 1985, DeLancey 1997, De Wit et. al. 2013, Robert 1994, Thomas 1978, Wright 1994) and has been probably overlooked in other languages.
