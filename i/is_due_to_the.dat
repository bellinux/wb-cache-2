5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> satellites' low density and their surfaces lying {{close to the edge}} of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|All six Category5s in October and November {{reached their}} intensities {{in the western}} Caribbean, a region that Atlantic hurricanes {{strongly}} gravitate toward late in the season. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> climatology of the area, which sometimes has a high-altitude anticyclone that promotes rapid intensification late in the season, as well as warm waters.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra {{and the new}} field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.|$|E

30|$|It was {{estimated}} that the increase of the sound absorption coefficient in the low-frequency band range <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increased roughness of the internal pore wall.

5|$|Brane {{cosmology}} models, {{in which}} inflation <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movement of branes in string theory; the pre-Big Bang model; the ekpyrotic model, {{in which the}} Big Bang {{is the result of}} a collision between branes; and the cyclic model, a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Slum-dwellers {{comprise}} 32.6 {{per cent}} of the total population, {{much higher than the}} national average of 15.05 per cent. The increase in growth rate to 50 per cent from 1971 to 1981 <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's upgrade to a municipal corporation in 1974 and the subsequent inclusion of 13 Panchayats into the corporation limits. The decline in the population growth rate between 1981 and 2001 <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bifurcation of Madurai district into two, Madurai and Dindigul in 1984, and the subsequently of part of the city into the Theni district in 1997. The compounded annual growth rate dropped from 4.10 per cent during 1971–81 to 1.27 per cent during 1991–2004.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about {{the kingdom of the}} East Angles has survived.

5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that this <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Lexical {{differences}} between dialects are often considerable. This <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which {{had served as}} names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.|$|E
5|$|Lions are chiefly {{associated}} with Ishtar {{or with the}} male gods Shamash or Ningirsu. In Mesopotamian art, lions are nearly always depicted with open jaws. H.Frankfort suggests that The Burney Relief shows a modification of the normal canon that <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the lions are turned towards the worshipper: the lions might appear inappropriately threatening if their mouths were open.|$|E

50|$|From the 1870s {{the number}} of coopers in the Powder Mills declined. Some of this <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decline of {{production}} in the Ballincollig mills, but some <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of metal canisters to hold powder as the mills changed their production to sporting powders. Some of <b>the</b> decline <b>was</b> also <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> importation of barrels from Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, as machine cut staves were cheaper than those produced by the Ballincollig coopers.|$|R
40|$|A self-transferable plasmid of ca. 80 kb, pIP 1204, conferred multiple-antibiotic {{resistance}} to Klebsiella pneumoniae BM 4536, which was isolated from a urinary tract infection. Resistance <b>to</b> β-lactams <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blaTEM 1 and blaCTX-M genes, resistance <b>to</b> trimethroprim <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dhfrXII gene, resistance <b>to</b> sulfonamides <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sul 1 gene, resistance <b>to</b> streptomycin-spectinomycin <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ant 3 " 9 gene, and {{resistance to}} nearly all remaining aminoglycosides <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aac 3 -II gene and a new gene designated armA (aminoglycoside resistance methylase). The cloning of armA into a plasmid in Escherichia coli conferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new host high-level resistance to 4, 6 -disubstituted deoxystreptamines and fortimicin. The deduced sequence of ArmA displayed from 37 to 47 % similarity to those of 16 S rRNA m 7 G methyltransferases from various actinomycetes, which confer resistance to aminoglycoside-producing strains. However, the low guanine-plus-cytosine content of armA (30 %) does not favor an actinomycete origin for the gene. It therefore appears that posttranscriptional modification of 16 S rRNA can confer high-level broad-range resistance to aminoglycosides in gram-negative human pathogens...|$|R
5|$|Many {{classical}} {{philosophers and}} scientists, including Aristotle, considered the heart {{the seat of}} thought, reason, or emotion, often disregarding the brain as contributing to those functions.) |page=book 3, ch. 4. |nopp=y |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814220201/https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/parts/book3.html |archivedate=14 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }} The identification of the heart as the seat of emotions in particular <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Roman physician Galen, who also located {{the seat of the}} passions in the liver, and the seat of reason in the brain.|$|E

50|$|Patients with {{thalassemia}} gradually accumulate {{high levels}} of iron (Fe) in their bodies.

5|$|The Green is not {{perfectly}} rectangular, as {{its southern}} border along Wheelock Street runs {{slightly to the}} northeast rather than due east-west. This irregularity <b>is</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Town of Hanover's 1873 seizure of part of {{the southeast corner of}} the Green, which it used to straighten Wheelock Street.

The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 104.8 males.
