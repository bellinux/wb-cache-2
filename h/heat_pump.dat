5|$|Lord Kelvin {{invented the}} <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> in 1852, and Heinrich Zoelly had {{patented}} {{the idea of}} using it to draw heat from the ground in 1912. But {{it was not until the}} late 1940s that the geothermal <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> was successfully implemented. The earliest one was probably Robert C. Webber's home-made 2.2kW direct-exchange system, but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention. J. Donald Kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> to heat the Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon) and demonstrated it in 1946. Professor Carl Nielsen of Ohio State University built the first residential open loop version in his home in 1948. The technology became popular in Sweden as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. The 1979 development of polybutylene pipe greatly augmented the heat pump’s economic viability.|$|E

Energy-saving features include photovoltaic panels for electricity and ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> for heating. A green roof (a living roof that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium), is used to absorb rainfall and provide insulation. The centre is constructed using timber-frame walls insulated with straw bales.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus has {{increasingly}} been investing in environmental planning and, {{in accordance with}} national policy, aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of fossil fuels for heating by 2030. The municipal power plants were adapted for this purpose in the 2010s. In 2015, the municipality took over three private straw-fired heating plants and the year after, a new 77 MW {{combined heat and power}} biomass plant at Lisbjerg Power Station was completed while Studstrup Power Station finished a refit to move from coal to wood chips. In conjunction with the development of the Docklands district there are plans for a utility scale seawater <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the district heating system.|$|E
25|$|According to the US EPA, {{geothermal}} <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> {{can reduce}} energy consumption up to 44% compared with air-source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> {{and up to}} 72% compared with electric resistance heating. The COP for <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> range from 3.2 to 4.5 for air source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> to 4.2 to 5.2 for ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{in the basic}} division of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> Namely, it is focused on <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> for air-condition. It describes useful types of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> for both <b>heating</b> and refrigerating, explains their function and presents their advatages, disadvantages. The work also discusses adaptation of heating systems for adequate and effective utilization of this equipement. Finally, the work introduces particular representatives of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> for air-condition...|$|R
25|$|Air-air <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> that extract <b>heat</b> {{from outside}} air and {{transfer}} this heat to inside air, {{are the most}} common type of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> and the cheapest. These are similar to air conditioners operating in reverse. Air-water <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are otherwise similar to air-air <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit, floor heating being the most efficient, and they can also transfer heat into a domestic hot water tank for use in showers and hot water taps of the building. However, ground-water <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are more efficient than air-water <b>heat</b> <b>pumps,</b> and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems.|$|R
5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E
5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> can extract enough {{heat from}} shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
50|$|Air source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> {{can last}} for over 20 years with low {{maintenance}} requirements. There are numerous <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> from the 1970s and 1980s in the United States that are still in service in 2012, even in places where winters are extremely cold. Few moving parts reduce maintenance requirements. However, the outdoor heat exchanger and fan must be kept free from leaves and debris. <b>Heat</b> <b>pumps</b> have more moving parts than an equivalent electric resistance heater or fuel burning heater. Ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> have fewer moving parts than air source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> as {{they do not need}} fans or defrosting mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> The individual {{chapters of the}} theoretical part describe the principle parameters of evaluation used to allow comparison. <b>Heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are divided to individual systems, {{and there is a}} quite big part of the bachelor thesis which describes low-temperature resources that are necessary for <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> Claiming that occur in the theoretical part, then prove processed tables and have created charts in the chapter dealing with the economic evaluation. Primarily, the bachelor thesis deals with the evaluation of the cost of installing <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> To illustrate the issue there is also mentioned the economic comparison of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> and other fossil sources of heat...|$|R

The possibility to save non-renewable energy resources due to the combined <b>heat</b> <b>pumping</b> stations utilization instead of water heating boiler houses is shown in the paper. The calculation methodology for power efficiency for introduction of combined <b>heat</b> <b>pumping</b> stations has been developed. The seasonal heat needs depending on heating system temperature schedule, a low potential heat source temperature and regional weather parameters are taken into account in the calculations. </p...|$|R
25|$|Where {{the network}} has reached capacity, large {{individual}} load users can be decoupled from the hot feed pipe, say 80˚C and coupled to the return pipe, at e.g. 40˚C. By adding a <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> locally to this user, the 40˚C pipe is cooled further (the heat being delivered into the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> evaporator). The output from the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> is then a dedicated loop for the user at 40˚C to 70˚C. Therefore, the overall network capacity has changed as the total temperature difference of the loop has varied from 80–40˚C to 80˚C–x (x being a value lower than 40˚C).|$|E
25|$|Also, as the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> takes heat {{out of the}} air, some {{moisture}} in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. The system must periodically melt this ice; this defrosting translates into an additional energy (electricity) expenditure. When it is extremely cold outside, it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source (such as an electric resistance heater, oil furnace, or gas furnace) rather than to run an air-source <b>heat</b> <b>pump.</b> Also, avoiding {{the use of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine's compressor.|$|E
25|$|Applications of the Stirling engine {{range from}} {{heating and cooling}} to {{underwater}} power systems. A Stirling engine can function in reverse as a <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> for heating or cooling.

40|$|The {{decision}} of effective applying of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> {{should be based}} mainly on economic analysis, {{as well as on}} some additional information.

25|$|It is {{possible}} to use any type of solar thermal panel (sheet and tubes, roll-bond, heat pipe, thermal plates) or hybrid (mono/polycrystalline, thin film) {{in combination with the}} <b>heat</b> <b>pump.</b> The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows to cover a part of the electricity demand of the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> and reduce the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system.|$|E
25|$|In HVAC applications, a <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> is {{typically}} a vapor-compression refrigeration device {{that includes a}} reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of heat flow (thermal energy movement) may be reversed. The reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> may deliver either heating or cooling to a building. In cooler climates, the default setting of the reversing valve is heating.|$|E
40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{currently}} {{considered as one}} of the most promising means for meeting low energy consumption requirements in buildings. However conventional air source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> suffer from severe limitations in terms of performance at low ambient temperatures, while new designs such as multi-stage compression or ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> are still very costly. The main challenge is to improve on the air-source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> low efficiency in cold climates at a reasonable cost. The use of mixtures of refrigerants with the aim of increasing <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> performance (COP and/or heating capacity) by taking advantage of the thermal glide has been so far, little studied for the heating and cooling of buildings. In this paper, the goal is to assess the performance of refrigerant mixtures with thermal glide for cold climate air-source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps.</b> A simple theoretical and an extended model have been developed and used for refrigerant mixtures performance evaluation.

25|$|Air source {{heat pumps}} are {{relatively}} easy and inexpensive {{to install and}} have therefore historically been {{the most widely used}} <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> type. However, they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source. The higher temperature differential during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency. In mild weather, COP may be around 4.0, while at temperatures below around 0°C (32°F) an air-source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> may still achieve a COP of 2.5. The average COP over seasonal variation is typically 2.5-2.8, with exceptional models able to exceed this in mild climates.|$|E
25|$|Heat energy {{naturally}} transfers from warmer {{places to}} colder spaces. However, a <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> can reverse this process, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. Heat is not conserved {{in this process}} and requires some amount of external energy, such as electricity. In heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, the term <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> usually refers to vapor-compression refrigeration devices optimized for high efficiency in both directions of thermal energy transfer. These heat pumps can be reversible, and work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space.|$|E
