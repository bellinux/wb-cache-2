2500|$|Walter R. Hamilton {{was among}} those who {{completed}} the route. In his book The Yukon Story he describes the state of the trail thirty years after it was abandoned [...] "All evidence of the right-of-way and poles were gone, but in a few instances we found pieces of old telegraph wire imbedded several inches in the spruce, jack-pine and poplar trees that had long-since grown up and over the wires that touched them. [...] <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> of the old green glass insulators still attached to a galvanized wire. I kept it as a souvenir but lost it later with a camera and some clothing when a scow was nearly overturned on Lake Laberge." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> of {{the latter}} {{category}} among the accumulated arrears to which I have already referred.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. It was cut {{exactly the}} shape of Mr. Inglethorp's, and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> or two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep." ...|$|E
60|$|I parted from Lady Byron, feeling richer in that <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> <b>one</b> more pearl {{of great}} {{price on the}} shore of life.|$|R
5000|$|Insults {{have broken}} {{my heart and}} left me weak, I looked for sympathy but there was none; <b>I</b> <b>found</b> no <b>one</b> to comfort me (Psalm 69:20) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'May be so, sir. <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>one</b> already, by God's grace, and I'm much mistaken if I don't {{begin to}} see my way towards another.' ...|$|R
6000|$|PAGET. I am {{but of the}} laity, my Lord Bishop, And may {{not read}} your Bible, yet <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>One</b> day, a {{wholesome}} scripture, 'Little children, Love one another.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> {{within a}} block of the depot, and entering, I called for some coffee and muffins-- first, however, assuring myself that my train was not likely to leave for fully an hour.|$|E
60|$|And in {{the attic}} <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> day a very old {{forgotten}} map after the fashion of a bird's-eye view, representing the Crimea, that fascinated me and kept me for hours navigating its waters with a pin.|$|E
6000|$|KING. [...] You see {{so clearly}} How posterity will judge of me; {{yourself}} Shall teach it how I treated men so soon As <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> <b>one.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{told you}} that, like Diogenes, I went forth {{to seek a}} man. Did I not promise you, that when <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> <b>one</b> you {{should be the first}} to hear of him? And <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> a man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never, none. Now I {{begin to}} think that <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>one.</b> The thought is strange and warms me. Do you know also that when my eyes fell upon your face I loved you also, the gods know why. It was as though <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> <b>one</b> who was dear to me {{thousands}} of years ago but whom I had lost and forgotten. Perhaps this is but foolishness, or perhaps here we have the shadow of something great and beautiful which dwells elsewhere, in the place we call the Kingdom of Osiris, beyond the grave, Ana." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will go with}} you," [...] the Duchess decided. [...] "I {{should like}} to see Broomleys again. As a matter of fact, I meant to go there this morning, but <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> call enough for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I despise burglars!" [...] ejaculated Lady Julia, with a suddenness {{that stopped}} Jimmy's eloquence as if a tap {{had been turned}} off. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> coming after my jewels, and I had a pistol, I'd shoot him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shan't touch it. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> once, {{and took}} care of it, and the ungrateful thing flew away the minute it was well,' said Bessy, {{creeping}} under Kate's shawl, and putting her hands under her chin to warm them.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Asenath,’ said my mother, ‘in {{this sad}} {{end of my}} life <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>one</b> helper. Look upon him: it is Doctor Grierson. Be not, oh my daughter, be not ungrateful to that friend!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>found</b> no <b>one</b> {{to agree}} with me. He was not her brother, and though his tongue and all around her told her he was, her heart, that infallible guide, told her the truth. What more could any {{reasonable}} man ask? ...|$|R
60|$|TANNER. There! <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>one</b> man on {{my journey}} capable of {{reasonable}} conversation; {{and you all}} instinctively insult him. Even the New Man is as bad as any of you. Enry: you have behaved just like a miserable gentleman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I despise burglars!" [...] ejaculated Lady Blunt, with a suddenness which stopped Jimmy's eloquence as if a tap {{had been}} turned off. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> coming after my jewels and I had a gun handy, I'd shoot him. I would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Khadja," [...] the {{merchant}} said, [...] "this is the Christian slave I purchased today. You {{have for a}} long time desired one, but not until now have <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> who would, I thought, satisfy your expectations. What think you of him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Last in {{the pile}} of single-leaved devoirs, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> of several sheets, neatly written out and {{stitched}} together; I knew the hand, and scarcely needed {{the evidence of the}} signature [...] "Frances Evans Henri" [...] to confirm my conjecture as to the writer's identity.|$|E
6000|$|... "To not a soul!" [...] Guy answered. [...] "I {{was very}} dull in Vienna. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> no <b>one</b> who could speak English and my {{few words of}} German did me no good at all. I came on to Paris within a week." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, father, {{nothing of}} the sort. But there must be women {{somewhere in the world}} who are neither pink nor white, and I tell you, once for all, that I will never marry until <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>one</b> exactly to my taste.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{little while}} after I moved in here, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> that <b>one</b> old man could not fill {{the whole of}} this house, so I let the upper floors," [...] he explained, smilingly. [...] "Some day I must {{introduce}} you to my tenants, Mr. Hodder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A fine specimen,' {{said the}} Viscount at once, {{with the air}} of a connoisseur, by no means taken by surprise. 'They are not very uncommon; <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> myself about the same date in the justice-room. I dare say Mr. Calcott recollects the circumstance.' ...|$|E
60|$|Usually it is a {{cold day}} in July when you can stroll up Broadway in that month and get a story out of the drama. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> a few breathless, {{parboiling}} days ago, {{and it seems to}} decide a serious question in art.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gone. Scooted. Evaporated," [...] replied Ivan in humorous French. [...] "His hat {{and coat}} are gone, too, and I'll tell you {{something}} to cap it all. I ran outside the house to find any traces of him, and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one,</b> and a big trace, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|I moved away, cogitating, and at {{the same}} time keeping an eye out for any chance {{passenger}} in his right mind that might come along and give me some light. I judged <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> <b>one,</b> presently; so <b>I</b> drew him aside and said in his ear: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} were a rascal of that breed," [...] said the man. [...] "I've had the {{handling}} of one or two of you gentry before, and <b>I</b> never <b>found</b> <b>one</b> that could stand up to me for five minutes. Maybe you would like to try?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you served me cruelly enough until I thought <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> some <b>one</b> fairer than you. A blessed {{find for}} me, Eustacia." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{came out}} they were all gone. By good fortune <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> of the ship's rafts still lying on the deck. I {{gathered}} together such articles as might be of use and contrived, though how I do not know, to launch it into the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... “When I {{was denied}} {{by my own}} blood,” thought he; “these dearest friends {{received}} and cherished me. When I was a nameless orphan myself, and needed a protector, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> in yonder kind soul, who has gone to his account repenting of the innocent wrong he has done.” ...|$|E
60|$|Presently {{a shower}} came up, and this drove the {{passengers}} to {{the cars and}} the station. I got aboard the train at first {{to listen to what}} the train hands might have to say. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>one</b> of the brakemen quite a friendly fellow, and willing to talk.|$|E
60|$|Jovita. Miss Mary, <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> that <b>one</b> big vice {{in a man}} is apt to {{keep out}} a great many smaller ones.|$|R
60|$|In all Paris, <b>I</b> only <b>found</b> <b>one</b> {{place where}} tipping is {{absolutely}} {{out of the}} question. That was at the British Embassy. There they don't allow it. Not only the clerks and the secretaries, but even the Ambassador himself is forbidden to take {{so much as the}} smallest gratuity.|$|R
6000|$|He {{rose and}} {{put aside the}} book he had idly picked up. [...] "I am afraid I am an {{intentional}} intruder this time, Miss Nott. But <b>I</b> <b>found</b> no <b>one</b> here, and I was tempted to look into this ship-shape little snuggery. You see the temptation {{got the better of}} me." ...|$|R
