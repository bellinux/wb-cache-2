50|$|After {{the stadium}} opened in 1975, the last {{reconstruction}} was in 2000, when plastic seating and the light-emitting <b>diode</b> <b>board</b> were installed. In 2005 the stadium met all UEFA standards. Heating system, {{water supply and}} the sewage were replaced. The press center area was expanded to 54 sq.m., and the dispatcher room to 21 sq.m. 142 bulbs in the floodlight system with a total capacity of 1800 watts were installed. The grass was replaced and an automatic watering system installed. Installation of under soil heating of the pitch started on April 28, 2011. This system is only used in early Spring and late Autumn (Fall) to assist grass growth.|$|R
5000|$|The Marconi Transistorized Automatic Computer was Marconi Company's first computer, {{designed}} and manufactured from around 1959. They employed Germanium transistors which {{by this time}} were sufficiently reliable with room temperatures kept below about 23 degrees C. Apart from transistor failure other common faults included Power Supply capacitors 'drying out' resulting in excess ripple and poor connections on the computer input output highway. Paper tape peripherals had their own poor reliability influenced by degree of operator usage. The type S3301 was a 500 kHz clocked 20 bit word machine with two Mullard core memory stores providing 4k of 20 bit data, see Ref. 4. The internal CPU logic was synchronised to even and odd clock signals and special signals generated via the microinstruction <b>diode</b> <b>boards.</b> The memory logic had slow and fast loops to speed the transfer of sequential data bursts. Its microinstructions were programmed on <b>diode</b> <b>boards.</b> A facility was provided to microstep through instructions to help with fault finding. Processor status bits were provided with machine instructions being decoded from 6 bits in the current address memory word. Double word data had the MSB designated a sign bit coded as binary fractions ( [...] -1 to +1) for the square root, multiply and divide instructions. The instruction set had the usual functions based on three registers named A, B and D (C was the current address in memory register, M). An additional instruction assisted with checksum calculation for data transferred to and from main data stores (viz. Sperry Rand magnetic drums.).|$|R

50|$|The {{equipment}} {{under test}} must be monitored so that if the equipment fails under test, the failure is detected. Monitoring is typically performed with thermocouple sensors, vibration accelerometers, multimeters and data loggers. Common causes of failures during HALT are from weak product design, poor workmanship, and poor manufacturing. Failures to individual components such as resistors, capacitors, <b>diodes,</b> printed circuit <b>boards</b> occur because of these issues.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to Nortel's DMS-100 which uses individual line cards with a codec, most lines are on two-stage analog space-division concentrators or Line Units, which connect {{as many as}} 512 lines, as needed, to the 8 Channel cards that each contain 8 codecs, and to high-level service circuits for ringing and testing. Both stages of concentration are included on the same GDX (Gated <b>Diode</b> Access) <b>board.</b> Each GDX board serves 32 lines, 16 A links and 32 B links. Limited availability saves money with incompletely filled matrixes. The Line Unit can have up to 16 GDX boards connecting to the channel boards by shared B links, but in offices with heavier traffic for lines a lesser number of GDX boards are equipped.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{analysis}} of spacecraft failures {{during the period}} of 1990 - 2013 demonstrated clearly that electrostatic discharges caused more than 8 of all registered failures and anomalies, and comprised the most costly losses (25) for operating companies and agencies. The electrostatic discharges on spacecraft surfaces are the results of differential charging above some critical (threshold) voltages. The mechanisms of differential charging are well known, and various methods have been developed to prevent a generation of significant electric fields in areas of triple junctions. For example, low bus voltages in Low Earth Orbit plasma environment and slightly conducting layer over coverglass (ITO) in Geosynchronous Orbit surroundings are believed to be quite reliable measures to prevent discharges on respective surfaces. In most cases, the vulnerable elements of spacecraft (solar arrays, <b>diode</b> <b>boards,</b> etc.) go through comprehensive ground tests in vacuum chambers. However, tests articles contain the miniscule fragments of spacecraft components such as 10 - 30 solar cells of many thousands deployed on spacecraft in orbit. This is one reason why manufacturing defects may not be revealed in ground tests but expose themselves in arcing on array surface in space. The other reason for ineffectiveness of discharge preventive measures is aging of all materials in harsh orbital environments. The expected life time of modern spacecraft varies within the range of five-fifteen years, and thermal cycling, radiation damages, and mechanical stresses can result in surface erosion on conductive layers and microscopic cracks in coverglass sheets and adhesive films. These possible damages may cause significant increases in local electric field strengths and subsequent discharges. The primary discharges {{may or may not be}} detrimental to spacecraft operation, but they can produce the necessary conditions for sustained arcs initiation. Multiple measures were developed to prevent sustained discharges between adjacent strings, and many ground tests were performed to determine threshold parameters (voltage and current) for sustained arcs. And again, manufacturing defects and aging in space environments may result in considerable decrease of critical threshold parameters. This paper is devoted to the {{analysis of}} possible reasons behind arcing on spacecraft with low bus voltages...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Provision {{of traffic}} {{information}} to drivers around bottleneck by Light Emitting <b>Diode</b> (LED) information <b>board</b> has been expected {{as a new}} congestion antidote which will mitigate congestions in the normal sections of expressways with considerably low costs. It has already been reported that LED sign car may increase congested flow rate {{as the result of}} guiding drivers to accelerate their speeds during congestion. The study aims to verify the effect of LED information board to increase the bottleneck capacity during congestion as well as the maximum flow rate before congestion. As the result of the survey, it is shown that through provision of dynamic traffic information of congestion via LED information board will increase the congested flow rate at the bottleneck. However, it is difficult to show a clear increase of the maximum flow rate before congestion. Key Words: traffic congestion on interurban expressway, LED information board...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Communication {{technology}} has {{exploded in the}} past decade, leading {{to the question of}} what the best display method is to deliver electronic text message to public. Dynamic display system is widely used in information communicating medium which includes not only in website design, but also every part of our life such as banks, stock markets, transportation, schools, jewellery shops, restaurants etc. In order to overcome the limitations of screen size of the display units, numerous means of presenting moving materials on dynamic display have been invented. There are many factors that would affect the readability of electronic text. This paper reviews some related empirical studies concerning the various display methods of dynamic text presentation. The factors explored in this review are the text display type, character type, text display direction, and text/background colour-combination.

Global Service for Message (GSM) based LED Display Board is a model for dis-playing notices or messages at places that require real-time noticing, by sending messages {{in the form of}} Short Message Service (SMS) through mobile.

40|$|International audienceWe {{developed}} an integrated silicon detector to be {{embedded in a}} stratospheric balloon or a plane in order to investigate the radiative atmospheric environment. The key component of the detector is a commercial silicon diode from ORTEC in which incident protons from atmosphere interact. This leads to a charge collection on the electrodes due to the electric field in the diode (96 V). The active area of the diode is 4. 5 cm² and its thickness is 150 µm. We developed a specific electronic system to measure the energy deposition. The power management is on a dedicated board that has three direct-current-to-direct-current convertors that create four voltages from a 12 V battery to supply the electronic devices. There are also 32 three-volt lithium button cells that provide 96 V for the reverse bias of the <b>diode.</b> The experiment <b>board</b> contains the plug for the silicon diode in parallel with a test input, a preamplifier/shaper, a comparator, a peak detector, a microcontroller, and some peripherals. The charges coming from the silicon diode are converted into a voltage signal by the preamplifier/shaper. This voltage is then used to trigger the microcontroller on an event with the comparator that allows an adjustment of the detection threshold. The amplitude of the same voltage signal {{is measured by the}} Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) of the microcontroller {{with the help of a}} peak detector. The experiment also measures the temperature and stores the data. A Real Time Clock timestamps the events in order to calculate the event rate as a function of the particle fluxes. Our detector was calibrated with a Californium source, and it was fully characterized under neutron beams from 25 MeV up to 180 MeV. Differential detection cross sections for different neutron beam energies were shown to be in good agreement with simulations performed with the MC-Oracle code. We performed four stratospheric balloon flights (with ESA and CNES) and confirmed the correlation between the count rate and the altitude. Moreover, we observed that the radiative environment is not isotropic and demonstrated the potential of our tool for investigating the radiative atmospheric environment. These results are useful for estimating the particle flux that affects electronic devices and onboard aircraft systems...|$|R
