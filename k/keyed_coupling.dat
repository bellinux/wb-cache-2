Measurements of fuel mixture fraction are made for a non-premixed jet flame in a combustion chamber to assess the dynamics of mixing under imposed acoustic oscillations (22 – 55 Hz). Infrared laser absorption and phase resolved acetone-planar laser induced fluorescence are {{used to measure the}} fuel mixture fraction and then the degree of fuel/air mixing is calculated by determining the unmixedness. Results show acoustic excitation causes oscillations in the degree of fuel/air mixing at the driving frequency, which results in oscillatory flame behavior.

40|$|Palladium-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond {{formation}} {{is one of}} the most widely used reactions for the synthesis of biologically active substances. The DeShong group has demonstrated that hypervalent silicates can be employed for allyl-aryl carbon-carbon bond couplings in the presence of a Pd(0) catalyst. The goals of this dissertation are (1) to demonstrate application of palladium-catalyzed allylic-arylation coupling to the total synthesis of (+/-) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin and its analogues, and (2) to study the mechanism of allyl-aryl cross coupling reactions. In spite of the potent antitumor and antiviral activity of (+) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin, the use of this compound is limited in clinical applications because of its low natural abundance and lack of a practical scalable synthetic route. In order to test the feasibility of siloxane-based coupling in the synthesis of 7 -deoxypancratistatin, a simplified analogue of (+/-) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin was synthesized. The key reaction in the synthesis involved stereoselective construction of a carbon-carbon bond between A and C rings via coupling of an aryl siloxane with an allylic carbonate. While siloxane methodology was successfully applied to the synthesis of a (+/-) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin analogue, application of this methodology to the natural product (+/-) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin proved to be a significant challenge. To understand the causes of the failure of the coupling reaction, a detailed mechanistic study was undertaken. Hammett analysis of the allyl-aryl coupling reaction demonstrated that the rate of the coupling reaction was enhanced by electron-withdrawing groups on the aryl siloxane. The positive slope of the Hammett plot indicated a charged transition state in which negative charge on the aryl ring was stabilized inductively. Furthermore, this study provided useful information regarding the nature of ligands on the palladium. Based on this study, a new family of Pd(0) olefin catalysts was developed. These catalysts were found to be highly efficient and formed carbon-carbon bond even at ambient temperature. Novel Pd(0) olefin complexes were successfully employed in the synthesis of (+/-) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin. The <b>key</b> <b>coupling</b> reaction of allylic carbonate with aryl siloxane produced Hudlicky's intermediate, thus constituting formal total synthesis of the actual product. Though the reaction required higher catalytic loading and proceeded in moderate yields, the ability of the reaction to work at ambient temperature is advantageous for practical synthesis of the natural product.

The model has been developed based on a coupled thermal, hydraulic, chemical, and mechanical (THCM) formulation, and extended by the inclusion of geochemical processes under mixed equilibrium and kinetically controlled reactions in–between the solid, aqueous, and gas phases in soil. This has been achieved by coupling the transport model, COMPASS, with the geochemical model, PHREEQC. <b>Key</b> <b>coupling</b> between the geochemical modelling and the flow of chemicals has been established via the inclusion of porosity modification from mineral precipitation–dissolution reactions and the consequential effects on flow processes.

Good results have been achieved for the verification of the theoretical and numerical implementation of the new developments in the model.

40|$|Despite {{improved}} scientific {{insight into}} {{physical and social}} dynamics related to natural disasters, the financial cost of extreme events continues to rise. This paradox is particularly evident along developed coastlines, where future hazards are projected to intensify with consequences of climate change, and where the presence of valuable infrastructure exacerbates risk. By design, coastal hazard mitigation buffers human activities against the variability of natural phenomena such as storms. But hazard mitigation also sets up feedbacks between human and natural dynamics. This paper explores developed coastlines as exemplary coupled human–environmental systems in which hazard mitigation is the <b>key</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism. Results from a simplified numerical model of an agent-managed seawall illustrate the nonlinear effects that economic and physical thresholds can impart into coastal human–environmental system dynamics. The scale of mitigation action affects the time frame over which human activities and natural hazards interact. By accelerating environmental changes observable in some settings over human timescales of years to decades, climate change may temporarily strengthen the coupling between human and environmental dynamics. However, climate change could ultimately result in weaker coupling at those human timescales as mitigation actions increasingly engage global-scale systems...|$|R
