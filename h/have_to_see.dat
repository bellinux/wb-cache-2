5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner: The day-night cycle is {{haphazard}} and buildings float off the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E
5|$|With 17minutes remaining, a Birmingham chance arose when Murphy outpaced Dave Ewing. Goalkeeper Trautmann dived at {{the feet}} of Murphy to win the ball, but in the {{collision}} Murphy's right knee hit Trautmann's neck with a forceful blow. Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately. Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No substitutes were permitted, so Manchester City would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> out the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul felt certain that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put Roy Little in goal instead. However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in great pain, with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear the ball well upfield or into the stand whenever it came near. Trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny Brown and Murphy, the second causing him to recoil in agony due to a collision with Ewing, which required the trainer to revive him.|$|E

25|$|Alexandra Petrovna {{was deeply}} upset by her husband's infidelity. She was torn between her duties, the {{breaking}} up {{of her marriage}} {{and the death of}} her sister Catherine Petrovna in 1866. By 1870, nothing was left of her marriage except the bitterness. Alexandra found solace in her two sons and her charity work while her husband divided his time between his children with Alexandra and his second family. The couple's palace in St. Petersburg was so large that they did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> each other. Nicholas and Alexandra led separate lives, appearing together only in official ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|Elisabeth did {{not provide}} police with more details until they promised her {{that she would never}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her father again. Over the next two hours, she told the story of her 24 years in captivity. Elisabeth told the police that her father raped her and forced her to watch pornographic videos. To humiliate her, he made her reenact scenes from the videos with him in front of her children. Shortly after midnight, police {{officers}} completed the three pages of minutes of the interrogation. Josef Fritzl, aged 73, was arrested on 26 April 2008 on suspicion of serious crimes against family members.|$|E

25|$|White Spanish and Cuban criollos saw cabildos as a {{necessary}} evil. By the 18th century, these spaces of cultural autonomy and support began to worry slaves' white masters. Articles of the 1792 Bando de Buen Gobierno y Policia address the necessity of controlling the cabildos and their members. Neighbors often complained about the unpleasant noises made by the slaves as they sang and played African instruments. By the 19th century, cabildos were re-located outside {{the walls of the}} city of Havana so that whites would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> or hear their African celebrations. For the Afro-Cubans, this expulsion added a degree of privacy that they had previously lacked.|$|E
25|$|Rett is Deshwitat's {{best friend}} and {{fighting}} partner, both {{in the past and}} in the present. Rett led a party of men to attempt to stop Kalutika's rebirth into a God, but arrived too late. Because of their past friendship, Kalutika forced immortality on him so that Rett would have to witness the end of the world. Rett is a good natured and rowdy man who enjoys beer, women, and good living. He is often able to read Deshwitat's true feelings, no matter how much the vampire tries to conceal them. He is quite lecherous, particularly to Millenear, Remy and Beryun. He was also in love with Master Tae in her youth, but did not pursue the relationship because he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her grow old and die. Some refer to him as 'Hellrasier'.|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} of the old {{allotment}} system, Sweden's involvement in the Thirty Years' War and the Northern Wars did not have a very large impact on the population in general. The armies of Sweden under Gustavus Adolphus and later Charles X had relatively large success due to the superior tactics used, and foreign mercenaries comprised large parts of the armies. Gustavus Adolphus had, when he entered the Thirty Years' War, an army of 14,500 Swedish and Finnish conscripts and more than 20,000 enlisted foreigners, and deaths in the latter group did not affect the Swedish population. Charles XI's new allotment system did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> use in the first 20 years of its existence, which was also the longest time of peace Sweden had seen since its independence. Thus, the population continued to grow at a steady rate between 1620 and 1700.|$|E

25|$|Portugal and the Netherlands {{faced each}} other in the first semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo put the hosts in the lead from a corner kick midway through the first half, and just before the hour mark Maniche made it 2–0 for Portugal with a {{spectacular}} goal from the corner of the penalty area. An own goal from Jorge Andrade gave the Netherlands a glimmer of hope. Portugal came close to scoring a third goal that was only stopped by Wilfred Bouma's blocking attempt. The game ended 2–1 to Portugal and the hosts, after their opening day failure, were through to the final of their European Championship. The Czech Republic looked likely candidates to face the hosts in the final. They were favorites to take the trophy, having won all four games. However, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> off the upstart Greeks to do so. The Czechs had several chances, including a shot from Tomáš Rosický that struck the bar. The game remained goalless, until the dying moments {{of the first half of}} extra-time, when Traianos Dellas headed home the winner, the first and only silver goal in a European Championship.|$|E
