5|$|The FreeBSD Project {{is run by}} around 500 committers, or {{developers}} who have commit access to the master source code repositories and can develop, debug or enhance {{any part of the}} system. Most of the <b>developers</b> <b>are</b> volunteers and few <b>developers</b> <b>are</b> paid by some companies. There are several kinds of committers, including source committers (base operating system), doc committers (documentation and web site authors) and ports (third party application porting and infrastructure). Every two years the FreeBSD committers select a 9-member FreeBSD Core Team who are responsible for overall project direction, setting and enforcing project rules and approving new commiters, or the granting of SVN commit access. A number of responsibilities are officially assigned to other development teams by the FreeBSD Core Team, for example, responsibility for managing the ports collection is delegated to the Ports Management Team.|$|E
5|$|<b>Developers</b> <b>are</b> able {{to request}} Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings {{that are designed to}} manipulate the Steam storefront and other features. For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.|$|E
5|$|Internally, the company's <b>developers</b> <b>are</b> {{given much}} {{creative}} freedom. Uninvolved staff members can {{comment on the}} games' designs. Price considered game design a kind of social design, in which the team solve problems together. Price said trust {{is an essential part}} of a game's development, and that honest communications between staff members can ensure the correct direction of games. Price also said admitting mistakes can help maximize creativity, and that the company's leaders should be approachable by staff members.|$|E

5|$|Professional {{software}} <b>developers</b> <b>are</b> {{responsible for}} most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development. Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over port8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit digital signatures. While the client's graphical user interface (GUI) is open-source, the client is proprietary software citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.|$|E
5|$|The Kings County Association of Governments {{has plans}} to improve the state {{highways}} within the county. <b>Developers</b> <b>are</b> interested in building distribution warehouses in Kings County because of its strategic location midway between the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, but they are currently {{turned off by the}} lack of freeway access. For SR 198, the plan is to extend the freeway segment from Naval Air Station Lemoore to I-5. However, Kings County voters have shown little interest in passing any transportation taxes to fund these projects.|$|E
5|$|The Xbox Live {{service has}} been scaled up to use 300,000 servers for Xbox One users. Cloud storage is {{available}} to save music, films, games and saved content, and <b>developers</b> <b>are</b> able to use Live servers (along with the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform) to offer dynamic in-game content and other functionality. Users can have up to 1,000 friends. The December 2016 software update added the new social networking feature Clubs, which allows users to join groups focused on specific interests or games, and Looking for group (LFG), a system to help users locate players to join their party for multiplayer play.|$|E

5|$|Development for {{multiple}} platforms is profitable, but difficult. Optimizations needed for one platform architecture {{do not necessarily}} translate to others. Individual platforms such as the Sega Genesis and PlayStation 3 are seen as difficult to develop for compared to their competitors, and <b>developers</b> <b>are</b> not yet fully accustomed to new technologies such as multi-core processors and hyper-threading. Multi-platform releases are increasingly common, but not all differences between editions on multiple platforms can be fully explained by hardware alone, and there remain franchise stalwarts that exist solely on one system. Developers for new platforms such as handheld and mobile systems {{do not have to}} operate under the pressure of $20 million budgets and the scrutiny of publishers' marketing experts.|$|E
5|$|Zahran {{district}} in west Amman is {{the location of}} the Jordan Gate Towers, the first high-rise towers in the city. It is a high-class commercial and residential project currently under construction, close to the 6th Circle. The towers are one of the best known skyscrapers in the city. The southern tower will host a Hilton Hotel, while the northern tower will host offices. The towers are separated by a podium that is planned to become a mall. It also contains bars, swimming pools and conference halls. The <b>developers</b> <b>are</b> Bahrain's Gulf Finance House, the Kuwait Investment and Finance Company (KIFC). The project is expected to be opened by 2018.|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that, with the {{available}} data, {{it is not possible}} to measure the time during which the <b>developer</b> <b>was</b> actually writing patches.

25|$|Software {{development}} is a complex process, and <b>developers</b> <b>are</b> often uncertain {{how long it will}} take to complete any given project. Fixing errors in software, for example, can make up a significant portion of its development time, and <b>developers</b> <b>are</b> motivated not to release software with errors because it could damage their reputation with customers. Last-minute design changes are also common. Large organizations seem to have more late projects than smaller ones, and may benefit from hiring individual programmers on contract to write software than using in-house development teams. Adding people to a late software project does not help; according to Brooks' Law, doing so increases the delay.|$|E

25|$|The game {{development}} {{team has}} {{to select a}} profitable and suitable method to sell or earn money from the finished game. Traditionally, the game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store.

25|$|If {{building}} a bigger network {{is one reason}} to subsidize adoption, then stimulating value adding innovations is the other. Consider, for example, {{the value of an}} operating system with no applications. While Apple initially tried to charge both sides of the market, like Adobe did in figure 2, Microsoft uncovered a second pricing rule: subsidize those who add platform value. In this context, consumers, not <b>developers</b> <b>are</b> the money side.|$|E

The Amersham Hill area is noted for its large period properties and leafy streets.
