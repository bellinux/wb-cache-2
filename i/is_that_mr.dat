500|$|In 2011, Dr. Rogers {{said in his}} testimony: [...] "The {{theory that}} seems less {{reasonable}} to me <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Jackson woke up, and although he was {{under the influence of}} sedative medications, managed to give himself another dose." ...|$|E
500|$|Harriet Weaver {{was among}} the first to suggest that the dream was not that of any one dreamer, but was rather an {{analysis}} of the process of dreaming itself. In a letter to J.S. Atherton she wrote: [...] In particular their ascription of the whole thing to a dream of HCE seems to me nonsensical. My view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Joyce did not intend the book to be looked upon as the dream of any one character, but that he regarded the dream form with its shiftings and changes and chances as a convenient device, allowing the freest scope to introduce any material he wished—and suited to a night-piece. [...] Bernard Benstock also argued that [...] "The Dreamer in the Wake is more than just a single individual, even if one assumes that on the literal level we are viewing the dream of publican H.C. Earwicker." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after Bannister {{pronounced}} Hendrix dead, {{a hospital}} spokesperson told the press: [...] "We don't know where, how, or why he died, but {{he died of}} an overdose." [...] By that evening, many newspapers in London and New York had printed sensationalized headlines that exploited the death-from-overdose account. Hendrix's public relations manager, Les Perrin, granted an interview on Dutch radio soon after the hospital announcement. He commented: [...] "Well, all I know <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hendrix's body was taken to St. Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington, London, at 11:45 this morning, and he was certified to be dead on arrival." [...] At 2 p.m., BBC Radio 1 reported: [...] "Jimi Hendrix, regarded by millions {{as one of the}} most talented and original performers in modern rock music, is dead." [...] That evening, The New York Times described him as [...] "a genius black musician, a guitarist, singer and composer of brilliantly dramatic power. He spoke in gestures and big as he could imagine and create." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{second result}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Kinsolving quit {{the game with}} $2,000,000 prof--er--rake-off.|$|R
60|$|Then it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dean {{returned}} from New York, {{and came to}} make his report.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Grouse (voiced by John DiMaggio) - The elderly {{neighbor}} of the Loud family. In [...] "11 Louds a Leapin'", it <b>is</b> revealed <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Grouse tends to confiscate any {{items of the}} Loud siblings that end up on his property. Also, it <b>is</b> revealed <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Grouse has an extended family that he can barely {{pay a visit to}} due to financial difficulties. In some episodes, it <b>is</b> shown <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Grouse can take food bribes. In [...] "Lock N' Loud," [...] it <b>is</b> revealed <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Grouse <b>is</b> allergic to walnuts which causes his face to swell up.|$|R
2500|$|A {{newspaper}} in May 1892 reported, [...] "To-day, Mr. Kynnersley presided at the Third Court. Since {{the departure of}} Mr. Woodward, no official has been appointed to fill his place. The present arrangement <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bland sits {{in the morning and}} Mr. Hare in the afternoon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Demonstrators cursing the Americans ignore two realities. The {{cold war}} is over in Africa, and Ethiopia is no longer a focus of superpower rivalry. Otherwise it would have been unthinkable for four contending Marxist groups to turn to Washington for help. The other reality <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Cohen cannot undo at the conference table what has {{happened}} on the battlefield ...|$|E
2500|$|Mr Falkoff, {{representing}} Ahmad, continued: [...] "There is {{only one}} meaning that can be gleaned from this short passage," [...] the petition says. [...] "The government believes that Mr. Ahmad has information that it wants but that it cannot extract without torturing him." [...] The petition {{goes on to say}} that because torture is not allowed at Guantanamo, [...] "the recommendation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ahmad should be sent to another country where he can be interrogated under torture." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was greatly}} disturbed, and thought involuntarily of Comyn's words. Could it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Manners <b>was</b> {{forcing her to}} marry Chartersea? ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{an uncomfortable}} {{silence for a}} few seconds, and Carrie knew, dark as it now <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Annersly <b>was</b> furtively {{watching}} her.|$|R
60|$|Thus it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hudson nodded, {{when the}} young officer of the constabulary said that his {{indebtedness}} to Reuben was equal to his own.|$|R
2500|$|... "Our opinion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Travis has {{won more}} low gross, low net and open tourneys {{than any other}} living golfer. [...] He was {{practically}} unbeatable for a stretch of six years from 1898 to 1904 during which time he played in double or triple the number of events entered by either John Ball or Chick Evans. [...] A guess {{at the number of}} his trophies would place it over five hundred and perhaps nearer to a thousand. [...] In 1901, Travis was national champion and in 1915 he was again the Metropolitan champion. [...] His southern victories were numerous." ...|$|E
2500|$|C. P. Scott {{made the}} {{newspaper}} nationally recognised. He was editor for 57 years from 1872, and became its owner {{when he bought}} the paper from the estate of Taylor's son in 1907. Under Scott, the paper's moderate editorial line became more radical, supporting William Gladstone when the Liberals split in 1886, and opposing the Second Boer War against popular opinion. Scott supported the movement for women's suffrage, but was critical of any tactics by the Suffragettes that involved direct action: [...] "The really ludicrous position <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Lloyd George is fighting to enfranchise seven million women and the militants are smashing unoffending people's windows and breaking up benevolent societies' meetings in a desperate effort to prevent him." [...] Scott thought the Suffragettes' [...] "courage and devotion" [...] was [...] "worthy of a better cause and saner leadership". It {{has been argued that}} Scott's criticism reflected a widespread disdain, at the time, for those women who [...] "transgressed the gender expectations of Edwardian society".|$|E
2500|$|The family {{resided in}} Brentwood, a suburb south of Nashville, where Elson managed a vintage {{clothing}} store called Venus & Mars. Elson provided vocals on White's first solo record. [...] The couple announced {{their intention to}} divorce in June 2011, throwing [...] "a positive swing bang humdinger" [...] party to commemorate the split. On July 22, 2013, a Nashville judge barred White from having [...] "any contact with Karen Elson whatsoever except {{as it relates to}} parenting time with the parties' minor children." [...] A counter-motion was filed on August 2, 2013, stating that [...] "The reason for filing this response <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> White {{does not want to be}} portrayed as something he is not, violent toward his wife and children." [...] The divorce was finalized on November 26, 2013. Elson later recanted the charges, attributing the [...] "aggressive" [...] proceedings to her divorce attorneys, and saying [...] "those who gain of a marriage ending helped to create a downward spiral at my most vulnerable." [...] White agreed, saying, [...] "When shitty lawyers are in a situation like divorce, their goal is to villainize." [...] The former couple reportedly remain on good terms.|$|E
50|$|That {{the first}} {{headmaster}} {{of the college}} was Mr. Lomax is an outstanding revelation, outstanding because the general conception has always <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hyde-Johnson who held that position. Until 1954 when {{the first edition of}} the brief history of the college was written, the popular myth <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hyde-Johnson <b>was</b> the first principal of King’s College. Except for the few surviving foundation students, there was hardly any Old Boy who had ever heard of Mr. Lomax; this pioneer’s name was curiously sunk in obscurity.|$|R
60|$|Mr Grant {{could not}} very well explain what it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Kennedy meant {{if he did not}} mean that, so he turned to him for help.|$|R
60|$|The fact <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Lillie, having {{formerly}} {{set down}} this lovely Charlie {{on the list}} of her own adorers, had small sympathy with the sentimental romance of her friend.|$|R
60|$|The {{long and}} short of it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Mackenzie {{was the cause of}} George Allerton's death.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have an evil mind," [...] Philippa yawned, {{producing}} {{her cigarette}} case. [...] "What you really resent <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Lessingham sometimes forgets {{to talk about}} Dick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I mean <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Greystock is,--at least, I {{should think}} so from what I hear,--the very last {{man in the}} world to marry for money." ...|$|E
60|$|Here it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass {{were seated}} on the evening after the {{conclusion}} of the election, with several other temporary inmates of the house, smoking and drinking.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bale {{looked at}} him sharply. Carrie's letters were long and chatty; and it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bale had gleaned, from them, some notion of an idea <b>that</b> Carrie and <b>Mrs.</b> Harcourt had in their heads.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She has {{not said}} one word of complaint. Her grief and fear is only of being a burden on you. What brought me here <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Audley <b>was</b> anxious about her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Attached to {{the post}} is a princely salary and but one condition," [...] Monsieur de Founcelles said, {{watching}} the girl's face. [...] "The condition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ruff remains a bachelor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{there are}} several reasons. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hopkins--Mr. Erastus Hopkins, you know, is the other candidate, and a person must vote for either {{one or the other}} of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hartley?" [...] interrogated the General. [...] "Mr. Pendragon is of my opinion, it appears. He too {{suspects}} that Lady Vandeleur {{has something to}} do with your friend's silk hat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. At this period, Miss Eyrecourt and {{her mother}} were staying at Beaupark House. The general {{impression}} in the neighborhood <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Winterfield and Miss Eyrecourt were engaged to be married.|$|R
6000|$|... "That lady {{can take}} care of herself," [...] he said, and started off towards Leith, {{wondering}} how it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Flint had not confided his recent political troubles to his daughter.|$|R
6000|$|And now it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> George {{thought he}} would make his very cleverest speech. [...] "Sir," [...] he said, [...] "your Royal Highness's most kind {{proposal}} does me infinite honour, but----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} my opinion," [...] I replied, trying to speak slowly, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Farrar ought to get ten {{thousand}} dollars. And I {{think that would be}} only a moderate reward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{the natural}} {{extension}} of your inference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Corbeck {{is a liar}} and a fraud; {{and that he is}} in conspiracy with Miss Trelawny to deceive someone or other about those lamps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not till I've seen Europe!" [...] said Miss Stackpole. [...] "What are you {{laughing}} at?" [...] she went on. [...] "What I mean <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Goodwood {{came out in the}} steamer with me." ...|$|E
60|$|The answer, {{after some}} little {{hesitation}} and delay, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Armadale {{had gone away}} six days since. A second waiter added <b>that</b> <b>Mr.</b> Armadale's friend--Mr. Midwinter--had only left that morning. Where had Mr. Armadale gone? Somewhere into the country. Where had Mr. Midwinter gone? Nobody knew.|$|R
60|$|Another result <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mr</b> Webster, at Annie's earnest solicitation, {{agreed to}} make Covelly his summer {{quarters}} next year, instead of Ramsgate, and Mrs Boyns agreed to lodge the family in Coral Cottage.|$|R
50|$|The most {{remarkable}} {{thing about this}} glowing tribute <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Purefoy not only wrote it herself, but had the tablet erected in the church {{while she was still}} alive. She died in 1765.|$|R
