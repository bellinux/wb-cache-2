40|$|The use of {{finite element}} {{analysis}} (FEA) has grown to a more and more important method {{in the field of}} biomedical engineering and biomechanics. Although increased computational performance allows new ways to generate more complex biomechanical models, in the area of orthopaedic surgery, solid modelling of screws and drill holes represent a limitation of their use for individual cases and an increase of computational costs. To cope with these requirements, different methods for numerical screw modelling have therefore been investigated to improve its application diversity. Exemplarily, fixation was performed for stabilization of a large segmental femoral bone defect by an osteosynthesis plate. Three different numerical modelling techniques for implant fixation were used in this study, i. e. without screw modelling, screws as solid elements as well as screws as structural elements. The latter one offers the possibility to implement automatically <b>generated</b> <b>screws</b> with variable geometry on arbitrary FE models. Structural <b>screws</b> were parametrically <b>generated</b> by a Python script for the automatic generation in the FE-software Abaqus/CAE on both a tetrahedral and a hexahedral meshed femur. Accuracy of the FE models was confirmed by experimental testing using a composite femur with a segmental defect and an identical osteosynthesis plate for primary stabilisation with titanium screws. Both deflection of the femoral head and the gap alteration were measured with an optical measuring system with an accuracy of approximately 3 µm. For both screw modelling techniques a sufficient correlation of approximately 95 % between numerical and experimental analysis was found. Furthermore, using structural elements for screw modelling the computational time could be reduced by 85 % using hexahedral elements instead of tetrahedral elements for femur meshing. The automatically <b>generated</b> <b>screw</b> modelling offers a realistic simulation of the osteosynthesis fixation with screws in the adjacent bone stock and can be used for further investigations...|$|R

This intrinsic dissimilarity makes conventional plates and locking plates suited for use in different clinical scenarios [3, 18].

Inadequate preload can result in screw loosening, whilst fracture may occur if preload is excessive. These are the most commonly reported complications in implant-retained prostheses, and result in unscheduled, costly and time-consuming visits for {{the patient and the}} clinician. This study investigated changes in preload generation after repeated torque applications to gold and titanium screws. The test set-up consisted of an implant body, a cylindrical transmucosal abutment, and the test samples of gold and of titanium retaining screws. The implant bodies were anchored using a load cell, and the transmucosal abutments were attached using either gold or titanium retaining screws. A torque gauge was used to apply torque of 20 Ncm, 32 Ncm, and 40 Ncm to the retaining <b>screws.</b> The preloads <b>generated</b> in each <b>screw</b> type were compared at each torque setting, and after repeated tightening episodes. In addition, the effect of applying torque beyond the manufacturers’ recommendations was also examined. Gold retaining screws were found to achieve consistently higher preload values than titanium retaining screws. Preload values were not significantly different from the first to the tenth torque cycle. Titanium screws showed more consistent preload values, albeit lower than those of the gold screws. However due to possible galling of the internal thread of the implant body by titanium screws, gold screws remain the retaining screw of choice. Based on the findings of this study, gold retaining <b>screws</b> <b>generate</b> better preload than titanium. Torque beyond the manufacturers’ recommendations resulted in a more stable implant complex.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is present tools which support the {{top-down}} design process for assemblies by analyzing the locating scheme or constraint structure of assemblies in absence of detailed level part geometry. The top-down design process has received attention both in academia and industry. However, {{there have been few}} analytical tools to support it. The bottom-up approach supported by CAD systems is good for detailed level design of a single part. The representation and manipulation of assemblies involves structural and spatial relationships between individual parts at a higher level of abstraction than the representation of single parts. This thesis uses the Datum Flow Chain (DFC) for symbolic representation of mechanical assemblies and screw theory for representation of constraints between two parts. DFC captures the design intent by recording location scheme of assemblies. Screw theory can represent constraints in three dimensions. This thesis presents the design steps and corresponding analytical tools for a top-down design process in a logical progressive way. The approach of bottom-up process supported by CAD systems is compared all along the presentation. A method to <b>generate</b> the <b>screw</b> theory representation of relative constraints between two arbitrary contacting surfaces is presented first. A procedure has been outlined to <b>generate</b> the <b>screw</b> representation of an assembly feature constructed by several contacting surface pairs. These tools can be used to construct screw theory representation of an arbitrarily complex assembly feature. A method of finding the constraint properties of assemblies, which uses screw theory, is presented next. The method of motion analysis can find under-constraints for all assemblies. This can be used for analysis of instantaneous kinematics of a general mechanism as well. Finding over-constraints in an assembly is a separate problem and it requires different procedure of analysis than motion analysis. This thesis presents a method of finding over-constraints of assemblies. Quantitative information about over-constraint of all assemblies may not be found in cross-coupled assemblies. Motion and constraint analyses can help assembly designers in evaluating the nominal design. A method to calculate the sensitivity of the location of a part due to variation in the location of an assembly feature is presented next. This method uses the screw theory representation of constraints and information about location of assembly features. Clearance is introduced on bi-directional assembly features to reduce the probability of interference but it introduces uncertainty in the location of parts. A method is proposed to analyze uncertainty in the location of parts due to clearance on the size dimensions of assembly features. These analysis tools can be used to check robustness of the nominal design. A classification of assemblies based upon constraint properties is presented next. This classification relates properties of constraint structure of assemblies to design context. Finally, this thesis lays out a coherent scheme of design steps forming a procedure for designing mechanical assemblies in a top-down fashion. by Gaurav Shukla. Thesis (S. M.)

Hence, the molecular-level understanding of ice crystal surfaces holds the key to unlocking the secrets {{of a number of}} fields. In this study we demonstrate, by laser confocal microscopy combined with differential interference contrast microscopy, that elementary steps (the growing ends of ubiquitous molecular layers with the minimum height) of ice crystals and their dynamic behavior can be visualized directly at air-ice interfaces. We observed the appearance and lateral growth of two-dimensional (2 D) islands on ice crystal surfaces. When the steps of neighboring 2 D islands coalesced, the contrast of the steps always disappeared completely. We were able to discount the occurrence of steps too small to detect directly because we never observed the associated phenomena that would indicate their presence. In addition, classical 2 D nucleation theory does not support the appearance of multi-layered 2 D islands. Hence, we concluded that 2 D islands with elementary height (0. 37 and 0. 39 nm on basal and prism faces, respectively) were visualized by our optical microscopy. On basal and prism faces, we also observed the spiral growth steps <b>generated</b> by <b>screw</b> dislocations.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} {{the requirements for}} sta-ble control of simple devices that consist of a permanent magnet rigidly attached to a screw operating in soft tissue. Placing these devices in a rotating magnetic field causes the device’s permanent magnet to rotate synchronously with the applied field, making the attached <b>screw</b> <b>generate</b> forward propulsion. Although there has been significant {{research in the area}} of magnetic screws, this paper describes magnetic phenomena that have not been addressed in prior work, yet will be critical in the design of future steering and control strategies for medical applications. Using a time-averaged model of magnetic torque, we analyze the magnetic torque present when intentionally steering the screw or due to naturally occurring disturbances in the screw’s heading. We predict and experimentally demonstrate the existence of magnetic torques that simultaneously act to stabilize and destabilize magnetic screws operating in tissue. We find that there exists an applied field rotation speed, above which screws may become unstable, and we find that the interaction between the stabilizing and destabilizing magnetic torques may cause potentially undesired but predictable behavior while steering.

These species were formed from the reaction of chiral pyridine and quinoline containing ligands and metal ions. The combination of traditional coordination chemistry and supramolecular interactions led to a range of polymeric and network structures being formed. The ligands used in this thesis can be divided into two broad categories: alkaloids and ligands derived from them, and amino acid-based ligands. In the first category three new ligands were synthesized, and a variety of routes towards alkaloid-based homochiral ligands were investigated. The second category focused on three ligand motifs, and resulted in the preparation of 16 ligands. These two categories of ligands were reacted with a range of metal salts to investigate their coordination and supramolecular chemistry. The structure of twenty complexes was determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The complexes had a range of structures, with discrete and polymeric species being formed. Hydrogen bonding was an important feature in the supramolecular chemistry of the complexes, playing a different role in different series of complexes.

The first phase was aimed at {{the investigation of the}} effects of the in-plane behavior of timber diaphragms on the global seismic response of URM buildings. The second phase was dedicated to the assessment and retrofit of timber floors, with particular attention to the out-of-plane behavior. A study on the equivalent frame method, which is a more and more appreciated masonry modeling technique, is presented. Both as-built and strengthened timber floors were addressed. In order to understand the influence of the masonry modeling method on the seismic response of URM structures when flexible diaphragms are concerned, a simplified elastic no tension method was proposed. Such method is able to describe the characteristic nonlinear behavior of masonry (due to extremely low tensile strength) by means of a series of linear analyses based on a Rankine failure criterion. An in-situ testing campaign on full-scale 100 year old timber diaphragms is presented. Both mechanical and dynamic in-plane properties of wood diaphragms were investigated. Cyclic and snap back tests were carried out thanks to an innovative ad hoc loading system, developed by means of wire ropes and steel pulleys. The loading system was designed to reproduce a realistic inertial load distribution and to be lightweight, versatile and easily relocatable from one diaphragm section to the next. The effect of different refurbishment techniques was also probed during the experimental campaign. The outcomes of a testing campaign regarding out-of-plane refurbishment techniques of existing timber floors by means of timber to timber composite structures are described. A numerical model based on the theory of composite beams with incomplete interaction, was calibrated to take into account the real load distribution and connector spacing. An original procedure to camber timber beams by employing the compression pressure <b>generated</b> by <b>screw</b> fasteners is presented. The camber deflection is attained by superposing a timber reinforcement element on top of a beam and then connecting the two elements by means of screws inserted at 45 ° to the beam axis. Such method which is currently patent pending, was validated using data obtained from experimental testing. A mathematical formulation was also developed to describe the cambering procedure. A specific experimental campaign was therefore performed to precisely evaluate the amount of pressure that each screw is capable of yielding.

40|$|Background: Internal {{fixation}} with dynamic hip screw {{is a choice}} of treatment for hip fractures to stabilize a femoral fracture. Choosing the proper implant and its material has a great effect on the healing process and failure prevention. The purpose of this analysis was to assess biomechanical behavior of dynamic hip screw with two different materials implanted in the femur during fall and gait. Methods: A 3 D finite element model of an intact femur and a 3 D implant within the same femur were developed. A finite element analysis was carried out to establish the effect of load conditions and implant material properties on biomechanical behavior of the dynamic hip screw after internal fixation. Two load configurations are chosen: one simulating the stance phase of the normal gait cycle, and the other replicating a low-energy fall. The implanted femur was investigated with two different materials for the dynamic hip screw: stainless steel and titanium alloy. Results: During stance, more stress {{is placed on the}} implanted femur compared with the intact femur. During a fall, the implanted femur is in a greater state of stress, which mostly occurs inside the dynamic hip screw. Titanium alloy decreases stress levels by an average of 40 % compared with stainless steel. However, deformation is slightly reduced with a stainless steel dynamic hip screw during both load cases. Conclusions: After internal fixation, dynamic hip <b>screw</b> <b>generates</b> greater stresses within the implanted femur compared with the intact femur under the same loading conditions.

The deviation functions used in this research are composed of the Bezier curves. The partially overlapped three-segment third-order Bezier curve-based deviation function is proposed to achieve the goal of minimizing the blowhole area along with shorter interlobe sealing line length. The complication of combining curves as the generating curves and determining values of parameters of those curves are problems for the rotor profile designs of twin screw compressors in industry.

Moreover, the effects of the lead non-uniformity of the twin screw compressor are investigated and the results are compared to the twin screw compressor with constant lead in this research.

The mechanical node that is created between the plate and the locking-head <b>screws</b> <b>generates</b> a real internal fixator that does not require, for the stability of the system, a friction between the plate and the bone. In this type of implants the plate acts as a bridging system and the transfer of loads between the fracture fragments is ensured by angular stability. Stainless steel remains the most commonly used material in veterinary orthopedics. Recently, titanium alloy systems have been introduced for the greater biocompatibility and the lower rate of infection correlated with its use. Several fixed-angle titanium made systems are now available for veterinary use. Each implant is characterized by a different locking system and design that affect its mechanical properties. In literature, few biomechanical information are available on the new locking implants in general and particularly on the PAX-S plates. To our knowledge no information regarding PAX-R and VetLOX plates’ properties has been published yet. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the biomechanical properties of three listed above implants to a single cycle to failure in bending and to report outcomes and complications of dog and cat fractures treated with the PAX system. Qualitative comparison of our results with previously published data suggests that the PAX-S plate seems to have a higher bending stiffness while the bending strength data showed similar trends to the findings of other studies. Our retrospective study included 85 animals. Overall complications occurred in 23 cases and plate failure occurred in 9 cases. Statistically significant factors that affected healing time were age and fracture type. Those associated with complications were implant type and screw number...|$|R
