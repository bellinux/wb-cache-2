500|$|Jared Leto as Nemo Nobody, both 34- and 118-year-old. Nemo is a Latin {{word meaning}} [...] "nobody". The name Nemo alludes to Captain Nemo, the main {{character}} of Jules Verne's novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. It is the false name that Odysseus in Homer's poem Odyssey gives to the cyclops Polyphemus, to deceive him and save his own life. Van Dormael said that Leto was chosen because he is [...] "an actor who could transform himself, as much physically as vocally, rhythmically, his breathing." [...] Leto described his role saying, [...] "Mr. Nobody <b>is</b> <b>everyone</b> and no one {{all at the same}} time, an illusion, the product of his own dreams. He's love, he's hope, he's fear, he's life and he's death. This is without doubt the most complex character I've ever played. It was a challenge to keep all these lives concentrated into one character {{for the duration of the}} filming without losing myself. But we had outlines and things that helped me to keep track of where we were." [...] Actor Toby Regbo portrays Nemo at fifteen and Thomas Byrne Nemo at nine.|$|E

As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that [...] "we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to act like it was cold when it was warm. For hours and hours. You would never know it by looking at us. Isn't that crazy?" [...] Flannery also wrote, [...] "I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter." [...] In her memoir <b>Is</b> <b>Everyone</b> Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a [...] "very nice" [...] person, disagreed on a story point {{to the extent that}} Daniels told her that if [...] "you [...] going to resist what I'm doing here, you can just go home."

When it comes to video games, style is important, but {{substance}} that is paramount when it comes to rating a title. And while Xtreme Sports offers a distinct experience in the way it combines a number of different events into a single track, it doesn't focus enough on the gameplay of the individual sports to make the whole package compelling." [...] GameSpot noted, [...] "If you're expecting six perfect games wrapped up in one title, you'll only find disappointment. However, if you're in the mood for a game where each event is reasonably well designed and integrated into a greater, meatier whole, then Infogrames' Xtreme Sports should prove satisfying." [...] IGN stated, [...] "Certainly not the greatest game to ever slide down the pipe, Xtreme Sports is still not without some charm. Yes, it could have been better had a couple of the events been tightened up in the gameplay department, and yeah, it would have made a lot more sense had the characters been more diverse from one another (Is it me, or <b>is</b> <b>EVERYONE</b> five foot nine?), but I guess that's what sequels are for.

2500|$|Miller was {{determined}} the production {{not become a}} farce, and in that vein, two keys texts were Lawrence Stone's The Family, Sex and Marriage in England: 1500-1800 and Michael Walzer's The Revolution of the Saints, which he used to help ground his interpretation in recognisably Renaissance-esque societal terms; Petruchio's actions are based on accepted economic, social and religious views of the time, as are Baptista's. In tandem with this interpretation, the song sung {{at the end of}} the play is a musical version of Psalm 128 ("Blessed <b>is</b> <b>everyone</b> that feareth the Lord"), which was often sung in Puritan households at the end of a meal during Shakespeare's own day, and which praised a peaceful family life. Speaking of the addition of the psalm, Miller states [...] "I had to give [...] an explicitly religious format, so people could see it as not just simply the high-jinks of an intolerantly selfish man who was simply destroying a woman to satisfy his own vanity, but a sacramental view of the nature of marriage, whereby this couple had come to love each other by reconciling themselves to the demands of a society which saw obedience as a religious requirement." [...] Along these lines, Miller was also insistent that to interpret the play in light of twentieth century feminism was a flawed approach; [...] "what we think now is really quite beside the point. If everything is done in the light of what we think, it's a sort of historical egocentricity, which is quite intolerable." [...] Diana E. Henderson was unimpressed with this approach, however, writing [...] "it was the perfect production to usher in the neo-conservative 1980s" [...] and [...] "this BBC-TV museum piece unabashedly celebrates the order achieved through female submission." ...|$|E

60|$|But, after all, {{what is most}} {{required}} by the transport train is a commanding officer of far higher rank than a major. The transport train is, as I have shown, a collection of fourteen divisions, each as numerous as three cavalry regiments, the whole equalling in men alone {{the rest of the}} expedition. To command this immense corps a brigadier-general of energy and standing should have been selected—a man who would see the work done, {{and at the same time}} insist on being allowed to carry out his plans in his own way, without interference from others. As it <b>is,</b> <b>everyone</b> has advice to offer to the transport train, and, while throwing the blame of everything that goes wrong upon their shoulders, men do little to assist them; think nothing of sending for transport animals, and then keep them waiting for hours; start at times which render it impossible that the animals can be watered; send in their requisitions at all sorts of odd times; and, in fact, show no regard whatever for anything but their personal convenience. Major Warden does his best, and works indefatigably; but it requires an officer of much higher rank and of great firmness and decision. The present would be a great chance for an officer to make himself a name. To have successfully managed so enormous a corps as the transport train under such extreme difficulties as have already, and will in future visit it, would be a feather in the cap of the most distinguished officer.|$|E
6000|$|He to whom thou wast {{sent for}} ease, being by name Legality, {{is the son}} of the bond woman which now is, and is in bondage with her {{children}} (Gal. 4:21-27); and is, in a mystery, this mount Sinai, which thou hast feared will fall on thy head. Now, if she, with her children, are in bondage, how canst thou expect by them to be made free? This Legality, therefore, is not able to set thee free from thy burden. No man was as yet ever rid of his burden by him; no, nor ever is like to be: ye cannot be justified by the works of the law; for by the deeds of the law no man living can be rid of his burden: therefore, Mr. Worldly-wiseman is an alien, and Mr. Legality is a cheat; and for his son Civility, notwithstanding his simpering looks, he is but a hypocrite, and cannot help thee. Believe me, there is nothing in all this noise, that thou hast heard of these sottish men, but a design to beguile thee of thy salvation, by turning thee from the way in which I had set thee. After this, Evangelist called aloud to the heavens for confirmation of what he had said: and with that there came words and fire out of the mountain under which poor Christian stood, that made the hair of his flesh stand up.

6000|$|Long ago as it <b>is,</b> <b>everyone</b> {{remembers the}} terrible and {{grotesque}} scene that occurred in--, {{when one of}} the most acute and forcible of the English judges suddenly went mad on the bench. I had my own view of that occurrence; but about the facts themselves there is no question at all. For some months, indeed for some years, people had detected something curious in the judge's conduct. He seemed to have lost interest in the law, in which he had been beyond expression brilliant and terrible as a K.C., and to be occupied in giving personal and moral advice to the people concerned. He talked more like a priest or a doctor, and a very outspoken one at that. The first thrill was probably given when he said to a man who had attempted a crime of passion: [...] "I sentence you to three years imprisonment, under the firm, and solemn, and God-given conviction, that what you require is three months at the seaside." [...] He accused criminals from the bench, not so much of their obvious legal crimes, but of things that had never been heard of in a court of justice, monstrous egoism, lack of humour, and morbidity deliberately encouraged. Things came to a head in that celebrated diamond case in which the Prime Minister himself, that brilliant patrician, had to come forward, gracefully and reluctantly, to give evidence against his valet. After the detailed life of the household had been thoroughly exhibited, the judge requested the Premier again to step forward, which he did with quiet dignity. The judge then said, in a sudden, grating voice: [...] "Get a new soul. That thing's not fit for a dog. Get a new soul." [...] All this, of course, {{in the eyes of the}} sagacious, was premonitory of that melancholy and farcical day when his wits actually deserted him in open court. It was a libel case between two very eminent and powerful financiers, against both of whom charges of considerable defalcation were brought. The case was long and complex; the advocates were long and eloquent; but at last, after weeks of work and rhetoric, the time came for the great judge to give a summing-up; and one of his celebrated masterpieces of lucidity and pulverizing logic was eagerly looked for. He had spoken very little during the prolonged affair, and he looked sad and lowering at the end of it. He was silent for a few moments, and then burst into a stentorian song. His remarks (as reported) were as follows: ...|$|E
