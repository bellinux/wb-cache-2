500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E
2500|$|The sonnet {{as a whole}} {{leads the}} reader's mind and emotion to the climax, line 12. It is in this line {{that there is an}} {{affirmation}} of the return of love. The line reads [...] "let your love <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> life decay." [...] With this affirmation of the return of love comes the [...] "advice to terminate it".|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly!" [...] I answered. [...] "I {{have not}} communicated <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> lawyers. My substitute's fate {{was enough to}} make me careful!" ...|$|E
60|$|To me thy tedious feeble pace Comes {{laden with}} the weight of years; With sighs I view morn's {{blushing}} face, And hail mild <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> tears.|$|R
60|$|At {{the moment}} of {{stepping}} over the gangway he checked himself though, {{to give me a}} mumbled invitation to dine at his house that <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> captain, an invitation which I accepted. I don't think it could have been possible for me to refuse.|$|R
60|$|I {{spent an}} amusing <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> old savage hostess. She had thrown off her ailments and, pleased at having a {{companion}} in her dreary solitude, she was good-tempered and talkative, {{and much more}} inclined to laugh than when the others were present, {{when she was on}} her dignity.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the point, sir," [...] cried Belcher. [...] "By the Lord, I wish they'd let me {{take his}} place, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> left arm {{strapped}} behind me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{your first}} {{assumption}} must be correct," [...] she declared. [...] "You cannot explain things to me, so I cannot help you <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> advice. I am sorry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Empress, when I took my oath {{of office}} I swore to protect both the Augustus and the Augusta, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> life. I was {{fulfilling}} my oath, that is all." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{what with}} working and housekeeping, and lessons to Charley, and backgammon in the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> guardian, and duets with Ada, the three weeks slipped fast away. Then I {{went home with}} Caddy to see {{what could be done}} there, and Ada and Charley {{remained}} behind {{to take care of my}} guardian.|$|R
6000|$|... "What nonsense, mother--you know I don't love her--I--I {{tell you}} I DON'T love her--she doesn't <b>even</b> walk <b>with</b> <b>my</b> arm, because I don't want her to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 23d. St. George's day and Coronacion, the King and Court {{being at}} Windsor, at the {{installing}} of the King of Denmarke by proxy and the Duke of Monmouth.... Spent the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> father. At cards till late, and being at supper, my boy being sent for some mustard to a neat's tongue, the rogue staid half an houre in the streets, it seems at a bonfire, at which I was very angry, and resolve {{to beat him}} to-morrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "But if {{he should}} come, Malcolm, I suppose you will join him? I am afraid I shall be fool enough to do so, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> fifty years on my head. And you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a most}} reprehensible habit. I {{thought that}} my house, at least, would be free from it. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> opinion of you, I hardly thought {{it was one of}} your vices." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ... Are you strong enough--are you strong enough, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> help--to {{set your}} foot upon the necks of Sumner, Heintzelman, and Keyes, all at once? This is a {{practical}} and a very serious question for you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take your confounded fruit," [...] he howled, {{throwing}} {{a dozen or}} more of the luscious pears at my feet. [...] "If I don't get <b>even</b> <b>with</b> you, <b>my</b> name isn't Duncan Woodward!" ...|$|R
60|$|By {{the first}} train I {{was on my}} way to town, and hurried at once to the Seamen's Hospital. I remembered that both hands of the Lascar had been amputated, but I was terrified lest the {{precious}} organ which I was in search of might have been already consumed in the crematory. My suspense was soon ended. It had still been preserved in the post-mortem room. And so I returned to Rodenhurst in the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> mission accomplished and the material for a fresh experiment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{my right}} {{pleasant}} lord," [...] replied Condall, forcing an obsequious smile, [...] "an ye be so masterful, as doth right well become you, I will <b>even,</b> <b>with</b> all <b>my</b> poor skill, do your good bidding." ...|$|R
6000|$|But to return. Are you {{strong enough}}--are you strong enough <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> help--to set your foot upon the necks of Sumner, Heintzelman, and Keyes all at once? This is a {{practical}} and very serious question to you? ...|$|E
60|$|A second rook who {{had been}} {{watching}} the proceedings from the lime tree, called to a third who was passing. <b>Even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> limited knowledge of the language I found it easy to follow the conversation: it was so obvious.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{looked like}} a London trader, father, and was some forty years old; {{but it was hard}} to tell, for by the time we got him to the hostelry he was well-nigh spent and scarce able to crawl along, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> help." ...|$|E
60|$|After tea and a go-to-bed romp {{with the}} little girls, I {{attacked}} the big workbasket, and had a quiet <b>evening</b> chatting <b>with</b> <b>my</b> new friend. I shall keep a journal-letter, and send it once a week, so goodnight, and more tomorrow.|$|R
2500|$|The controversy, however, {{did not end}} there. In {{response}} to McEnroe's on-court outbursts during the Championships, the All England Club did not accord McEnroe honorary club membership, an honor normally given to singles champions after their first victory. McEnroe responded by not attending the traditional champions' dinner that evening. He told the press: [...] "I wanted to spend the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> {{family and friends and}} the people who had supported me, not a bunch of stiffs who are 70–80 years old, telling you that you're acting like a jerk." [...] The honor was eventually accorded to McEnroe after he won the championship again.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{received}} a telegram in work from Tom Scully, the Shamrock Rovers secretary, {{on the day}} of the game to be at Dalymount at 7pm that <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> boots and shin-guards.I drove to out to Milltown from Finglas where I lived, but the place was locked up and there was no one there, so I had to climb over the wall, break in the door, grab my boots and climb out over the wall again.I stripped off in Dalymount and after a few minutes Theo Foley, who had been doubtful from the start, went down injured, and I was sent on and played very well." ...|$|R
60|$|Mal. So pitiless? But yet I may command thee, and I will: I {{love the}} Guise, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> latest breath, Beyond my soul, and my lost hopes of heaven: I charge thee, by my {{short-lived}} power, disclose What fate attends my master.|$|E
60|$|Her. A parent's love,--for I confess my crime,-- Moved me to say, Leonidas was yours; But when I heard Palmyra was to die, The fear of guiltless blood so stung my conscience, That I resolved, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> shame, to save Your daughter's life.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a man," [...] she remarked, [...] "in the stalls, {{who finds}} us {{apparently}} {{more interesting than}} the performance. I do not see very well <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> glasses, but I fancy, no! I am quite sure, that his face is familiar to me." ...|$|E

60|$|Anne Catherick again! Even {{the memory}} of the {{farewell}} <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> mother and my sister could not return to me now unconnected with that other memory of the moonlight walk back to London. What did it mean? Were that woman and I to meet once more? It was possible, at the least. Did she know that I lived in London? Yes; I had told her so, either before or after that strange question of hers, when she had asked me so distrustfully if I knew many men of the rank of Baronet. Either before or after--my mind was not calm enough, then, to remember which.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We,' Penfentenyou replied ambassadorially, 'have come {{to have a}} Voice in Your Councils. By the way, the Voice {{is coming}} down on the <b>evening</b> train <b>with</b> <b>my</b> Agent-General. I thought you wouldn't mind if I invited 'em. You know We're going to share Your burdens henceforward. You'd better get into training.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} call up former {{favorite}} views of mountain and sea, so as to compare them with this; but the memory pictures refused to come, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> eyes closed. Then I returned to camp, with unsettled, troubled mind, and was silent, wondering at the strange feeling burning within me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Auburn hair, if you please: mamma, {{calls it}} auburn, or golden, {{and so do}} all her friends. But <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> 'long red hair'" [...] (and he waved his mane {{with a sort of}} triumph--tawny he himself well knew that it was, and he was proud of the leonine hue), [...] "I cannot {{possibly}} be queerer than is your ladyship." ...|$|E
6000|$|Next morning Hans was dosed with brandy, which, in {{his empty}} condition, made him {{extremely}} drunk, {{and from that}} time forward began {{to take a more}} cheerful view of things. Especially was this so when the hours for the [...] "brandy medicine" [...] came round. Hans, like most other Hottentots, loved spirits, and would put up with much to get them, <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> father's fiery indignation.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Rupert said seriously, [...] "that {{would not}} do. We may be detected, {{and may have}} to dive, {{and all sorts of}} things. No, Dillon, it would not do. But if you can get the petards, you will have the {{satisfaction}} of knowing that you have done your share of the work; and then you might, if you could, ride round in the <b>evening</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> uniform and Hugh's in your valise. If you go on to the bank half a mile or so below the town, every one will be watching the assault, and we can get ashore, put on our clothes, and get back home without a soul being the wiser." ...|$|R
6000|$|In the <b>evening</b> I went <b>with</b> <b>my</b> {{friends to}} the Harim. The minaret {{galleries}} were hung with lamps, {{and the inside}} of the temple was illuminated. It was ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I acquiesce in your proposal, Doctor Hartley," [...] {{said the}} General, reluctantly {{receiving}} back {{a part of}} the contents of the pocketbook, [...] "it is because I hope to serve you <b>with</b> <b>my</b> interest, <b>even</b> better than <b>with</b> <b>my</b> purse." ...|$|R
