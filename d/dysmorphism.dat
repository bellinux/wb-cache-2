25|$|Isotretinoin is a {{teratogen}} {{highly likely}} to cause birth defects if taken by women during pregnancy or even a short time before conception. A few of the more common birth defects this drug can cause are hearing and visual impairment, missing or malformed earlobes, facial <b>dysmorphism,</b> and abnormalities in brain function. Isotretinoin is classified as FDA Pregnancy Category X and ADEC Category X, and use is contraindicated in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|WR is {{associated}} with abnormalities in bone maturation, and lipids and hormone metabolism.

They have physical abnormalities including a large head (macrocephaly), sparse hair, prominent scalp veins, inward-folded eyelids, widened anterior fontanelles, hollow cheeks (malar hypoplasia), general loss of fat tissues under the skin, delayed tooth eruption, abnormal hair pattern, beaked noses, mild to severe mental retardation and <b>dysmorphism.</b>|$|E

40|$|Gestalt {{identification}} {{is the process}} by which healthcare practitioners actively organize clinical perceptions into specific diagnostic ideas.

40|$|Copy number {{variation}} {{studies of}} known disorders {{have the potential}} to improve the characterization of clinical phenotypes and may help identifying candidate genes and their pathways. The authors described a child with congenital heart disease, microcephaly, facial <b>dysmorphisms,</b> developmental delay, learning difficulties, and behavioral problems. There was initially a clinical suspicion of 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome (22 q 11. 2 DS), but molecular cytogenetic analysis (array genomic hybridization [aGH]) showed the presence of a de novo 3. 6 -Mb interstitial microdeletion in 8 p 23. 1. The main features of 8 p 23. 1 DS include congenital heart disease and behavioral problems, in addition to minor <b>dysmorphisms</b> and mental delay.

40|$|Abstract Background Intellectual {{disability}} affects approximately 1 to 3 % of {{the general}} population. The etiology is still poorly understood and {{it is estimated that}} one-half of the cases are due to genetic factors. Cryptic subtelomeric aberrations have been found in roughly 5 to 7 % of all cases. Methods We performed a subtelomeric FISH analysis on 76 unrelated children with normal standard karyotype ascertained by developmental delay or intellectual disability, associated with congenital malformations, and/or facial <b>dysmorphisms.</b> Results Ten cryptic chromosomal anomalies have been identified in the whole cohort (13, 16 %), 8 in the group of patients characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability associated with congenital malformations and facial <b>dysmorphisms,</b> 2 in patients with developmental delay or intellectual disability and facial <b>dysmorphisms</b> only. Conclusion We demonstrate that a careful clinical examination is a very useful tool for pre-selection of patients for genomic analysis, clearly enhancing the chromosomal anomaly detection rate. Clinical features of most of these patients are consistent with the corresponding emerging chromosome phenotypes, pointing out these new clinical syndromes associated with specific genomic imbalances. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. OCI- 5 /GPC 3 is {{a member}} of the glypican family. Glypicans are heparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} that are bound to the cell surface through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. It has recently been shown that the OCI- 5 /GPC 3 gene is mutated in patients with the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS), an X-linked disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal overgrowth and various visceral and skeletal <b>dysmorphisms.</b> Some of these <b>dysmorphisms</b> could be the result of deficient growth inhibition or apoptosis in certain cell types during development. Here we present evidence indicating that OCI- 5 /GPC 3 induces apoptosis in cell lines derived from mesothelioma (II 14) and breast cancer (MCF- 7). This induction, however, is cell line specific since it is not observed in NIH 3 T 3 fibroblast...|$|R
40|$|Aims: We {{will discuss}} the {{clinical}} and genetic diagnosis {{of a child with}} severe psychomotor delay, who at 3 years of age presented with paroxysms of hyperpnea-apnea and seizures unrelated to breathing anomalies. Methods: The child underwent genetic (karyotype, FISH telomeres) and neuroradiological (cranial CT and MRI) tests, which proved to be normal. He came under our clinical observation at 3 years and 5 months of age. Due to severe psychomotor delay and facial <b>dysmorphisms</b> we completed the genetic investigations based on his clinical feature and analysis of the available literature. Results: The presence of severe mental retardation associated with anomalous breathing pattern may suggest the Joubert and Rett syndrome, however these were excluded on the basis of clinical and genetic examination. Angelman syndrome, suspected for facial <b>dysmorphisms</b> and absent language, was also excluded {{because of the presence of}} a normal pattern of methylation at SNRPN locus. Another possible diagnosis was the Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome (PHS), characterized by severe mental retardation, breathing anomalies (paroxisms of hyperpnea-apnea), <b>dysmorphisms</b> and sometimes epilepsy. Haploinsufficiency of TCF 4 gene located at 18 q 21. 2 region has been recently identified as causative of this syndrome.
