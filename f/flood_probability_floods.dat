40|$|Determining {{the role}} of {{different}} precipitation periods for peak discharge generation is crucial for both projecting future changes in flood probability and for short- and medium-range flood forecasting. In this study, catchment-averaged daily precipitation time series are analyzed prior to annual peak discharge events (floods) in Switzerland. The high number of floods considered – more than 4000 events from 101 catchments have been analyzed – allows to derive significant information about {{the role of}} antecedent precipitation for peak discharge generation. Based on the analysis of precipitation times series, a new separation of flood-related precipitation periods is proposed: (i) the period 0 to 1 day before flood days, when the maximum flood-triggering precipitation rates are generally observed, (ii) the period 2 to 3 days before flood days, when longer-lasting synoptic situations generate "significantly higher than normal" precipitation amounts, and (iii) the period from 4 days to 1 month before flood days when previous wet episodes may have already preconditioned the catchment. The novelty of this study lies in the separation of antecedent precipitation into the precursor antecedent precipitation (4 days before floods or earlier, called PRE-AP) and the short range precipitation (0 to 3 days before floods, a period when precipitation is often driven by one persistent weather situation like e. g., a stationary low-pressure system). A precise separation of "antecedent" and "peak-triggering" precipitation is not attempted. Instead, the strict definition of antecedent precipitation periods permits a direct comparison of all catchments. The precipitation accumulating 0 to 3 days before an event is the most relevant for floods in Switzerland. PRE-AP precipitation has only a weak and region-specific influence on <b>flood</b> <b>probability.</b> <b>Floods</b> were significantly more frequent after wet PRE-AP periods only in the Jura Mountains, in the western and eastern Swiss plateau, and at the outlet of large lakes. As a general rule, wet PRE-AP periods enhance the flood probability in catchments with gentle topography, high infiltration rates, and large storage capacity (karstic cavities, deep soils, large reservoirs). In contrast, floods were significantly less frequent after wet PRE-AP periods in glacial catchments because of reduced melt. For the majority of catchments however, no significant correlation between precipitation amounts and flood occurrences is found when the last 3 days before floods are omitted in the precipitation amounts. Moreover, the PRE-AP was not higher for extreme floods than for annual floods with a high frequency and was very close to climatology for all floods. The fact that floods are not significantly more frequent nor more intense after wet PRE-AP is a clear indicator of a short discharge memory of Pre-Alpine, Alpine and South Alpine Swiss catchments. Our study poses the question whether the impact of long-term precursory precipitation for floods in such catchments is not overestimated in the general perception. The results suggest that the consideration of a 3 – 4 days precipitation period should be sufficient to represent (understand, reconstruct, model, project) Swiss Alpine floods...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{self-similarity}} conjecture {{can provide}} an assessment of regionalization procedures for flood frequency analysis if the scaling properties of flood flows as parameterised by drainage area are considered. The question whether simple scaling {{can be used to}} discriminate among different <b>flood</b> <b>probabilities</b> in relatively small regions with high variability of climate and geomorphological features is investigated. Detailed simulations for a small basin in Thyrrhenian Liguria (North-West Italy) show that self-similarity or simple scaling properly represent the spatial variability of <b>flood</b> <b>probabilities.</b> The scaling properties of annual flood series for North-West Italy are also investigated. Although flood statistics display multiscaling properties when considering North-West Italy as an individual homogeneous region, one can classify geographically consistent regions in this area where self-similarity cannot be rejected. Accordingly, the index flood procedure can be properly applied to these regions in order to estimate <b>flood</b> <b>probabilities</b> at ungauged catchments, and the scaling exponent of <b>flood</b> <b>probabilities</b> can be interpreted as the signature of complex interactions between climate and hydrology producing extreme flows in rivers of a region.

Urban green spaces {{have emerged as}} a potential option to reduce urban flood risks, and their effectiveness has been highlighted in notable urban water management studies. In this study, flooded areas in Seoul, Korea, were divided into four flooded area types by cluster analysis based on topographic and physical characteristics and verified using discriminant analysis. After division by flooded area type, logistic regression analysis was performed {{to determine how the}} <b>flooding</b> <b>probability</b> changes with variations in green space area. Type 1 included regions where flooding occurred in a drainage basin that had a flood risk management infrastructure (FRMI). In Type 2, the slope was steep; the TWI (Topographic Wetness Index) was relatively low; and soil drainage was favorable. Type 3 represented the gentlest sloping areas, and these were associated with the highest TWI values. In addition, these areas had the worst soil drainage. Type 4 had moderate slopes, imperfect soil drainage and lower than average TWI values. We found that green spaces exerted a considerable influence on urban <b>flooding</b> <b>probabilities</b> in Seoul, and <b>flooding</b> <b>probabilities</b> could be reduced by over 50 % depending on the green space area and the locations where green spaces were introduced. Increasing the area of green spaces was the most effective method of decreasing <b>flooding</b> <b>probability</b> in Type 3 areas.

40|$|When {{performing}} risk {{analyses for}} flood studies or dam safety projects, {{it is common}} to use best estimates for <b>flooding</b> <b>probability,</b> the peak <b>flood</b> levels, and for damage from the flooding to estimate the “expected” value of economic consequences or fatalities.

This paper includes an approach for estimating uncertainties and the effect of these uncertainties in the dam breach and inundation analysis and in the flood damage relationships on the estimate of flood damages.

We hypothesize that there are differences between WTA and WTP, and that both value functions and their disparity are affected by the absolute value of the reference point. We test our hypotheses using a choice experiment with trade-offs between changes in <b>flood</b> <b>probabilities</b> and costs. The choice experiments elicit WTP and WTA, using two <b>flood</b> <b>probability</b> reference values, yielding four separate value functions.

Also, both WTA and WTP value functions are affected by the <b>flood</b> <b>probability</b> reference value, and the WTA–WTP disparity increases when the <b>flood</b> <b>probability</b> reference point increases. Both findings suggest that welfare effects caused by changes in public good provision depend not only on the direction of change (loss aversion), but also the reference value. Moreover, our results show that the latter effect is larger for losses than for gains. We introduce the concept of reference point updating as a possible explanation for these findings...|$|R
40|$|A {{large part}} of the flood defences in The Netherlands does not meet the present safety standards. In 2014 the delta {{programme}} has proposed new safety standards, which are based on the flood risk approach. These new safety standards will for a lot of river dikes be stricter than the currently prevailing safety standards. A lot of work has to be done to make sure all the river dikes will meet the new safety standards. The safety level of river dikes can be improved by means of spatial measures, which decrease the hydraulic load on the dikes by increasing the flood conveyance capacity, or by dike improvements, which increase the strength of the dike. The effectiveness of spatial measures has always been assessed in terms of water level reduction and not in terms of reduction of the <b>flood</b> <b>probability.</b> In this research a rapid assessment tool is developed with which the reduction of the <b>flood</b> <b>probability</b> by spatial measures can be assessed. This reduction has been calculated for several types of measures and it is compared with the effectiveness of more traditional dike improvements. The delta programme prescribes a strategy in which the increase of the <b>flood</b> <b>probability</b> because of climate change is counteracted with spatial measures. The difference between {{the current state of the}} dikes and the new safety standards should be resolved with dike improvements. This research shows that the <b>flood</b> <b>probability</b> reduction by spatial measures is overestimated. Due to this overestimation more spatial measures will be necessary to counteract climate change than was expected. A new strategy is proposed in which the <b>flood</b> <b>probability</b> for failure mechanism overflow/overtopping is reduced with a combination of dike improvements and spatial measures. The probability of failure for other failure mechanisms (piping, macro stability) is reduced with only dike improvements.

Fault tree analysis is a technique that is able to model all potential causes of flooding and to quantify both the overall <b>probability</b> of <b>flooding</b> and the contributions of all causes of flooding to the overall <b>flood</b> <b>probability.</b> This paper gives the results of a fault tree analysis for urban flooding for the case of Haarlem, a city of 105. 000 inhabitants. Data from a complaint register, rainfall data and hydrodynamic model calculations are used to quantify the probabilities of the basic events in the fault tree. The <b>flood</b> <b>probability</b> that is calculated for Haarlem is 0. 78 /week. Gully pot blockages make the main contribution to flood probability: 79 %, storm events contribute only 5 %.

To ensure the spatial consistence of our flood scenarios, we used a stochastic rainfall simulator to generate rainfall fields representative of the climatology of a 150 km² catchment near Lyon. The influence of the variability and spatial structure of the rainfall on the choice of the best locations for a set of dams was previously studied using a simplistic rainfall-runoff model. The estimated optimum is highly dependent to the choice of the sub-sets of events, confirming that assessments based on a limited number of scenarios are heavily flawed. A large set of events, representative of the regime, is indispensable. For further investigations of this approach, a cascade-of-reservoirs conceptual model now computes the rainfall-runoff transformation and can optionally be chained to a 1 D-hydraulic models. This increases both results consistence and computation-time, however sensitivity analyses remain accessible. We studied optimisation of outlet dimensions in addition to dam location.

40|$|To {{guarantee}} a safe flood defence {{in a changing}} environment, the {{adaptation to climate change}} needs to be considered in the design of river dikes. However, the large uncertainty in the projections of future climate leads to varied estimations of future <b>flood</b> <b>probability.</b> How to cope with the uncertainties in future <b>flood</b> <b>probability</b> under climate change is an inevitable question in the adaptation. In this paper, the uncertainty introduced by climate projections was integrated into the ‘expected predictive flood probability’, and the risk-aversion attitude was introduced in the adaptation of river dikes. In detail, the uncertain effect of climate change on <b>flood</b> <b>probability</b> was represented by the uncertainty in the parameters of the probabilistic model. This parameter uncertainty was estimated based on the outputs from the GCMs participated in IPCC AR 4.

It is common practice to express flood risk (the combination of <b>flood</b> <b>probabilities</b> and potential <b>flood</b> damages) into a single number.

This type of information is relevant when a robust system is desired. We consider robust (fluvial) flood risk systems {{to have the ability to}} remain functioning under a range of river discharges. To understand system robustness, it is thus useful to analyze how the flood impact varies over a range of possible events. We applied a method to quantify the robustness of flood risk systems on a fluvial flood risk system in the Netherlands: the IJssel River, a branch of the Rhine River, and its flood-prone area. We compared four alternative system configurations of the IJssel River Valley, and analyzed their robustness, applying the following criteria: resistance threshold, response severity, proportionality and recovery threshold. The robustness analysis provides us with clues about how to enhance a flood risk system’s robustness. We found that a system with unbreachable embankments scores best on overall robustness, because it has the least uncertain resistance threshold, the most proportional damage increase with increasing discharge, and the least uncertainty about where and when floods will occur. This shows that a robustness perspective helps to develop strategies that reduce the flood risks without increasing the consequences of beyond-design flood...|$|R

Insights about individual risk beliefs and behavioural responses to changing risks are relevant for insurers, as it allows them, for example, to estimate the demand for new insurance products that cover weather-related damage. This study elicits individual risk beliefs and the demand for low-probability, high-impact flood insurance using the contingent valuation survey method among approximately 1000 homeowners in the Dutch river delta. This study is of practical relevance since currently flood insurance is not available in the Netherlands, while insurers have been considering to provide such insurance. Individuals generally do not behave in accordance with the expected utility model since a significant proportion of homeowners neglect the low-probability flood risk. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) of those individuals who demand flood insurance is on average considerably higher than the expected value of the flood risk they face. Moreover, the WTP for flood insurance is less than proportionally related to increased <b>flood</b> <b>probabilities</b> that were presented to respondents in the questionnaire. Individuals follow a process of Bayesian updating of <b>flood</b> <b>probabilities,</b> since perceptions of <b>flood</b> risk are an important determinant of the WTP, while objective risks derived from geographical characteristics influence the WTP to a lesser extent.

This finding is consistent with HRM’s planning regulations that prevent residential development in the 20 -year floodplain.|$|R

Indeed, the specific subject of the paper has no particular connection with Dr. McCulloch’s technical specialties or the thrust of IH work, {{but it does have}} much to do with Dr Mc Culloch’s prowess and vision for running a research institute. In 1984, I was invited to spend a Sabbatical year at IH to work on the then new technique of Regional Probability Weighted Moments (PWM) in connection with Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The IH Flood Studies Report (FSR) had used the GEV distribution with a graphical method involving rather arbitrary and subjective steps in its fitting procedure for determining the regional distributions to use in different parts of the UK. Because physically impossibly-large <b>flood</b> <b>probabilities</b> had been produced by the FSR in connection with some Scottish dams, there was a controversy with large economic and social implications. I, working together with Jon Hosking, a young, very bright mathematical statistician employed by IH, addressed the problem and devised a PWM solution for the GEV so that the FSR <b>flood</b> <b>probability</b> estimation difficulty was resolved which was invaluable to IH at the time...|$|R
40|$|Flooding is {{an unwelcome}} and {{increasingly}} frequent phenomenon in many urban areas. However, as recent UK floods have shown, serious inundation can still occur even if river discharge has not exceeded the functional flood plain capacity due to 'pluvial' or sewer flooding. This work focuses on sewer flooding and its management. The {{aim of this}} study is to develop a methodology to support effective sewer flood risk management within a decision support framework, based on a sound understanding of the urban flooding regime. An urban drainage modelling tool was used to generate a flow time series based on long-term continuous rainfall inputs (rather than individual storms). A catchment delineation method was applied on a detailed digital elevation model to predict the extent of flooding and flood stages were assigned to the different flood discharges at each property in a catchment. A flood risk model was developed to assess flood risk in terms of <b>probability</b> and consequence. <b>Flood</b> <b>probability</b> was identified using statistical analysis for the flood stages, and flood consequence was obtained from the relationship between the flood stage and the corresponding damage cost. Annual average flood risk for each property was identified by linking the <b>flood</b> <b>probability,</b> stage and damage. A decision support framework was developed to allow the rational comparison of different management strategies ranked in terms of highest cost benefit difference or benefit cost ratio. This was used to compare a wide range of different sewerage rehabilitation and management scenarios in terms of flood costs and benefits for a particular case study. The wider application of the framework was demonstrated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{popularity}} of monitoring dikes with sensor techniques is rising. It is claimed that sensor techniques lead to {{significant cost savings}} and can predict an upcoming dike collapse. But a technical foundation to use the sensor monitoring information in flood safety assessment is lacking. This research investigates the contribution of sensor monitoring information to flood safety and the cost-effectiveness of sensor monitoring. Sensor techniques have been tested in full-scale dike failure experiments at the IJkdijk, trying to predict an upcoming dike collapse. The sensor techniques are capable of monitoring deformation, temperature, water pressure, vibrations and moisture. The state of the sensor techniques is doubtful due to subjective analyses, controlled test conditions and a wide variety in failure prediction times: from 1, 5 to 102 hours. Implementation of sensor information Water pressure is the only variable that constitutes an input for dike safety assessment models. Monitoring water pressures affects the epistemic uncertainty of the water pressure schematization which {{is caused by the}} translation from the hydraulic load to water pressures. One must be aware that sensor monitoring either leads to an increased assessment of flood safety if the prior schematization turns out to be done conservatively or a decrease in flood safety if the prior schematization turns out too optimistic. One would expect an increased assessed flood safety due the intended conservative approach. But prior schematization mistakes imply a decreased assessed flood safety. Moreover, monitoring water pressures has minimum impact on the flood safety assessment if other uncertainty aspects dominate the stability assessment. A case study of the canal of Nauerna denotes that the water pressure has resulted in a higher assessed flood safety, but the uncertainties regarding the soil conditions dominate the stability assessment. However, sensor monitoring on itself does not affect the real flood safety: only physical measures affect the real risk of flooding. Important information is obtained from monitoring high water events such that water pressure models can be calibrated to determine design loading conditions for the periodic safety assessment. Also, an additional application is to identify unforeseen risks. Cost-benefit analysis Conceptual cost-benefit models have been set up to determine the cost-effectiveness of sensor monitoring over the long-term. The monitoring costs consist of installation, maintenance and operational costs. The benefit from permanent dike reinforcements is gained from specifying the long-term optimal investment strategy based on the minimum sum of flood risk and reinforcements costs. The monitoring information from relevant high water events affects the assessed <b>flooding</b> <b>probability.</b> If the sensor monitoring reduces the assessed <b>flooding</b> <b>probability,</b> the assessed <b>flood</b> risk lowers and savings on permanent dike reinforcements. If a higher <b>flooding</b> <b>probability</b> is obtained by sensor monitoring, this financially leads to additional investments and negative benefits. But the value of knowing this higher flood risk is rationally beneficial. The benefit from temporary measures is gained from timely execution of emergency measures based on the early warning of the sensor system. This benefit depends on the prediction time of the sensor monitoring system and the reaction time to execute the emergency measure. Additional costs for executing the emergency measure must be incorporated. The cost-benefit models have been worked out in case studies for dike-ring 48 and 14. Conclusion The conclusion of this research is that sensor monitoring can be implemented in the flood safety, by specifying dike reinforcements in both the periodic safety assessment, as well as the operational situation. However, the investments in sensor monitoring have to be made while a long waiting time is expected before benefits turn out. Then these benefits can financially be disappointing, but do have a certain value of information. Hydraulic Structures & Flood RiskHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
