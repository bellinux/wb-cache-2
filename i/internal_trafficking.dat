The trafficking is multidimensional and it involves both commercial sexual exploitation and labor exploitation. Russia {{is a significant}} source of women trafficked to over 50 nations. <b>Internal</b> <b>trafficking</b> is a problem in the country; women are trafficked from rural areas to urban settlements for commercial sexual exploitation. Men are trafficked internally and from Central Asia for forced labor in the construction and agricultural industries. Debt bondage is common among the trafficking victims.|$|E
25|$|The Czech police {{increased}} {{its capacity to}} investigate and convict traffickers over the reporting period, although the overall numbers of cases prosecuted pursuant to anti-trafficking legislation remained low and sentences imposed remained weak. Amendments to the Czech Penal Code {{went into effect in}} November 2004, making all forms of trafficking illegal, including labor exploitation and <b>internal</b> <b>trafficking.</b> Maximum trafficking penalties were increased from 12 to 15 years, with a minimum penalty of two years. In 2004, Czech authorities investigated 30 individuals and prosecuted 19 under the trafficking statutes. The courts convicted 12 traffickers under those statutes, an increase from five in 2003. Of the 12 convicted, three received unconditional prison sentences of three to five years, and nine received conditional or suspended sentences. Police training curricula included segments on trafficking, and a new internal website for police provided trafficking awareness information. While no government officials were indicted or convicted for complicity in trafficking, allegations continued about the involvement of individual border police officers facilitating illegal border crossings. Czech law enforcement conducted joint anti-trafficking investigations with Germany, Slovakia, Austria, Poland, and Ukraine in 2004.|$|E

40|$|Worst-case bounds {{on delay}} and backlog are derived for leaky bucket {{constrained}} sessions in arbitrary topology networks of Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) [6] servers. The inherent {{flexibility of the}} service discipline is exploited to analyze broad classes of networks. When only {{a subset of the}} sessions are leaky bucket constrained, we give succinct per-session bounds that are independent of the behavior of the other sessions and also of the network topology. However, these bounds are only shown to hold for each session that is guaranteed a backlog clearing rate that exceeds the token arrival rate of its leaky bucket. A much broader class of networks, called Consistent Relative Session Treatment (CRST) networks is analyzed for the case in which all of the sessions are leaky bucket constrained. First, an algorithm is presented that characterizes the <b>internal</b> <b>traffic</b> in terms of average rate and burstiness, and it is shown that all CRST networks are stable. Next, a method is presented that yields bounds on session delay and backlog given this <b>internal</b> <b>traffic</b> characterization: The session i route is treated as a whole, yielding tighter bounds than those that result from adding the worst-case delays (backlogs) at each of the servers in th...|$|R

50|$|Though the Ethiopian {{government}} {{has increased its}} efforts to prosecute and punish transnational trafficking offenders, prosecution of <b>internal</b> <b>trafficking</b> cases remains nonexistent. Article 635 of Ethiopia's Criminal Code (Trafficking in Women and Minors) criminalizes sex trafficking and prescribes punishments not exceeding five years' imprisonment. Articles 596 (Enslavement) and 597 (Trafficking in Women and Children) outlaw slavery and labor trafficking and prescribe punishments of five to 20 years' rigorous imprisonment. These articles, however, have rarely been used to prosecute trafficking offenses; instead, Articles 598 (Unlawful Sending of Ethiopians to Work Abroad) and 571 (Endangering the Life of Another) are more often used to prosecute cases of transnational labor trafficking. The Federal High Court's 11th Criminal Bench heard all cases of transnational trafficking, as well as <b>internal</b> <b>trafficking</b> cases discovered in the Addis Ababa jurisdiction. Between March and October 2009, the bench heard fifteen cases related to transnational labor trafficking, resulting in five convictions, nine acquittals, and one withdrawal due to missing witnesses. Of the five convictions, three offenders received suspended sentences of five years' imprisonment, two co-defendants were fined, and one offender is serving a sentence of five years' imprisonment.|$|E
