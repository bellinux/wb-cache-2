500|$|Tifa was {{designed}} to use the [...] "monk" [...] character class that appears in previous games in the series. She has long, black hair in a style resembling a dolphin's tail at the tip, and garments described as simple and monotone, consisting of a white tank top and black miniskirt. She also wears red boots and gloves, and sleeves extend up her arms from her wrists to <b>her</b> <b>elbows,</b> with suspenders connecting her skirt to her shoulders, and a large metal guard covering her left elbow. She stands about 5feet 6inches (167cm) tall, and has measurements of 36-24-35" [...] (92-60-88cm).|$|E
500|$|Maria's face is {{idealised}} and {{conforms to}} contemporary ideals of beauty, {{especially in the}} raised eyebrows and elongated nose. The art historian Lorne Campbell has noted her facial similarity to the Virgin in Memling's panel at the National Museum of Ancient Art, Lisbon. In this work, Maria's frame is slightly undersized compared to her head, a common characteristic of contemporary northern portraiture, also found in similar works by Rogier van der Weyden and Petrus Christus. <b>Her</b> <b>elbows</b> rest on an unseen parapet that coincides with the lower edge of the painted stone [...] frame, acting as a trompe-l'œil which situates her both in the same reality and in closer proximity to the viewer. Maria wears a relatively modest wedding band lined with rubies and sapphire. Her necklace is colored with mostly red and blue jewels, similar to Hugo van der Goes's portrait {{of her in the}} Portinari Altarpiece.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used <b>her</b> <b>elbows</b> to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Jenny was {{gambling}} in Cannes one evening, Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness saw her and remarked, [...] "I {{have never seen}} so many jewels on any one person in my life. Her bracelets reached almost to <b>her</b> <b>elbows.</b> The necklace she wore must have cost a king's ransom, and the ring on her right hand was the size of an ice cube." ...|$|E

2500|$|... the sisters' maid, who is {{sometimes}} referred to as Mare in the visual novel and Mear in the fan book, is actually a lifelike android that has existed for a long time. Her scarlet hair is tied down into two long pigtails that reach <b>her</b> <b>elbows.</b> She appears completely unemotional, especially {{at the beginning of the}} game, but she has her own desires and [...] becomes friendlier with Chris as the story progresses to varying degrees depending upon whether it's her scenario or not.|$|E
2500|$|The {{woman can}} lie {{on her back}} with her hips {{on the edge of}} a {{platform}} such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc. while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch her back, and the man can raise, support or [...] restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the butterfly position, adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced clitoral stimulation, and the woman may need direct clitoral fingering, either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch her back or raise her torso onto <b>her</b> <b>elbows</b> or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.|$|E
