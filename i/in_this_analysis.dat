5|$|In a 1978 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Clavaria, Ronald Petersen placed C.zollingeri in the subgenus Clavaria, a grouping of species with clamp connections absent from all septa in the fruit body; others in the subgenus included C.purpurea, C.fumosa, and the type, C.vermicularis. A large-scale molecular analysis of the phylogenetic distributions and limits of clavarioid fungi in the family Clavariaceae was published by Bryn Dentiger and David McLaughlin in 2006. Based on their analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences, C.zollingeri shared the greatest genetic similarity with Clavulinopsis laeticolor. Petersen's concept of the infrageneric {{classification of}} Clavaria was largely rejected <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis,</b> as {{two of the three}} subgenera he proposed were found to be polyphyletic.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis,</b> the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible to}} link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E

25|$|All {{subdivision}} classifications had depended {{primarily on}} morphological differences till {{the era of}} phylogenetic analyses (Price and Palmer 1993).

25|$|A {{number of}} {{alternate}} analyses of Munsee and Unami vowels have been proposed. In one, the two languages are analysed {{as having the}} same basic vowel system, consisting of four long vowels /i· o· e· a·/, and two short vowels /ə a/. This vowel system {{is equivalent to the}} vowel system reconstructed for Proto-Eastern-Algonquian. Alternative analyses reflect several differences between the two languages. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> Munsee is analysed as having contrasting length in all positions, with the exception of /ə/. In cells with two vowels, the first is long.|$|E
25|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} of ribosomal DNA {{has helped to}} clarify the evolutionary and genetic relationships amongst the species in Cookeina. The species C. speciosa, C. tricholoma, and C. sinensis belong to a monophyletic group, and all are hairy, with stipes, and lack a well-defined layer of slime in the excipulum at maturity. Another monophyletic grouping contains the species C. Venezuela and C. colensoi, which do have a slime layer on the excipulum, and have either short stipes {{or not at all}} (sessile). <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis,</b> C. indica and C. insititia did not clearly resolve with the other clades.|$|E

25|$|Different {{analyses}} of the Munsee vowel system have been proposed. Goddard (1979) presents an analysis in which Munsee and Unami have the same vowel system, unchanged from the Proto-Eastern-Algonquian vowel system (discussed in the History section below). <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis,</b> there are four long vowels /i·, o·, e·, a·/ and two short vowels /a, ə/. Vowel length is indicated with a raised dot (·). However, in modern Munsee there are several sources of new short /i, o, e/ that arise from such sources as reduplication, loan words, and other various phonological changes, and that cannot be derived from other underlying vowels. Hence an analysis {{in which there are}} four positions that have contrastive vowel length as well as /ə/, is appropriate.|$|E
25|$|The {{hereditary}} form (HAE) {{often goes}} undetected {{for a long}} time, as its symptoms resemble those of more common disorders, such as allergy or intestinal colic. An important clue is the failure of hereditary angioedema to respond to antihistamines or steroids, a characteristic that distinguishes it from allergic reactions. It is particularly difficult to diagnose HAE in patients whose episodes are confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Besides {{a family history of}} the disease, only a laboratory analysis can provide final confirmation. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis,</b> it is usually a reduced complement factor C4, rather than the C1-INH deficiency itself, that is detected. The former is used during the reaction cascade in the complement system of immune defense, which is permanently overactive {{due to the lack of}} regulation by C1-INH.|$|E

25|$|Men are {{affected}} {{three times as}} often as women. There is also marked geographic variation in the prevalence of IgA nephropathy throughout the world. It {{is the most common}} glomerular disease in the Far East and Southeast Asia, accounting for almost half of all the patients with glomerular disease. However, it accounts for only about 25% of the proportion in European and about 10% among North Americans, with African–Americans having a very low prevalence of about 2%. However, a confounding factor <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> is the existing policy of screening and use of kidney biopsy as an investigative tool. School children in Japan undergo routine urinalysis (as do army recruits in Singapore) and any suspicious abnormality is pursued with a kidney biopsy, which might partly explain the high observed incidence of IgA nephropathy in those countries.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 {{paper by}} Prof R. Balasubramaniam of the Indian Institute of Technology found Barraud's {{explanation}} of the dimensional errors and the transition between the 23 and 17 gaz grid at the great gate unconvincing. Balasubramaniam conducted dimensional analysis of the complex based on Barraud's surveys. He concluded that the Taj was constructed using the ancient Aṅgula as the basic unit rather than the Mughal 'gaz', noted in the contemporary accounts. The Aṅgula, which equates to 1.763cm and the Vistasti (12 Angulams) were first mentioned in the Arthashastra in c. 300BC {{and may have been}} derived from the earlier Indus Valley Civilisation. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis</b> the forecourt and caravanserai areas were set out with a 60 Vistasti grid, and the riverfront and garden sections with a 90-vistari grid. The transition between the grids is more easily accommodated, 90 being easily divisible by 60. The research suggests that older, pre-Mughal methods of proportion were employed as ordering principles in the Taj.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{analysis}} is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics {{used by many}} governments to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim. This often {{takes the form of}} an interview by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's native language through an interpreter or in an international lingua franca like English. Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved. Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>analysis,</b> linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can {{play a critical role in}} the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.|$|E
