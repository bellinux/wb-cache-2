5000|$|The gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), also spelled <b>grey</b> <b>catbird,</b> is a {{medium-sized}} North American and Central American perching bird of the mimid family. It {{is the only}} member of the [...] "catbird" [...] genus Dumetella. Like the black catbird (Melanoptila glabrirostris), it is among the basal lineages of the Mimidae, probably a closer relative of the Caribbean thrasher and trembler assemblage than of the mockingbirds and Toxostoma thrashers. In some areas it is known as the slate-colored mockingbird.|$|E
50|$|An endemic {{subspecies}} is the Bermuda white-eyed vireo or chick-of-the-village (Vireo griseus bermudianus). The national bird of Bermuda is the white-tailed tropicbird or longtail, {{which is}} a summer migrant to Bermuda, its most northerly breeding site in the world. Other native birds include the eastern bluebird, <b>grey</b> <b>catbird</b> and perhaps the common ground dove. The common moorhen {{is the most common}} native waterbird; very small numbers of American coot and pied-billed grebe are breeding. Small numbers of common tern nest around the coast. The barn owl and mourning dove colonized the island during the 20th century, and the green heron has recently begun to breed.|$|E
50|$|Male <b>grey</b> <b>catbirds</b> fluff their {{feathers}} and spread their lower tails {{to defend their}} territory when threatened by another male. The bird {{that is capable of}} puffing up and appearing to be the biggest will win the territory.|$|R
500|$|The {{feathered}} {{area between}} the [...] and the [...] Also, the collective name for the [...] The crissal thrasher derives {{its name from the}} term, having distinctive colouring in the region, in contrast with the balance of its [...] Other birds having distinctive crissum colouration include Le Conte's thrashers and <b>grey</b> <b>catbirds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{this bird}} is {{widespread}} and still common, it has declined in numbers {{in some areas}} due to loss of suitable habitat. Despite the decrease, the rate does not warrant a status towards vulnerable. One of the natural nuisances is the parasitic brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), but these incidents are rare. Whenever these situations occur, the brown thrashers usually discard of the cowbirds' eggs. Occasionally, the thrasher has thrown out their own eggs instead of the cowbird eggs due to similar egg size, {{and at least one}} recorded event raised a fledgling. Northern cardinals and <b>grey</b> <b>catbirds</b> are also major competitors for thrashers in terms of territorial gain. Because of the apparent lack of opportunistic behavior around species like these, thrashers are prone to be driven out of zones for territory competition. Brown thrashers have tendencies to double-brood or have failures on their first nesting attempts due to predation. <b>Grey</b> <b>catbirds</b> have been seen invading brown thrashers' nests and breaking their eggs. Other than the catbird, snakes, birds of prey, and cats are among the top predators of the thrasher. In Kansas, at least eight species of snake were identifieid as potentially serious sources of nest failure. Among the identified avian predators of adults are Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii), northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), broad-winged hawks (Buteo platypterus), merlins (Falco columbarius), peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), eastern screech-owls (Megascops asio), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) barred owls (Strix varia) and long-eared owls (Asio otus).|$|R
50|$|The male {{brown thrasher}} {{may have the}} largest song {{repertoire}} of any North American bird, which has been documented at least over 1,100. Some sources state that each individual has up to 3,000 song phrases, while others stated beyond 3,000. The males' singing voice usually contains more of a melodic tone {{than that of the}} related <b>grey</b> <b>catbird.</b> Its song are coherent phrases that are iterated no more than three times, but has been done for minutes at a time. By the fall, the male sings with smoother sub-songs. During the winter, the males may also sing in short spurts during altercations with neighboring males.|$|E
40|$|Migratory birds use {{celestial}} and geomagnetic directional {{information to}} orient {{on their way}} between breeding and wintering areas. Cue-conflict experiments involving these two orientation cue systems have shown that directional information can be transferred from one system to the other by calibration. We designed experiments with four species of North American songbirds to: (1) examine whether these species calibrate orientation information from one system to the other; and (2) determine whether there are species-specific differences in calibration. Migratory orientation was recorded with two different techniques, cage tests and free-flight release rests, during autumn migration. Cage tests at dusk in the local geomagnetic field revealed species-specific differences: red-eyed vireo, Vireo olivaceus, and northern waterthrush, Seiurus noveboracensis, selected seasonally appropriate southerly directions whereas indigo bunting, Passerina cyanea, and <b>grey</b> <b>catbird,</b> Dumetella carolinensis, oriented towards the sunset direction. When tested in deflected magnetic fields, vireos and waterthrushes responded by shifting their orientation according to the deflection of the magnetic field, but buntings and catbirds failed to show any response to the treatment. In release tests, all four species showed that they had recalibrated their star compass {{on the basis of}} the magnetic field they had just experienced in the cage tests. Since release tests were done in the local geomagnetic field it seems clear that once the migratory direction is determined, most likely during the twilight period, the birds use their recalibrated star compass for orientation at departure.
