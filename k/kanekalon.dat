50|$|Synthetic dreads, {{also called}} dread extensions, dread falls, and cyberlocks, are {{interlocked}} coils of synthetic hair, mostly <b>kanekalon,</b> {{that give the}} look and feel of natural dreadlocks without the commitment or maintenance. They are mainly worn as a fashion statement for the subculture of cybergoth.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, {{the company}} {{developed}} and marketed [...] "Selesorb", a selective adsorption column for systemic lupus erythematosus. In 1993, the company established Nantong Sunrise Worsted Spinning Co., Ltd. as {{a joint venture}} with Kyusyu <b>Kanekalon</b> Co., Ltd. Kanematsu Corporation, and Toyobo Co., Ltd. In 1997, the company established Kaneka High-Tech Materials, Inc. to succeed the apical operations of Allied-Apical Company, Inc.|$|E
50|$|Other twist hairstyles include Senegalese twists, Marley twists, and Havana twists. All {{of these}} hairstyles require {{specific}} types of hair extensions that are installed to one's head. These styles have been labeled as protective styles because they protect the person's natural hair from daily manipulation. Senegalese twists originated in Senegal, Africa and are commonly performed in African hair salons across the U.S. This style uses synthetic <b>Kanekalon</b> hair, which can last anywhere from one to three months. Marley and Havana twists are more recent hairstyles widely spread through the black hair community in 2013. They look very similar to one another, but have distinct differences. Marley twists use Marley hair extensions {{that can be found}} in most hair supply stores from various hair companies and Havana twists use Havana hair extensions sold by few companies that are only available online. Havana twists are generally done with fewer twists than the Marley hairstyle and also weigh less in density because the hair is much fluffier in texture than Marley hair. Both hairstyles like Senegalese can last from one to three months, but should not be kept in {{for a longer period of}} time. Due to the technique of these hairstyles a person's natural hair can begin to get matted or form into dreadlocks.|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} {{times of}} Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Mg) and Mycoplasma synoviae (Ms) on washed and unwashed natural and synthetic <b>kanekalon</b> hair samples over a 5 -d period were evaluated using the color changing unit method for comparison with results {{of previous studies}} conducted on natural hair. Regardless of whether synthetic or natural hair samples prewashed with a disinfectant shampoo were spiked with Mg or Ms, all viable organisms rapidly dropped below a count of 1 × 101 /mL of culture. unwashed natural hair seeded with a titer of approximately 1 × 106 /mL of viable Mg or Ms decreased to 6 × 105 /mL and 6 × 103 / mL, respectively, by 4 h postseeding, but no viable Mg or Ms were detected on natural hair from 8 h onwards. By contrast, the titers of Mg and Ms on synthetic hair did not decline from the initial 1 × 106 /mL seed dose up to 96 h postseeding, and, in fact, viable Mg and Ms was still detectable at 9 d postinfection. Application of a real-time quantitative single-tube duplex PCR assay confirmed that no proliferation of Mg or Ms had occurred on the synthetic hair samples, the cells simply remained viable. The unexpected finding that Mg and Ms survive for extended periods on synthetic <b>kanekalon</b> hair fibers {{raises the question of}} whether attachment to a surface is a prerequisite for the survival and persistence of Mg and Ms in the extra-host environment. Future studies should be aimed at determining whether other synthetic hair types or indeed other types of plastics commonly found in the poultry house offer similar survival advantages to mycoplasmas.
