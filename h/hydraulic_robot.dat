40|$|Compared to {{conventional}} robot manipulators driven by electrical motors, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>robot</b> arms have richer nonlinear dynamics and stronger couplings among various joints (or hydraulic cylinders). This paper {{focuses on the}} physical model based coordinated adaptive robust control (ARC) strategies that explicitly {{take into account the}} strong coupling among various hydraulic cylinders (or joints). In our recent studies, two such methods were proposed to avoid the need of acceleration feedback in doing ARC backstepping designs. The first method uses an observer to recover the state needed for the ARC backstepping design. The second method utilizes the property that the adjoint matrix and the determinant of the inertial matrix can be linearly parametrized by certain suitably selected parameters and employ certain over-parametrizing techniques. Theoretically, both the resulting ARC controllers guarantee a prescribed output tracking transient performance and final tracking accuracy while achieving asymptotic output tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties only. This paper focuses on the comparative studies of these two methods under various practical constraints.

The control of hydraulically actuated robot manipulator is very challenging due to the highly nonlinearities in its dynamics, uncertainties parameters, and variations on payload. To overcome these problems, an integrated mathematical model of an N degree-of-freedom (dof) <b>hydraulic</b> <b>robot</b> manipulator is treated as a large-scale uncertain system models with bounded uncertainties where the bounds are known.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{proposes a}} gain {{switching}} algorithm for joint position {{control of a}} <b>hydraulic</b> humanoid <b>robot.</b> Accurate position control of the lower body is a {{one of the basic}} requirements for robust balance and walking control. In general, it is more difficult to perform joint position control of <b>hydraulic</b> humanoid <b>robots</b> than electric humanoid robots because of a slower actuator time constant and the backdrivability of hydraulic joints. Because of the backdrivability, external forces and torques have a large effect on the position of the joints, and external ground reaction forces prevent a simple PD joint controller from realizing accurate joint position control. We propose a state feedback controller for joint position control of the lower body, define three modes of state feedback gains, and switch the gains effectively according to the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) using linear interpolation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} described in this thesis was {{to contribute to the}} analytical and experimental development of a new hydraulic tunnel drilling robot which could be used to replace the present tedious, but highly skilled manual operations, which must be carried out in dusty, damp, noisy and often dangerous conditions. In this research, three separate but related investigations were carried out by the author to improve the precision and speed of positioning the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>robot</b> and to reduce its cost. The first investigation was the determination of the kinematics of a new positioning mechanism which has a tripod arrangement of hydraulic cylinders to improve the positioning stiffness of the robot manipulator. The second investigation was {{the development and implementation of}} an optimal tracking control algorithm to improve the precision of the manipulator tracking. The third investigation was the design of a tracking control hydraulic system using a low cost stepping motor driven proportional valve incorporating a pressure compensator to stabilize the flow gain of the valve and automatically compensate for the load disturbances. The design considerations, theoretical analysis, (including the derivation and solution of the inverse kinematics problem) and experimental testing which were related to these three investigations are presented in this thesis. A kinematics model of the drilling robot manipulator was first established by deriving the homogeneous transformation matrices for describing the relationship between the links of the robot manipulator and its work space. A combination of analytical and numerical methods were then used to solve the inverse kinematics problem of the drilling robot manipulator. A three dimensional simulation was then developed to verify the validity of the solution of the inverse kinematics problem. To implement an optimal tracking control algorithm, the dynamics of an experimental <b>hydraulic</b> <b>robot</b> were analyzed and a multiple input fifth order discrete state space model was established for the pitch control hydraulic system of the robot. An optimal tracking control algorithm was then derived and experimentally implemented to improve the tracking precision and positioning speed of the pitch control system of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>robot.</b> The design of the controller was based on the dynamic model of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>robot</b> and the optimal tracking control algorithm. A Kalman filter was designed for observing the state variables of the system. System identification was carried out using a triangle pulse input method that was developed to estimate the parameters of the tracking control system. This method was faster and caused less disturbance to the positioning mechanism than the sine wave and the random signal methods. It also had the advantage of being able to estimate the parameters of the system for both directions of motion of the actuator. A hydraulic circuit, which used a stepping motor driven valve incorporating a pressure compensator to stabilize the flow gain of the valve and which automatically compensated for the load disturbances, was designed and tested in the pitch optimal tracking control system. The comparison of this hydraulic circuit with one using a conventional proportional valve showed that the former improved the tracking performance significantly under large load disturbances and could successfully be used in the robot optimal tracking control system for tracking the given trajectories of displacement, velocity, and acceleration...|$|E

These control methods have highly dynamic structures to minimize the resultant error by optimizing the control signal, but stability is their common problem. This study integrates the classical proportional-derivative (PD) control with the self-tuning adaptive control {{in order to have a}} stable and dynamic control structure. The integral part (I) of PID is replaced by explicit self-tuning control to improve the performance of the proposed controller.

It has been successfully applied to control several different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>robots.</b> On the other hand, hydraulic rotary actuators are types of actuator used when high power-to-size ratio and compact space utilization are required. They come in different types; the helical spline type often introduces backlash nonlinearity into control systems because of gear the transmission involved. Therefore, {{in order to achieve}} good reference tracking performance and guaranteed stability of systems in which they are applied, their backlash has to be somewhat accounted for by incorporating backlash compensation into their main controller structure. Thus, the essence of this research was to design a virtual decomposition controller with the capability to reduce or eliminate the effect of backlash in an application where helical type hydraulic rotary actuators is applied and compare the system performance with that obtained by applying the traditional Proportional- Integral- Differential controller. A general overview of robot control is presented, followed by the definition of basic terms related to virtual decomposition control.
