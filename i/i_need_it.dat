500|$|Widney {{attributed}} his longevity {{to living}} simply and keeping busy. At age 94, Widney advocated [...] "no liquor, no tobacco, no drugs. I'm not a fanatic on liquor, {{but to me}} it is a medicine. I keep it around and take it when <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b> But there is no excuse whatever for tobacco or drugs". He recommended at least eight hours sleep each night and short naps throughout the day.|$|E

I need that money. <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> in my business. <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> worse than anybody has ever needed anything. And I'm going to have it! From now on, until further notice, I am your lady's maid. You can give your present one a holiday." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why? Dad thinks it'd be {{good for}} me," [...] went on Belllounds, now, with strong, self-centered thought. [...] "It'd give me responsibility. I reckon <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b> Why not soon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you'll {{get this}} back with interest, old man. <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> now, but I won't {{six months from}} now. I'm going to strike a job before long--don't you worry." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{was well}} aware of that, but--"Oh, David," [...] she cried, [...] "that you should believe <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it!</b> How little you must think of me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} frankly. [...] "I don't know him very well, but on two {{occasions}} he came to my assistance when <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it.</b> He was very tactful and considerate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are such girls numerous? But why do {{you insist}} on a will {{and the power of}} guiding? It looks as if you thought <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it.</b> Sometimes you're the reverse of flattering." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{she clung}} closer to him, in another burst of tears, {{he kissed her}} on her lips, and, lifting up his eyes, said, 'Oh my God, forgive me, for <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> very much!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to anticipate," [...] Hunterleys confessed, a little wearily. [...] "Things are moving fast now towards the climax. I promise I'll come to you for help if <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b> You can but refuse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That isn't {{exactly what}} I meant, but it can't do me any harm {{coming from a}} man like you, while if it does me any good I daresay <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b> You see, I'm one of the goats," [...] he said.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, Miller {{relocated}} to Los Angeles {{to pursue an}} acting career. He has stated that his rocky road to stardom [...] "was {{a long time in}} the coming and there were a lot of upsets and a lot of failures and roadblocks, but I couldn't walk away from <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> like <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> air, <b>it</b> was just something I had to do." [...] Miller's first TV appearance was as student-turned-sea monster Gage Petronzi on Buffy the Vampire Slayer ("Go Fish", 1998).|$|R

60|$|Obviously if I used my {{knowledge}} I should stand alone and unapproachable until all men were as wise as myself. That would be something, but manlike I was ungrateful. It seemed bitterly unfair that Charlie's memory should fail me when <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> most.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, dear Breeze, fly {{straight}} up till we reach our journey's end. Sunbeam shall light the way; Redleaf shall keep me warm, and Snowflake lie here beside me till <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b> Good-by {{to land and}} sea; now away, up to the sun!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know yet," [...] replied Blakeney, [...] "but {{it would}} not be safe to ride. I'll reach one of the gates {{on this side of the}} city and {{contrive}} to slip in somehow. I have a certificate of safety in my pocket in case <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Dick {{put down}} the drawing-board {{and looked at him}} steadily. [...] "It's very bad taste. In fact, I find myself in a very awkward situation. Your father gave me a fresh start when <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it</b> badly, and agreed when your sister put you in my charge." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bradley {{walked away}} sick at heart.

60|$|That's all it is, Gerald, {{my young}} hero. At any rate we'll spare {{ourselves}} the nausea of stirring the old broth any more. You be beautiful, my Gerald, and reckless.

60|$|Here was a {{man about}} to risk his life--for {{there was no denying}} the fact--in a great sociological experiment, yet they {{received}} the announcement with absolute unconcern.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{to another}} world," [...] replied the {{minister}} with pious resignation.

60|$|They {{passed on}} together. The fair, little lady had favored {{me with a}} very {{perfunctory}} and somewhat insolent glance; Adèle herself left me without a word. I went into the saloon, took my place for dinner, and then sought the deck for some fresh air. I felt that <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank my tutors Martin Rajman and Jean-Cédric Chappelier for {{offering}} me this project and for guiding me through my first experience of research.
