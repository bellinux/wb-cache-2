50|$|Because the small-end {{position}} {{is lower than}} the half-way point of the stroke at 90 degrees and at 270 degrees after TDC, the piston moves less distance when the crank rotates from 90 degrees to 270 degrees after TDC than during the crank rotation from 90 <b>degrees</b> <b>before</b> <b>TDC</b> to 90 degrees after TDC.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} injection timing in diesel combustion. Ansys Fluent a computational fluid dynamics tool is used to study the combustion of diesel with three different injection timing. The fuel is injected <b>before</b> <b>TDC,</b> at TDC and after TDC. The parameters such as temperature, pressure, velocity, density, soot and NOx emission are compared. The specie transport model is used for modelling the combustion. Standard k-e (2 equ) is used for modelling the turbulence. The analysis is carried out by only considering the compression and expansion strokes. The pressure reaches the maximum when the fuel is injected <b>before</b> <b>TDC</b> and the maximum temperature is when injected at TDC. The NOx emission is less when the fuel is injected at TDC and the soot formation is when fuel injected <b>before</b> <b>TDC...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{into the}} mixture {{formation}} {{in a direct}} injection, turbocharged, spark-ignition, CNG engine. The engine features a pent-roof combustion chamber, a bowl in piston and an outward-opening poppet valve injector, which is located centrally in the chamber dome. In the last few years, many {{studies have been conducted}} focusing on direct injection natural gas engines, and the end-of-injection timing has been identified as the main parameter affecting the quality and completeness of the mixture formation process. This paper aims at contributing to the progress of this research field, by means of the presentation and discussion {{of a large number of}} experimental and numerical data. The results obtained from the authors' CFD model, which has been developed and validated within the InGAS Collaborative Project of the EC, are in fact introduced and correlated to the outcomes of the experimental activity done by AVL GmbH, Graz, as part of the same research project. This synergy allowed a deep understanding of the mixture formation process, over a wide range of operating conditions. As a matter of fact, the mixture formation process in a direct injection gaseous-fuel engine differs significantly from direct-injection engines fuelled by gasoline. In fact, the gas jet momentum is lower, reducing the penetration, and the mixture formation strongly relies on the charge motion generated during the intake stroke. More precisely, the work presented in this paper showed that several factors exert an influence on the fuel-air mixing process: jet shape, interaction with piston and/or with the charge motion, and time available for mixing between the end-of-injection and the spark timing, and these may combine differently depending on the specific working point. On an average, at low load and low-medium speeds, the injection should better take place during the second part of the induction stroke. On the other hand, at high speed or high load the injection timing needs to be advanced till around 250 °- 300 ° CA <b>degrees</b> <b>before</b> firing <b>TDC,</b> in order to increase the time available for mixing as much as possibl...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous OH- and {{formaldehyde}} planar-LIF measurements {{have been}} performed in an optical engine using two laser sources working on 283 and 355 nm, respectively. The engine used for the measurements was a car diesel engine converted to single-cylinder operation and modified for optical access. The fuel, n-heptane, was injected by a direct injection common-rail system and the engine was also fitted with an EGR system. The engine was operated in both HCCI mode and diesel mode. Due to the low load, the diesel mode resulted in low-temperature diesel combustion and because of limitations in maximum pressure and maximum rate of pressure increase of the optical engine, the diesel mode was run at a higher EGR percentage than the HCCI mode {{to slow down the}} combustion. A third mode, pilot combustion, was also investigated. This pilot combustion is created by an injection at 30 CAD <b>before</b> <b>TDC</b> followed by a second injection just <b>before</b> <b>TDC.</b> The OH and formaldehyde LIF images were compared with the heat-release calculated from the pressure traces.
