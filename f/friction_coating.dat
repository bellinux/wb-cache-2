40|$|The {{complexity}} of thermal elastohydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) problems {{has led to}} a variety of specialised numerical approaches ranging from finite difference based direct and inverse iterative methods such as Multilevel Multi-Integration solvers, via differential deflection methods, to finite element based full-system approaches. Hence, not only knowledge of the physical and technical relationships but also knowledge of the numerical procedures and solvers is necessary to perform TEHL simulations. Considering {{the state of the art}} of multiphysics software, the authors note the absence of a commercial software package for solving TEHL problems embedded in larger multiphysics software. By providing guidelines on how to implement a TEHL simulation model in commercial multiphysics software, the authors want to stimulate the research in computational tribology, so that, hopefully, the research focus can be shifted even more on physical modelling instead of numerical modelling.

Slipway stations consist of an initial section where the boat is held on rollers followed by an inclined keelway of nickel/chromium coated steel, the lifeboat is released {{from the top of the}} slipway and proceeds under its own weight into the water. The lifeboat is subsequently recovered to the top of the slipway using a winch line. With the introduction of the new, larger Tamar class lifeboat existing boathouses are being upgraded and existing low <b>friction</b> <b>coated</b> steel slipway lining materials replaced with a low-friction jute fibre/phenolic resin composite, which is designed to operate with unlubricated conditions. This has led to problems of high wear on slipway panels, particularly where the lifeboat mounts the slipway for recovery. This paper describes a method for assessing slipway lining materials and lubricants. The selection of an appropriate test machine, the TE 92 rotary tribometer, and design of a modified ring on disc arrangement incorporating panel interfaces and attaching holes effects is described. An experimental methodology is developed using programmed running intervals to simulate dwell effects. Experimental data is thus presented to establish slipway panel wear rates for a range of lubricants and contact pressures. Experimental results are incorporated into real-world slipway surveys to develop the wear scenario. Results and implications of this research for future lifeboat slipway design are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Today {{sheet metal}} forming is {{used to make a}} variety of mass {{production}} because it has a high production rate. One of the biggest concerns in {{sheet metal forming}} is wear of the tool in form of galling. Galling in sheet metal forming is characterised by an increased tool surface roughness, unstable friction in the forming process and undesirable scratches on the final products. Several ways of ranking materials resistance to galling exist today but only ASM G 98 is standardised. Nevertheless, some different methods developed for ranking tool materials’ tendency to galling have also been developed. The aim of this thesis is to develop and improve the Uddeholm Tooling Tribo Test rig located at Uddeholm Tooling AB. The rig, which is a variation of cylinder-on-cylinder test equipment, was improved with a new tool holder, a utilization of the real sheet material counter face and a new data acquisition system and software. The galling was detected using scratches on the sheet, metallographic analysis of the material adhered on the tool specimen, monitoring of coefficient of friction and the standard deviation of the coefficient of friction. The obtained results show difficulties with ranking of tool materials in terms of galling resistance under non-lubricated conditions. The tool steels tested were SVERKER 21 and UNIMAX. AISI 304 - 10, DC 04 and DOCOL 1000 DP sheets were used. Additionally a low <b>friction</b> <b>coating</b> of BalinitC on SVERKER 21 was also included. All specimens of the tool steels showed signs of galling on every run, only the low <b>friction</b> <b>coating</b> showed a transition in behaviour of friction coefficient corresponding to galling initiation. The standard deviation of the coefficient of friction increased at low loads. A decrease of the test loads led to stability loss of the system detected by an increase in the standard deviation of the coefficient of friction. This might happen because the Kistler platform is originally designed for larger loads. Although, the test rig does not work properly in its present state, the concept looks promising...|$|E

A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) layer adhered through a polydopamine (PDA) layer on a steel substrate will reduce the coefficient of friction on the substrate surface. This paper discusses different methods for attempting to increase the uniformity of the PDA layer as well as decrease the PDA coating time. Methods for increasing uniformity include using a particle disperser instead of a magnet stir rod, changing the orientation of the coating surface in the solution, and changing the position of the coating surface in the solution. The PDA deposition time was decreased by increasing the temperature of the PDA solution. After applying the PDA layer onto the steel substrate, a PTFE layer was applied to the steel substrate by dipcoating. The different samples were tested for coefficient of friction and durability cycles.

By dynamically changing the friction, we are able to bring the sample from a static state into motion via UV exposure. When in motion, the friction coefficient can be altered further by modulating the light conditions. E. g. a smooth sliding can transfer into an interlocking state, or vice versa.

40|$|The {{frictional}} {{behavior of}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) films varies with environmental condition.

Testing of the frictional performance of DLC films in a pin-on-disk contact has mapped the transient behavior of the friction coefficient. A model for fractional coverage, based on the adsorption of environmental contaminants and their removal through the pin contact, is developed. The rate of adsorption is taken from Langmuir's model [1], which is combined with the removal rate from Blanchet and Sawyer [2]. The coefficient of friction is based on the average fractional coverage under the pin contact. The model also gives a closed-form expression for the steady-state fractional coverage.
