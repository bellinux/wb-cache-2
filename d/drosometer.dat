50|$|A <b>drosometer</b> (from Classical Greek , drosos, dew + , metron, measure) is an {{apparatus}} {{for measuring the}} quantity of dew formed in a unit of time per unit area of surface.|$|E
50|$|A {{classical}} {{device for}} dew measurement is the <b>drosometer.</b> A small, artificial condenser surface is suspended from an arm {{attached to a}} pointer or a pen that records the weight changes of the condenser on a drum. Besides being very wind sensitive, however, this, like all artificial surface devices, only provides {{a measure of the}} meteorological potential for dew formation. The actual amount of dew in a specific place is strongly dependent on surface properties. For its measurement, plants, leaves, or whole soil columns are placed on a balance with their surface at the same height and in the same surroundings as would occur naturally, thus providing a small lysimeter. Further methods include estimation by means of comparing the droplets to standardized photographs, or volumetric measurement of the amount of water wiped from the surface. Some of these methods include guttation, while others only measure dewfall and/or distillation.|$|E
50|$|Many {{peculiarities of}} the {{deposition}} of dew on different objects are explained {{in detail in}} the popular work by Charles Tomlinson, entitled The Dew-drop and the Mist (London, 1860). Moreover, {{the case of the}} natural deposition of dew on the grass and other plants very near the surface of the ground is not at all parallel to that where it is deposited upon metal plates or other bodies used as <b>drosometers,</b> partly because of the location, partly because of the difference in the substances, and largely because of the influence of slight local currents of air.|$|R
