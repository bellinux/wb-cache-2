5|$|In his history, Harry Altham {{wrote that}} the 1884 Australians have been equated with the 1882 team but <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> {{disagreed}} with that assessment. He added that George Giffen considered England's team in the final Test {{to have been the}} strongest of the nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In parallel, <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> {{became a}} {{representative}} of literary and artistic Symbolism, and supposedly maintained contacts with authors such as Joris-Karl Huysmans, Maurice Maeterlinck, Octave Mirbeau, Jean Moréas, and Paul Verlaine. Another influence on him was the occultist and novelist Joséphin Péladan, whose Rosicrucian salon he attended several times.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015 playoffs, Getzlaf {{tied the}} {{previous}} Ducks {{record for most}} assists in a post-season – which <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> set in 2009 – at 14 when he provided the primary assist on teammate Simon Després' game-winning goal in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks on May 22, 2015.|$|E

60|$|But, let Skrebensky do what <b>he</b> would, betray <b>himself</b> entirely, <b>he</b> betrayed <b>himself</b> always {{upon his}} own responsibility. He {{permitted}} {{no question about}} <b>himself.</b> <b>He</b> was irrevocable in his isolation.|$|R

5|$|Ludwig Metzger {{had been}} trying to promote his {{proposal}} for a film on the life of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer since as early as 1921 but without any success. The publication of Feuchtwanger's book and Mendes' film adaptation of it irritated Metzger because <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> had been incubating the idea for many years.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} criticisms Steiner {{received}} was that <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> believed what his fictive Hitler said about the Jews. It was also thought {{that at the end}} of the London theatre production, the audience were applauding Hitler and not the play.|$|E
5|$|Saint Francis of Assisi is {{credited}} with creating the first live nativity scene in 1223 in order to cultivate the worship of Christ. <b>He</b> <b>himself</b> had recently been inspired by {{his visit to the}} Holy Land, where he'd been shown Jesus's traditional birthplace. The scene's popularity inspired communities throughout Catholic countries to stage similar pantomimes.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus was {{so great}} a person by reason both of his {{excessive}} haughtiness and of his vast power, that, to put it briefly, <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> {{seemed to be the}} emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of Capreae.|$|E

60|$|No. He obeyed his Father utterly, and at all costs. <b>He</b> emptied <b>himself</b> (says St. Paul). He took on him {{the form}} of a slave. <b>He</b> humbled <b>himself.</b> <b>He</b> became obedient; obedient to death; and that death the shameful and dreadful death of the cross.|$|R
60|$|At length <b>he</b> flung <b>himself</b> {{upon his}} knees to address {{not so much}} a prayer as a maudlin {{grievance}} to his Creator. <b>He</b> felt <b>himself</b> a craven--doubly so by virtue of the peaceful breathing of that sinner he despised--and <b>he</b> told <b>himself</b> that it was not in fear a gentleman should meet his end.|$|R
5|$|Wilson {{used the}} money he won in the libel case to support a London {{production}} of Boughton's opera The Lily Maid, which <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> conducted at the Winter Garden Theatre in January 1937. He was praised for his assured beat and experienced direction.|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, Macrinus {{sent his}} son Diadumenian to Artabanus V of Parthia, while <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> {{returned}} to Antioch, proclaiming himself victorious over Elagabalus in battle. News spread of Macrinus' defeat, however, and many civilians who had supported him were slain {{in the city}} and on the roads. Macrinus then shaved off his beard and hair to disguise himself {{as a member of the}} military police. Fleeing the city at night on horseback, he reached Cilicia along with a few companions, masqueraded as a military courier, and secured a carriage to drive to Eribolon, near Nicomedia. From there he set sail for Chalcedon.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from his war service, Keenor met Muriel Griffiths, a church organist from Swansea {{who had worked}} in a munitions factory during the First World War.

The couple {{would go on to}} have seven children together, their final child Graham being born in 1931.

5|$|Although outnumbered ten-to-one by the Pakistani troops, the Sikhs {{repelled}} {{their attacks}} multiple times. With their ammunition running out, Singh ordered {{his men to}} join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With the help of another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, boosting the morale of his men and intermittently throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold {{the first line of}} trenches.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} morning of 13 March 1806 {{he was in the}} Mid-Atlantic when his lookouts spotted sails in the distance. Turning his force around to investigate, Linois hoped to {{encounter}} a merchant convoy but instead discovered the large British second rate HMS London looming out of the darkness ahead. Unable to escape, Linois fought until his ships were battered and <b>he</b> <b>himself</b> was badly wounded, but he eventually surrendered to the squadron under Admiral Warren that had followed London. Napoleon's fury at Linois was unabated and the French admiral remained a prisoner of war for the next eight years.|$|E
5|$|Gerard was {{a patron}} of learning, {{to the extent}} that he urged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a {{language}} not commonly studied at that time. <b>He</b> <b>himself</b> was a student of astrology, which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside York Minster after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch.|$|E
