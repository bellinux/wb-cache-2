5|$|The Supreme Court would {{eventually}} reverse criminal convictions {{due to the}} exclusion of women <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool in Taylor v. Louisiana (1975) and Duren v.

5|$|The theory behind SJS is that juror attitudes predict voting {{preferences}} most effectively. By discovering what relationships {{exist between}} certain attitudes, attorneys can exclude those <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> whose attitudes would predispose {{them to a}} bad verdict.|$|E

5|$|Raymond grows {{furious with}} Rusty's {{handling}} of the case, but admits that he had also been romantically involved with Carolyn at one time. Rusty calls on Sandy Stern, a top defense attorney. At trial, it is revealed that the beer glass is missing, and Stern persuades Judge Larren Lyttle to keep this <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury.</b> Raymond testifies and perjures himself, claiming that Rusty insisted on handling the investigation, thus confirming the defense's claim of a frame-up. Rusty discovers that Carolyn had acquired a file for a bribery case involving a man named Leon Wells. Upon being confronted by Rusty and Lipranzer, Wells confesses that he paid Judge Lyttle $1,500 to have criminal charges against him dropped, with Carolyn acting as a facilitator.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendants}} argued: (1) {{that the}} indictment {{should have been}} quashed because {{of the absence of}} women from the grand jury; (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court; (3) that the indictment was duplicitous, inconsistent, and vague; (4) that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict; (5) that the trial judge should have granted a continuance, rather than appoint Stewart to represent Kretske; (6) that Roth should have been severed from the other defendants; (7) that the reports of the Alcohol Tax Unit were hearsay; (7) that the two government exhibits not admitted into evidence were sent to the jury during its deliberations; (8) that Glasser had been cross-examined on matters not pertinent to the charge and not within the scope of his direct examination; (9) that the cross-examination of U.S. Attorney Campbell had been unduly restricted; (10) that evidence beyond the scope of the bill of particulars had been introduced; (11) that there was insufficient corroboration of the accomplice testimony against Kretske; (12) that certain testimony of Alexander Campbell was erroneously admitted; (13) that the admission of various prejudicial evidence had the cumulative effect of denying the defendants a fair trial; (14) that the trial judge's cross-examination of witnesses and other comments crossed the line into advocacy; and (15) that the trial judge should have granted a new trial because of the exclusion of women <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool.|$|E

25|$|Bugliosi {{criticized the}} {{prosecution}} for trying the murder in Los Angeles rather than Santa Monica. During the jury selection process, the defense {{made it difficult}} for the prosecution to challenge potential black jurors, {{on the grounds that it}} is illegal to dismiss someone <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> for racially motivated reasons. (California courts barred peremptory challenges to jurors based on race in People v. Wheeler, years before the U.S. Supreme Court would do so in Batson v. Kentucky).|$|E

25|$|During jury selection, the {{prosecutors}} used peremptory strikes {{to remove all}} four black prospective jurors <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool, resulting in an all-white jury.

The trial judge dismissed the challenge and empaneled the jury, which convicted Foster of the murder and sentenced him to death. After sentencing, Foster filed a motion {{for a new trial}} {{on the grounds that the}} jury selection violated the US Supreme Court's Batson decision. The trial court denied the motion, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.|$|E

500|$|The Court further held that: [...] "The {{deliberate}} {{selection of}} jurors from {{the membership of}} particular private organizations definitely does not conform to the traditional requirements of jury trial." [...] But, the Court held that the submission of an affidavit, even if un-contradicted, which contained an offer to prove the exclusion of women <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool was insufficient to preserve the error; instead, the defendants must actually introduce evidence, or attempt to formally offer evidence, to support the claim.|$|E
500|$|Further, Glasser {{held that}} the {{exclusion}} of women (other than members of the League of Women Voters who had taken a jury training class) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> pool violated the Impartial Jury Clause of the Sixth Amendment, but declined to reverse the other two convictions on this ground for technical reasons.
