25|$|Vongerichten {{claims to}} have invented molten {{chocolate}} cake in New York City in 1987, but the French chef and chocolatier Jacques Torres has disputed that, arguing that such a dish already existed in France. According to Vongerichten, he pulled a chocolate sponge cake <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> before it was done {{and found that the}} center was still runny, but was warm and had both a good taste and a good texture.|$|E
25|$|After dry roasting, peanuts {{are removed}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} and directly placed in a blower-cooler cylinder. There are suction fans in the metal cylinder that can pull a large volume of air through, so the peanuts can be cooled more efficiently. The peanuts will not be dried out because cooling can help retain some oil and moisture. The cooling process is completed when the temperature in the cylinder reaches 30℃.|$|E
25|$|The baking of matzo is labor-intensive, as only 18–22 {{minutes is}} {{permitted}} between {{the mixing of}} flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> Consequently, {{only a small number}} of matzos can be baked at one time, and the chabura members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up; this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.|$|E

25|$|Another Shabbat dish is calf's foot jelly, called p'tsha or šaltiena in Lithuania and galarita, galer, galleh, or fisnoge in Poland. Beef or calf {{bones are}} put up to boil with water, seasonings, garlic and onions {{for a long}} time. It is then allowed to cool. The broth then jells into a {{semi-solid}} mass, which is served in cubes.

25|$|The {{staple of}} the Parisian diet was bread; unlike rural France, where peasants ate dark bread, baked weekly, Parisians {{preferred}} a spongy white bread with a firm crust, fresh <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> which they commonly ate by soaking it in a meat bouillon. It {{was similar to the}} modern baguette, not invented until the 20th century, but took longer to make. Parisians ate an average of 500 grams of bread, or two loaves a day; laborers consumed four loaves a day. Napoleon wanted to avoid the popular uprisings of 1789 caused by bread shortages, so the price of bread was strictly controlled between 1800 and 1814, and was much lower than outside the city. Parisians were very attached to their variety of bread; in times of grain shortages, when the government attempted to substitute cheaper dark breads, the Parisians refused to buy them.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is known}} for {{gingerbread}} biscuits which were first made in 1740 by William Eggleston. Eggleston, a baker by trade, was a producer of a biscuit called Grantham Whetstones. Whetsones were a rusk like dry biscuit enjoyed locally and also by coach drivers who used to stop in Grantham to change their horses whilst travelling on the Great North road. According to folklore, Egglestone, whilst baking whetsones in his dimly lit kitchen one morning, mistook one ingredient for another, resulting in a ginger-like biscuit to emerge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> The mistake was a huge success and the biscuit became established as Grantham gingerbread, known as a white gingerbread {{because it is not}} made with molasses or black treacle. This provides a delicate ginger flavour, rich in butter, with a domed top that has a crackled surface. The centre is hollow and resembles a honeycomb.|$|E
60|$|In a bake-shop was a mill for {{grinding}} the grain, and the furnaces {{for baking}} the bread: {{and they say}} that here, in the same furnaces, the exhumers of Pompeii found nice, well baked loaves which the baker had not found time to remove <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ovens</b> <b>the</b> last time he left his shop, because circumstances compelled him to leave in such a hurry.|$|R

25|$|It {{was almost}} {{impossible}} to walk in the narrow streets of Paris, due to the mud and traffic, and the Champs-Élysées did not yet exist, so upper and middle class Parisians took their promenades on the grand boulevards, in the public and private parks and gardens, and above all in the Palais-Royal. The arcades of the Palais-Royal, as described by the German traveler Berkheim in 1807, contained boutiques with glass show windows displaying jewelry, fabrics, hats, perfumes, boots, dresses, paintings, porcelain, watches, toys, lingerie, and every type of luxury goods. In addition there were offices of doctors, dentists and opticians, bookstores, offices for changing money, and salons for dancing, playing billiards and cards. There were fifteen restaurants and twenty-nine cafes, plus stalls which offered fresh waffles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> sweets, cider and beer. The galleries also offered gambling salons and expensive houses of prostitution. The gallery was busy from the early morning, when people came to read the newspapers and do business, and became especially crowded between five and eight in the evening. At eleven, when the shops closed and the theaters finished, a new crowd arrived, along with several hundred prostitutes, seeking clients. The gates were closed at midnight.|$|E
500|$|The death-lay's {{version of}} the bishop's death was {{different}} from the vita. The bishop's killer was called Lalli. Lalli's wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food, cake <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> and beer from the cellar, for himself and hay for his horse, and left nothing but ashes. This is supposed to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake Köyliönjärvi. There he killed him on the spot with an axe. Lalli then proceeded to steal the late holy man’s hat, called a mitre, and place it on his own head. When Lalli’s mother questioned him about where he found the hat, he attempted to take it off, but with it came his scalp. Lalli then died a painful death. The 17th century lay version smugly comments that: ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{a legend}} related by Bertarius of Verdun, one day Paulus {{was working in}} the bakery in the Abbey of Tholey when the oven malfunctioned.

2500|$|Water {{and other}} [...] liquids can {{superheat}} when heated {{in a microwave}} oven in a container with a smooth surface. That is, the liquid reaches a temperature slightly above its normal boiling point without bubbles of vapour forming inside the liquid. The boiling process can start explosively when the liquid is disturbed, such as when the user takes hold of the container to remove it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> or while adding solid ingredients such as powdered creamer or sugar. This can result in spontaneous boiling (nucleation) which may be violent enough to eject the boiling liquid from the container and cause severe scalding.|$|E

2500|$|Mass {{distribution}} of Right Marital Living through the U.S. Mail after its publication as a featured {{article in the}} medical journal The Chicago Clinic led to an 1899 Chicago Federal indictment of Craddock. [...] She pleaded guilty and received a suspended sentence. [...] A subsequent 1902 New York Federal trial on charges of sending The Wedding Night through the mail during a sting operation ended with her conviction. She refused to plead insanity as a condition to avoid prison time {{and was sentenced to}} three months in prison, much of which she served in Blackwell's Island workhouse. Upon her release, Anthony Comstock immediately re-arrested her for violations of the federal Comstock law and on October 10 she was tried and convicted, the judge declaring that The Wedding Night was so “obscene, lewd, lascivious, dirty” that the jury {{should not be allowed to}} see it during the trial. At age forty-five, she saw her five-year sentence as a life term and so committed suicide, by slashing her wrists and inhaling natural gas <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> in her apartment, on October 16, 1902, the day before reporting to Federal prison. [...] She penned a private final letter to her mother as well as a lengthy public suicide note condemning Comstock, her personal nemesis.
