Two types of red mud from China were used in the experiments. Concrete in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the compressive strength and dry shrinkage of concrete. <b>Grout</b> <b>mortars</b> in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the flexural and compressive strengths, dry shrinkage and water permeability of mortar. Cement paste in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the capacity of Cs adsorption and ionic leaching. The results show that addition of red mud does not contribute to nor impair the strength of the concrete or <b>grout</b> <b>mortar</b> but instead acts as inert filler. The decrease in compressive strength of concrete with addition of red mud is mainly due to the increased water-cement ratio. There is no significant increase in dry shrinkage of concrete with addition of red mud, but there is a certain increase in dry shrinkage of <b>grout</b> <b>mortar,</b> especially when more than 20 % of the binder is replaced by red mud. Addition of red mud in <b>grout</b> <b>mortar</b> significantly increases the water permeability of the mortar due to the increased water-cement ratio. Owing to the fluctuant results from the adsorption test, it is difficult to draw a conclusion of the adsorption capacity for Cs by addition of red mud in concrete.

Yet when it comes to cold regions like Alaska, new {{challenges}} caused by the harsh environment need to be resolved before they are used extensively in cold regions. One challenge associated with anchor installation could be the potential thawing of warm permafrost due to the <b>grout</b> <b>mortar</b> hydration, which might undermine the capacity of the anchor. Another challenge is that due to low temperature the grout may cure slower or not cure at all, which will also result in a significant decrease in the ultimate strength of the anchor. Field tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of shallow anchors including duckbill anchors and grouted anchors with three types of different grouting materials, including Microsil Anchor Grout, Bentonite Clay and a newly-developed Antifreeze <b>Grout</b> <b>Mortar.</b> Constant-load creep test and pullout test were conducted to evaluate the performance of the anchors.

40|$|As {{fractures}} in rock {{significantly reduce the}} strength {{as well as the}} stiffness of the rock mass, grouting may be required to improve the performance of the rock mass in engineering or mining projects. During <b>grouting,</b> <b>mortar</b> of cement or other materials is injected into the rock mass so that the fractures can be filled up and the rock mass can act as an integral unit. Unlike water, grouts are usually viscous and behave as non-Newtonian fluids. Therefore, the equations describing the flow of grout are more complicated and the solutions are quite difficult to obtain. The problem is further aggravated {{by the fact that the}} fractures are mostly randomly distributed, and it is rarely possible to accurately define the fractures and the distribution patterns. In this paper, a numerical model is proposed for analyzing the grouting process. The model is based on the stochastic approach, and it can provide the depth of penetration and the fluid pressure due to the flow of grout, which is modeled as a Bingham fluid, in the fractured rock mass. Parametric studies have been carried out to investigate the effects of various factors on the depth of penetration, and a regression formula is developed for calculating the penetration depth. Experiments have been carried out and their results are used to validate the present method. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

In this way, these self?healing materials and intelligent structures will significantly enhance durability and serviceability, improve safety and reduce maintenance costs. The conglomerate materials that form the basis of the majority of such construction materials (concrete, <b>grouts,</b> <b>mortars,</b> hydraulically bound materials, grouted soils etc), are extremely complex multiphase composites with multi?scale internal structures that exhibit a hierarchy of multi?dimensional, time?dependent damage mechanisms. For example, in cementitious composites nano?scale damage occurs during hydration and the strength development phase, while medium?term damage due to chemical attack also leads to the formation of defects in its structure. Other short?term factors can also produce dislocations at the nano-scale. In time, this nano?damage grows to form micro-cracks which eventually coalesce to form networks of meso?cracks which in turn lead to debonding between the paste and aggregate particles, followed by a discrete number of visible macro?cracks which so often lead to corrosion of the steel reinforcement. Hence, it is evident that to truly achieve a self?healing cementitious composite, a system is needed that can act at both the different time and length scales at which the damage can form.
