Figure 7 shows the interesting fact that the main amplifier does not satisfy the port conditions at its input and output unless the ground connections are chosen to make that happen. For example, on the input side, the current entering the main amplifier is IS. This current is divided three ways: to the feedback network, to the bias resistor RB and to the base resistance of the input transistor rπ. To satisfy the port condition for the main amplifier, all three components must be returned to the input side of the main amplifier, which means all the ground leads labeled G1 must be connected, as well as <b>emitter</b> <b>lead</b> GE1. Likewise, on the output side, all ground connections G2 must be connected and also ground connection GE2.

40|$|Superradiance is a {{signature}} effect in quantum photonics {{that explains the}} collective enhancement of emission power {{by a factor of}} N 2 when N emitters are placed in subwavelength proximity. Although the effect is inherently transient, successful {{attempts have been made to}} sustain it in the steady-state regime. Until recently, the effects of superradiance were not considered to be applicable to thermal emitters due to their intrinsic incoherent nature. Novel nanophotonic thermal emitters display favourable coherent characteristics that enable them to obey principles of superradiance. However, published analytical work on conventional superradiant thermal emitter assemblies show an anomalous power scaling of 1 /N and therefore, increasing the number of thermal <b>emitters</b> <b>leads</b> to a degeneration of power at resonance. This phenomenon immediately renders the effect of thermal superradiance futile since it cannot outperform non-coupled emitters in the steady-state regime. We propose an alternative assembly of thermal emitters with specific features that improves the power scaling while maintaining the effects of superradiance. In essence, we show that our emitter assembly achieves superior power delivery over conventional non-coupled emitter systems at resonance.

Another field of application is a medical use of red lasers. The German funded project ROLAS combines medical and technical aspects of photodynamic therapy (PDT). One special approach under investigation is a laser bar based multi-port PDT system: To allow the optimum treatment of widespread, complex-shaped tumors a PDT laser system with 8 independently operable fiber outputs is designed, based on two laser bars with 652 nm emission and independently addressable emitters. The necessity of individually addressable <b>emitters</b> <b>leads</b> to a more complex and allows a thermally less optimized package design.

The enhancement spectra, {{as well as the}} near-field and charge distribution were inspected to uncover the physics underlying behind the optical responses. The conditionally optimized coupled systems were qualified by the product of the radiative rate enhancements at the excitation and emission, which is nominated as Px factor.

The Px factor is 529 -fold with 49. 7 % cQE at the emission.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we study}} a novel class of laser devices, {{referred}} to as half-Josephson lasers (HJL). Here, lasing at half the Josephson frequency is induced by a parametric instability, resulting from an oscillating supercurrent flowing through a Josephson junction that contains quantum emitters. The device combines the electronic coherence of superconductivity with the optical coherence of lasers, resulting in a phase lock between the optical phase and the superconducting phase difference across the junction. Apart from the introductory first chapter, this dissertation consists of two parts. In the first part, the essentials of HJL devices are investigated. First, we study a model containing a Josephson junction with a single quantum emitter. Spontaneous switchings in the quantum <b>emitter</b> <b>lead</b> to decoherence of the laser. After this, a general HJL model is derived for the case of many quantum emitters driving the laser mode. Here, small fluctuations in the laser lead to a broad background in the laser spectrum. Large fluctuations, occurring on exponentially long timescales, cause decoherence. In {{the second part of}} the dissertation, two possible applications of the HJL are investigated, both exploiting the phase lock. First, a well-known optical feedback technique is found to lead to significant stabilization of fluctuations in the bias voltage of the HJL, which cause drift of the optical and superconducting phases. After this, a HJL device is proposed based on the Superconducting Quantum Interference Device. In this `light-superconducting interference device’ (LSID), magnetic fields can be used to manipulate the laser light. The LSID is also shown to facilitate multimode lasing.

40|$|The {{failure of}} two {{transistors}} in the Altitude Switch Assembly for the Solid Rocket Booster {{followed by two}} additional failures a year later presented a challenge to failure analysts. These devices had successfully worked for many years on numerous missions. There was no history of failures {{with this type of}} device. Extensive checks of the test procedures gave no indication for a source of the cause. The devices were manufactured more than twenty years ago and failure information on this lot date code was not readily available. External visual exam, radiography, PEID, and leak testing were performed with nominal results Electrical testing indicated nearly identical base-emitter and base-collector characteristics (both forward and reverse) with a low resistance short emitter to collector. These characteristics are indicative of a classic failure mechanism called punchthrough. In failure analysis punchthrough refers to an condition where a relatively low voltage pulse causes the device to conduct very hard producing localized areas of thermal runaway or "hot spots". At {{one or more of these}} hot spots, the excessive currents melt the silicon. Heavily doped emitter material diffuses through the base region to the collector forming a diffusion pipe shorting the emitter to base to collector. Upon cooling, an alloy junction forms between the pipe and the base region. Generally, the hot spot (punch-through site) is under the bond and no surface artifact is visible. The devices were delidded and the internal structures were examined microscopically. The gold <b>emitter</b> <b>lead</b> was melted on one device, but others had anomalies in the metallization around the in-tact emitter bonds. The SEM examination confirmed some anomalies to be cosmetic defects while other anomalies were artifacts of the punchthrough site. Subsequent to these analyses, the contractor determined that some irregular testing procedures occurred at the time of the failures heretofore unreported. These testing irregularities involved the use of a breakout box and were the likely cause of the failures. There was no evidence to suggest a generic failure mechanism was responsible for the failure of these transistors...|$|E

Positron emission tomography (PET) {{has one of the highest}} diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the detection of skeletal metastases (Hamaoka et al. 2004), when used with the cyclotron produced [18 F]NaF. Actually more common is the use of 99 mTc-bisphosphonate compounds in the whole body scintigraphy (Evan-Sapir et al. 2006). The positron emitter 68 Ga has several advantages, which makes it an interesting object in the development of radiopharmaceuticals. First of all it is the cyclotron independent availability based on the 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator system—similar to the availability of 98 mTc, and second, it is the intense emission of positrons—similar to 18 F. Finally, it is the principle of the bifunctional chelating agent to design radiometal, in particular *Me(III), based pharmaceuticals. Substitution of β+ by β- or α-particle <b>emitters</b> <b>leads</b> in principle to a theranostic concept, wherein diagnosis and therapy is combined in one precursor molecule.

First promising human applications reported for [68 Ga]BPAMD showed PET scans of equal quality to [18 F]NaF and particularly a higher SUVmax in seleceted bone lesions (Fellner et al. 2010). In addition Passah et al. reported the use of a bisphosphonate conjugated to NOTA (1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane- 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraacetic acid) chelator to detect bone metastases efficiently (Passah et al. 2014; Pfannkuchen et al. 2015).|$|R
