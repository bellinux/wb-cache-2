2500|$|On November 2, 2015, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Debre Katz Weintraub ruled Cosby and {{his former}} lawyer Martin Singer must give a {{deposition}} despite their efforts to have the case thrown out (Singer is not named as a defendant in the case). The ruling states Dickinson's lawyers can only seek answers {{as to whether the}} denials were made maliciously, and Cosby and Singer can assert attorney-client privilege and refuse to answer some questions. Singer was scheduled to be deposed November 19 in Los Angeles, with Cosby's deposition occurring on November 23 in Boston. On November 12, a California appeals court temporarily halted an order requiring them to testify. Both parties are required to provide information by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> to state their cases as to why or why not the deposition should proceed. [...] "We are confident that once the Court of Appeals hears full argument on the issues it will allow the deposition of Mr. Cosby and his attorney to go forward," [...] Dickinson's attorney Lisa Bloom wrote in an email. An email sent to Cosby's Attorney seeking comment was not answered. Marty Singer announced that he was planning a new legal move of his own. [...] "I'm looking forward to pursuing claims against Janice Dickinson and Lisa Bloom after I prevail in this action," [...] Singer told Deadline tonight.|$|E

Prime Minister Kilman {{had just}} sacked Justice Minister Yoan Simon, who had [...] "reportedly backed the oppositionâ€™s {{plans for a}} motion of no confidence" [...] in him, and needed to shore up his {{coalition}} government by bringing in a new party. Kilman offered a Cabinet position to the Republican Party, who demanded the Lands Ministry. Consequently, Alfred Carlot replaced Regenvanu as Minister for Lands, while Regenvanu {{was appointed to the}} vacant position of Minister for Justice. Ben Bohane, of the Pacific Institute of Public Policy, remarked that Regenvanu seemed to have been [...] "sacrificed to allow the [...] to come in as a coalition partner for the government. The government's numbers are very shaky. Parliament is set to resume some time at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> and again there is ongoing talk of a vote of no confidence." [...] Radio New Zealand International, describing Regenvanu as a reformer during his three weeks as Minister for Lands, noted: [...] "Reliable sources from the office of the opposition say Mr Kilman {{had no choice but to}} make the reshuffle to stay in power." [...] Radio Australia noted that he had been [...] "transferred due to political pressure", as the government tried to maintain a viable parliamentary majority. It added that Regenvanu was [...] "not happy about leaving before finishing significant changes to the laws on land ownership". Carlot said he would continue Regenvanu's reforms aimed at rooting out and prevent corrupt practices.|$|E

40|$|The initial aim of {{the present}} chapter {{was to assess the}} {{suitability}} of a fish oil diet to correct the metabolic and hormonal defects otherwise encountered in rats deprived of a dietary supply of long-chain polyunsaturated Ï‰ 3 fatty acids. For such a purpose, 8 groups of 4 rats each were first exposed from the 8 th week after birth and for the ensuing 3 months to either a soya oil or sunflower oil diet and then examined at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> 3 <b>months</b> initial period or after a further period of one, two or 8 weeks exposure to a fish oil diet. The fatty acid profile of jejunum, caecum, liver, red blood cells and brain phospholipids, as well as liver triglycerides and visceral adipose tissue lipids, was analyzed. Changes in food intake, body weight and the HOMA index for insulin resistance were also monitored. The results document the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>this</b> procedure for the correction of both the Ï‰ 3 deficiency and insulin resistance, without any undesirable increase in liver steatosis, visceral obesity, food intake or body weight. Emphasis is also placed on the dual regulation of the lipid fatty acid profile as attributable to either a direct link with the fatty acid content of the diet or the transfer of information from one organ to another.
