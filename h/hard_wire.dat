50|$|As in many things, {{no single}} wire {{is perfect for}} all applications. Soft wire is easy to bend and shape, but the {{finished}} product may be bent out of shape if squeezed. <b>Hard</b> <b>wire</b> is difficult to bend but makes permanent shapes. Half-hard wire is a compromise between the two. Wire-wrapped jewelry {{can be made by}} wire which is initially soft, simplifying fabrication, but later hardened by hammering or by work hardening.|$|E

In the fall of 2009, the school acquired the new building and the computer lab {{was set up in}} the library as part of an information resource center. In the fall of 2010, Destiny was purchased and the school signed an online subscription. GRASP and funds from the school’s budget were used to authorize legal software and to purchase 14 updated computers.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{band members}} and {{employees}} {{felt that he}} did not fit in with the Dead ethos despite his longstanding friendships with Lesh and Garcia; for example, {{he was a member of}} the Church of Scientology throughout his tenure with the band and thus declined to become re-involved with LSD and other drugs. According to band manager Rock Scully, [...] "He was sooo different. You know, he was like a crew cut. He was like a marine in a prison camp full of Japanese. He was like our boss in a way.

50|$|The breed {{occurs in}} three {{different}} coat varieties, all with an undercoat: a) relatively short, hard and flat, b) semi-long, profuse and harsh and c) a semi-long, <b>hard,</b> <b>wire</b> coat with some facial furnishings. The wire-haired variety is extremely rare. The coat must never be thin, sparse, soft and silky or lack a protective and insulating undercoat as the breed is a small utility dog that {{should be able to}} thrive outdoors as well as inside. Winters in the mountains of northern Greece can be quite harsh in particular, and the summers can be very hot, so a good coat quality is essential. The coat is easy to groom and inherently easy to keep clean by a caretaker. This is in part because Alopecis dogs are very clean by their nature and often groom themselves meticulously. The breed does not seem to attract as many external parasites as others.|$|E
5000|$|Guacharaca [...] is a {{percussion}} instrument {{usually made}} out of the cane-like trunk of a small palm tree. The guacharaca itself consists of a tube with ridges carved into its outer surface with part of its interior hollowed out, giving it {{the appearance of a}} tiny, notched canoe. It is played with a fork composed of <b>hard</b> <b>wire</b> fixed into a wooden handle. The guacharaquero (guacharaca player) scrapes the fork along the instrument's surface to create its characteristic scratching sound. A typical guacharaca is about as thick as a broomstick and as long as a violin. The guacharaca was invented by native American Indians from the Tairona culture in the region of la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia as an instrument to simulate the guacharaca (or Ortalis ruficauda) bird's singing. During the mid 20th century it was adopted by vallenato and cumbia musicians and today it is most often associated with these musical styles.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hard</b> <b>wire</b> {{intercom}} {{appears to}} have been provided between Sieber and the engineers in the launch bunker using a system similar to that used in the manned glider flights. Around 1100 am, the M23 was ready for take-off. Low stratus clouds lay over the Ocksenkopf. The Walter liquid-fueled rocket motor built up to full thrust and Sieber pushed the button to ignite the four solid boosters. With a roar, the M23 rose out of a cloud of steam and rocket smoke straight up, displaying its camouflage paintwork. At an altitude of about 100 to 150 m, the Natter suddenly pitched backwards into an inverted curve. Initially it climbed at about 30° to the vertical. At about 500 m the cockpit canopy was seen to fly off. The Natter continued to climb at high speed at an angle of 15° from the horizontal and disappeared into the clouds. The Walter motor stalled about 15 seconds after take-off. It is estimated the Natter reached 1500 m, at which point it nose-dived and hit the ground with great force about 32 seconds later, some kilometres from the launch site. Unknown at the time, one of the Schmidding boosters failed to jettison and its remains were dug up at the crash site in 1998.|$|E

40|$|An elderly patient {{underwent}} cannulated hip screw {{surgery for}} a subcapital neck of femur fracture. Nine days post surgery, she was noted to have collapsed with a falling haemoglobin level. Computed tomography revealed a large haematoma to the thigh. Further angiography showed active bleeding {{from one of}} the branches of the lateral femoral circumflex artery (LFCA),which we postulate was caused by the sharp tip of a version guidewire used during fracture fixation surgery. Iatrogenic injury during hip fracture fixation is a rare event,particularly to the circumflex branches of the profunda femoris artery (PFA), and may occur from <b>hard</b> <b>wire</b> use intraoperatively or from the fracture itself. The LFCA branches laterally from the PFA, runs anterior to the femoral neck,where we suspect it was injured in our case. Whilst a version wire is a useful radiological guide intra-operatively,manually clearing a passage for its insertion into the femoral head/neck junction and using the blunt end is recommended. A combination of acute swelling in the operated region and falling haemoglobin post surgery should alert the clinician to possible vascular injury. Compared to duplex ultrasonography,CT angiography remains the gold standard in its specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing arterial injuries. With early recognition and prompt radiological intervention, this rare complication of fracture fixation surgery can be treated without the need for further surgery...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis concerns the combining of wideband and reconfigurable narrow band functionality into a single antenna. This concept {{may be useful in}} reducing size and to give flexibility to a wireless terminal to operate in several different modes. The approach also offers additional pre-filtering to the front-end, which reduces the interference levels at the receiver, giving them a significant advantage over fixed non reconfigurable transceivers. Wideband-narrowband reconfiguration is potentially useful for future wireless communications such as software defined radio and cognitive radio, since they may employ wideband sensing and reconfigurable narrowband communications. Five novel reconfigurable antennas are presented. One is a switchable log periodic patch array and four are Vivaldi antennas with various forms of reconfiguration. The log periodic is reconfigured by placing switches between the patches and the feed line whilst the Vivaldi antenna has switched resonators controlling the current in the edges of the tapered slots. Wideband to various narrowband functions, wideband with a tunable band rejection having a very wide tuning ratio, and combined three function wide, narrow and tunable band rejection in a single antenna are demonstrated. Prototypes are presented with PIN diode switches, varactors, fixed capacitor or <b>hard</b> <b>wire</b> switches. Measured and simulated results with a very good agreement are presented, thus verifying the proposed concepts. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{communicate}} within any destination, {{at any given moment}} both effectively and efficiently tends to define our success (existence) within not only the world of technology but also the world’s social and economical standpoint. The 802. 11 standard had helped emerge the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) industry as one of the fastest-growing segments of the communications industry. WLAN equipment shipments grew to almost 12 million units in 2001 and the market research firm, Cahners In-Stat expect sales of wireless network cards and WLAN base stations to grow from $ 1. 9 billion in 2001 to $ 5. 2 billion in 2005. Using a wireless protocol, allows for tremendous world advancements in the realm of communications. Third world countries are able to afford communication networks and participate in the future advancements and technology breakthroughs {{for the first time since}} their initial existence. Countries around the world are able to use the 802. 11 standard to communicate with the world while at the same time decrease the country’s financial costs by excluding the <b>hard</b> <b>wire</b> communication lines and capitalize on the standard’s flexibility and functionality revolving around the concept of cellular architecture. The 802. 11 standard has been redefined several times in order to accommodate technological advancement needs. Within the next few years, the standard’s success will be based off interoperability between WLAN products between different equipment manufacturers. In addition, new industries such as education, healthcare, manufacturing and warehouse, production, retail and financial will begin to integrate the 802. 11 standard to increase their overall efficiency and decrease their financial overhead...|$|E
