5|$|Research {{indicates}} that the salinity of the Euphrates water <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban Dam in Turkey and the Tabqa Dam in Syria. This increase can, among other things, {{be related to the}} lower discharge of the Euphrates {{as a result of the}} construction of the Keban Dam and the dams of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey, and to a lesser degree of the Tabqa Dam in Syria. High-salinity water is less useful for domestic and irrigation purposes.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{conflicts}} {{have sometimes}} {{made it impossible}} for the Commission to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether. Zehrensdorf Indian Cemetery in Germany was unkempt after the end of World War II and until the German reunification because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005. The Six-Day War and War of Attrition resulted in the destruction of Port Tewfik Memorial and Aden Memorial, and the death of a Commission gardener at Suez War Memorial Cemetery. During the Lebanese Civil War two cemeteries in Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt. The maintenance of war graves and memorials <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> remained difficult since Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, with regular maintenance being impractical since after the Gulf War.|$|E

25|$|As the {{security}} situation <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> worsened since the invasion, many journalists have found {{it increasingly difficult to}} report from Iraq without jeopardizing their lives. Some media outlets, unable to afford the cost of additional security, have even abandoned their bureaus in Baghdad. This trend has forced journalists to depend even more heavily on U.S. military sources, which has led some critics to call into question the impartiality of their reports on events such as the Iraqi elections.|$|E
25|$|The ED {{was divided}} into the sub-periods ED I, II, and III. This was {{primarily}} based on complete changes over time in the plan of the Abu Temple of Tell Asmar, which had been rebuilt multiple times on exactly the same spot.

2500|$|Apart {{from the}} changes in the {{discharge}} regime of the river, the numerous dams and irrigation projects have also had other effects on the environment. The creation of reservoirs with large surfaces in countries with high average temperatures has led to increased evaporation; thereby reducing the total amount of water that is available for human use. Annual evaporation from reservoirs has been estimated at [...] in Turkey, [...] in Syria and [...] in Iraq. Water quality in the Iraqi Euphrates is low because irrigation water tapped in Turkey and Syria flows back into the river, together with dissolved fertilizer chemicals used on the fields. The salinity of Euphrates water <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> increased as a result of upstream dam construction, leading to lower suitability as drinking water. The many dams and irrigation schemes, and the associated large-scale water abstraction, have also had a detrimental effect on the ecologically already fragile Mesopotamian Marshes and on freshwater fish habitats in Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the War in Iraq, Buckley stated, [...] "The {{reality of}} the {{situation}} is that missions abroad to effect regime change in countries without a bill of rights or democratic tradition are terribly arduous." [...] He added: [...] "This isn't to say that the Iraq war is wrong, or that history will judge it to be wrong. But it is absolutely to say that conservatism implies a certain submission to reality; and this war has an unrealistic frank and is being conscripted by events." [...] In a February 2006 column published at National Review Online and distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, Buckley stated unequivocally that, [...] "One cannot doubt that the American objective <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> failed." [...] Buckley has also stated that [...] "...it's important that we acknowledge in the inner councils of state that it (the war) has failed, so that we should look for opportunities to cope with that failure." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Ignatieff, [...] "what Saddam Hussein {{had done}} to the Kurds and the Shia" [...] in Iraq was {{sufficient}} justification for the invasion. His {{support for the war}} began to wane as time passed. [...] "I supported an administration whose intentions I didn't trust," [...] he averred, [...] "believing that the consequences would repay the gamble. Now I realize that intentions do shape consequences." [...] He eventually recanted his support for the war entirely. In a 2007 New York Times Magazine article, he wrote: [...] "The unfolding catastrophe <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> condemned the political judgment of a president, but it has also condemned the judgment of many others, myself included, who as commentators supported the invasion." [...] Ignatieff partly interpreted what he now saw as his particular errors of judgment, by presenting them as typical of academics and intellectuals in general, whom he characterised as [...] "generalizing and interpreting particular facts as instances of some big idea". In politics, by contrast, [...] "Specifics matter more than generalities". Samuel Moyn, Harvard University historian of human rights and humanitarian intervention, asserts that Ignatieff is among those whose who [...] "soiled their reputations" [...] through their defence of the Iraq war, and labelled his later public apology [...] "embarrassingly vacuous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most recently, the Marines {{have served}} {{prominently}} in the Iraq War as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The I Marine Expeditionary Force, along with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division, spearheaded the 2003 invasion of Iraq and received the Presidential Unit Citation, {{the first time a}} Marine unit has received that award since 1968. The Marines left Iraq in the fall of 2003, but returned for occupation duty in the beginning of 2004. They were given responsibility for the Al Anbar Province, the large desert region to the west of Baghdad. During this occupation, the Marines spearheaded both assaults on the city of Fallujah in April (Operation Vigilant Resolve) and November 2004 (Operation Phantom Fury) and also saw intense fighting in such places as Ramadi, Al-Qa'im and Hīt. Their time <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> also courted controversy with the Haditha killings and the Hamdania incident. The Anbar Awakening and 2007 surge reduced levels of violence. On 1 March 2009, President Barack Obama [...] an accelerated withdrawal during a speech at Camp Lejeune, promising all combat troops out by August 2010. The Marine Corps officially ended its role in Iraq on 23 January 2010 when they handed over responsibility for Al Anbar Province to the United States Army. 1,022 Marines were killed in the war with an additional 8,623 wounded, while only Cpl Jason Dunham received the Medal of Honor.|$|E
