During the Tang Dynasty, this ritual was carried out in honour of the imperial family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The earthly Yellow Register ritual was performed to ensure the dead was at rest. The final type of ritual, which has not survived, was the human Jade Register, which was performed to ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register <b>has</b> <b>assumed</b> the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the scope}} of a popular {{comparison}} that draws parallels between House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Wilson is equivalent to Doctor Watson. In two-parts episodes such as Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard narrating the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who narrates the stories in most of Sherlock Holmes novels. Leonard has said that his character and House were originally intended to play roles similar to Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively, in the series although he believes that House's team <b>has</b> <b>assumed</b> the role of Watson since the show has begun. Producer Katie Jacobs believes that Wilson and House both hide from mature relationships, which brings the two closer together. She {{has said that the}} difference between the two characters is that Wilson finds it hard to say no because he wants to please the other person. The similarities between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson was also one of the reasons that made Leonard choose House over Numb3rs.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{recovery}} in A Storm of Swords (2000), Tyrion finds {{that he has}} lost most of his nose, and a returned Tywin <b>has</b> <b>assumed</b> the position of Hand himself. Tyrion is appointed Master of Coin, the treasurer, {{as a reward for}} his successful leadership. After learning of a Tyrell plot to claim Winterfell through marriage to Sansa, Tywin forces Tyrion to marry her instead. Sympathetic to Sansa's situation, Tyrion leaves their marriage unconsummated, despite his father's orders to conceive a child with her as soon as possible. At the celebration of his wedding to Margaery Tyrell, Joffrey is poisoned. Cersei promptly accuses Tyrion, who is arrested. His previous good deeds forgotten, Tyrion is put on trial as Cersei manipulates the proceedings to ensure a guilty verdict. He is heartbroken to find that even Shae has turned against him. In his grief, Tyrion demands a trial by combat, to which Cersei responds by naming the virtually unbeatable Gregor Clegane as her champion. Oberyn Martell agrees to fight for Tyrion but dies in the attempt. Pronounced guilty, Tyrion is taken to the dungeon to await his execution. Jaime frees him with the help of Varys, eventually confessing his complicity in Tywin's ruin of Tyrion's first wife Tysha. Furious, Tyrion swears revenge on his family for a lifetime of cruelty and lies to Jaime that he did murder Joffrey. Before escaping the palace, Tyrion goes to confront his father, and finds Shae in Tywin's bed. After strangling her in a rage, Tyrion murders Tywin as well when he speaks ill of Tysha, and flees Westeros.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} for court, attorney Phoenix Wright is attacked from behind, {{resulting in a}} severe case of amnesia. With {{the help of his}} client, policewoman Maggey Byrde, he learns that he is representing her in a case where she faces charges of having murdered her boyfriend, a fellow officer. After narrowly avoiding disaster due to his lack of preparation, Phoenix exposes Richard Wellington, a witness testifying for the prosecution, as the true murderer, saving Maggey. In the aftermath of the trial, he recalls another case that occurred two months prior: Dr. Turner Grey, a private surgeon who lost his reputation due to alleged malpractice, requested his help in contacting Maya Fey, his former secretary who had left the practice to finish training as a spirit medium in her home village. While performing a spirit channeling on Grey's behalf, Maya apparently kills him {{under the influence of the}} spirit's evil. Forced to once again defend her in court, Phoenix learns that Franziska von Karma, the daughter of his old enemy Manfred von Karma, <b>has</b> <b>assumed</b> the role of High Prosecutor from Miles Edgeworth, who is presumed dead. Teaming up with Maya and her young cousin Pearl, Phoenix uncovers a conspiracy between Mimi Miney, a disgruntled nurse who once worked at Grey's clinic, and Maya's aunt Morgan Fey to ruin Maya's chances of succeeding her mother as spiritual leader of her home village. When Miney publicly confesses to the murder, Morgan is sentenced to solitary confinement for her crimes and Phoenix decides to take Pearl in as one of his assistants. Six months later, the firm takes on another high-profile client: circus magician Maximillion Galactica, accused of murdering his employer Russell Berry in a dispute. Despite Franziska's interference, Phoenix and his team prove that Acro, one of Max's fellow performers, framed him after mistakenly killing Russell.|$|E
