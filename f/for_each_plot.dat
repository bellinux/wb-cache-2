As its economy relied on this resource, the use of water from the Gascas and Júcar for irrigation was strictly rationed <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>plot</b> of land.

50|$|In the Minion Hunter {{supplement}} {{there are}} randomization rules that supplant the built in {{limitations of the}} Plot deck. The way the Plot deck is configured {{it is possible to}} remove enough cards during the random draw to make it impossible for {{one or more of the}} minion races to win. Using the random rules, a roll is made against a table <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>plot</b> card when it is first encountered. This causes there to be no real limit to the amount of plot points that could be drawn for each minion race.|$|E

The origins of the Machine Bems are never fully clarified, {{although}} a few of them (like Samson) are actually genetically modified humans, while others (like the Monster Cat) were apparitions brought back to life. The Machine Bems have the ability to change size at will, changing not only to giant size, but also to small palm sizes as well (such as the case with Kabuton).|$|E

50|$|The revenue system {{introduced}} by Malik Ambar {{was based on}} the revenue system introduced in Northern India and some parts of Gujarat and Khandesh subahs by Raja Todarmal. Lands were classified as good or bad according to their fertility and he took a number of years to ascertain accurately the average yield of lands. He abolished the revenue farming. At first, revenue was fixed as two-fifths of the actual produce in kind, but later the cultivators were allowed to pay in cash equivalent to approximately one-third of the yield. Although an average rent was fixed <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>plot</b> of land but actual collections depended on the conditions of crops and they varied from year to year.|$|E

50|$|Ergodicity {{means the}} {{ensemble}} average equals the time average. Each resistor has an associated thermal noise {{that depends on}} the temperature. Take N resistors (N should be very large) and plot the voltage across those resistors for a long period. For each resistor you will have a waveform. Calculate the average value of that waveform; this gives you the time average. Note also that you have N waveforms as we have N resistors. These N plots are known as an ensemble. Now take a particular instant of time in all those plots and find the average value of the voltage. That gives you the ensemble average <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>plot.</b> If ensemble average and time average are the same then it is ergodic.|$|E

5000|$|Around 1586, {{the city}} started drawing up plans to {{determine}} how the streets, alleys and defensive walls would be laid out. The local landowners were compelled to demolish the existing buildings, such as fences, ropewalks, drying sheds and tar houses, and to raise the land with sand. The city would provide the sand and the stones needed for pavements and embankments. For this [...] "amelioration", the landowners would have to pay a yet to be determined sum in tax. The construction ban, which had been instituted eight years before, was lifted. Before being allowed to build, the amelioration tax needed to be determined <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>plot</b> of land. To this end, each plot of land was measured to calculate the loss of land to newly built streets, ditches and ramparts.|$|E
50|$|M-drt is {{translated}} to “split small holder”. A split small holder is {{a plot of}} land that is owned {{by more than one}} cultivator or tenant farmer. These plots are generally owned by the lower or middle class. As Sally Katary wrote in “Labour on smallholdings in the New Kingdom”, there are roughly 2,245 cultivated plots. Sally tries to break down 93 plots that are mentioned as being m-drt. She bases her number of cultivators needed <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>plot</b> off {{of the size of the}} plot. She also uses information on how many split plots are owned by the smallholder and the location of the multiple plots owned by the smallholder. By going off of the towns mentioned in both text A and B in the papyrus, we are able to identify locations of the plots. Although we have a vague idea of the locations they have not been able to be completely identified. However, it is possible these locations reveal the hierarchies of the towns and villages exposing the agricultural organization. It is also believed the plots lay across the flood plain, from the Nile banks to the desert edge and along the Bahr Yusuf.|$|E
50|$|The {{resort town}} of La Grande Motte was largely built between 1960 and 1975 on virgin beachfront dunes, and is artificially {{irrigated}} {{to create a}} green, environment. The architect of the project, Jean Balladur, drew inspiration from pre-Columbian pyramids such as Teotihuacan, Mexico; and from modernist architecture in Brazil, especially the work of architect Oscar Niemeyer. Balladur developed the master plan for the seaside resort on a site of 750 hectares comprising 450 hectares of land and 300 hectares of wetland. The plan included principles for settlement, with guidelines <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>plot,</b> including zones for camping, a town centre, a marina, and a city park. The landscaper Pierre Pillet collaborated on the project, selecting plant species that were tolerant of the marine climate. Jean Balladur imagined a green city. Parking was placed no more than 600 meters away from the beach, to allow visitors to walk there, but keeping all development away from the beach itself. The project incorporated large open spaces surrounding the main buildings. Squares and parks, and sports and leisure services were also planned for the new city. Public and private beaches, the marina and water sports facilities complement the design. The Palais de Congrès (conference centre), a casino and the church of St. Augustine are also key elements.|$|E

We also calculated mean dNBR {{at the home}} range scale in 339 m buffers (36 ha) around focal trees and subplot centers (dNBRh). To retain the burn severity gradient and avoid breakpoints between severity classes and classification errors, we used mean dNBRp or dNBRh for all analyses. We used the burn severity classes only for interpretation and display of results.|$|R

A total of 3400 marked beetles were released at each instance for abundance estimation as described by Arakaki et al. (2008). Beetles were released in the night (Nyundo and Yarro 2007) once per month and were recaptured for three consecutive days after each release. Adults were recaptured by hand picking and trapping.

40|$|The fire {{characteristics}} chart is a graphical {{method of}} presenting U. S. National Fire Danger Rating indices or primary surface or crown fire behavior characteristics. A desktop computer application {{has been developed}} to produce fire characteristics charts in a format suitable for inclusion in reports and presentations.

Laying out the plot means defining the plot center (or center for several sub-plots) and determining which trees belong to the plot(s). For circular or relascope plots that means checking the distance of borderline trees from the plot center with a measuring tape or an (optical) rangefinder (e.g. Loetsch et al. 1973).|$|R
