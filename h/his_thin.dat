25|$|Knowing {{there was}} a good chance he would be chosen in the first round, Randolph {{declared}} himself eligible for the 2008 NBA draft {{at the end of his}} freshman year at LSU. Some projected Randolph to go high in the year's draft because of his versatility and potential, while his detractors thought he might drop because of <b>his</b> <b>thin</b> frame and raw overall game. In either case, many believed Randolph could be the steal of the draft with his talent and tremendous potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{look was}} that of a greyhound. His arms and legs were {{extended}} more than was customary in his era of pounded post World War II roads. And the toes pointed down. Just a few years before, riders had prided their ankling motion, but Jacques {{was the first of the}} big gear school. His smooth power dictated his entire approach to the sport. Hands resting serenely on <b>his</b> <b>thin</b> Mafac brake levers, the sensation from Quincampoix, Normandy, appeared to cruise while others wriggled in desperate attempts to keep up.|$|E
25|$|Allen Moore, WAPE's news director, {{was also}} a bodybuilder. Tracht {{questioned}} Moore about his hobby, and Moore encouraged Tracht to try it. Tracht began a high protein diet of canned tuna, raw eggs, and milk; took vitamins; and lifted weights for 90 minutes a day. In the first three months, he added 25 pounds of muscle to <b>his</b> <b>thin</b> physique. After a year, he had gained 45 pounds, and people commented that he looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Tracht enrolled in an evening law enforcement training program, and after completing it, he volunteered as an auxiliary officer. He occasionally worked the night shift with the Clay County Sheriff's Office, then {{went directly to the}} station at 5:30a.m. for his morning show, still in uniform.|$|E

500|$|In 1774, the First Continental Congress convened, {{and both}} Ward and Hopkins were {{chosen as the}} {{delegate}}s from Rhode Island. [...] Hopkins, at age 68, was senior to every delegate there, and {{was only one of}} two of the 55 delegates (the other being Benjamin Franklin) who had attended the Albany Congress 20 years earlier. [...] Over the previous several years Hopkins had developed palsy in his hands, and this greatly affected his ability to write. [...] At the seating of this congress, Henry Arniett Brown wrote, [...] "yonder sits the oldest of them all. [...] His form is bent, <b>his</b> <b>thin</b> locks, fringing a forehead bowed with age and honorable service, and his hands shake tremulously as he folds them in his lap. [...] It is Stephen Hopkins." ...|$|E
500|$|During Bomar's {{senior season}} (when {{he moved to}} halfback), the Commodores tied the Quantico Marines 13–13. Bomar, picking up a fumble, ran 84 yards for a touchdown. According to a {{newspaper}} account, [...] "It was Lynn Bomar's gigantic figure that broke up {{what looked like a}} Marine cakewalk. After receiving the kickoff, the Marines drove steadily to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line as Goettge repeatedly completed short passes. At the 10, Groves dropped back. The pass from center was low. He missed it. He reached for the ball. It trickled off his fingers. The Commodores were boring in. Wakefield was in there. Then Bomar came charging through. He picked up the ball and with a twist was out of Groves' grasp. He came out of the bunch with a long, charging run. Then he seemed a little undecided. One fleeting glance behind him and he struck out. Up came his free arm to brush off his headgear. <b>His</b> <b>thin,</b> yellow hair stood out. On he swept like a thundercloud of vengeance across the goal. Bedlam broke loose." [...] Captain and guard Tuck Kelly was injured during the game, making Bomar the interim captain two weeks later against the Georgia Bulldogs.|$|E

500|$|Off the field, the {{throwing}} controversy {{was beginning to}} affect Meckiff adversely. In his 1961 autobiography, prophetically titled Thrown Out, he said the accusations took a deep personal toll on him and his family, and prompted him to shun the public. He became known by the derisive nickname [...] "Chucker" [...] and was credited on the front cover of his autobiography as [...] "Ian 'Chucker' Meckiff". Meckiff reported that from the Melbourne Test onwards, his son was verbally abused by classmates; Meckiff's parents were persistently told their son bowled illegally. He added that doctors believed his anxiety was contributing to stomach ailments. At the time, players {{were not allowed to}} talk to the media during the season, and Meckiff was upset because he could not rebut his accusers while they were free to attack him. He denied ever throwing, but admitted he may have been open to suspicion after bowling 15 to 20 overs in a day's play, as his body would begin to fall away in the delivery stride due to fatigue. He had a permanently bent bowling arm; he generated his pace from his wrist action, and asserted that <b>his</b> <b>thin</b> wrists gave the impression that his whole arm was bending.|$|E
500|$|Talbot nicknamed Windle [...] "the greyhound" [...] {{because of}} <b>his</b> <b>thin</b> and angular build. As {{a result of}} Windle's small build, he took between 45 and 47 strokes to {{complete}} a lap, but fellow distance swimmer Murray Rose needed only 35 to 37 strokes. Talbot said that Windle was the most thinly built elite swimmer that he had trained, and had great trouble in trying to increase Windle's frame. Talbot motivated Windle and instilled him with a greater level of self belief. For his part, Windle responded by increasing his workload, and was regarded as Talbot's most diligent student. Windle trained with a determination that often saw him swim through others who were in his training lane. These collisions led to complaints by recreational swimmers that Windle was too aggressive. He often did twice as much pre-season training as the other swimmers in Talbot's squad. According to Talbot, Windle's weakness {{was that he was}} only capable of swimming in two ways, flat out or very slowly. Windle had trouble in pacing himself to conserve energy for later events. Talbot lamented to [...] "never [...] astute enough to realise that he [...] didn't have the subtleties of pace that would have added to his armament as a swimmer".|$|E
500|$|Other storylines {{received}} a more mixed response. Canning disliked the focus placed on Sam and <b>his</b> <b>thin,</b> [...] "loveable dope" [...] characterization. He {{found that the}} love-triangle plot made little sense, and as such was hard to invest in. In contrast, Poniewozik called Sam's Bieber subplot the episode's strongest element, and deemed it fun if inessential. He praised Glee for capturing the [...] "disposable fun" [...] of Bieber's music, [...] "without either sneering at it or making it more than it is", and called it better in this respect than [...] "The Power of Madonna". Lauren received several positive reviews. While VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than in [...] "Silly Love Songs", Mullins and Gonzalez praised their [...] "endearing" [...] dynamic. Reiter felt that in [...] "Comeback", while new characters like Sam and Lauren [...] "managed to shine", established favorites fared less well: [...] "Finn continues to be dismayingly drained of all that once made him so adorable, and Rachel, too, has been deprived of the depth and sex appeal she so carefully developed over time." [...] Several critics raised similar criticism of Rachel—Gonzalez found her need for Brittany's help [...] "too much of a regression", and disliked her return to [...] "old, desperate habits" [...] after several episodes of personal growth. Canning felt that the storyline was forced, and Poniewozik observed that the episode [...] "seemed to be trying less to advance her character [...] simply to give her something to do." [...] VanDerWerff wrote that Rachel appeared to have five different subplots, none of which came together cohesively, and that it reflected the awkward construction of the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Jane Stanford, in That Irishman, {{suggests}} that Doyle borrowed {{some of the}} traits and background of the Fenian John O'Connor Power for his portrayal of Moriarty.

Thomas Kay, SJ, Prefect of Discipline, under whose authority Doyle fell as a wayward pupil. According to this hypothesis, Doyle as a private joke has Inspector MacDonald describe Moriarty: [...] "He'd have made a grand meenister with <b>his</b> <b>thin</b> face and grey hair and his solemn-like way of talking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pitchforks Ryan Dombal commended Timberlake for [...] "shamelessly extol {{the joys}} of music and marriage", and viewed the album as more ambitious than his 2002 debut album Justified and more {{consistent}} than FutureSex/LoveSounds. Kitty Empire, writing for The Observer, found it mostly [...] "terrific– lush and quirky too", with silly, respectable homages to Prince. Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph said that the music feels both grandiose and intimate, and that Timberlake makes up for <b>his</b> <b>thin</b> voice with [...] "yearning charisma and sly timing to sell every swoon." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V.

2500|$|Reeve was {{a talented}} {{all-around}} athlete. Portraying {{the role of}} Superman would be a stretch for the young actor, but he was tall enough for the role and had the necessary blue eyes and handsome features. However, his physique was slim.
