40|$|During January and May, 2009, two {{configurations}} of steel-framed walls constructed with conventional 2 × 4 steel studs insulated with either R- 19, approximately 14 cm (5. 5 in.) thick, or R- 13, approximately 9 cm (3. 5 in.) thick, fiberglass <b>insulation</b> <b>batts</b> {{were tested in}} the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) guarded hot box using the ASTM Standard C 1363 test procedure. The first test wall used conventional 2 × 4 steel studs insulated with 2. 5 cm (1 in.) thick foam profiles, called stud-snugglers. These stud-snugglers converted the 2 × 4 wall assembly into a 2 × 6 assembly, allowing application of R- 19 fiberglass insulation. The second wall tested for comparison was a conventional 2 × 4 steel stud wall using R- 13 <b>insulation</b> <b>batts.</b> Furthermore, numerical simulations were performed in order to evaluate the steady-state thermal performance of various wood-and steel-framed wall assemblies. The effects of adding the stud-snugglers to the wood and steel studs were also inve stigated numerically.

5000|$|R-values stated on {{packaging}} {{are based}} on laboratory conditions; air infiltration can significantly reduce effectiveness, particularly for fiberglass loose fill. Cellulose inhibits convection more effectively. In general, loose fill is seen as being better at reducing the presence of gaps in <b>insulation</b> than <b>batts,</b> as the cavity is sealed more carefully. Air infiltration through the insulating material itself is not studied well, but would be lower for wet-spray insulations such as wet-spray cellulose.|$|R
40|$|Wind washing is {{a general}} term {{referring}} to diminished thermal control caused by air movement over or through a thermal barrier. The primary focus {{of this paper is}} towards a specific type of wind washing where wind can push attic air into the floor cavity between first and second stories of the home through ineffective (or missing) air barriers separating attic space from the floor cavity. A second type of wind washing studied in this project involved <b>insulation</b> <b>batts</b> on knee walls where space between the batts and the wall board allowed air movement against the gypsum wall board. During hot weather, the first type of wind washing pushes hot air into the floor cavity (between the first and second stories) thereby heating ceiling, floor, and interior wall surfaces (see Figures 1 and 2). Condensation may occur on cold supply duct surfaces within the floor cavity resulting in ceiling moisture damage. In cold climates, cold air from wind washing can chill surfaces within the interior floor space and result in frozen water pipes. Through the summer of 2009, a field study tested thirty-two two-story homes and found significant wind washing potential in 40 % of the homes. Part I of this paper will highlight the evaluation methods used and the extent of wind washing found in this study. Repairs and energy monitoring were completed in six of these homes to evaluate retrofit methods and cost effectiveness of retrofit solutions. These results are discussed in Part II of this paper.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to determine {{the magnitude of the}} energy savings brought about by installing radiant barriers in the attics of single-family houses. The radiant barrier used for this test was a product with two reflective aluminum surfaces on a kraft paper base. The radiant barrier has the potential to reduce the radiant heat transfer component impinging on the fiberglass attic insulation. Working as a system in conjunction with an air space, the radiant barrier could theoretically block up to 95 % of far-infrared radiation heat transfer. The experiment was conducted in three unoccupied research houses that are operated by ORNL. One house was used as the control house (no barrier was installed), while the other two were used to test the two different methods for installing the radiant barriers. In one house, the barrier was laid on top of the attic fiberglass <b>batt</b> <b>insulation,</b> and in the other house, the barrier was attached to the underside of the roof trusses. The attics of all three houses were insulated with kraft paper faced nominal R- 19 fiberglass <b>batt</b> <b>insulation.</b> The results showed a savings in the cooling loads of 21 % when the radiant barrier was laid on top of the attic fiberglass insulation and 13 % with the radiant barrier attached to the underside of the roof trusses. The savings in electrical consumption was 17 % and 9 %, respectively. The electrical consumption data and the cooling load data indicated that the most effective way of installing the foil was to lay it on top of the fiberglass <b>batt</b> <b>insulation.</b> The radiant barriers reduced the measured peak ceiling heat fluxes by 39 % for the case where the barrier was laid on top of the attic fiberglass insulation. The radiant barrier reduced the integrated heat flows from the attic to house by approximately 30 - 35 % over a 7 -day time period...|$|R
50|$|Exterior {{wall studs}} are the {{vertical}} members {{to which the}} wall sheathing and cladding are attached. They are supported on a bottom plate or foundation sill and in turn support the top plate. Studs usually consist of 1.5 x 3.5 in or 1.5 x 5.5 in lumber and are commonly spaced at 16 in on center. This spacing may be changed to 12 or 24 in on center depending on the load and the limitations imposed by the type and thickness of the wall covering used. Wider 1.5 x 5.5 in studs {{may be used to}} provide space for more insulation. Insulation beyond that which can be accommodated within a 3.5 in stud space can also be provided by other means, such as rigid or semi-rigid <b>insulation</b> or <b>batts</b> between 1.5 x 1.5 in horizontal furring strips, or rigid or semi-rigid insulation sheathing to the outside of the studs. The studs are attached to horizontal top and bottom wall plates of 1.5 in lumber that are the same width as the studs.|$|R

5000|$|The {{method of}} {{installation}} {{and type of}} drywall can reduce sound transmission through walls and ceilings. Several builders' books state that thicker drywall reduces sound transmission, but engineering manuals recommend using multiple layers of drywall, sometimes of different thicknesses and glued together, or special types of drywall designed to reduce noise. Also important are the construction details of the framing with steel studs, wider stud spacing, double studding, insulation, and other details reducing sound transmission. Sound transmission class (STC) ratings can be increased from 33 for an ordinary stud-wall to as high as 59 with double 1/2" [...] drywall {{on both sides of}} a wood stud wall with resilient channels on one side and fiberglass <b>batt</b> <b>insulation</b> between the studs.|$|R
50|$|Cotton {{insulation}} {{is increasing}} in popularity as an environmentally preferable option for insulation. It has an R-value of around 3.7 (RSI-0.65), {{equivalent to the}} median value for fiberglass batts. The cotton is primarily recycled industrial scrap, providing a sustainability benefit. The batts do not use the toxic formaldehyde backing found in fiberglass, and the manufacture is nowhere near as energy intensive as the mining and production process required for fiberglass. Boric acid {{is used as a}} flame retardant. A small quantity of polyolefin is melted as an adhesive to bind the product together (and is preferable to formaldehyde adhesives). Installation is similar to fiberglass, without the need for a respirator but requiring some additional time to cut the material. As with any <b>batt</b> <b>insulation,</b> proper installation is important to ensure high energy efficiency.|$|R
30|$|Heating {{demand is}} profoundly {{affected}} by building construction, and we therefore lay out {{in detail the}} average prototypical SDD. Homes in Ontario are typically constructed using wood frames with exterior cladding and gypsum wall board on the interior wall. The cavities left between wood studs in the frame are hopefully filled with insulation. However, the average level of insulation taken from Swan and Ugursal et al. [62] results in a partially filled wall cavity if fibreglass <b>batt</b> <b>insulation</b> is used (see Table  4). Most homes have basements [62] with less wall insulation than upper levels, and an asphalt shingle covered peaked roof. The greatest level of insulation found in the home is usually at the juncture between the attic and upper living area. Table  2 enumerates the basic properties of the prototypical SDDs used in this study.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{physical}} {{problem is}} water infiltrating into the exterior building envelope (walls and roofs) of buildings, usually through a weather barrier (e.g. building paper or air barrier membrane) {{that is designed}} to prevent water drops to pass through, but allow water vapour through. However, problems in design, installation, and damage during construction can allow water to penetrate the walls. This causes rot and delamination of exterior wall cladding and sheathing, rusting in metal wall studs, rot in the wood structure, saturation of <b>batt</b> <b>insulation,</b> and development of mould and spores inside the walls and building interior. The construction failures ranged from minor to major failure of the structural integrity of the building. Some buildings became unhealthy to occupants. Most of these buildings are low-rise, 3-4 story buildings constructed of wood-frame construction, as well as some with steel, concrete, and metal stud construction types, including highrises.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{determined}} from extensive tests involving test models and home attics that loose fill and fiber <b>batt</b> <b>insulation</b> does not function as expected by the industry. The reason for this deficiency is current test methods do not accurately predict the magnitude of air infiltration into fiber insulation as used in home attics, radiant heat infiltration into the insulation during summer, or radiant heat loss through the insulation during winter conditions. The use of (1) moisture permeable membranes over the insulation, and (2) layered membranes between fiber batts to form closed cells in the insulation both dramatically improve {{the efficiency of the}} fiber insulation. The efficiency of this insulation will be improved to an even greater degree if these membranes reflect radiant heat as well as reduce convection air currents. Extensive tests have also been conducted which show that if moisture permeable membranes are used over fiber insulation, the moisture content of the insulation will be reduced...|$|R
5000|$|Adding {{absorptive}} {{materials to}} the interior surfaces of rooms (e.g. fabric-faced fiberglass panels, thick curtains) {{will result in a}} decrease of reverberated sound energy within the room. However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently. Installing absorptive <b>insulation</b> (e.g., fiberglass <b>batts,</b> blow-in cellulose, mineral fiber batts) into the wall or ceiling cavities affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth. For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 wood stud framing spaced 16" [...] (406 mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in light-gauge (25-gauge or lighter) steel stud partitions can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement. As the stud gauge becomes heavier, the presence and type of insulation matters less.|$|R
40|$|This project proposes an {{experimental}} procedure {{to evaluate the}} effect of adding insulation to leak exterior wall assemblies and to monitor air leakage paths within them. The procedure involves the construction of a full-scale test hut exposed consecutively to climatic conditions representing winter and late spring, inside the environmental chamber.

The construction of the hut is typical of low-rise wood frame residences in Quebec, insulated with glass fiber <b>batt</b> <b>insulation</b> between the studs. The objectives of the experimental work are: (1) To study the effect of different insulating strategies for exterior wall assemblies having different air leakage characteristics on the moisture content and temperature distribution patterns in walls when exposed consecutively to wetting and drying conditions; (2) To develop and implement a method of characterizing air leakage paths so that more is known about the movement of air through exterior wall assemblies; (3) To produce patterns {{that could be used to}} validate existing models...|$|R
30|$|Madrzykowski and Fleischmann (2012) {{performed}} {{a study of}} the response of gypsum wallboard and the reproducibility of the damage pattern created when exposed to known heat release rate (HRR) fires with varying types of fuel sources and wall construction. The fuels used for their experiments included a natural gas burner, gasoline pool fire and polyurethane foam. The wall construction was varied between a single sheet of gypsum wallboard with wood framing, a gypsum wallboard front and back with wood framing and gypsum wallboard front and back with fiberglass <b>batt</b> <b>insulation</b> in the voids of the wood framing. The gypsum wallboard was covered with a primer and cover coats of latex paint. This study focused on the effects where the paper had been burned away (consumed) and where the paper had been peeled up (penetration). To accomplish this, the researchers evaluated the variability of the flame height in comparison to the height and area of damage. As expected, the results indicated that the patterns generated by the polyurethane foam fire had greater uncertainty than the natural gas and gasoline pool fires. The wall construction had no significant impact on the damage.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} shift within the {{construction}} materials industry towards green and sustainable building products. Spending in this area has increased 5 fold since 2011 to a total revenue of $ 70 billion. An area of particular interest has been aimed at replacing fiberglass <b>batt</b> <b>insulation</b> with cellulose. Cellulose is the most abundant polymer on earth, and has potential to replace petroleum derived insulations. This project explores the potential of selectively isolating cellulose by depolymerizing the support structures found in lignocellulosic materials – specifically lignin and hemicellulose. The current focus is on isolating cellulose from Cannibas sativa, but more specifically, industrial hemp. Previous studies have successfully delignified industrial hemp using chlorite as a nucleophile that can selectively dissolve lignin and hemicellulose, but not cellulose. However, no study to date has explored the effects of selective depolymerization {{and its effects on}} thermal insulation (R-value). By selectively dissolving support biopolymers away from cellulose, it should induce macro and nano sized pores within the cellulose matrix – a change that may increase thermal resistivity. The project has characterized depolymerized industrial hemp with materials characterization techniques such as: Scanning Electron Microscopy, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis, X-ray Diffraction, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Third party laboratory testing was conducted at RADCO Laboratories to determine insulating performance by adhering to ASTM C 518.

Gas-Filled Panels, or GFPs, are thermal insulating devices that retain {{a high concentration of}} a low- conductivity gas, at atmospheric pressure, within a multilayer infrared reflective baffle. The thermal performance of the panel depends on the type of gas fill and the baffle configuration. Heat- flow meter apparatus measurements have shown effective apparent thermal conductivities of 0. 194 Btu{center_dot}in/h{center_dot}ft{sup 2 }{center_dot}{degree}F with air as the gas fill, 0. 138 Btu{center_dot}in/h{center_dot}ft{sup 2 }{center_dot}{degree}F with argon, and 0. 081 Btu{center_dot}in/h{center_dot}ft{sup 2 }{center_dot}{degree}F with krypton. Calorimetric measurements have also shown total resistance levels of about R- 12. 6 h{center_dot}ft{sup 2 }{center_dot}{degree}F/Btu for a 1. 0 -inch thick krypton panel, R- 25. 7 h{center_dot}ft{sup 2 }{center_dot}{degree}F/Btu for a 2. 0 -inch krypton panel, and R- 18. 4 f{center_dot}ft{sup 2 }{center_dot}{degree}F/Btu for a 10 -inch xenon panel. GFPs are flexible, self-supporting and can be made in a variety of shapes and sizes to thoroughly fill most types of cavities in building walls and roofs, although the modular nature of the panels can lead to complications in installing them, especially for irregularly shaped cavities.

40|$|In wall construction, highly {{conductive}} members spaced {{along the}} wall, which allow higher heat transfer than that through less conductive areas, {{are referred to}} as thermal bridges. Thermal bridges in walls tend to increase heat loss and, under certain adverse conditions, can cause dust streaking (``ghosting``) on interior walls over studs due to temperature differentials, as well as condensation in and on walls. Although such adverse conditions can be easily avoided by proper thermal design of wall systems, these effects have not been well understood and thermal data has been lacking. Therefore, the present study was initiated to provide (1) {{a better understanding of the}} thermal behavior of steel-framed walls, (2) a set of R-values for typical wall constructions, and (3) information that could be used to develop improved methods of predicting R-values. An improved method for estimating R-value would allow an equitable comparison of thermal performance with other construction types and materials. This would increase the number of alternative materials for walls available to designers, thus allowing them to choose the optimum choice for construction. Twenty-three wall samples were tested in a calibrated hot box (ASTM C 9761) to measure the thermal performance of steel-framed wall systems. The tests included an array of stud frame configurations, exterior sheathing and fiberglass <b>batt</b> <b>insulations.</b> Other studies have not included the use of insulating sheathing, which reduces the extent of the thermal bridges and improves total thermal performance. The purpose of the project was to provide measured R-values for commonly used steel-framed wall configurations and to improve R-value estimating methods. Test results were compared to R-value estimates using the parallel path method, the isothermal planes method and the ASHRAE Zone method.

Roxul Inc. Final Report [...] October 7, 1997 Page i EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Fire stops can introduce a physical connection between the two sides of a double-stud wall, hence providing structural flanking paths for transmission of vibration which worsens the sound insulation. This study primarily addressed the specific case of a load-bearing party wall with double wood studs, supporting a floor with wood joists perpendicular to the party wall and a floor deck or sub-floor of 15. 9 mm OSB. Even without structural transmission of vibration through a fire stop, the sound insulation in a real building is normally affected by flanking transmission. Addition of a fire stop provides yet another path for vibration transmission between the rooms, and hence tends to worsen the sound insulation further. This study examines how a fire stop at the floor/wall junction can degrade the apparent sound insulation of the party wall (the nominal separation) by increasing structural transmission of vibration around that wall via the connected floor system (the flanking path). Group 0 Constructions have no physical fire stop. Adding <b>batt</b> <b>insulation</b> to fill the wall's inter-stud cavities leaving a gap of 25 mm or less (Case 2) improves sound insulation provided by the party wall itself while adding negligible structural transmission. Strictly speaking, this is not a fire stop, but it does provide the necessary fire resistance (as shown in the companion study of fire spread) and meets the presc [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Hemcrete is an alternative, environmentally‐friendly {{building}} material gaining adherents in Great Britain and other European countries. It {{is an attractive}} choice as a {{building material}} because it is made from a renewable resource, hemp, a hardy plant that is a close, but non‐hallucinogenic relative of marijuana. This plant {{is relatively easy to}} cultivate, requires {{little in the way of}} pesticides or fertilizers, and almost all parts can be used for various products from paper to textiles to food. Hemcrete is made from a mixture of lime, water, and the fibrous outer portion of the hemp plant called the “hurd” or “shive”. When mixed, it is worked and placed much like conventional concrete ‐ hence the name. However, that is where the similarities with concrete end. Hemcrete is not comparable to concrete on a strength basis, and is better described as an alternative insulation product. When built into walls of sufficient thickness, Hemcrete offers high thermal efficiency, and has strong claims to being carbon negative. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this claim of carbon negativity, and to compare these environmentally friendly qualities against conventional fiberglass <b>batt</b> <b>insulation.</b> Our model was constructed using two identically sized “walls” measuring eight feet square by one foot in depth, one insulated using Hemcrete, and the other using fiberglass. Our study focused on three areas: water usage, cost, and carbon dioxide emissions. We chose water usage because we wanted to determine the feasibility of using Hemcrete in the Phoenix metropolitan region, where water is a troubled resource. Secondly, we wished to evaluate the claim on carbon negativity, so CO 2 equivalents throughout the production process were measured. Finally, we wished to know whether Hemcrete could compete on a cost basis with more conventional insulation methods, so we also built in a price comparison. Since the cultivation of hemp is currently unlawful in the United States, this study can help determine whether these restrictions should be relaxed in order to allow the construction of buildings insulated with Hemcrete...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} present {{case studies of}} the {{investigations}} of three different buildings exhibiting moisture control problems along the Gulf Coast. We will briefly discuss the original, or existing, conditions that led to our involvement, as well as analysis of the problems, and recommendations for correction. Each of these projects would be classified an airconditioned building in a hot, humid climate, and subject to the problems and design issues concomitant with these types of projects. The first case study was a historic residence in Houston that had experienced concealed condensation within the wood-framed floor system located over a crawl space. The floor framing had been insulated with an extruded polystyrene rigid board insulation, but with no vapor retarder. The second case study was a new premanufactured residence located in the pine woods of Southeast Texas. The residence had been occupied for two summers when the occupants began to complain of adverse health effects. Indoor air quality testing revealed the presence of mold spores, which prompted the residents to vacate the premises to allow appropriate remediation. Our investigation occurred simultaneously with the remediation and allowed us to determine the sources of moist air infiltration that had resulted in the wall condensation and mold growth. The final case study was a modern, four-story office building recently constructed in New Orleans, Louisiana. The cladding system consists of a clay brick veneer installed over a # 30 felt weather-barrier, ?? exterior gypsum sheathing, metal studs with a glass fiber <b>batt</b> <b>insulation,</b> and interior gypsum board. The interior finishes consisted of heavy duty vinyl wall coverings that had been specified by the architect-of-record.
