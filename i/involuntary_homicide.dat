5000|$|The laws {{distinguish}} between murder and <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Manslaughter is {{any form}} of {{voluntary}} or <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> and is punishable with a maximum of 20 years imprisonment.http://articles.cnn.com/2010-06-11/justice/peru.murder.case_1_holloway-case-van-der-sloot-aruban?_s=PM:CRIME ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{necessary}} to indicate that in Spanish law, <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> is not regulated; {{in the majority of}} cases the law that will be applied will be somewhere between homicide and the criminal concept which is involved.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Involuntary</b> {{culpable}} <b>homicide</b> is homicide {{where the}} mens rea for murder {{is not present}} but either the independent mens rea for culpable homicide is present, or {{the circumstances in which}} death was caused make it culpable <b>homicide.</b> <b>Involuntary</b> culpable <b>homicide</b> may arise {{in the context of an}} unlawful act or a lawful act. The mens rea requirement is different in each case.|$|R
50|$|Recklessness: {{the accused}} was aware the {{criminal}} act could be potentially dangerous {{but did not}} give a second thought to its consequences, for example <b>involuntary</b> culpable <b>homicide.</b>|$|R
50|$|Afterwards, the 40 sick {{employees}} {{gathered together}} as Interessengemeinschaft der VC-Geschädigten {{in order to}} file a complaint for violation of duty against the Land of North-Rhine-Westphalia and asked for damage compensation, {{just like in the}} Contergan trial. The local committee of the DKP in Troisdorf filed a complaint for injury and <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicides</b> against {{the board of directors of}} Dynamit Nobel AG. Both complaints remained unsuccessful. After more details about the scandal were made public, employees and inhabitants of Troisforf organised a series of demonstrations. In 1975, the company’s board of directors decided to shut down PVC polymerisation workshop to escape the expensive costs related to modernization and security of the plant.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} inquiry, led by Bologna's {{public prosecutor}} Andrea Scarpa, charged 10 people, including Trenitalia CEO Mauro Moretti and the Head {{of the infrastructure}} division of RFI Michele Mario Elia, of causing a rail disaster, <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> and involuntary wounding. They were all discharged on 11 May 2009.|$|E
50|$|On November 22, 1996, {{the leader}} of the Lyon Church of Scientology, Jean-Jacques Mazier, was convicted of fraud and <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> and sentenced to {{eighteen}} months in prison {{for his role in the}} death of a member who committed suicide after going deeply into debt to pay for Scientology auditing sessions. Fourteen others were convicted of fraud as well.|$|E
50|$|Thirty-five-year-old Chun Kyong-ja, {{the head}} of the Somang Kindergarten in Seoul, along with her husband and another teacher, were also arrested and charged with <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> for their role in the children's deaths. Rather than {{overseeing}} their charges in room 301, they were elsewhere, drinking. Reports differ as to whether they were in another room or outside the building.|$|E
2500|$|On June 3, the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office {{released}} a statement in which they declared their investigation to be completed and that they turned their findings over to prosecutor Tim McGinty, who was expected to review the report and decide whether to present evidence to a grand jury. [...] In response to a petition from citizens, on June 11 Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine agreed that [...] "Officer Timothy Loehmann should be charged with several crimes, the most serious of them being murder but also including <b>involuntary</b> manslaughter, reckless <b>homicide,</b> negligent homicide and dereliction of duty." [...] Judge Adrine also found probable cause to charge Officer Frank Garmback with negligent homicide and dereliction of duty. [...] Because Ohio judges lack the legal authority to issue arrest warrants in such cases, his opinion was forwarded to city prosecutors and Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty who, as of that date, had not yet {{come to a decision}} on whether to present the evidence to a grand jury.|$|R
5000|$|On May 26, 2012, Hu Jun, who {{was driving}} the first minivan that ran over Wang, was put on trial in Foshan and charged with Wang's death. He pleaded guilty to traffic crimes, but not homicide. On September 6, 2012, Hu was convicted of <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> and {{sentence}}d to [...] years in prison. The sentence was lightened because he turned himself in and had paid part of Wang's medical expenses.|$|E
50|$|However, {{it was in}} the mid-2000s whereThivierge {{started to}} play lead roles in Nitro {{as well as in the}} 3 L'il pigs, two of the biggest box-office Quebec hits in 2007. Another notable role was in Lance et Compte: Le Revanche in 2006, where he played a {{paraplegic}} lawyer defending one of the fictional National de Quebec hockey who was charged with second degree murder and later for <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> following an on-ice incident where a player died from his injuries following a check from the accused player.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 May 2005, while {{filming a}} {{commercial}} with his troupe in Mexico City, an overtaking car slammed into his motorcycle caravan, sending Ponce {{flying into the}} air and injuring three other actors. Ponce {{was rushed to the hospital}} but died early the next morning. Police charged the driver with <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> and detected alcohol on his breath, but believed he did not intend to kill Ponce. Ponce's co-star Poncho de Nigris accused the man of trying to hit them, stating, [...] "the car didn't hit the brakes or anything".|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} dateable events in Athenian history {{is the creation of}} the Draconian law code, 620 BC. We know little about Draco and the code, with the homicide law being the only one known due to it surviving the Solonian reforms. The law seems to have distinguished between premeditated and <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide,</b> and provided for the reconciliation of the killer with the family of the dead man. [...] The homicide law of Draco was still in force in the fourth century. Though the rest of the code is unknown, it was by Athenian tradition known to have been very harsh.|$|E
5000|$|In France, a {{parliamentary}} report classified Scientology {{as a dangerous}} cult.

Fourteen others were convicted of fraud as well. [...] In 2009, members of the church were sued for fraud and practicing pharmacology without a license, and the Church was convicted of fraud in October 2009, being fined €600,000, with additional fines and suspended prison sentences for four officers.|$|E
5000|$|An {{association}} gathering {{veterans of}} nuclear tests (AVEN, [...] "Association des vétérans des essais nucléaires") {{was created in}} 2001. Along with the Polynesian NGO Moruroa e tatou, the AVEN announced on 27 November 2002 that it would depose a complaint against X (unknown) for <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> and putting someone’s life in danger. On 7 June 2003, for the first time, the military court of Tours granted an invalidity pension to {{a veteran of the}} Sahara tests. According to a poll made by the AVEN with its members, only 12% have declared being in good health. An international symposium on the consequences of test carried out in Algeria took place on 13 and 14 February 2007, under the official oversight of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.|$|E
50|$|On July 16, 1988, Atlas was {{appearing}} at a WWC event in Bayamón (a city near San Juan), Puerto Rico, {{where he was}} witness to the fatal assault on wrestler Bruiser Brody. José Huertas González a.k.a. the Invader, a fellow wrestler and booker, asked Brody {{to go into the}} shower to discuss business. Brody entered the shower stall and a few minutes later a scuffle ensued, followed by two groans, loud enough for the entire locker room to hear. Atlas ran to the shower and saw Brody bent over and holding his stomach. Atlas then looked up at González and saw him holding the knife. When the paramedics arrived, Atlas carried Brody downstairs to the waiting ambulance, as, due to Brody's enormous stature, paramedics were unable to lift him. González, who always maintained his innocence, was initially charged with first-degree murder but was later reduced and tried for <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On 15 September 2006, Richard Degryse {{was convicted}} guilty for <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> {{and was sentenced}} for two years of {{prohibition}} from exercising a professional activity {{in connection with the}} direction of flight operations. The sentence was far less than what the prosecutor had demanded, who had demanded for a two-year prison sentence with a suspended sentence, as well as a five-year ban. Subsequently, the airline, Air Caraïbes, was also convicted guilty and was fined 250,000 euros by the court. The court would have considered that the operations manager as well as the company knew that they had formed a dangerous crew for failing to comply with the training flight requirement for a pilot taking control of an aircraft more than 90 days after leaving [...] The court also received the civil party constitutions - after 70 - whose interests would be examined during a civil lawsuit, held on December 22 at the tribunal of Basse-Terre.|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the Cylonian affair. This event was the precondition of the first laws of Athens. There were many serious contradictions in Athens and the adoption of laws was necessary. The author of the article concludes that the Cylonian affair was the peak of social conflicts in Athens. New laws were the only way to resolve the dispute between noble families. The Cylonian affair is considered as the failed attempt to take power. After this accident the first legislation was established. The first legislator, Draco, distinguish between murder and <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide.</b> This law help to resolve conflicts in Athenian society...|$|E
30|$|Table 1 {{shows the}} {{distribution}} of cases for each area of law. We have a total of 136 criminal cases (first five categories) and 265 civil cases (remaining categories). In our previous work [17], we used only eight (8) categories but this time we have increased it to eighteen (18). For example, the homicide category has been split into two different categories: murder and manslaughter and <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> by imprudence. Land law has also been split into general land issues and tenancy issues. New categories like road accident and insurance, election matters, family issues, injunctions and judicial review have also been added. The number of cases has also rose from 294 to 401. The biggest drawback of the horizontal thesaurus approach {{is the need to}} create a lexicon (dictionary of terms) for each area of law that is added to the system. This is a time-consuming procedure and we would expect that for large number of classes, the accuracy would decrease significantly. The purpose of classifying legal materials is {{to address the needs of}} legal practitioners who need to find relevant materials quickly to prepare their cases. The information has to be provided at a sufficient granular level to be useful to them.|$|E
40|$|Belgium data on {{homicide}} {{are interesting}} for two reasons. Firstly, the demographic and criminal statistics established in 1830 offers a relatively good quality. Secondly, the rich material produced {{in one of}} the most urbanized region of Europe since the 14 th century, especially on recorded homicide (accounts of justice officers, pardon’s letters) has been exploited in many crime studies, especially Manuel Eisner’s essays. This contribution is the second of three devoted to Homicide on the long run. Our purpose is to compare both sets of data on a regional basis, by comparing the ancient duchy of Brabant (1350 - 1650) with today provinces of Antwerp and Brabant (1830 - 2000) and revise some traditional explanation of homicide evolution on the long run, only based on local or national rates. Partly due to this demographic density, the incredible state of the southern Low Countries’ documentation makes it possible to have a comprehensive and coherent vision of the public management of homicide from the end of the middle ages. The study of the sources of practice will highlight a major trend going through the whole period: the decline of the homicide rate. But, on top of a regular trend, the study of these sources clearly indicates an irregular activity of the different officers, which needs to enlighten the role of these officers as actors of homicide repression and their role as mediators between the central power and the population. This shows, on the one hand, how recorded homicide rate varies according to the institution which is mainly in charge of it; and on the other hand how this quantitative difference and this responsibility taken by institutions which are more and more centralised has been accompanied by a change of position on homicide. This evolution is clearly illustrated in the evolutions related to the vocabulary of homicide, with the appearance of the murder in the 15 th century and its growth throughout the period studied (the reversed trend as compared with the simple homicide), and to a lesser extent, with the emergence of the category ‘assassination’ in the 16 th century. The aim of the paper will then be to demonstrate how the qualitative has a role to play on the quantitative. A lesser tolerance towards homicide defined as acts which are more and more serious must be pointed out, but, paradoxically, the simple homicide, by breaking away from murders and assassinations, follows a reverse evolution towards a definition which highlights the gravity of the act to a lesser degree, which is perfectly conveyed in the 16 th and 17 th centuries in the King’s letters of pardon which forgive the perpetrator of a homicide but which at the same time also participate in the criminalization of the homicide as such. The interest of the issue will lie in this paradoxical evolution focusing on forgiveness which is granted more and more often for an act which is more and more criminalized. In the 19 th c. national state, homicide has been clearly defined by Napoleonic Penal Code. Under Adolphe Quetelet impulse, a refined statistical apparatus has been established. The production on national judicial, criminal and medical statistics, discriminated by provinces and arrondissement allows us to compare the level of homicide for two major provinces Antwerp and Brabant. Unlike the Namur case examined by Aude Musin, these provinces became in the 19 th- 20 th c., more urbanized. In the paper, we will try to follow long-term continuing decline of homicide, the variability between rural and urban arrondissements, as well as the transformations in modus operandi and in legal qualifications. Opposite to the 14 th- 17 th trend of criminalisation, we suspect for the 19 th- 20 th a process of decriminalisation, due to the emergence of new forms of <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> as traffic accidents...|$|E

Pharr, (706) 542 - 5172, pharr@jd. lawsch. uga. edu CONTACT: Dean David Shipley, (706) 542 - 7140 TWO OUTSTANDING NEW INSTRUCTORS JOIN UGA LAW SCHOOL FACULTY ATHENS, Ga. - A {{seasoned}} {{public interest}} lawyer and accomplished military attorney {{have been hired}} as new instructors at the University of Georgia School of Law: Patricia (Pat) Barron will serve as managing attorney {{of the law school}} 2 ̆ 7 s Family Violence Clinic, and Major William (Bill) H. Weber IV will supervise the law school 2 ̆ 7 s award-winning moot court and mock trial programs as director of advocacy. Barron has worked for Georgia Legal Services since her graduation from law school in 1979. She began her career as a staff attorney in the Americus office, then was promoted to supervising attorney in the Douglasville office, and has served for the last 10 years as managing attorney of the Gainesville office. There, she oversees a staff of 11, including 7 lawyers, providing civil representation to low-income clients in 24 counties of Northeast Georgia. Barron has taught Interviewing, Counseling and Negotiation to UGA law students as an adjunct professor since 1997, and has supervised several Civil Clinic students during their externships with Georgia Legal Services. Barron graduated summa cum laude from Mercer University and earned her law degree from Georgetown University in 1979. At the University of Georgia, Barron will supervise law students in the Family Violence Clinic, a civil clinic founded in 1994 to assist victims of domestic abuse. Law students now respond to nearly 500 inquiries of domestic violence in the local area each year, helping abused spouses and children obtain civil protective orders. The vast majority of the cases settle, but about 100 actually go to court, giving students the opportunity to work both as lay advocates conducting interviews and drafting initial paperwork and as practitioners under the Third-Year Practice Act resolving cases through negotiation or trial. 2 ̆ 2 Pat works tirelessly {{to address the needs of}} the poor and under-represented, 2 ̆ 2 said David Shipley, UGA law school dean. 2 ̆ 2 She brings to us a depth and range of experiences as a lawyer and a teacher as well as a powerful commitment to her clients and to public service that will strengthen our teaching and help to develop our civil clinics in important ways. 2 ̆ 2 Weber has handled several high-profile cases recently, including the trial of Captain Richard Ashby, the Marine Corps pilot whose jet severed gondola cables at an Italian ski resort, killing 20 people. Ashby was acquitted of manslaughter and <b>involuntary</b> <b>homicide</b> charges in mid-March. Weber also represented a Marine charged with conspiracy, aggravated assault and maiming after a hazing incident at Fort Knox; after pleading guilty to several lesser charges, the defendant was acquitted of all remaining charges. Weber earned a bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s degree with merit from the United States Naval Academy and served in the Marine Corps from 1987 to 1993, during which time he commanded the most decorated Marine platoon of the Gulf War, then taught basic infantry tactics to new officers. Following his service, he enrolled in law school at UGA, where he won numerous awards as a member of the law school 2 ̆ 7 s acclaimed moot court program, including participation on the team which won the Southeast Regional Competition and was awarded the Best Brief of the 1995 Jessup Moot Court Competition; brief editor for the 1996 Best Brief in the Jessup Competition; and individual honors in the First-Year Closing Argument Competition, the Russell Moot Court Competition and the Talmadge Moot Court Competition. Weber returned to the Marine Corps upon his graduation in 1996, serving as civil law officer from 1996 - 97; chief legal assistance officer from 1997 - 98; and from 1998 -present as chief civil law officer at Parris Island and Beaufort Air Station, a position similar to that of general counsel for a mid-sized corporation. 2 ̆ 2 Bill Weber had a superb record at the University of Georgia School of Law, he has been a successful advocate in the Marines, and I am confident that he will lead our moot court and mock trial programs to the next level of excellence, 2 ̆ 2 said Dean Shipley. Barron will begin her service at the law school on July 19, and Weber will arrive in early August...|$|E
