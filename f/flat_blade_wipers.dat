40|$|This report {{looks at}} the {{possibility}} of designing a universal adapter for <b>Flat</b> <b>Blade</b> windshield <b>wipers</b> in cooperation with European Automotive Supplier AB. To understand and see if this is possible, a research and an extensive patent search where done. Then to add structure to the project a Ganttschematic were developed. To generate good and solid ideas, different methods for product development were looked upon. When a method was chosen and applied, a series of concepts emerged. Now the focus was to design and construct all the pieces. The desired manufacture procedures were looked upon as well as materials. Lot of time where spent on designing a lock mechanism to meet the demands European Automotive Supplier AB hade given. To choose the right concept the team used a set of selection matrix for the different ideas. After the choices were made, different prototypes were made of the concepts. Then they were tested, and improvement on them was done to make the end product better...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{windshield}} wiper consists of 4 parts: a blade, an arm, a linkage and a motor. The <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> makes {{contact with the}} windshield and {{is designed to be}} operated normally at an angle of 30 ~ 50 degrees to the front glass. If the contact pressure between the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> and windshield surface is too high, noise and wear of the rubber will result. On the other hand, if the contact pressure is too low, the performance will do badly, since foreign substances such as dust and stains will not be removed well. The pressure and friction of the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> has a great influence on its effectiveness in cleaning the front window. This is due to the contact of the rubber with the window. This paper presents the dynamic analysis method to estimate the performance of the <b>flat</b> type <b>blade</b> of the <b>wiper</b> system. The <b>blade</b> has a nonlinear characteristic since the rubber is an incompressible hyper-elastic and visco-elastic material. Thus, Structural dynamic analysis using a complex contact model for the blade is performed to find the characteristics of the blade. The flexible multi-body dynamic model is verified by the comparison between test and analysis result. Also, the optimization using the central composite design table is performed...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a set of}} experiments concerning the behavior of several types of impellers regarding the depression formatted and operating in a specific range of rotations. Various mixer designs including a four pitched blades impeller, a six <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller and four two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller were compared. Experimental data confirmed the analytical results previously obtained. The results showed that there are similarities regarding the effects generated by four pitched blades impeller {{and one of the}} two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller. Also, it is found that two shortblade impeller produces the lowest depression of all tested impeller. The maximum depression produced by all type of impellers do not exceeds 120 mmH 2 O at 400 rpm, which is a small value to realize the vaporization of the fluid and to reach the cavitation. The equipment is not in danger to be destroyed. The numerical results obtained by experiments can be used in various practical applications...|$|R

2500|$|Early axial {{compressors}} offered poor efficiency, so {{poor that}} in the early 1920s a number of papers claimed that a practical jet engine would be impossible to construct. Things changed after A. A. Griffith published a seminal paper in 1926, noting that the reason for the poor performance was that existing compressors used <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> and were essentially [...] "flying stalled". He showed that the use of airfoils instead of the <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> would increase efficiency to the point where a practical jet engine was a real possibility. He concluded the paper with a basic diagram of such an engine, which included a second turbine that was used to power a propeller.|$|R
