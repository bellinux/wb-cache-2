5|$|August 24, 1992 - <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew</b> makes {{landfall}} on Homestead, {{just south}} of Miami, as a Category Five hurricane with winds of 165mph (265km/h). The winds destroy 25,524homes and damage 101,241 others in southern Florida, leaving up to one-quarter million people temporarily homeless. In Homestead, more than 99% of all mobile homes are completely destroyed. <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew</b> causes $25.5billion in damage (1992USD, $39.2billion 2008USD) in south Florida and 15 direct deaths. At the time, Andrew is the costliest North Atlantic hurricane {{in the history of}} the United States, though has since dropped to fifth after Hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Sandy, and Harvey.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew</b> struck South Florida on 24 August 1992, killing 13 people, leaving another 250,000 {{homeless}} and causing damages {{in excess of}} $20billion. On 27 September 1992, the 10th Mountain Division assumed responsibility for <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew</b> disaster relief as Task Force Mountain. Division soldiers set up relief camps, distributed food, clothing, medical necessities and building supplies, as well as helping to rebuild homes and clear debris. The last of the 6,000 division soldiers deployed to Florida returned home in October 1992.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{period between}} 1992 and 2005 was {{turbulent}} for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Failed responses to <b>Hurricanes</b> <b>Andrew</b> and Katrina resulted in academics questioning {{the efficacy of}} FEMA’s structure and ability to coordinate a response. The literature studying this phenomenon focuses on whether the failed responses were due to FEMA’s structure being too flexible or too hierarchical. This thesis argues this duality misses the point. First, the literature is overly focused on failure {{at the expense of}} success. This necessarily ignores half the story. Analysing successful responses will provide a more holistic view of what structures are the most appropriate in a response. Second, responses are never wholly open or closed but rather a mixture of both. FEMA’s responses need to be disaggregated into their strategic (policy-makers) and operational (implementers) components and their combinations examined. With reference to two failures, <b>Hurricanes</b> <b>Andrew</b> and Katrina, and two successes, The Great Midwest Floods and Northridge Earthquake, this thesis argues optimal response frameworks are strategically closed and operationally open.

40|$|Past {{domestic}} catastrophic disasters {{have required}} massive Department of Defense (DoD) Title 10 involvement. During <b>Hurricanes</b> <b>Andrew</b> and Katrina, DoDs initial response, although critical, was criticized as slow. The increased {{risks to the}} United States of cataclysmic events have solidified DoDs mandatory response to future events. This has punctuated the importance of DoDs initial response capability. Historically, DoDs response to catastrophic disasters was instantaneous. This was {{in part due to}} the strong relationships they maintained with State and local civil authorities. This thesis examines how the once strong relationship between DoD and State civil authorities deteriorated over the years contributing to DoDs slow initial response to <b>Hurricanes</b> <b>Andrew</b> and Katrina. Changes to disaster statutes, doctrine, and authoritative policies along with a contentious debate over the DoDs role in the domestic disaster arena have aided in deteriorating their relationship. The thesis explores {{what can be done to}} reverse the trend and build a collaborative relationship between DoD and State civil authorities. It concludes by setting forth findings and recommendations focused on creating relationship building mechanisms between the DoD and State civil authorities aimed at improving DoD initial response for the next catastrophic disaster...|$|R
5|$|In 1984, the NHC was {{separated}} from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the meteorologist in charge at Miami {{was no longer in}} a position above the hurricane center director. By 1988, the NHC gained responsibility for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones as the former Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in San Francisco was decommissioned. In 1992, <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew</b> blew the WSR-57 weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of NHC's/the Miami State Weather Forecast offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D NEXRAD system in April 1993 installed near Metro Zoo, near where <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew</b> made landfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} nearly {{struck the}} Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. Had it hit there, Iniki, along with <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew</b> and Typhoon Omar, would have struck {{each of the}} three National Weather Service offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two-month period.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{hurricane}} to hit {{the state}} during the time period was Hurricane Charley, which was the strongest hurricane to strike the United States since <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew.</b> Additionally, hurricanes Ivan, Jeanne, Dennis, Wilma, and Irma made landfall on the state as major hurricanes.|$|E
40|$|Hurricanes {{can be very}} {{different}} from each other. Here we examine the impacts that two <b>hurricanes,</b> <b>Andrew</b> and Wilma, had in terms of storm surge and sediment deposition on the southwest coast of Florida. Although Wilma was the weaker storm, it had the greater impact. Wilma had the higher storm surge over a larger area and deposited more sediment than did Andrew. This effect was most likely due to the size of Wilma’s eye, which was four times larger than that of Andrew...|$|R
50|$|In September 2008, {{after two}} {{straight}} years {{of not being}} affected by a serious hurricane, Hurricane Gustav caused $18 billion in damage in Louisiana, and a few weeks later, the Galveston, Texas and Houston, Texas areas were devastated by Hurricane Ike with over $31 billion in damage, making Ike the third most destructive hurricane ever to hit the United States behind <b>Hurricanes</b> <b>Andrew</b> and Katrina. Over 100 people were killed. The hurricanes also caused gas prices to spike to around $4 per gallon.|$|R

5|$|Dean was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall in the Atlantic basin at Category5 intensity since <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew</b> on August 24, 1992. Dean's Category5 landfall was in a sparsely populated area and thus far less damaging than Andrew's, even though Dean was much larger, but its long swath of damage resulted in its name retirement from the World Meteorological Organization's Atlantic hurricane naming lists.|$|E
5|$|Iniki caused around $1.8billion (1992USD) {{of damage}} and six deaths. At the time, Iniki {{was among the}} costliest United States hurricanes, and it {{remains one of the}} costliest hurricanes on record in the eastern Pacific. The storm struck just weeks after <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew,</b> the costliest {{tropical}} cyclone ever at the time, struck Florida.|$|E

5000|$|Military Support to Civil Authorities (MSCA): These {{operations}} can {{consist of}} temporary augmentation of {{air traffic controllers}} and postal workers during strikes, restoration {{of law and order}} after a riot, protection of life and federal property, or providing relief in the aftermath of natural disaster. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of federal military forces to enforce or otherwise execute laws unless expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress. Examples of MSCA are disaster relief provided during <b>Hurricanes</b> <b>Andrew</b> and Iniki in 1992, and deployment of troops during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.|$|R
50|$|Weather {{proved to}} be a {{challenge}} for the FRD-10 antennas. For example, the antenna at NSGA Winter Harbor had problems due to frost heaving the ground and shifting the reflector screens out of alignment. Digging up the affected poles and replacing them was costly and was estimated at around $240,000 in the late 1970s. An alternative method was discovered that modified the poles to allow readjustment of the screen instead the costly removal and replacement that had been done in the past. The arrays were also vulnerable to high winds. Antenna arrays at Homestead, Florida and Sebana Seca, Puerto Rico were heavily damaged by <b>hurricanes</b> <b>Andrew</b> and Georges, respectively.|$|R
5|$|The strongest {{hurricane}} to hit {{the state}} during the time period was <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew,</b> {{which was one of}} only three Category 5 hurricanes to strike the United States. Andrew, at the time, was the costliest tropical cyclone in United States history. Additionally, Hurricane Eloise and Hurricane Opal hit the state as major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds and other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew,</b> scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} {{advisory}} on the depression, the National Hurricane Center emphasized the threat for heavy rainfall in Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, south Florida, and the Bahamas. The agency also advised small craft in Cuba and the Cayman Islands {{to remain at}} port. The depression was the first tropical cyclone threat to south Florida since <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew</b> nine months prior, although officials noted the depression's winds were no cause for concern.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{tropical}} storms on coral reefs {{can be both}} immediate and lingering. Satellites can provide synoptic coverage of storm-induced plumes of sediment and associated runoff, whose effects are proportional to the length and extent of the plume. We examined three <b>hurricanes</b> (<b>Andrew,</b> Georges and Charley) affecting south Florida utilizing three different satellite sensors (Landsat, SeaWiFS and MODIS) to determine what information these sensors could provide. Results show all three sensors could provide some information on the longevity and geographic extent of the plumes. However, usefulness of the satellite data was limited {{by the amount of}} cloud cover. The storm-induced plumes observed lasted four to seven days and stretched as far as 120 km...|$|R

Also, on September 24, 2005, as Rita hit the southwest coast of Louisiana, the Louisiana Geological Survey assisted the United States Geological Survey in the creation of mapping for Lake Charles, Louisiana, and surrounding communities. It was responsible for the production of the maps.|$|R
5|$|The List of Florida hurricanes {{encompasses}} approximately 500tropical or subtropical cyclones {{that affected}} {{the state of}} Florida. More storms hit Florida than any other U.S. state, and since 1851 only eighteen hurricane seasons passed without a known storm impacting the state. Collectively, cyclones that hit the region have resulted in over 10,000 deaths, most of which occurring {{prior to the start}} of Hurricane Hunters flights in 1943. Additionally, the cumulative impact from the storms totaled over $141billion in damage (2017USD), primarily from <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew</b> and hurricanes in the 2004 and 2005 seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Charley in South Carolina {{included}} $20million (2004USD) in damage and 135,000power outages. Hurricane Charley lasted from August 9 to August 15, 2004, {{and at its}} peak attained 150mph (240km/h) winds, making it a strong Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm made landfall in southwestern Florida at maximum strength, making it the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Andrew</b> struck Florida twelve years before, in 1992.|$|E
