25|$|In Serbia, JP Pošta Srbije Beograd, the {{state-owned}} post, provides a telegram service. It {{is commonly used}} to express condolences, official notifications of death or to congratulate anniversaries, births, graduations, etc. Telegrams may be sent by using special telephone number or directly at the post office. Telegrams are delivered {{on the same day}} for recipients in territories covered by post offices with telegram delivery service and are delivered as regular mail for post offices which do not have telegram delivery service. In <b>internal</b> <b>traffic,</b> length of message is limited to 800 characters and is charged at flat rate while in international traffic telegrams are charged by word. International delivery is possible for recipients in Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia.|$|E
500|$|The {{rail traffic}} on Polish railway lines was {{extremely}} dense. An average of 420 German military trains were passing through every 24 hours {{on top of}} <b>internal</b> <b>traffic</b> already in 1941. The Holocaust trains were routinely delayed en route; some transports took many days to arrive. Hundreds of prisoners died from exhaustion, suffocation and thirst while in transit to the camp in the overcrowded wagons. In extreme cases such as the Biała Podlaska transport of 6,000 Jews travelling only a [...] distance, up to 90 per cent of people were already dead when the sealed doors flew open. From September 1942 on, both Polish and foreign Jews were greeted with a brief verbal announcement. An earlier signboard with directions was removed because it was clearly insufficient. [...] The deportees {{were told that they}} had arrived at a transit point on the way to Ukraine and needed to shower and have their clothes disinfected before receiving work uniforms and new orders.|$|E

60|$|DURING {{the absence}} of this detachment, a sociable {{intercourse}} had been kept up between the main party and the Skynses, who had removed into the neighborhood of the camp. These people dwell about {{the waters of the}} Way-lee-way and the adjacent country, and trade regularly with the Hudson's Bay Company; generally giving horses in exchange for the articles of which they stand in need. They bring beaver skins, also, to the trading posts; not procured by trapping, but by a course of <b>internal</b> <b>traffic</b> with the shy and ignorant Shoshokoes and Too-el-icans, who keep in distant and unfrequented parts of the country, and will not venture near the trading houses. The Skynses hunt the deer and elk occasionally; and depend, for a part of the year, on fishing. Their main subsistence, however, is upon roots, especially the kamash. This bulbous root is said to be of a delicious flavor, and highly nutritious. The women dig it up in great quantities, steam it, and deposit it in caches for winter provisions. It grows spontaneously, and absolutely covers the plains.|$|E

50|$|On 20 September 1961, DR {{decided to}} build a 347 metres long {{connecting}} curve between the Franconian Forest line and the line to Sonnenberg. This had been planned since 1936, to avoid the need to reverse in Probstzella. The curve would have an advantage for border security as <b>internal</b> <b>traffic</b> {{would no longer have}} to run to the border station. On 2 October 1961, construction work began north of the station. On 9 December 1961 the new line was opened. Probstzella halt was opened on 2 November 1964 on this single-track curve. On 23 May 1993, the curve was closed.|$|E

50|$|Serving only {{a string}} of {{medium-sized}} market towns between its extremities, the S&D generated a modest <b>internal</b> <b>traffic,</b> and had daunting operational costs, due {{to the difficulty of}} its main line. Its strategic significance was the formation of a through route between the Midlands and the South Coast, by connecting with the Midland Railway at Bath. The Midland Railway linked Bath to Bristol and via Gloucester to Birmingham and the North. Heavy summer holiday passenger traffic and healthy through freight business was the result, but the long and difficult main line was always very expensive to support the business.|$|E
50|$|IPsec is a {{protocol}} suite, recently standardized by the IETF, which provides network-layer security {{services such as}} packet confidentiality, authentication, data integrity, replay protection, and automated key management.This is an artifact of firewall deployment: <b>internal</b> <b>traffic</b> that is not seen by the firewall cannot be filtered; as a result, internal users can mount attacks on other users and networks without the firewall being able to intervene.

5000|$|The SDN Datapath is {{a logical}} network device that exposes {{visibility}} and uncontested control over its advertised forwarding and data processing capabilities. The logical representation may encompass all or {{a subset of the}} physical substrate resources. An SDN Datapath comprises a CDPI agent and a set of one or more traffic forwarding engines and zero or more traffic processing functions. These engines and functions may include simple forwarding between the datapath's external interfaces or <b>internal</b> <b>traffic</b> processing or termination functions. One or more SDN Datapaths may be contained in a single (physical) network element—an integrated physical combination of communications resources, managed as a unit. An SDN Datapath may also be defined across multiple physical network elements.

50|$|Though the Ethiopian {{government}} {{has increased its}} efforts to prosecute and punish transnational trafficking offenders, prosecution of <b>internal</b> <b>trafficking</b> cases remains nonexistent. Article 635 of Ethiopia's Criminal Code (Trafficking in Women and Minors) criminalizes sex trafficking and prescribes punishments not exceeding five years' imprisonment. Articles 596 (Enslavement) and 597 (Trafficking in Women and Children) outlaw slavery and labor trafficking and prescribe punishments of five to 20 years' rigorous imprisonment. These articles, however, have rarely been used to prosecute trafficking offenses; instead, Articles 598 (Unlawful Sending of Ethiopians to Work Abroad) and 571 (Endangering the Life of Another) are more often used to prosecute cases of transnational labor trafficking. The Federal High Court's 11th Criminal Bench heard all cases of transnational trafficking, as well as <b>internal</b> <b>trafficking</b> cases discovered in the Addis Ababa jurisdiction. Between March and October 2009, the bench heard fifteen cases related to transnational labor trafficking, resulting in five convictions, nine acquittals, and one withdrawal due to missing witnesses. Of the five convictions, three offenders received suspended sentences of five years' imprisonment, two co-defendants were fined, and one offender is serving a sentence of five years' imprisonment.|$|R

40|$|Child {{trafficking}} {{has been}} conceptualised as ‘modern day slavery’. Slavery {{has been held}} up as the worst possible exploitation in human history (Lee, 2007). For more than 20 years UK governments have ratified United Nation Conventions and Protocols and rescheduled laws {{in its effort to}} eradicate this crime. However, despite such political commitment, in reality thousands of British children are still victims to <b>internal</b> <b>trafficking</b> for sexual exploitation in the UK today. Over the last 10 years the UK government has employed agencies, {{in the shape of the}} UK Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC), the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) and the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre (CEOP). Each of these organisations have the specialised framework of identifying trafficked children (and adults), and estimating the scale of the problem. However, in each of the current reports delivered by these agencies, there is little or no statistical data and recognition for British national children (CEOP, 2010; HM Government, 2011; SOCA, 2012). The aim of this study was to try and seek out ‘why there is lack of recognition for British children who are victim to <b>internal</b> <b>trafficking</b> for sexual exploitation?’ By carrying out an analysis of academic, media and journal text and interviewing policing bodies and an NGO, who have direct experience with this subject matter, some quite alarming revelations were revealed. These include the covert nature of the crime; child protection professionals and the police not understanding the definition of ‘human trafficking’ as set out in the Palermo Protocol (2000); police officers not recording incidents of children being internally trafficked; police recording sexual exploitation as sexual abuse; no statutory responsibility of the police to pass information on trafficked children to either the UKHTC or the NRM; and the lack of police resources to deal with the situation. As such, this study presents that the <b>internal</b> <b>trafficking</b> of British children is not only a crime against humanity, but also a crime in which the UK government and its agencies appear to ignore...|$|R
