5|$|The {{television}} series Jackass {{is referred to}} frequently by Peter and his neighbors, and is the principal reason that they try to do stunts. Johnny Knoxville cameoes and takes a shotgun blast which blows off part of <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> episode, while being launched off a ramp and flying through the air, Peter wears the costume from The Greatest American Hero and sings the series' theme song.|$|E
5|$|While {{the doctor}} {{talks with the}} police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, and has been slowly losing her sanity from guilt and isolation, frees Paulette and stabs Louise in the neck. She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. Génessier dismisses the police (who readily accept his explanations) and returns to his lab, where an {{abandoned}} German Shepherd he'd only recently obtained for his experiments attacks him, inciting the other dogs to follow suit—maddened by pain and confinement, they maul him to death, disfiguring <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. Christiane, unmoved by her father's death, walks slowly into the woods outside Génessier's house {{with one of the}} freed doves on her hand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty. The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> putty, so he was instructed to hold his breath {{as long as he}} possibly could. But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it on eBay. The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E

Lilly was indifferent to his own appearance, and his collar was a rag.|$|R
5|$|Santos boxed for {{the vacant}} WBO light-middleweight title against Yori Boy Campas {{in a fight}} that took place at Bally's Event Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Santos won the fight when referee Joe Cortez intervened in the {{eleventh}} round. During {{the course of the}} fight numerous combinations hurt Campas and cut <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eleventh round following one of Santos' punches Campas informed Cortez that his vision was not functioning properly. At the moment of the fight's conclusion the scores of the judges were 99–91, 97–93 and 99–90 in favor of Santos. On August 17, 2002, Santos defended this championship for a first time against Mehrdud Takaloo, in a fight that also involved the World Boxing Union Light middleweight championship. The event took place in the Cardiff Castle located in Cardiff, Wales. Takaloo began the fight by using his right hand often and on the fourth round he scored a knockdown. As the fight progressed Takaloo began to show signs of exhaustion and Santos managed to have a strong performance {{in the second half of}} the fight. Takaloo received cuts around both of his eyes which made the referee consider stopping the fight twice in the tenth round. When the fight ended Santos won the contest by unanimous decision and the judges' scores were 116–111, 116–112, 117–110.|$|E
25|$|Only {{a single}} Russian is shown with <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, {{with the rest}} of the antagonists being faceless Soviets, {{particularly}} the helicopter. The original ending was created as a compromise resulting in a closing deadline and lack of funding, yet keeping the ending open. After the premiere, a new ending was filmed, which weaved the storyline better together. The second version also trimmed 10 minutes from the film's beginning.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Smith {{would put}} the seer stone into a hat, and put <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the {{darkness}} the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, {{and when it was}} written down and repeated to Brother Joseph {{to see if it was}} correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, Joseph Smith founded the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} {{based in part}} on what was said to be information obtained miraculously from the reflections of seer stones. Smith had at least three separate stones, including his favorite, a brown stone he found during excavation of a neighbor's well. He initially used these stones in various treasure-digging quests in the early 1820s, placing the stone in the bottom of his hat and putting <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hat to read what he believed were the miraculous reflections from the stone. Smith also said that he had access to a separate set of spectacles composed of seer stones, which he called the Urim and Thummim. He said that, through these stones, he could translate the golden plates that are the stated source of the Book of Mormon.|$|E
25|$|Registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola) {{begins a}} rivalry with Dan after he {{undermines}} {{him over the}} treatment of a patient. Tensions build when he learns that Malick is gay. He secretly treats his injured rugby team mate Sean Foster (Sam Callis) with steroids. Malick and Chrissie criticise his actions and Malick threatens to report him. Sean develops necrotizing fasciitis as a result and Dan is forced to operate, ruining Sean's career. A fight ensues between the two and Dan kisses Malick. He then runs to Chrissie and confesses his love for her. Dan asks Malick to forget the kiss and attempts to avoid him. They are forced to operate together. Dan undermines him in theatre, the pair fight once more. After more competitiveness, Dan ignores Malick's medical advice dangering a patient. Malick is angered by his attitude and punches Dan, injuring <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process.|$|E
25|$|That {{following}} day, 14 February 1779, Cook {{marched through}} the village to retrieve the King. Cook took the King (aliʻi nui) by his own hand and led him willingly away. One of Kalaniʻōpuʻu's favorite wives, Kanekapolei and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded with the king not to go until he stopped and sat where he stood. An old kahuna (priest), chanting rapidly while holding out a coconut, attempted to distract Cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore. The king began to understand that Cook was his enemy. As Cook turned his back to help launch the boats, he was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surf. He was first struck {{on the head with}} a club by a chief named Kalaimanokahoʻowaha or Kanaʻina (namesake of Charles Kana'ina) and then stabbed by one of the king's attendants, Nuaa. The Hawaiians carried his body away towards the back of the town, still visible to the ship through their spyglass. Four marines, Corporal James Thomas, Private Theophilus Hinks, Private Thomas Fatchett and Private John Allen, were also killed and two others were wounded in the confrontation.|$|E

25|$|In their rooms, Raoul expresses disgust {{that their}} host would send circus freaks to receive them ("What a Dreadful Town!..."). He upsets Gustave {{by refusing to}} play with him and storms out to find a bar, leaving Christine to explain his {{behavior}} to their son ("Look With Your Heart"). When Gustave goes to bed, the Phantom enters and reveals to a stunned Christine that {{it was he who}} summoned her to sing at Phantasma. Initially outraged, Christine eventually succumbs to the memory of a clandestine evening the two shared before she was married. As they recall their one night of passion, it is revealed that Christine was prepared to abandon Raoul for the Phantom, but awoke in the morning to find herself alone. The Phantom explains that he fled out of fear that she would reject him again when she saw <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning light ("Beneath a Moonless Sky"). Both concede that they once thought their love had a chance, but the circumstances of the present day make it impossible ("Once Upon Another Time"). They are startled by a scream from Gustave, who awakens from a nightmare and rushes into the room. Christine introduces the Phantom as an old friend named Mr. Y, and he promises to show the boy around Phantasma the next day ("Mother Please, I'm Scared!").|$|E
500|$|Many Democrats were incensed at McCarthy's {{attack on}} the State Department of a Democratic administration, and had hoped to use the {{hearings}} to discredit him.

He pleases them {{so much that they}} want him to join them the next night, and offer a gift for him. In addition, they take the lump off his face, thinking that he will want it back and therefore have to join them the next night. An unpleasant neighbor, who also has a lump, hears of the old man's good fortune and attempts to repeat it, and steal the gift. The tengu, however, simply give him the first lump in addition to his own, because they are disgusted by his bad dancing, and because he tried to steal the gift.|$|E
500|$|The labourers {{worked in}} 12-hour shifts of 3,000–4,000 men, with three 20-minute breaks during each shift. The work {{continued}} around the clock, {{seven days a}} week, under giant floodlights during the night. The living and working conditions were extremely harsh, especially for the political prisoners and the eastern Europeans, who were given especially punitive treatment due to their status as the most expendable members of the workforce. For the non-German workers, falling ill or being unable to work through injury {{was the equivalent of}} a death sentence, as they would either be left to die or be transported back to the concentration camps from which they had been brought. A German commission that inspected the labour camps in the area in late 1943 commented: [...] "The Eastern [...] worker is very tough. He works at his job until he falls flat on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mire, and all that is left for the doctor to do is to issue the death certificate." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after Berry's {{death in}} 1416, {{the bulk of}} his treasures were seized and melted down by the English, who were occupying much of {{northern}} France after their victory at the Battle of Agincourt the previous year. [...] That the reliquary escaped this fate suggests it may have been given away by Berry, perhaps to his Burgundian cousins, in whose family it is next recorded (the Burgundian heiress Mary of Burgundy married the Habsburg Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1477). [...] A reliquary that was donated to the church had a better chance of surviving than the similar secular works that are now only known from their descriptions in inventories, where scenes of courtly pleasure were depicted with portrait figures of the princes and their friends. A work belonging to Berry's elder brother Anjou showed the romance of Tristan and Isolde, with King Mark spying on the lovers from a tree above them, giving himself away when they see [...] "the enamelled reflection of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> enamelled brook".|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} Casino Royale, Sellers was {{appointed}} a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) {{in honour of}} his career achievements. The day before the investiture at Buckingham Palace, Sellers and Ekland argued, with Ekland scratching <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process; Sellers had a make-up artist cover the marks. Ekland later reported that although the couple argued, Sellers never hit her. During his next film, The Bobo, which again co-starred Ekland, the couple's marital problems worsened. Three weeks into production in Italy, Sellers told director Robert Parrish to fire his wife, saying [...] "I'm not coming back after lunch if that bitch is on the set". Ekland later stated that the marriage was [...] "an atrocious sham" [...] at this stage. In the midst of filming The Bobo, Sellers's mother had a heart attack; Parrish asked Sellers {{if he wanted to}} visit her in hospital, but Sellers remained on set. She died within days, without Sellers having seen her. He was deeply affected by her death and remorseful at not having returned to London to see her. Ekland served him with divorce papers shortly afterwards. The divorce was finalised on 18 December 1968, and Sellers's friend Spike Milligan sent Ekland a congratulatory telegram. Upon its release in September 1967, The Bobo was poorly received.|$|E
500|$|Just before Dwight {{starts his}} fire simulation, {{he said his}} {{co-workers}} previously failed to listen because he made a presentation on the computer program Microsoft PowerPoint, of which he said, [...] "PowerPoint is boring". Michael refers to Barack Obama, the first African American president of the United States, to Stanley while he is suffering a heart attack by shouting, [...] "Stanley! Barack is president! You are black! Stanley!" [...] A deleted scene further addresses Obama's election, with Michael praising the choice and Darryl, with Darryl half-jokingly telling the Caucasian office workers what will change for them (they {{no longer have to}} pretend to like jazz, and Morgan Freeman won't get any more acting work because [...] "he's more for you guys"). Michael calls an employee from the Red Cross, an international humanitarian movement, to conduct a lesson about CPR. The instructor suggests they pump the heart to the tune of [...] "Stayin' Alive", a disco song by the pop band, the Bee Gees, but Michael mixes the song up with [...] "I Will Survive" [...] by Gloria Gaynor. At the end of the lesson, Dwight cuts the face off the CPR dummy and places it on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manner of Hannibal Lecter, a fictional cannibalistic serial killer who cut the face off a man and wore it as a mask in the 1991 thriller film, The Silence of the Lambs. Watching Mrs. Albert Hannaday, Andy says the Cloris Leachman character was originally supposed to be played by the much younger actress, Nicole Kidman, and the last-minute replacement prompted a minor overhaul in the film's script. The songs [...] "You Make My Dreams Come True" [...] by Hall and Oates, [...] "All Out of Love" [...] by the soft rock duo Air Supply, [...] "Have a Little Faith in Me" [...] by singer-songwriter John Hiatt, and [...] "Lady" [...] by Little River Band play during scenes in Mrs. Albert Hannaday.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} create the Night King, {{according}} to Barrie Gower, it is primarily practical prosthetic, but also incorporates some VFX {{to create a more}} icy look and feel, saying about the eyes, [...] "The effects department alters the eyes in post-production. They give them that blue-glowy hue to them, which we can't really achieve with contact lenses." [...] In regards to the overall prosthetic, [...] "they've added this sort of icy layer over the top of him to create this — it's something incredibly difficult to achieve practically, prosthetics are cast in a translucent rubber, which can only give you so much of that icy quality, so visual effects help augment it a little bit further to give it more dimension." [...] Prior to the sixth season, the Night King was portrayed by Richard Brake, with a head mold of Brake being created in order to accurately mold the prosthetic to <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> sixth season he was portrayed by Vladimir Furdik. The White Walker army was first shot in front of a green screen in Magheramorne quarry, and according to a piece in The Hollywood Reporter [...] "A scan was taken from a drone and used as the basis for a CG model of the location, which was augmented with VFX and joined with volcanic hills that were photographed in Iceland." [...] Crowd replication was used to create the 1,000-man army, with special effects supervisor Joe Bauer saying [...] "It's scans of those actors in the makeup and costumes, with variations we used to make a digital army that extends up onto the hills." [...] Bauer also noted that VFX were used to create the weather conditions in the scene, noting [...] "It's wind, mist, fog and heavy atmosphere that you'd get in a marine layer. The dramatic value is to say something's wrong; it's a mystery what they are facing. The temperature drops, and our characters can see their breath. The weather obscures their vision." [...] Spain-based El Ranchito, one of several special effects companies used by Game of Thrones, was responsible for the White Walker army shots.|$|E
