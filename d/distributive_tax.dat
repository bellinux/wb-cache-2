He was already deeply imbued with the theories of Quesnay and Gournay, and set to work to apply them {{as far as possible}} in his province. His first plan was to continue the work, already initiated by his predecessor Tourny, of making a fresh survey of the land (cadastre), in order to arrive at a more just assessment of the taille; he also obtained a large reduction in the contribution of the province. He published his Avis sur l'assiette et la repartition de la taille (1762-1770), and as president of the Société d'agriculture de Limoges offered prizes for essays on the principles of taxation. Quesnay and Mirabeau had advocated a proportional tax (impôt de quotité), but Turgot proposed a <b>distributive</b> <b>tax</b> (impôt de repartition). Another reform was the substitution for the corvée of a tax in money levied on the whole province, the construction of roads being handed over to contractors, by which means Turgot was able to leave his province with a good system of highways, while distributing more justly the expense of their construction.|$|E

Exploiting the substantial variation of tax and transfer systems across US states {{and over time}} we investigate the necessary traces of these two effects in the data: that state-level measures of redistributive taxation should correlate negatively with, (a) the standard deviation, and (b) the mean, of the within-state consumption distribution.

40|$|This paper numerically {{explores the}} <b>distributive</b> <b>tax</b> policy for {{improving}} both efficiency and equity with increased remittances in Ghana within a {{computable general equilibrium}} (CGE) framework. The generalized framework with the latest Ghanaian input-output table of year 2005 with 59 different production sectors provides the following results: First, the government can improve both efficiency and equity by using a government surplus generated by increased remittances without additional tax revenue. Second, {{if the government is}} concerned about equity, then a surplus used for more direct transfers to the rural households results in the best outcome in terms of equity. Third, such a policy also results in the improvement in efficiency. Welfare of not only rural but also urban households improves by such a policy through its strong stimulation effect on the demand side. Fourth, while the impact through the supply side is relatively smaller, an introduction of subsidies to production of the 'Cocoa Beans' sector results in the best outcome for the improvement in efficiency and equity among all supply side tax policies. Fifth, if the government is concerned only about efficiency, then a policy to use a surplus for more government spending on education or health achieves the highest efficiency through its direct demand effect. Under such a policy, the positive impact on equity is limited. Finally, while the Ghanaian economy can enjoy the largest benefits in improved efficiency as a whole when a surplus is used for more government spending on education or health, increased efficiency gain will be more distributed to the government sector in comparison with the case when a surplus is used for more direct transfers to the rural households...|$|E

40|$|The National Tax Association (1907) {{successfully}} led more well-known Progressive Era reform groups (National Municipal League, Civic Federation, Bar and Economics Associations and others) in advocating twenty-eight "classified" (discriminatory) taxes [...] {{examined in}} statutory detail, with debate. Supplanting constitutionally mandated, uniform-rate, shared state/local general property taxation {{and the federal}} tariff, NTA Model Laws with varying bases, rates, loopholes, methods of assessment, administration, and collection for separate levels of government supervised by newly-created "independent" State Tax Commissions reflected the NTA's classified tariff model, Republican roots, and business interests of its leadership. Classification produced the <b>distributive</b> <b>tax</b> politics imbedded in today's American tax "structure" [...] composed entirely of NTA reforms supported by its supply-side, class-based, European-generated rationales. NTA reformers used seven "tax incentive" arguments supporting selective tax relief, reflecting their restricted membership, procedures, and funding sources. Results show intangibles investors and businesses (banking, insurance, securities) and other "regulated" concentrated industries (public service corporations) benefitting from NTA reforms reducing intangibles and selected tangible tax burdens (timber industry) via relief from personal property taxation replaced by "net" earnings taxation and one-time recording or stumpage fees [...] in lieu of yearly personal property taxes based on total asset value. Highly competitive industries producing tangible goods (manufacturing, mining), their employees and consumers, farmers and small-lot owners suffered under NTA reforms [...] through comparatively regressive real estate levies and new taxes added to the general property tax [...] income, sales, excises and user fees, while absorbing excused intangible tax burdens. While NTA state success positively correlated {{with the presence of}} State Tax Associations, NTA leader-lobbyists, State Tax Commissions, pre-existing state classification leeway, and economic structure, and federal success with NTA co-affiliations, alternative hypotheses suggest NTA success related positively to powerful within-state interest groups (virtually identical to NTA reformers' interests), Republican governorships, governors with intangibles business ties, and states with diversified economies. The rise of State Tax Commissions and tax classification during competitive state/local electoral times suggests an alternative interpretation of realignment, and supports critics of anti-democratic Progressive Era municipal reform.

Results support the hypothesis that personal norms and justice concerns are related to tax compliance attitudes. Moreover, analyses confirm the hypothesis that distributive fairness positively affects both tax compliance attitudes and intentions to comply among entrepreneurs with relatively low personal norms, while distributive justice has no significant effect among entrepreneurs with high personal norms.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to offer an {{overview}} of the many opportunities the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) data set provides to measure the <b>distributive</b> effect of <b>taxes</b> and transfers in the developed countries. Two specific tasks are undertaken. First, and most important, the paper offers a detailed discussion of a number of aspects of fiscal redistribution, presenting a good deal of newly computed data that are, to our knowledge, unavailable elsewhere. LIS data are detailed enough to allow us not only to measure overall redistribution, but also to explore whether redistribution has been achieved primarily through taxes or transfers; to compare the redistributive effect of the most important individual transfers; to determine whether redistribution is associated with the size or the internal target efficiency of social benefits; to focus separately on redistribution across all income groups, lower, middle and upper income groups, and those in poverty; and to examine separately households headed by persons of working age. Second, the paper places fiscal redistribution in a broader context by discussing several aspects of redistribution that are not directly measured in LIS surveys. These include the redistributive effect of in-kind benefits, which we will explore using an imputation method; and second-order effects, whereby direct transfers affect pregovernment private sector income, in turn affecting measures of direct state transfers...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] “This Article {{argues that}} the pro-consumption tax {{literature}} is wrong to claim that no legitimate fairness objections to the consumption tax exist. It {{argues that the}} persistent and widespread wariness about replacing our current hybrid consumption tax/income tax system with a pure consumption tax is, contrary to what the pro-consumption tax literature asserts, completely justified. In fact, our reservations about the consumption tax’s fairness reflect legitimate concern {{about the role of}} capitalist power in America, particularly over the past thirty years. Indeed, the more the nation continues to experience the social welfare effects of increased capitalist power, the more compelling these objections become. History proves these concerns not just legitimate, but paramount. A full account, not a dismissal, of how capitalist power might benefit from a consumption tax is what would be required to meet these fairness objections. Part II of this Article fleshes out the fairness objections more fully and addresses the counter arguments that exist in the literature. In doing so, it seeks to reestablish the legitimacy of fairness objections to a consumption tax and encourage more robust and historically aware considerations of <b>distributive</b> justice in <b>tax</b> policy. Part II goes further and shows that the consumption tax literature gets it wrong in a particularly revealing way. Part II characterizes the pro-consumption tax literature’s dismissal of serious fairness and distributive justice concerns as, essentially, ideological; the literature’s very framing of the fairness issue precludes any serious consideration of the historical reality of capitalist power. Ideology, not argument, supports the claim that capitalist power is not a concern. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} analyze the {{distribution}} of real estate assets among Brazilian families and IPTU-property tax-their main form of taxation. The text points out that real estate property usufruct is more concentrated than family income itself, {{despite the fact that}} IPTU boasts a dubious behavior, from a <b>distributive</b> standpoint. The <b>tax</b> burden is heavier on wealthier families, since only a few low-income families actually pay property tax. However, when only the universe of actual taxpayers is examined, it is observed that the tax structure is highly regressive, with poorer taxpayers more likely to undergo a heavier tax burden. The main causes pointed out in the text are poor administrative management, outdated and regressive official real estate assessment versus property market values and the lack of a comprehensive coverage of tax maps and inventories of poor dwelling units. The possibility of adoption of progressive tax rates, introduced by Constitutional Amendment no 29 of 2000, did little to alter IPTU distribution in the municipalities that embraced it, for they were not duly calibrated in accordance with the distribution of the properties market values to be taxed. Additionally, the paper demonstrates that a broad IPTU exemption policy, together with poor administrative and assessorial quality end up exempting middle and higher-income families from paying property tax. A tax reform devised to increase tax progressiveness in Brazil, increasing property tax bills and easing the tax weight on consumption, must be perceptive of the distributive aspects of IPTU, instead of merely focusing on an increase or progression oftax levy rates...|$|R
40|$|The Article {{explains}} why {{international trade and}} tax arrangements should advance global wealth redistribution {{in a world of}} enhanced economic integration. Despite the indisputable importance of global poverty and inequality, contemporary political philosophy stagnates over the controversy of whether distributive justice obligations should extend beyond the political framework of the nation state. This stagnation results from the difficulty of reconciling liberal impartiality with notions of state sovereignty and accountability. The Article offers an alternative approach that bypasses the controversy of the current debate. It argues that international trade results in relational distributive duties when domestic parties engage in transactions with foreign parties that suffer from an endowed vulnerability—such as extreme poverty prevalent in the developing world. These relational duties differ from 2 ̆ 2 traditional 2 ̆ 2 distributive claims because they rely on actual economic relationships, rather than upon hypothetical social-contract scenarios. The Article establishes that in a competitive market, private parties cannot address these relational distributive duties by themselves, because doing so would put them at a competitive disadvantage, and argues that the only common-action solution to this systemic problem in the current global political setting is wealth transfers among states. The Article proceeds to suggest some policy implication of this normative analysis in the field of international tax law. It points out that the allocation of taxing rights is a form of wealth allocation that divides globalization 2 ̆ 7 s revenue-proceeds among nations. As such, tax allocation arrangements should help 2 ̆ 2 correct 2 ̆ 2 international trade relationships that fail to meet relational distributive standards. This discussion stresses a point frequently neglected by both the tax and political philosophy literatures—that real-world attempts to promote a more just distribution of global wealth could greatly benefit from integrating <b>distributive</b> considerations in <b>tax</b> allocation arrangements...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{tax policy}} options for Singapore. The first three substantive chapters evaluate {{the efficiency and}} distributive impacts of various tax alternatives using a static numerical general equilibrium model. One notable difference of this study from major general equilibrium tax studies for other countries is that instead of using the arithmetic sum of the Compensating and/or Equivalent variations across households, welfare impacts are evaluated using the concept of potential welfare gain/loss, based on Kaldor 2 ̆ 7 s (1939) weak compensation principle. The cost of tax distortions is sensitive to the criteria used to evaluate efficiency. To analyze the general equilibrium impacts of mandatory savings, a feature of special importance in Singapore, the static model is extended to incorporate endogenous saving behaviour.;Another distinguishing feature of this study which differentiates it from others is its special emphasis {{on the effects of}} alternative tax systems on the performance of the traded sector. The interaction between tax policy and trade structure is particularly important for a country with a large volume of trade, like Singapore. The analysis of this issue in chapter 4 is a novel contribution, because traditional tax policy analysis does not examine trade impact but mainly studies the efficiency and <b>distributive</b> effects of <b>taxes</b> and the effects of taxes on variables such as output or primary factor allocations. This thesis attempts to empirically study the general equilibrium interaction of tax policy and trade structure.;Finally, chapter 5 presents a theoretical framework to examine the tax treatment of financial intermediary services. The question of whether to include banking services in the tax base has received little attention from academic economists. A priori, it seems straight-forward that (if leisure is exogenous), for a broadly-based consumption tax, all goods and services, including banking services, {{should be included in the}} tax base. Numerical simulation results suggest that, in equal yield comparisons, a tax on goods alone but not on banking intermediation services is preferable to a broader tax including financial services. While not proving that banks should not be taxed, these results challenge the conventional wisdom that they should be included in the tax base...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyThe chronic {{inequality}} {{that characterized}} Latin America and the Caribbean {{has its roots}} {{not only in the}} region’s history but also in a pattern of development and modernization that perpetuated the socio-economic gaps. Very recently, however, the region experienced a period of sustained growth between 2003 and 2008, in which the indicators of poverty, indigence and even concentration of income improved, breaking, although for a short period, the so-called “empty box” of Fernando Fajnzylber. It is well known that the state can promote greater social equity through more effective public policies. However, as noted in this work, some distinctive features of inequality in our region as the large fraction of total income captured by the highest stratum, the level of geographical disparities and the high levels of poverty, reflect the difficulty in improving equity and cohesion and the complexity of achieving that aim by means of decentralized policies. Most of the times, the poorest areas are exactly those that have the lowest tax bases for funding the priorities of local public spending. To improve distributive impacts and promote equality and social cohesion in Latin America and the Caribbean, it is important to realize that citizens’ social needs are impossible to meet without financial resources. On the revenue size, the region’s fiscal systems share two important limitations: low tax pressure and regressive taxation, which, together with large-scale evasion and tax avoidance, all have major effects on equity. On the expenditure size, it is hoped that the structure of the spending financed with the resources available can help to construct more cohesive societies, increasing the legitimacy of public policy and therefore of paying the taxes intended to finance them. Decentralization is an important issue that affects {{the role of the state}} in improving the distributive equity, and the expected benefits of decentralization need to be evaluated in the context of the peculiarities of each country. In order to analyze in detail some aspects of the impact of public policies on equality as discussed in the ECLAC document “Time for equality: closing gaps, opening trails”, the Economic Development Division together with GIZ organized a seminar in which the main findings of the thematic chapter of the Economic Survey 2010 were discussed. The purpose of this activity and this publication is to contribute to the discussion on the impact that public policy can have in strengthening the link between economic growth and distributive equality, a link which has been quite elusive in the region’s economic history. The document address important issues as the consequences for income distribution of macroeconomic volatility; the way in which the latter affects the labour market, and the policy options dealing with it; the analysis of the <b>distributive</b> impacts of <b>tax</b> policy and the characteristics and possible impacts of social spending. The conclusion states that public policies must secure the financing needed to improve citizen access to social provisions in a way that combines efficiency with solidarity, relevance and universality, all at the most appropriate level of government. Inequality remains one of the biggest economic and social challenges in the region and public policy reforms needed to close the social gap require a constant effort to learn and rethink the kinds of intervention needed to overcome poverty and inequality and to increase people’s sense of belonging to a growing economy...|$|R
