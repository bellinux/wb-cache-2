25|$|An {{autopilot}} is a mechanical, electrical, or {{hydraulic system}} used to guide a vehicle without assistance {{from a human}} being. Most people understand an autopilot to refer specifically to aircraft, but self-steering gear for ships, boats, space craft, and missiles is sometimes also called autopilot. The first aircraft autopilot was invented by Lawrence Sperry in 1912. Sperry demonstrated it in 1914, and proved {{the credibility of the}} invention by flying the aircraft with his <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from the controls and visible to onlookers.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{nears the}} end with [...] "Where Do We Go from Here?", as the Scoobies stand dazed and disoriented, facing {{different}} directions. As they sing [...] "Understand we'll {{go hand in}} hand / But we'll walk alone in fear", they line up, hold hands, then fling each other's <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> in a piece of what Whedon calls [...] "literal choreography". Each of the eight characters in this line wears a color in the visible spectrum, a conscious decision by the costume designer. The couples in the group wear opposite colors (Giles in green and Buffy in red, Anya in blue and Xander in orange, Tara in yellow and Willow in purple), and Rhonda Wilcox interprets the color-coding and choreography to represent the [...] "tension between the individual and the group". The characters as a chorus sing [...] "The curtains close on a kiss, God knows / We can tell the end is near", moments before Buffy runs out to kiss Spike and the show closes with actual curtains. As Spike and Buffy kiss, a swell of music accompanies them, similar to the ending of Gone with the Wind. Lyrics sung moments before, however, forecast the uncertainty of the relationship between Spike and Buffy, as well as their contrasting reasons for initiating any romance; Spike wants to feel love from Buffy, while she simply wants to feel.|$|E
2500|$|The WC, {{with many}} good {{features}} and various first-to-market attributes, {{had at least}} a few drawbacks. Its clutch was not particularly well designed, and, like other tractors of the 1920s through mid-1930s, it lacked usability in the design of its brake controls, with a hand lever {{on each side of the}} tractor, which meant that applying the brakes took the operator's <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from other controls. Other tractors had foot pedals on both sides, but that meant that the clutch and left brake could not be operated simultaneously. The solution came in the late 30s, when [...] various brands moved both brake pedals to the right foot.|$|E

2500|$|Chief American Horse was {{examined}} by the two surgeons. One of them pulled the chief’s <b>hands</b> <b>away,</b> and the intestines dropped out. [...] "Tell him he will die before next morning," [...] said the surgeon. The surgeons worked futilely to close his stomach wound, and Chief American Horse refused morphine preferring to clench a stick between his teeth to hide any sign of pain or emotions and thus he bravely and stolidly died. Chief American Horse lingered until 6:00a.m. and confirmed that the tribes were scattering and were becoming discouraged by war. [...] "He appeared satisfied that {{the lives of his}} squaws and children were spared." [...] Dr. McGillicuddy, who attended the dying chief, said that he was cheerful to the last and manifested the utmost affection for his wives and children. [...] American Horse’s squaws and children were allowed to remain on the battleground after the dusky hero’s death, and subsequently fell into the hands of their own people. [...] Even [...] "Ute John" [...] respected the cold clay of the brave Sioux leader, and his corpse was not subjected to the scalping process." [...] Crook was most gentle in his assurances to all of them that no further harm should come if they went along peacefully, and it only required a day or two of kind treatment to make them feel very much at home.|$|E

60|$|She {{wrenched}} her <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from his. There was a bright, {{red spot}} of colour flaring on her cheeks. Her {{eyes were on}} fire.|$|E

60|$|The {{intruder}} {{moved his}} <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from his eyes. His expression {{was full of}} wonder.|$|R
60|$|The Bishop, startled, {{takes his}} <b>hand</b> <b>away.</b> Mrs George's eyes open vividly as she {{interrupts}} Soames.|$|R
60|$|He hid {{his brow}} {{in his arms}} and groaned aloud. Softly Swanhild crept up to him--softly she drew his <b>hands</b> <b>away,</b> holding them between her own.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no! I {{want to do}} {{them all}} myself," [...] she said, gesturing his offered <b>hands</b> <b>away,</b> with a little nether appeal in her {{laughing}} refusal.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, John," [...] she said, {{stretching}} her <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> {{over the}} fair plain of the Guadalquivir, {{as soon as}} we stood against the parapet; [...] "is not that lovely?" ...|$|E
60|$|I drew my <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> {{somewhat}} coldly; a born diplomatist {{could not}} have managed the thing better.|$|R
60|$|She {{attempted}} {{to take her}} <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> but he closed on it with a protecting, fatherly clasp.|$|R
60|$|She {{shook her}} head violently, and with a sudden effort thrust his <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from her mouth.|$|R

60|$|She {{pulled her}} <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> and flung {{them up to}} her face, her form shaken by stormy sobs. In {{distress}} {{he put his arm}} about her and drew her closer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep your <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> altogether," [...] said Zeppa; [...] "you only delay me. There now, they're {{as tight}} as two masts. Hold on to me while I raise you up." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Castro {{positively}} blushed as {{she drew}} her <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> but her laughter indicated a mingling of pride with scorn.|$|R
60|$|But he put her <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> {{and turning}} his face, stared {{out of the}} window. And so they reached their home.|$|R
60|$|He gently {{drew his}} <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from me, and sighed {{as he did}} it. Perhaps she had {{sometimes}} kissed his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't know me, papa," [...] said Flora, {{drawing her}} <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from him, and tightly {{clenching}} {{them in one}} another, as thoughts far too terrible for words swept over her.|$|E
60|$|He disregarded her bidding to {{the extent}} of placing his arm around her waist. He made no attempt, however, to draw her <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from her face, or stop her tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oho, you're at it again! Take your <b>hands</b> <b>away,</b> {{and let me}} {{see your}} eyes. You always do that when I read a letter from her. I will write and tell her." ...|$|E
60|$|Slipping her <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> {{she went}} back to the window. Harz stood, looking after her; then, taking up his palette, again began painting.|$|R
