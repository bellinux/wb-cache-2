25|$|A {{photograph}} was taken of Richmond captain-coach Dyer, aged 30 and playing his {{two hundred and}} twenty second game, wearing white strapping on his left thumb, and a dirty knee bandage on his left knee, breaking away from the pack, with his <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Lake end goals (Dyer went on to kick a goal), {{in the last quarter}} of the 1944 Preliminary Final, held at the Junction Oval, on Saturday 23 September 1944, in which Richmond defeated Essendon, primarily due to Dyer's nine goals.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{is divided into}} three principal spaces. Musicians occupy the lower left section, one of whom is centrally located, his back turned toward the viewer, with his double-bass erected to the left. A row of dancers, two women and two men with their legs raised, occupy the upper right. They are characterized by curves and rhythmic repetition, creating a synthetic sense of dynamical movement. The background consists of ornate cabaret-style lighting fixtures, and a few members of the audience sitting in the front row, their <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> performance. On the lower right another client is staring with a sidelong glance, indicative of sexual desire or sly and malicious intent; the archetype of a male voyeur, often portrayed in mid-century journalistic illustrations of the can-can.|$|E
60|$|The {{moment the}} {{landlord}} {{came out and}} saw who it was, his <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cocked hat, and he turned as pale as ashes.|$|R
60|$|Richard {{kept his}} <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Scot's face, beheld and beholding, smiling {{inwardly}} at the relief {{produced by the}} turn he had given to his general accusation.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile {{the man who}} {{had entered}} the shop in company with the goldsmith--a tall figure, about fifty, with a short trimmed beard, wearing an old felt hat and a threadbare mantle--had kept his <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Greek, and now said abruptly-- ...|$|R
2500|$|The Nāsāgre dṛṣṭi ( [...] ; meaning [...] "to {{the tip of}} the nose") has the <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tip of the nose. Purportedly {{strengthens}} the eye muscles.|$|E
2500|$|Recitative and prologue. Hamlet asks Ophélie if he may sit at {{her feet}} (Hamlet: Belle, permettez-nous [...] "Lady, permit me"). She {{responds}} that his expression frightens and chills her. Hamlet sits, his <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> King and Queen. Everyone takes their places, and the curtains of the small theatre are opened. The play is introduced with a short orchestral passage featuring a saxophone solo. (According to Annegret Fauser {{this is the first}} instance of the use of a saxophone in an opera.) In an aside Hamlet asks Marcellus to watch the King (Hamlet: Voici l'instant! fixez vos regards sur le Roi, et, si vous le voyez pâlir, dites-le moi! [...] "Now! Fix your gaze on upon the King, and, if he should turn pale, tell me!").|$|E
2500|$|That {{suspension}} {{is created}} [...] "simply, by denying the listener any I chords," [...] Pallett explains. After {{the first few}} lines, the B tonic chord that repeats throughout the song is offset by bass notes that give it a more dominant 7th feel. [...] "The I chord will never appear again," [...] he observes. At the same time, however, Perry begins singing the melody on that note, and returns to it frequently, even when it clashes with the dominant V chord as she sings [...] "feel like I'm living a". [...] "he vocal melody establishes the key so clearly {{that there is no}} doubt ... Her voice is the sun and the song is in orbit around it," [...] he concludes. [...] "The insistence of the tonic in the melody keeps your ears’ <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> destination, but the song never arrives there. Weightlessness is achieved. Great work, songwriters!" [...] Pallett notes other classic pop songs, such as Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Dreams" [...] and Coldplay's [...] "Viva La Vida", that employ the same device.|$|E
60|$|The {{mountains}} by moonlight. ALHADRA {{alone in}} a Moorish dress; her <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> earth. Then drop in one after another, {{from different parts of}} the stage, a considerable number of Morescoes, all in Moorish garments. They form a circle at a distance round ALHADRA.|$|R

60|$|This was too horrid; Father John got up {{and held}} his hand before the father's face, as if to forbid him to finish the curse which {{he was about to}} utter; and the old man trembled like a frightened child upon his seat, and sat silent with his <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> priest.|$|R
2500|$|Notorious for {{his defense}} against the pirates, Mangkaw was a known net-fisherman. Already a fishing ground that it is today, Sogod then had houses {{clustered}} close to shore around the watchtower. Being {{an expert in the}} art of casting the net, Laya, he could send out the casting net in a perfect circle in the sea. As the community grew bigger, the residents agitated for a name for their place. Meetings after meetings were held presided by Mangkaw. But every time a meeting is ongoing, a shoal of fish would be seen by the subtle wave of the surface or quick shifting shadow beneath the surface. The eyes of the pondering datu kept stalking it, interfering with the meeting. Satisfying his unequalled fisherman's instinct, he would leave the meeting unattended and his body language was being watched by the attendees, feasting their eyes on the artful slide of the feet of the datu so as not to disturb the surface, his <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> school. Then, he shared his catch with the people for the asking, even by strangers. After which, shouts of [...] "Sogod, sogod!" [...] (vernacular for [...] "to begin") would reconvene the meeting. Thus the word [...] "Sogod" [...] became the name of the village then and the town as it is today.|$|E

60|$|He spoke very simply, as if {{he could}} not help it, with his <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clear eastern sky, and with a tone of grave awe and thankfulness which greatly struck Mr. Ashford, from the {{complete}} absence of self-consciousness, or from any attempt either to magnify or depreciate his sense of the danger.|$|R
60|$|He made no reply. His <b>eyes,</b> <b>fixed</b> intently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea astern, {{suddenly}} flashed.|$|R

60|$|Here the {{chairman}} {{glanced at his}} wife, but she was absorbed in watching Mrs. Duncombe's restless hands; and the look was intercepted by Lady Tyrrell's eyes, which flashed back sympathetic amusement, with just such a glance as used to pass between them in old times; but the effect {{was to make the}} Member's face grave and impassive, and his <b>eyes</b> <b>fix</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> papers before him.|$|R
60|$|I noticed, as {{the song}} progressed, that a good many other people seemed to have their <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two young men, as well as myself. These other people also tittered when the young men tittered, and roared when the young men roared; and, as {{the two young men}} tittered and roared and {{exploded}} with laughter pretty continuously all through the song, it went exceedingly well.|$|R
