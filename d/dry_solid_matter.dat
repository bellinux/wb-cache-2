40|$|BACKGROUND : The {{acceptability}} of frozen green peas {{depends on their}} sensory quality. There {{is a need to}} relate physico-chemical parameters to sensory quality. In this research, six brands of frozen green peas representing product sold for retail and caterer’s markets were purchased and subjected to descriptive sensory evaluation and physico-chemical analyses (including dry matter content, alcohol insoluble solids content, starch content, °Brix, residual peroxidase activity, size sorting, hardness using texture analysis and colour measurements) to assess and explain product quality. RESULTS : The sensory quality of frozen green peas, particularly texture properties, were well explained using physico-chemical methods of analysis notably alcohol insoluble solids, starch content, hardness and °Brix. Generally, retail class peas were of superior sensory quality to caterer’s class peas although one caterer’s brand was comparable to the retail brands. Retail class peas were sweeter, smaller, greener, more moist and more tender than the caterer’s peas. Retail class peas also had higher °Brix, a*, hue and chroma values; lower starch, alcohol insoluble <b>solids,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> content and hardness measured. CONCLUSIONS : The sensory quality of frozen green peas can be partially predicted by measuring physico-chemical parameters particularly °Brix {{and to a lesser extent}} hardness by texture analyser, alcohol insoluble <b>solids,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and starch content.

The two conditions studied showed similar yields (0. 40 m 3 /kgCOD fed) but different biological process stability: in fact the mesophilic process was clearly more stable than the thermophilic one in terms of bioprocess parameters. The resulting digestates showed good characteristics for both the tested conditions: heavy metals, dioxins (PCDD/F), and dioxin like bi-phenyls (PCBs) were concentred in the efﬂuent if compared with the inﬂuent because of the important reduction of the <b>solid</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> but remained at levels acceptable for agricultural reuse.

This insoluble organic matter (IOM) consists of both humic and non-humic components. This organic matter is believed to be partly responsible for the intractability of the sludge. In our previous work we have successfully isolated non-extractable residual organic matter from oil sand tailings using oil phase aggromeration and acid dissolution techniques. In this investigation we have isolated humic acids from a number of samples of mineral solids obtained from Syncrude sludge pond tailings. These solids were obtained from sludge using different experimental conditions such as soxhlet extraction followed by air <b>drying</b> of <b>solids</b> and centrifugation followed by air drying or vacuum <b>drying</b> of <b>solids.</b> Humic <b>matter</b> was extracted from these solids using a mixture of Na 2 ̆ 084 P 2 ̆ 082 O 2 ̆ 087 and NaOH which extracts both humic acids as well as organometallic compounds.

40|$|Aim: To assess {{physicochemical}} characters {{related to}} the glucide contents of the sap provided by four coconut cultivars. Study Design: Thirty-six coconut saps from thirty-six healthy coconut trees inflorescences, replicated two times. Trees were randomly selected; cultivars were the most widespread coconut types in Côte d'Ivoire. The whole coconut saps consists of three batches of three samples per cultivar. Place and Duration of the Study: Station Marc Delorme for the coconut Research at Port Bouet, National Centre of Agronomic Research (CNRA) of Côte d'Ivoire during 2012 and 2013. Methodology: Inflorescences saps from four coconut cultivars namely Malayan Yellow Dwarf, West African Tall, and PB 121 + and PB 113 + hybrids were investigated according to their carbohydrate content. Nine coconut trees were randomly selected per cultivar on experimental fields and their unopened inflorescences (spathes) of rank 8 have undergone the production of sap. The sap was harvested twice a day and samples from both harvestings were stored at - 20 ºC. Even quantities of the daily samples were mixed and a slight volume was taken from this mixture for analysis. Five traits (pH, contents of total soluble <b>solids,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> total soluble sugars and reducing sugars) related to glucidic richness of the coconut sap were assessed. Then the main carbohydrates components (sucrose, glucose, fructose, mannose and glycerol) were elucidated using a high performance ionic chromatography {{and led to the}} evaluation of the sweet index. Results: The effect of coconut cultivars on the pH and contents of total soluble <b>solids,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter,</b> total soluble sugars, sucrose, mannose, glycerol and sweet index was significant at P =. 05. The sap of MYD recorded highest means of pH (7. 32). This type of sap contained also highest contents of total soluble solids (16. 31 %), dry matter (16. 47 g/ 100 ml), total soluble sugars (16. 08 g/ 100 ml), mannose (0. 019 g/ 100 ml) and glycerol (0. 094 g/ 100) contents and provided the greatest sweet index (16. 00). Sucrose was the main carbohydrate of coconut sap. The MYD obtained higher sucrose content (12. 24 g/ 100 ml) than the WAT (9. 40 g/ 100 ml). Hundred (100 ml) of saps from PB 121 + and PB 113 + provided respectively 10. 31 g and 10. 38 g of sucrose, which intermediate both means above. The contents of reducing sugars, glucose and fructose were respectively between 2. 41 and 3. 73 g/ 100 ml; 1. 63 and 1. 84 g/ 100 ml and from 1. 24 to 1. 52 g/ 100 ml, but didn't differentiate saps originating with MYD, WAT, PB 121 + and PB 113 + cultivars. Reducing sugars were significantly composed of glucose (r = 0. 83) and fructose (r = 0. 91). Conclusion: The richness in glucides of coconut inflorescence sap is {{related to the}} contents of total soluble <b>solids,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and the whole carbohydrates. Thanks to their higher sucrose, glucose and fructose contents, the saps of the MYD, PB 121 + and PB 113 + cultivars could be suitable for the production of syrup, sugar and alcohol in order to improve benefits derived from the coconut. - See more at: [URL] (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

For the evaluation of this experiment there was based a plot on the piece of land of South Bohemia University in České Budějovice. The samples were picked up before harvest to compare the evaluated high - yielding indicators. The number of samples depended on the desired dry matter content in biomass. During corn harvest the yield of biomass was determined, and yield and share of corncobs, dry matter content of biomass and corncobs, and yield of dry biomass. At the harvest of sorghum the yield of biomass was determined, the content of dry matter and yield of dry matter in biomass.

40|$|AbstractIrrigation is {{a crucial}} {{practice}} that operators often perform empirically, relying on their own experience, especially in productive areas characterized by low technology agriculture (i. e. several parts of Mediterranean countries). One of the possible approach for proper irrigation scheduling is measuring the soil water potential, simple and easy to manage. The purpose {{of this research was}} {{to examine the effects of}} two different irrigation regimes (obtained by the use of tensiometers connected to a relay controller) on yield, fruit quality and water consumption of greenhouse tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Naxos) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus L., cv Sarig, in the first cropping cycle, and the local landrace ‘Mezzo lungo di Polignano’, in the second one) grown on a silty-clay soil in Mediterranean conditions. For each species, two tests (August-February and February-July cycle) were carried out in a plastic greenhouse-tunnel. Drip irrigation was adopted, with automated schedule based on tensiometer readings. Two water potential irrigation set-points were compared: - 100 and - 400 hPa for tomato and - 100 and - 300 hPa for cucumber, in both cycles. Yield (marketable and unmarketable) and quality traits of fruits (soluble <b>solids,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and titratable acidity) were determined. Water consumption was calculated at the end of each crop cycle. In the first cycle, the two water regimes did not affect the yield of tomato and cucumber. The cucumber irrigated at the lowest soil water potential set-point produced fruits with 8 % higher dry matter. In the second cycle, the tomato irrigated at the potential of - 400 hPa showed a 40 % lower yield (mainly due to the lower fruit size) compared to that of plants irrigated at - 100 hPa. However, the fruits of tomato plants irrigated at - 400 hPa showed total soluble <b>solids,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>matter</b> and titratable acidity, respectively 41, 45 and 59 % higher than plants irrigated at - 100 hPa. In both crop cycles, a water saving of 35 % and 46 %, on average, for tomato and cucumber, respectively, was obtained using the lowest potential as irrigation set-point. Proper use of tensiometer could allow a better use of water resource. Selection of proper water potential set-points according to the cultivation season is crucial for satisfactory results. The positive effects of a controlled and moderate water stress on fruit quality should be taken into account...|$|R

Garmerwolde sludge had a darker colour than Heerenveen sludge. It was also seen that Heerenveen sludge contained much more pollutions such as twigs and hairs. The odour of Heerenveen sludge was also much stronger. These differences {{can be explained by}} the fact that Garmerwolde sludge is digested and the organic material is therefore lower. An optimum <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> content for Garmerwolde was not reached yet but with a dosage of 167. 5 g/kg sludge DSC, a <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> content of 30 % could be reached. However this dosage is too high to use it in practice. In the case of Heerenveen there was an optimum <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> content with a dosage of 88. 5 g/kg sludge DSC. With this dosage a <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> content of 27 % is obtained. An improvement of the <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> content is not acquired with the use of magnesium salts as coagulant. With both sludges it was seen that manually dewatering using a filter, was difficult. There were more flocs formed with MgCl 2 but still the water was more unclear than using FeCl 3. Probably the settle time needs to be increased if higher <b>dry</b> <b>solid</b> contents should be reached. Both sludges require a suitable dosage of coagulant and flocculant. Wrong amounts of coagulant and flocculant cause too large flocs. When the flocs are too thick, the sludge cake will be thicker as well because dewatering is difficult and the filtration resistance will increase. When the dosage of coagulant and flocculant is too low, it is not possible to obtain a sludge cake at all because of the absence of flocs. ...|$|R
