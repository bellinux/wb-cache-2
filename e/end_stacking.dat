40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach for}} anticancer strategies is the stabilization of telomeric DNA into a G-quadruplex structure. To explore the intrinsic stabilization of folded G-quadruplexes, we combined electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, ion mobility spectrometry, and molecular modeling studies to study different DNA sequences known to form quadruplexes. Two telomeric DNA sequences of different lengths and two DNA sequences {{derived from the}} NHE III 1 region of the c-myc oncogene (Pu 22 and Pu 27) were studied. NH 4 + and the ligands PIPER, TMPyP 4, and the three quinacridines MMQ 1, MMQ 3, and BOQ 1 were complexed with the DNA sequences to determine their effect on {{the stability of the}} G-quadruplexes. Our results demonstrate that G-quadruplex intramolecular folds are stabilized by NH 4 + cations and the ligands listed. Furthermore, the ligands can be classified according to their ability to stabilize the quadruplexes and <b>end</b> <b>stacking</b> is shown to be the dominant mode for ligand attachment. In all cases our solvent-free experimental observations and theoretical modeling reveal structures that are highly relevant to the solution-phase structures. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{synthesis}} of {{a new class of}} G-quadruplex DNA recognition agents are discussed in this thesis along with their binding abilities to both duplex and G-quadruplex forming DNA. A selection of G-quadruplex binders reported in the literature to date have been reviewed and their interactions with the quadruplex DNA structure analysed. The biisoquinoline ligand used to incorporate into the metal complexes synthesised in this thesis was chosen because of its large aromatic surface area which is ideal for <b>end</b> <b>stacking</b> onto G-quartets. Both the palladium and platinum biisoquinoline complexes bind to quadruplex forming DNA, monitored by UV-vis and circular dichroism. The platinum complex has the most promising DNA binding results showing a selectivity for quadruplex DNA over duplex DNA when examined by gel electrophoresis. Biisoquinoline complex interactions with RNA G-quadruplexes have been investigated to make comparisons of that with DNA. The palladium complex binds less well to parallel quadruplex conformers suggesting its mode of interaction differs from that of the platinum complex. A toxicity assay against two cancer cell lines showed the platinum and palladium complexes to have IC_ 50 values in the nM range. Modifications to the biisoquinoline structure were also attempted in order increase the specificity of the complex to G-quadruplexes by incorporating components that could interact with the quadruplex loops...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStabilization of G­quadruplex DNA {{structures}} {{by small}} molecules {{has emerged as}} a promising strategy for the development of anticancer drugs. Since G-quadruplex structures can adopt various topologies, attaining specific stabilization of a G­quadruplex topology to halt a particular biological process is daunting. To achieve this, we have designed and synthesized simple structural scaffolds based on indolylmethyleneindanone pharmacophore, which can specifically stabilize the parallel topology of promoter quadruplex DNAs (c­MYC, c­KIT 1 and c­KIT 2), when compared to various topologies of telomeric DNA and duplex DNAs. The lead ligands (InEt 2 and InPr 2) are water soluble and meet a number of desirable criteria for a small molecule drug. Highly specific induction and stabilization of the c-MYC and c-KITquadruplex DNAs (ΔT 1 / 2 up to 24 °C) over telomeric and duplex DNAs (ΔT 1 / 2 ~ 3. 2 °C) by these ligands were further validated by ITC and ESI-MS experiments (Ka ~ 105 ­ 106 M− 1). Low IC 50 (~ 2 µM) values were emerged for these ligands from Taq DNA polymerase stop assay with the c-MYC quadruplex forming template, whereas the telomeric DNA template showed IC 50 values > 120 µM. Molecular modeling and dynamics studies demonstrated the 5 '- and 3 '- <b>end</b> <b>stacking</b> modes for these ligands. Overall, these results demonstrate that among the > 1000 quadruplex stabilizing ligands reported so far, the indolylmethyleneindanone scaffolds stands out in terms of target specificity and structural simplicity, and therefore offers a new paradigm in topology specific G-quadruplex targeting for potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{affinity}} {{of three}} square-planar nickel(II) (1), copper(II) (2) and zinc(II) (3) Schiff-base complexes for wildtype human telomeric (h-Telo) and protooncogene c-myc G-quadruplex (G 4) DNA was investigated by UVvisible absorption spectroscopy and circular dichroism. DNA-binding constants (Kb) {{were determined by}} spectrophotometric titrations for both G 4 -DNA and B-DNA. The results obtained {{point out that the}} three metal complexes selectively bind G 4 -DNA with higher affinity, up to two orders of magnitude, with respect to B-DNA. The nickel(II) complex 1 was found to be the most effective G 4 -DNA stabilizer and the Kb values decrease in the order 1 > 2 z 3. Innovative computational investigations, consisting of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by density functional theory/molecular mechanics (DFT/MM) calculations, provide atomistic support for the interpretation of the binding mechanism to G 4 -DNA by <b>end</b> <b>stacking</b> and also of the experimental affinity order. Interestingly, 1 is able to induce G 4 -DNA formation of h-Telo sequences, also in the absence of K+ cations. This last result is nicely confirmed and highlighted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) stop assays, which show the ability of the title compounds to induce and stabilize G 4 structures inhibiting the amplification of PCR products. Finally, compounds 1 – 3 showed concentration and time-dependent cytotoxicity towards HeLa and MCF- 7 human cancer cell lines, inducing significant effects on cell cycle distribution with G 2 /M arrest in HeLa cells and G 0 /G 1 arrest in MCF- 7 cells. Overall, the PCR inhibition and anticancer activity of the three compounds decreases in the same order 1 > 2 z 3, in excellent correlation with the G 4 -DNAbinding affinity, implying that G 4 -DNA is the biotarget for their biological activity...|$|E

This answers the open question given by S. Ginsburg and G. F. Rose (J. Comput. System Sci. 8 (1974), 243 – 269). We also show that nondeterministic weak-stack-counter automata that accept by simultaneous terminal (final) state and empty stack are more powerful than those that accept by terminal state alone. This contrasts with the case of stack-counter automata, for which both methods are equally powerful...|$|R
