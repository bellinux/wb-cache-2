40|$|This paper, {{based largely}} on data from the Italian social {{security}} (INPS) records, shows that recent employment trends in Italy have been marked by large job and worker turnover and a new and strong process of renewal and substitution of labour in industry. Entries of young workers have shown a remarkable increase, mainly {{through the application of}} work and training contracts ('contratti di formazione e lavoro') that provide firms with a means to cut labour costs. Meanwhile many workers in their 40 s with considerable seniority, but still perfectly fit to go on working, found themselves squeezed out. The exit of this generation of mature workers was eased through subsidised early retirement, <b>golden</b> <b>handshakes</b> and a wide application of the 'cassa integrazione guadagni' (wage supplementation fund). This pattern of labour force replacement in industrial production, described as 'young in, old out', is at odds with the frequent ranking of Italy among the industrial countries hampered by rigid labour markets and questions theories of unemployment based on 'insider-outsider' hypotheses. ...|$|R

40|$|Vuonna 1995 tiedotettiin Kop:n ja Syp:n yhdistymisestä Merita Pankiksi. Tutkimus selvittää fuusion johdosta Merita Pankista poistuneiden henkilöiden uudelleensijoittumista ja sopeutumista uuteen elämäntilanteeseen yksilötasolla. Tutkimuksen kohteena on työnsä menettäneet sekä organisaatiosta vapaaehtoisesti poistuneet henkilöt. Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan henkilöiden vaiheittaista poistumista organisaatiosta (vuosina 1995 - 1997) ja vaiheittaisen poistumisen merkitystä sopeutumisprosessille. Tutkimusta henkilöstön vaiheittaisesta poistumisesta organisaatiosta yrityssaneerausten johdosta ei ole aikaisemmin Suomessa tehty. Vaiheittaisuuden huomioon ottaminen tutkimuksessa antaa uutta tietoa ajallisesti pitkittyneen epätietoisuuden vaikutuksista henkilön työn menetyksestä aiheutuvaan sopeutumisprosessiin ja uudelleensijoittumiseen sekä viitteitä työyhteisön ilmapiiristä. Tutkimus tuo myös näkökulman muuttuvan ja kriisiytyvän organisaation selviytymiseen ja hallintatapoja käsittelevään tutkimukseen. Tutkimusaineisto muodostuu postikyselystä, haastatteluista ja Tilastokeskuksen henkilörekisteriajoihin perustuvasta muistiosta. Tutkimusmetodi on pääosin kvantitatiivinen. Haastatteluja on käytetty tutkimustulosten kuvailemisessa. Tutkimuksessa havaittiin sukupuolella, iällä, koulutuksella, ammattiasemalla, asuinpaikalla ja vaiheittaisella poistumisella organisaatiosta olevan vaikutuksia henkilöiden uudelleensijoittumiseen, turvattomuuden kokemiseen ja työn menetyksen hyväksymiseen. Samoin johtamistavalla ja esimiehen toiminnalla havaittiin yhteys henkilöiden sijoittumisessa työelämään ja uuteen elämäntilanteeseen. Vastaavasti organisaation järjestämillä tukitoimilla ei havaittu merkittävää suoraa vaikutusta henkilöiden uudelleentyöllistymiseen. Ensimmäisessä vaiheessa vapaaehtoisesti organisaatiosta poislähteneet uudelleen työllistyivät ja sopeutuivat uuteen elämäntilanteeseen myöhemmin poislähteneitä paremmin. Työyhteisön ilmapiirissä oli myös nähtävissä muutoksia henkilövalintojen pitkittyessä. Entiset pankkilaiset olivat voimakkaasti sitoutuneet organisaatioon. Tutkimuksessa tuli esiin, että pankkiorganisaatio oli muodostunut useille vastaajille ns. "kultaiseksi häkiksi", jolloin henkilöt eivät osanneet edes nähdä muita vaihtoehtoja elämässään, saati toimia aktiivisesti niiden saavuttamiseksi. Tutkimuksessa käytetyt aineiston keruumenetelmät tarjoavat mahdollisuuden jatkaa tutkimusta. Aineistossa korostui tutkimushetkellä tyytyväisyys työn menetyksen suomaan vapauteen. Tämän johdosta kiinnostavaksi jatkotutkimuksen kohteeksi nousee, onko organisaation tarjoamilla tukijärjestelyillä jopa hidastava vaikutus henkilöiden uudelleensijoittumiseen ja sopeutumiseen tarkasteltaessa pitkällä aikavälillä. Toiseksi mielenkiintoiseksi jatkokysymykseksi nousee, muuttuuko työorganisaation kriisien luonne, niiden kokeminen ja selviytymiskeinot. Ottamalla voimakkaampi identiteetin näkökulma yksilöiden elämäntilanteiden tulkitsemiseen mahdollistaisi jatkossa myös kiinnostavan tutkimusasetelman. Tutkimus antaa käytännön ohjeita henkilösupistusten toteuttamiseen yksilön näkökulmasta tarkasteltuna. Usually, {{when two}} {{companies}} merge, {{it means that}} the new organisation must cut its costs by laying off personnel. In this case, when The Union Bank of Finland Ltd (SYP) and Kansallispankki (KOP) decided to merge in February 1995 it meant that 7463 employees left their jobs during a period of two years. The new Merita Bank reduced the number of employees by offering them a short-time employment, by giving <b>golden</b> <b>handshakes</b> for those who lost their jobs or made a decision to resign themselves. The department of HRM established a support program for those who lost their jobs. The program included financial benefits; a salary of six to twelve months and prolonged personnel loan benefits. Also outplacement services were provided. The purpose of this thesis was to study the employees who lost their jobs and accepted the colden handshakes offered by the bank. The thesis concentrates on how they were re-employed, how they adjusted to their new situation and on how they coped. Also the outcome of the support program was studied from the individuals viewpoint. Most of the employees studied had a strong commitment to their job and to the bank as an organisation. This study aims at explaining how the employees felt about their situation concerning work, identity and life in general one year after they lost their jobs. In this study, the data was collected by both quantitative and qualitative methods, mainly quantitative, though. Qualitative data was used only to support the quantitative method. The data collection, including a questionnaire, interviews and archive documents, was carried out in 1997 - 1998. The main consequenses of losing a job were freedom, satisfaction, economical insecurity and willingness to keep other things in life constant and permanent. The <b>golden</b> <b>handshakes</b> helped in the beginning. If an employee s financial situation was good, it was possible to have an extra holiday. However, if the situation was hard already, the extra benefits did not help. Only a new job with a stabile income or the benefits people got from their local trade union helped them economically and reduced their in security. The employees did not dream about big changes in the future. Quite the opposite, they were satisfied if the circumstances stayed stable. Their main coping strategy was to adapt to their new situation and to try and seek social support from their partners, friends and relatives. The outplacement programs in Merita consisted of career counselling services and job search training. Also psychological coaching, information lectures, a job finding scheme, retraining programs and career planning services were provided. In addition, an employment agency and occupational health services were at he employees disposal. The outcome and the effects of the HRM actions clearly depended on the individuals and their situation. In this case it seemed that the personnel assistance programs did not have {{a significant role in the}} employees re-employment or in the way they coped with their new situation. Furthermore, I have noticed that most employees did not want or need the support provided by Merita Bank. Those who left the organisation first and independently sought jobs on the labour market. They re-employed best and had alternatives to choose from. The ones who found a new job described their leaving Merita Bank as a start of a new period in their lives. They made the deal and accepted for example the personnel loan benefits which meant an extra advantage for them. Those who left the organisation last had bad experiences of the leadership and the working climate at the bank. These experiences had had an impact on these situation and continuing their lives. Those who were left unemployed tired to compensate their lack of work for example with hobbies but obviously it did not work that well. Those who were not very active and waited to see how their own situation would turn out to be were not so likely to get a new job. They were usually the ones highly committed to their work and the organisation. For those left unemployed it meant a disappointment at an individual level, unfair treatment, insecurity, financial stress, family problems and lack of social contacts. They participated more in the support programs organised by the bank than the winners. Unfortunately, their problems could not be solved by the HRM actions. According to the findings, the influence of demograpfic factors was remarkable. Age, the level of education, profession, gender, the length of employment with the bank, as well as the place where the employee lived all affected the final outcome. Those who were re-employed best were young, under 40, well educated, lived near Helsinki, the capital, and had a short commitment with the bank. Furthermore, men re-employed better than woman. Half of the respondents described the behavior and actions of their managers as being quite unsatisfactory. They would have wanted to get support, empathy and real discussions. It seems that a part of managers actions was dictated by their egoism and their eagerness to protect their own jobs. As a leadership problem the managers mentioned the lack of information and directions. Previous studies have verified that the behaviour of the managers in fusion is often weak. This study has confirmed this assumption...|$|R
40|$|It 2 ̆ 7 s {{time for}} Governments to stop playing musical chairs with the {{benefits}} system writes Cassandra Goldie from ACOSS. Well-crafted employment participation policies are a win for everyone – they lift {{some of the}} poorest people out of poverty, bolster the paid workforce, {{and in the long}} run they save the Government money. With unemployment falling, {{this is a very good}} time to invest in policies to boost the job prospects of people on social security payments who have been sidelined in the jobs market up until now, such as long term unemployed people, Indigenous people, people with disabilities, sole parents, and people of mature age. We put this to the Government late last year and were very pleased that the Prime Minister made employment participation a priority for the Budget in her CEDA speech in February. ACOSS was looking for three things in the Budget: investment in the job capacity and skills of people excluded from the labour market, improved employment incentives, and to lift the incomes of those living in the deepest poverty. The vast majority of people of working age on income support today are out of paid work because they have a disability, are caring for a young child or person with a disability, or are unemployed long-term. Around half of unemployed people have less than Year 12 qualifications. That’s why a strong up-front investment in skills training, employment services, and child care and respite care is essential to support people ‘over the line’ into a secure job. Encouragement and support for employers to take on people they haven’t considered in the past – for example through wage subsidies - is also vital. Past policies, which have been strong on activity requirements but weak on capacity building, have failed for want of this kind of investment. We welcome the Budget announcements of wage subsidies for people unemployed long term, the training places for sole parents, and the local experiments that bring together Centrelink, employment services and health and community services to assist people with multiple hurdles to employment. The mentoring services for early school leavers to help them complete their education also begin to address a serious gap in the Government’s ‘earn or learn’ policy. But these intensive programs will reach only a small minority of those who need them. Most will still rely on ‘mainstream’ programs like Job Services Australia (JSA) whose funding has not been indexed for six years of inflation. The only substantial increase in JSA funding is 1, 000 for providers to pay for 11 months of compulsory training and work preparation for their ‘very long term unemployed’ clients. At 100 a month, that looks to us like more of the ‘activity for activity’s sake’ that characterised employment assistance services in the past. The Budget eases the Newstart Allowance income test for sole parents and the Youth Allowance income test for unemployed young people. The easing of income test for sole parents was recommended by the Henry Tax Review. It will go a long way towards ensuring that part time employment is financially worthwhile. It is therefore regrettable that it is being paid for by cuts to income support payments. Starting in 2013, around 25, 000 sole parents who received the Parenting Payment when the previous Government introduced its Welfare to Work policy in 2006 will start to lose that payment and drop down to the lower Newstart Allowance when their youngest child reaches 12 years (instead of the 16 years that now applies). This is not about encouraging employment. These parents are already required to seek part time jobs and many already have such jobs. It is a straight 56 a week cut in payments for families already in poverty, to 257 a week plus Family Tax Benefit. Similarly, young unemployed people aged 21 years will no longer be eligible for Newstart Allowance. They have to live on the 195 a week Youth Allowance, a payment cut of 42. It’s time for Governments to stop playing musical chairs with the benefits system and commit to structural reform of the system based on a single base rate of payment, as Governments in the UK and New Zealand are now doing. That would also completely remove the biggest disincentive for Disability Support Pensioners to engage in employment – the fear of dropping down to the Newstart Allowance and losing 128 a week in future income. The Government has made a start in improving the job prospects of people on income support but there is a long way to go. The Budget’s best quality investments in the job capacity of people disadvantaged in the labour market should be greatly expanded, activity for its own sake should no longer be pursued, and the social security system should be based on the costs of the essentials of life rather than out-dated distinctions between those who ‘deserve’ or ‘don’t deserve’ a decent minimum income. Above all, this Budget had to be tough on waste, not welfare, in order to get back to surplus. We are therefore pleased to see the measures on the health care rebate, the fringe benefit tax on company cars, and the dependent spouse offset, and the removal of the low income tax offset for investment income of children. These will go some way to help restore the budget to surplus without the need to scrimp on essential investment such as training for unemployed people. We continue to urge the government to be bolder in cutting wasteful and poorly targeted spending and tax breaks –such as <b>golden</b> <b>handshakes</b> and income sheltered in private trusts and companies. ACOSS estimates that reform in these two areas alone (that mainly benefit people on higher incomes) would raise in the order of 2. 5 billion per year. This money would not only help us achieve the ‘political imperative’ of getting back to surplus, but would provide the longer term revenue needed to fund vital programs and benefits for people on low incomes (like skills training and essential services). Our next opportunity is the tax forum planned for October. We look forward to a broad-ranging tax forum that will encompass getting tough on waste as proposed by the Henry Review. And unlike the secretive Budget process, it will provide a chance of direct involvement by stakeholder groups, such as ACOSS, in the important process to help the community shape Australia 2 ̆ 7 s future – fairer - tax and social security system.
