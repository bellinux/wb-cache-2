They owned the Bwllfa Colliery in the Aberdare Valley (see above) {{and since the}} {{beginning}} of 1870 had supplied coal weekly to the Metropolitan Railway at favourable prices. A <b>draft</b> <b>contract</b> had been initialled by Alexander but never formally completed and Alexander decided to cease deliveries without notice. The Metropolitan held that the <b>draft</b> <b>contract</b> was valid and had been breached. A case was tried at the Surrey Spring Assizes (1873), The Court of Common Pleas and the House of Lords (1877), each of which held for the Metropolitan. This case is an important precedent in the law of contract.|$|E

50|$|Daulia Ltd {{wanted to}} buy the {{premises}} on Millbank, London from Four Millbank Nominees Ltd, who were mortgagees in possession. Formal contracts were never exchanged, but Daulia argued they did obtain a unilateral contract by the first defendants that they would enter into a written contract of sale, if they attended Four Millbank's offices with a <b>draft</b> <b>contract</b> on terms already negotiated and a deposit. But when Daulia Ltd's representatives attended, Four Millbank refused to exchange. Daulia Ltd claimed breach of the oral agreement.|$|E

40|$|In United Rentals, Inc. v. RAM Holdings, Inc., Vice Chancellor Chandler {{rejected}} conscious ambiguity as a drafting principle. In {{the face}} of seemingly inconsistent provisions in the merger agreement between United Rentals and Cerberus, Vice Chancellor Chandler denied United Rentals specific performance because the equipment lessor knew that Cerberus did not {{think there was a}} specific performance remedy in the agreement and, therefore, United Rentals was not a forthright negotiator. But underlying the opinion was a message to lawyers that they have a professional and ethical obligation to <b>draft</b> <b>contracts</b> clearly. “Conscious ambiguity” undermines those obligations and is inconsistent with a consent theory of contract.

50|$|Fontana was {{considered}} as a driver for the dying Tyrrell team for 1998 with team principal Ken Tyrrell negotiating with the Argentine. Fontana signed a <b>draft</b> <b>contract,</b> but did not sign the final contract as the owners British American Tobacco had vetoed the suggestion and Tyrrell was forced to sign Brazilian Ricardo Rosset who had more sponsorship brought to the team. In 1999, Fontana tested with Minardi for a seat that would partner Marc Gené. However, sponsorship once again caused the Argentine to lose the seat for a possible comeback.|$|E

Alessandro de' Medici caught him and Catherine de' Medici in a private embrace. However, when he was sent away as a Cardinal, they weren't allowed {{to see each other}} any longer. Some theories suggest that the reason Clement made Ippolito Cardinal was to keep him and Catherine de' Medici apart. By 24 April 1531 Catherine had been promised to Henri, the son of King Francis I of France, in a <b>draft</b> <b>contract</b> of marriage. [...] Catherine was 11, and Cardinal Ippolito was 21.|$|E
50|$|The normal {{practice}} {{is for the}} buyer to negotiate an agreed price with the seller then organise a survey and have the solicitor (or conveyancer) carry out their searches and pre-contract enquiries. The seller's solicitor or conveyancer will prepare the <b>draft</b> <b>contract</b> {{to be approved by}} the buyer's solicitor. The seller's solicitor will also collect and prepare property information to be provided to the buyer's solicitors, in line with the Law Society's National Protocol for domestic conveyancing. When undertaking property transactions, the conveyancer’s role is to carry out due diligence by submitting queries - known as Conveyancing Searches - about the transacted property. These are designed to uncover factors the estate agent or surveyor may not know about, which could impact the buyer’s enjoyment of the property.|$|E

5000|$|Continuing anti-communist {{policies}} of his predecessor, Lipsic unsuccessfully attempted {{to introduce a}} law, banning Judges who had worked under the former communist regime from the judiciary. He also attempted to prosecute members of the judiciary who had ruled in political trials under the communist regime. The plan was unequivocally rejected by Slovakia's top judicial authorities, who argued that the law, if passed, would come much too late. [...] In connection with the withdrawal of KDH from the ruling coalition on 7 February 2006, all KDH cabinet ministers resigned. Subsequently, on 8 February he was replaced as of Minister of Justice by Lucia Zitnanska from the SDKU. [...] This political move KDH was associated with disapproval of the <b>draft</b> <b>contract</b> between the Slovak Republic and the Holy See regarding the right to objection of conscience, which concerns the armed forces, health, education and training, legal services and labor relations. In early parliamentary elections, held on 17 June 2006, the KDH {{became part of the}} opposition.

5000|$|In 2001 he {{was named}} the head of Governor Frank Murkowski's {{transition}} team, and in 2002, he was appointed Chief-of-Staff by Governor Frank Murkowski. Although reluctant to leave the practice of law, which he loved, he said, “I am a strong believer in public service, {{and it is my}} turn to serve my State of Alaska, which has given so much back to me and my family.” As Chief-of-Staff he directed the preparation of the State budget; oversaw the preparation of legislation; negotiated the budget and legislation with the Legislature; worked with the Governor and departmental commissioners to formulate policy. He also managed Governor’s cabinet and served as the State’s chief gas pipeline negotiator and successfully negotiated a <b>draft</b> <b>contract</b> between the Governor and the North Slope producers to construct a gas pipeline. During this time he was often referred to as [...] "the most powerful unelected official in Alaska," [...] although he always rejected this as he said his job was simply to carry out the will of Governor Murkowski, and noted that he was not acting on his own agenda.|$|E

5000|$|In September 1939, Britain {{imposed a}} {{selective}} blockade of Italy. Coal from Germany, which was shipped out of Rotterdam, was declared contraband. The Germans promised {{to keep up}} shipments by train, over the Alps, and Britain offered to supply all of Italy's needs in exchange for Italian armaments. The Italians could not agree to the latter terms without shattering their alliance with Germany. On 2 February 1940, however, Mussolini approved a <b>draft</b> <b>contract</b> with the Royal Air Force to provide 400 Caproni aircraft; yet he scrapped the deal on 8 February. The British intelligence officer, Francis Rodd, believed that Mussolini was convinced to reverse policy by German pressure in the week of 2-8 February, a view shared by the British ambassador in Rome, Percy Loraine. On 1 March, the British announced that they would block all coal exports from Rotterdam to Italy. Italian coal {{was one of the}} most discussed issues in diplomatic circles in the spring of 1940. In April Britain began strengthening their Mediterranean Fleet to enforce the blockade. Despite French misgivings, Britain rejected concessions to Italy so as not to [...] "create an impression of weakness". Germany supplied Italy with about one million tons of coal a month beginning in the spring of 1940, an amount that even exceeded Mussolini's demand of August 1939 that Italy receive six million tons of coal for its first twelve months of war.|$|E
