2500|$|Plaster of Paris {{bandages}} {{were introduced}} in different forms by 2 army surgeons, one at a peacetime home station and another on active service at the front. [...] Antonius Mathijsen (1805–1878) was born in Budel, the Netherlands, where his father was the village doctor. He was educated in Brussels, Maastricht and Utrecht obtaining the degree of doctor of medicine at Gissen in 1837. He spent his entire career as a medical officer in the Dutch Army. [...] While he was stationed at Haarlem in 1851, he developed a method of applying plaster of Paris bandages. A brief note describing his method was published on January 30, 1852; it was followed shortly by more complete accounts. In these accounts Mathijsen emphasised that only simple materials were required and the bandage could be quickly applied without assistance. The bandages hardened rapidly, provided an <b>exact</b> <b>fit</b> and could be windowed or bivalved (cut to provide strain relief) easily. Mathijsen used coarsely woven materials, usually linen, into which dry plaster of Paris had been rubbed thoroughly. The bandages were then moistened with a wet sponge or brush as they were applied and rubbed by hand until they hardened.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} parameterizing jointly to all swaptions {{in the framework of}} the lognormal Libor market model (LLMM). First we refine some previous work showing that swaprates are nearly lognormal with a deterministic volatility. Then we formulate the fitting problem in terms of covariance matrices rather than the usual two variable volatility function. Semidefinite programming, in which the variables are positive semidefinite matrices (covariance matrices), minimizes a linear function of the variables subject to linear constraints on the variables. <b>Exact</b> <b>fits</b> to the swaption volatility matrix are imposed through linear constraints on covariance matrices. Various objectives can be used to get close to a historical covariance matrix. The method is illustrated by pricing fixed maturity Bermudan options...|$|R

50|$|In the 1980s, Geiger's {{opened a}} Pendleton Shop {{in an old}} home in Rocky River, Ohio. As {{a part of their}} {{contract}} with Pendleton, Geiger's was required to stock 75% of the merchandise with Pendleton brand clothing and accessories. In 1996, the store moved to larger quarters in the Old River Shopping area, also in Rocky River. Demand grew at such a pace that a second Geiger's Pendleton Shopped was opened in Medina, Ohio on the historic Medina Town Square. In 2005 the Medina store closed and the Pendleton name and affiliation were dropped in Rocky River, although the store still carried some Pendleton brand items, particularly its iconic women's blazers. The store focused mostly on women's traditional clothing. The response was enthusiastic and the store expanded. A unique aspect of the store was its in-house skilled women's tailor, whose expertise in alterations made certain of <b>exact</b> <b>fits.</b> When the Rocky River location finally closed, fashion ladieswear again became a part of Geiger's Lakewood and Chagrin Falls locations.|$|R

40|$|The {{irregular}} shape packing {{problem is}} approached. The container has a fixed width {{and an open}} dimension to be minimized. The proposed algorithm constructively creates the solution using an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. Simulated annealing is the adopted metaheuristic to solve the optimization problem. A two-level algorithm is used to minimize the open dimension of the container. To ensure feasible layouts, the concept of collision free region is used. A collision free region represents all possible translations for an item to be placed and may be degenerated. For a moving item, the proposed placement heuristic detects the presence of <b>exact</b> <b>fits</b> (when the item is fully constrained by its surroundings) and exact slides (when the item position is constrained {{in all but one}} direction). The relevance of these positions is analyzed and a new placement heuristic is proposed. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose discrete-time term {{structure}} models where the historical dynamics of the factor (xt) is given, in the univariate case, by a Gaussian AR(p) process, and, in the multivariate case, by a Gaussian n-dimensional VAR(p) process. The factor (xt) is considered as a latent or an observable variable and, in the second case, (xt) is given by the short rate (in the scalar setting) or by a vector of several yields (in the multivariate setting). We consider an exponential-affine stochastic discount factor (SDF) with a stochastic factor risk correction coefficient defined, at time t, as an affine function of Xt = (xt,..., xt?p+ 1) 0 and, consequently, the yield-to-maturity formula at time t is an affine function of the p most recent lagged values of xt+ 1. We study the Gaussian AR(p) and the Gaussian VAR(p) Factor-Based Term Structure Models. We investigate, under the risk-neutral and the S-forward probability, the Moving Average (or discrete-time Heath, Jarrow and Morton) representation of the yield and short-term forward rate processes. This representation gives the possibility to exactly replicate the currently-observed yield curve. We also study the problem of matching the theoretical and currently-observed market term structure by means of the Extended AR(p) approach.

40|$|Producción CientíficaA robust {{estimator}} {{for a wide}} {{family of}} mixtures of linear regression is presented. Robustness {{is based on the}} joint adoption of the Cluster Weighted Model and of an estimator based on trimming and restrictions. The selected model provides the conditional distribution of the response for each group, as in mixtures of regression, and further supplies local distributions for the explanatory variables. A novel version of the restrictions has been devised, under this model, for separately controlling the two sources of variability identified in it. This proposal avoids singularities in the log-likelihood, caused by approximate local collinearity in the explanatory variables or local <b>exact</b> <b>fits</b> in regressions, and reduces the occurrence of spurious local maximizers. In a natural way, due to the interaction between the model and the estimator, the procedure is able to resist the harmful influence of bad leverage points along the estimation of the mixture of regressions, which is still an open issue in the literature. The given methodology defines a well-posed statistical problem, whose estimator exists and is consistent to the corresponding solution of the population optimum, under widely general conditions. A feasible EM algorithm has also been provided to obtain the corresponding estimation. Many simulated examples and two real datasets have been chosen to show the ability of the procedure, on the one hand, to detect anomalous data, and, on the other hand, to identify the real cluster regressions without the influence of contamination.
