50|$|Like other North American birches, gray birch {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to the Bronze birch borer (Agrilus anxius). The leaves of the gray birch serve as food for various Lepidoptera, such as the leaf <b>miner</b> <b>moth</b> Cameraria betulivora. Between about 1930 and 1950, many gray birch trees, along with paper birch and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), were affected and killed by birch dieback disease.|$|R
5000|$|Concerns {{about the}} tree's health {{date back to}} at least 1993, when a soil {{analysis}} revealed that leakage from a nearby underground domestic fuel tank was endangering the tree's root system. The city of Amsterdam spent €160,000 on a soil sanitation program to save the tree. For {{the last several years}} the tree was attacked by a particularly aggressive fungus (Ganoderma applanatum, also called [...] "Artist's Conch" [...] or [...] "Artist's Bracket") which rotted the wood and undermined the tree's stability. Additionally, horse-chestnut leaf <b>miner</b> <b>moth</b> caterpillars (Cameraria ohridella) ate the tree's leaves, causing them to turn brown prematurely and fall off.|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{applications}} of hydrophobic kaolin particle film in apple orchards suppressed numbers of blossom weevil (Anthonomus pomorum), {{brown leaf weevil}} (Phyllobius oblongus), attelabid weevil (Caenorhinus pauxillus), leafhoppers (Empoasca vitis and Zygina flammigera) and green apple aphid (Aphis pomi) colonies. The kaolin treatments reduced the apple sawfly (Hoplocampa testudinea) fruit infestation on cultivar J. Grieve, and the fruit damage caused by oyster scale (Quadraspidiotus ostreaeformis), mussel scale (Lepidosaphes ulmi), early caterpillars, leaf rolling moths (Tortricidae), fruitlet-mining tortrix moth (Pammene rhediella) and codling moth (Cydia pomonella). There was {{no effect on the}} number of colonies of rosy leaf curling aphid (Dysaphis devecta), nor on the fruit damage caused by common earwig (Forficula auricularia) and apple sawfly on cv. G. Delicious. The level of infestation of rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea), leaf <b>miner</b> <b>moths</b> (Phyllonorycter blancardella, Lyonetia clerkella), and agromyzid flies (Phytomyza heringiana) increased in the kaolin-treated plots. Kaolin treatments promoted woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum) infestation, which became severe, while it reduced the abundance of polyphagous predators like F. auricularia, predaceous Heteroptera and Coleoptera, the red velvet mite (Allothrombium fuliginosum), spiders (Araneae) and the abundance of common black ant (Lasius niger). The treatments also reduced parasitism of the apple sawfly by the ichneumonid Lathrolestes ensator. Many weeks after ending the kaolin treatments, the number of predaceous Coleoptera and especially the number of spiders remained low in the kaolin-treated plots...|$|R
40|$|Egg laying site {{selection}} {{by a host}} plant specialist leaf <b>miner</b> <b>moth</b> at two intra-plant levels in the northern Chilean Atacama Desert. The spatial distribution of the immature stages of the leaf miner Angelabella tecomae Vargas & Parra, 2005 was determined at two intra-plant levels (shoot and leaflet) on the shrub Tecoma fulva fulva (Cav.) D. Don (Bignoniaceae) in the Azapa valley, northern Chilean Atacama Desert. An aggregated spatial pattern was detected for all the immature stages along the shoot, with an age dependent relative position: eggs and first instar larvae were clumped at apex; second, third and fourth instar larvae were mostly found at intermediate positions; meanwhile the spinning larva and pupa were clumped at basis. This pattern suggests that the females select new, actively growing leaflets for egg laying. At the leaflet level, the immature stages were found more frequently at underside. Furthermore, survivorship was higher for larvae from underside mines. All these results highlight the importance of an accurate selection of egg laying site in the life history of this highly specialized leaf miner. By contrast, eventual wrong choices in the egg laying {{site selection}} {{may be associated with}} diminished larval survivorship. The importance of the continuous availability of new plant tissue in this highly human modified arid environment is discussed in relation with the observed patterns...|$|R
40|$|The millet head <b>miner</b> <b>moth,</b> H. albipunctella, is an {{important}} pest of pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum, in Sub-Saharan Africa and causes severe crop losses. Damage to the panicles is direct and caused by developing larvae. Management techniques are being developed among which is host plant resistance. Youm and Kumar (1995) reported little progress in identifying resistance {{due to lack of}} a repeatable and reliable screening method. Efforts for the past 5 years have been devoted to developing such a technique. Youm (1997) reported an improved technique based on the use of larvae where 35 - 45 larvae were efficient in causing 51 - 60 % damage corresponding to a rating of 6 on a susceptible genotype. Though the use of larvae was promising, the present research shows that the use of eggs is more efficient than using neonate larvae. The use of 40 eggs per panicle resulted in 51 - 80 % damage corresponding to a mean damage rating ranging from 5. 5 to 8. 4 across several genotypes. A higher and more consistent infestation was obtained with eggs than larvae. Finally, egg handling was easier and infestation cheaper than using larvae. This technique should significantly improve screening millet for reaction to the head miner. It is recommended for use for future resistance screening of genotypes against the millet head miner to avoid the release of highly susceptible varieties on-farm...|$|R
50|$|Perittia lonicerae (honeysuckle leaf <b>miner)</b> is a <b>moth</b> of {{the family}} Elachistidae. It was first {{discovered}} in Hawaii in 1949. It was later found in Japan in 1982, although it was described as new. Several other species are known from the eastern Palearctic Region, so {{it is likely that}} P. lonicerae originated there instead of Hawaii where it was first found.|$|R
50|$|The small {{populations are}} highly threatened, {{one of the}} reasons being reduced populations of seabirds which they are {{dependent}} on to provide highly fertile and disturbed soils associated with nesting grounds. Additionally the species is susceptible to browsing by livestock, rodents, snails, and insect herbivores such as aphids, leaf <b>miners,</b> the diamondback <b>moth</b> (Plutella xylostella), and the small cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae). It is also affected by white rust, a fungus-like disease caused by the oomycete Albugo candida.|$|R
5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf <b>miner</b> or leek <b>moth</b> (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{while the}} {{drilling}} rig's compressed air rapidly increased the oxygen {{content of the}} mine air, monitors showed the rising water was approaching 1,825 ft above sea level, and rescuers feared they had perhaps {{an hour before the}} area where the miners had taken refuge would be under water. Mine ventilation expert John Urosek, of the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety Health Administration, proposed creating a pressurized air pocket for the miners. Urosek's plan had never been tested in the United States, but despite some skepticism, calculations were made, and the hole was sealed around the air supply. The drill operator then used his rig's air compressor to pump and maintain 920 cubic feet per minute at a temperature of 197 F at [...] The sound due to the high rate of pumped air deafened and hurt the <b>miner's</b> <b>ears,</b> but provided hope by the knowledge that rescuers knew where they were.|$|R
40|$|The growing {{interest}} in biological control has been reflected during last decades in a big number of scientific publications, books and symposia. However, biocontrol commercial application at a European level is limited and biological control products are not currently available for the control of important pests and diseases that cause high economic losses. The objective of the European project BIOCOMES is to develop 11 new biocontrol products to control key pests and diseases present in agricultural and forestry crops, as a suitable and environmental-friendly alternative strategy to chemical products. BIOCOMES includes 13 private companies (most of them SEMs) and 14 research centres from 14 different countries, working together to develop tools and give solutions to the Integrated Pest Management in Europe. Main targeted pests and diseases are: gypsy moth and large pine weevil in forestry, tomato leaf <b>miner,</b> potato <b>moths,</b> whitefly in vegetables, aphids in fruit tree crops, cabbage moth, brown rot in stone fruit, fungal root diseases in nurseries, Fusarium in cereals, soil-borne Verticillium wilt in Brassica and powdery mildew in cereals. Developed biocontrol products are parasitoids, entomopathogenic nematodes, viruses, bacteria and fungi, {{and at the end}} of the project, most of them will be at a stage close to market implementation. Brown rot in stone fruit is the only postharvest disease studied in BIOCOMES and the objective is to complete the development of the biocontrol agents Penicillium frequentans 909 (INIA) and Bacillus subtilis CPA- 8 (IRTA) to obtain products that provide an effective strategy to control brown rot in stone fruit production...|$|R
25|$|Chrysoperla carnea adults eat pollen and {{honeydew}} {{and are not}} predatory, but {{the larvae}} have been recorded as feeding on seventy different prey species in five insect orders. The prey are mostly from the order Hemiptera and are predominantly aphids on low growing vegetation. On crops, the larvae have been reported as attacking several species of aphids, red spider mites, thrips, whitefly, the eggs of leafhoppers, leaf <b>miners,</b> psyllids, small <b>moths</b> and caterpillars, beetle larvae and the tobacco budworm. They {{are considered to be}} important predators of the long-tailed mealybug under glass. C. carnea occurs naturally in many growing regions of the northern hemisphere. It is considered an important aphid predator in cotton crops in Russia and Egypt, sugar beet in Germany and vineyards in Europe. It {{has been found to be}} effective at controlling the cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, in cotton crops in Pakistan. The presence of the larvae on the foliage was found to inhibit visitation and oviposition by B. tabaci which suggests the larvae may produce a volatile semiochemical which repels the whitefly.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{studies of}} {{pheromone}} release behaviour haverevealed that virgin females {{of all of}} the nine species of thegenus Phyllonorycter investigated demonstrated the samepheromone release posture. Their calling activity wasregistered {{at the beginning of the}} photophase. This is anunusual time for calling in moths. Our hypothesis is, that thisuncommon timing of the pheromone communication may have beencaused by the sensitivity of the males to sex attractionantagonists, released into the environment by females of otherspecies at other times of the day. The diurnal calling behaviour of virgin Ph. junoniellafemales was more pronounced under a cyclic thermal regime(close to the natural conditions) than under constanttemperature. We assume, that the occurrence of an extra peak inthe pheromone release behaviour as well as the extension of thecalling period to cover the larger part of the light period maybe adaptive for Ph. junoniella with a sex ratio stronglyshifted towards females (8 : 1 females to males), as it may leadto an increased proportion of males mated. It was found, that the leaf <b>miner</b> <b>moth</b> Ph. emberizaepenellareproduced by parthenogenesis of the thelytoky type. Despite acomplete lack of males, the females demonstrated a callingposture with a sex pheromone release with the typical diurnalrhythm of that behaviour. Theoretical speculations that in thelytoky, where there is no need to attract a sexual partner, thefemales benefit by reducing their sexual behaviour, was notconfirmed for Ph. emberizaepenella. Ten compounds used in the sex communication of fivephyllonoryctid species were identified from calling virginfemales: Z 10 -, Z 8 - and E 10 - 14 :OAc for Ph. acerifoliella;E 10 - 12 :OAc, 12 :OAc and E 10 - 12 :OH for Ph. blancardella;E 8,E 10 - 14 :OAc and E 8,E 10 - 14 :OH for Ph. emberizaepenella;Z 8 - 14 :OAc, 14 :OAc and Z 8 - 14 :OH for Ph. heegerella; as well asZ 10 - 14 :OAc for Ph. ulmifoliella. The Solid Phase MicroExtraction technique was applied for the first time to collecta sex pheromone from a single calling microlepidopteran femaleand our data clearly demonstrated the advantages of thismethod. Our field screening tests in Lithuania disclosed new sexattractants for five phyllonoryctid species: E 10 - 12 :OH for Ph. sorbi; E 10 - 12 :OAc for Ph. cydoniella and Ph. oxyacanthae;Z 10 - 12 :OAc for Ph. junoniella; as well as Z 10 - 14 :OAc in a 1 : 10 mixture with E 9 - 14 :OAc for Ph. acerifoliella. The lattermixture was also found to be a potential sex attractant for Ph. coryli and Ph. heegerella. In addition, field trapping experiments revealed fourteensex attraction antagonists for males of seven Phyllonorycterspecies: E 10 - 12 :OH for Ph. acerifoliella and Ph. cydoniella;E 10 - 12 :OAc and Z 10 - 14 :OAc for Ph. heegerella; Z 10 -, E 10 - 12 :OHand E 10 - 14 :OH for Ph. mespilella; Z 10 - 12 :OH for Ph. oxyacanthae; Z 7 -, Z 9 - and Z 10 - 12 :OAc for Ph. sorbi; as well asZ 8 -, Z 9 -, E 9 -, E 10 - and E 11 - 14 :OAc for Ph. ulmifoliella. Schemes of probable interactions by means of allelochemicalsacting between Ph. blancardella and 7 other moth species, Ph. ulmifoliella and 414,Ph. sorbi and 243, Ph. mespilella and 11 as well as Ph. acerifoliella and 7 other moth species arepresented. Basing both on our own results and on data published byothers, we conclude that the pheromones used by gracillariidshave appeared at a period lasting between the formation oflower and of higher Heteroneura.
