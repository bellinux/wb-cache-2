40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) from {{different species of}} bacteria to the EF-Tu-binding antibiotics <b>efrotomycin,</b> pulvomycin and MDL 62879 was tested by measuring {{the effect of these}} antibiotics on cell-free protein synthesis systems. EF-Tu from four different Gram-negative species was sensitive to all three antibiotics. Among Gram-positive bacteria, EF-Tu of Baciiius subtiiis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecaiis was resistant to <b>efrotomycin</b> and less sensitive to pulvomycin than EF-Tu of Gram-negative bacteria. EF-Tus from streptococci were significantly less sensitive than EF-Tus from Gram-negative bacteria to both <b>efrotomycin</b> and pulvomycin. All of the EF-Tus were sensitive to MDL 62879. The same sensitivity pattern emerged from GDP exchange assays, performed with partially purified EF-Tu from different bacterial species and pure Escherichia coli EF-Ts. These results suggest that the site of action of MDL 62879 is more conserved among bacterial species than those of <b>efrotomycin</b> and pulvomycin. Heterogeneity of EF-Tus from different bacterial species was also reflected in differences in their apparent molecular masses estimated by SDS-PAGE. EF-Tus from the Gram-positive species had higher molecular masses than those from {{all but one of the}} Gram-negative species...|$|E
40|$|MDL 62, 879 (formerly GE 2270 A) {{is a novel}} {{antibiotic}} active against Gram-positive bacteria by inhibiting {{protein synthesis}}. MDL 62, 879 is not active against Gram-negative bacteria, but inhibits cell-free protein synthesis in extracts from Escherichia coli, and shows a high binding affinity for its elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). We prepared ribosomes and protein-synthesis elongation factors from three sources: E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and a strain of B. subtilis selected for resistance to MDL 62, 879 (strain G 1674). Homologous and heterologous reconstituted systems were {{used to compare the}} effects of MDL 62, 879 and of <b>efrotomycin,</b> an EF-Tu inhibitor of the kirromycin class, which is inactive against both B. subtilis and E. coli. We showed that in cell-free protein synthesis: (a) E. coli was sensitive to both MDL 62, 879 and efrotomycin; (b) B. subtilis was sensitive to MDL 62, 879, but not to efrotomycin; (c) B. subtilis G 1674 was resistant to both antibiotics. In the E. coli system and in the system from wild-type B. subtilis, inhibition by MDL 62, 879 was reversed upon addition of purified EF-Tu from B. subtilis G 1674. This demonstrates that the antibiotic acts by inhibition of EF-Tu. In contrast, extracts from B. subtilis failed to restore activity in an efrotomycin-inhibited E. coli system. Dominance or resistance to MDL 62, 879 and of sensitivity to <b>efrotomycin</b> in heterologous cell-free protein synthesis confirms that inhibition of EF-Tu by the two antibiotics is mediated by different mechanisms of action...|$|E
40|$|There are {{not many}} data {{available}} on antibiotics used solely in animals and almost exclusively for growth promotion. These products include bambermycin, avilamycin, <b>efrotomycin,</b> and the ionophore antibiotics (monensin, salinomycin, narasin, and lasalocid). Information is also scarce for bacitracin used only marginally in human and veterinary medicine and for streptogramin antibiotics. The mechanisms of action of and resistance mechanisms against these antibiotics are described. Special emphasis {{is given to the}} prevalence of resistance among gram-positive bacteria isolated from animals and humans. Since no susceptibility breakpoints are available for most of the antibiotics discussed, an alternative approach to the interpretation of MICs is presented. Also, some pharmacokinetic data and information on the influence of these products on the intestinal flora are presented...|$|E
40|$|A radiochemical {{method was}} {{developed}} to estimate cholyltaurine hydrolase potentials and rates of cholyltaurine hydrolysis in chicken intestinal homogenates. This method was used to monitor the effects of antibiotic feed additives on cholyltaurine hydrolase activity. Avoparcin, bacitracin methylenedisalisylic acid, <b>efrotomycin,</b> lincomycin, penicillin G procaine, and virginiamycin improved rate of weight gain and feed conversion of chicks and decreased cholyltaurine hydrolase activity in ileal homogenates relative to those of nonmedicated control birds. The results provided the first evidence that feeding selected antibiotics at subtherapeutic levels can affect bile acid-transforming enzymes in small-intestinal homogenates. The inverse relationship between growth performance and cholyltaurine hydrolase activity {{raises the possibility that}} specific inhibitors of this enzyme may promote weight gain and feed conversion in livestock and thereby reduce or eliminate the need for antibiotic feed additives...|$|E
40|$|Six kirromycin analogs (elfamycins) were {{compared}} {{on the basis}} of their inhibition of Escherichia coli poly(U) -directed poly(Phe) synthesis and stimulation of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) -associated GTPase activity. The elfamycins tested were kirromycin, aurodox, <b>efrotomycin,</b> phenelfamycin A, unphenelfamycin, and L- 681, 217. The last three lack the pyridone ring present in the other elfamycins. All the elfamycins inhibited poly(U) -dependent poly(Phe) synthesis and stimulated EF-Tu-associated GTPase activity, suggesting that the pyridone ring is not essential for activity. The six elfamycins were also examined in a poly(U) -directed, poly(Phe) -synthesizing system derived from Staphylococcus aureus and had 50 % inhibitory concentrations of greater than or equal to 1 mM. When S. aureus ribosomes and E. coli elongation factors were combined in a hybrid poly(Phe) -synthesizing system, aurodox produced essentially complete inhibition of poly(Phe) synthesis with a 50 % inhibitory concentration of 0. 13 microM. This suggests that the observed high MICs of kirromycin and its congeners in S. aureus reflect a kirromycin-resistant EF-Tu rather than permeability constraints...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 107 Enterococcus strains, 10 Vagococcus fluvialis strains, and 8 Lactococcus garvieae strains were tested for {{acidification}} of methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (MGP) and susceptibility to 100 -μg <b>efrotomycin</b> (EFRO) disks. All 26 strains of Enterococcus casseliflavus, including 3 nonmotile and 2 nonpigmented strains, acidified MGP and were resistant to EFRO. All 22 strains of Enterococcus gallinarum, including 5 nonmotile strains, also acidified MGP and were resistant to EFRO. None of the 26 strains of Enterococcus faecium acidified MGP, {{and all were}} susceptible to EFRO. Although all 12 Enterococcus faecalis strains were also negative in the MGP test, they were resistant to EFRO. Other enterococcal strains gave variable results. All 10 strains of V. fluvialis and all 8 strains of L. garvieae gave positive and negative results, respectively, in the MGP test and were, respectively, resistant and susceptible to EFRO. These results indicate that tests of the production of acid from MGP and susceptibility to EFRO {{can be used as}} adjunct tests in the identification of typical and atypical strains of enterococci in the clinical microbiology laboratory...|$|E
