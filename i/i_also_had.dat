I always felt there was some good in every person – even though you had to find it in some of them. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> prosecuted many people who didn’t have {{representation}} and I knew their sentences {{would have been more}} lenient if they could have had an attorney.|$|E
25|$|Immediately on our {{coming up}} out of the water after we had been baptized, we {{experienced}} great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.|$|E
500|$|The reggae group Easy Star All-Stars covered OK Computer in its {{entirety}} for Radiodread (2006). Producer Michael G noted that [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] was particularly difficult to arrange for reggae, saying [...] "There are songs like 'Paranoid Android', which flips between 4/4 time and 7/8 time about 13 times, and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> to think about other ways to reinterpret those parts with horns, melodica, organ... {{it was a great}} challenge." ...|$|E

500|$|After Indiscreet Donen made Britain {{his home}} {{until the early}} 1970s. Musicals' waning {{popularity}} caused Donen to focus on comedy films. He observed that his [...] "London base afforded me {{the advantage of being}} away from the Hollywood rat race. Just going your own way in spite of whatever anyone else is doing or in spite of what you've done already was satisfying. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the advantage of the European influence: their way of looking at life, of making movies." [...] While in the UK in the early 1960s Donen was praised as an early influence on the then-emerging British New Wave film movement.|$|E
500|$|He was {{a member}} of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Nashville sportswriter Fred Russell, who entered Vanderbilt in 1924, told a story about Bomar in his {{autobiography}} Bury Me In An Old Press Box: [...] "As a freshman I had pledged Kappa Sigma fraternity, which at that time had many varsity athletes. Among them was Lynn Bomar, selected All-American end in 1923... <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the responsibility, as a freshman, of awakening Bomar in time for him to get to classes, and at the end of the school year I did this one morning by rolling the biggest lighted firecracker I ever saw under his bed. When it exploded I feared the whole corner of the fraternity house had been blown off, and I was so scared that even Bomar in his BVD's chasing me across the street and deep into the campus couldn't catch me." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E

500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, {{noting that}} the actress [...] "captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in Star Trek {{a couple of years}} ago have I seen anyone so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy." [...] Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such as the one in the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has [...] "been needing an Everyman in this mix for awhile, someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that [...] "the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, is turning out to be sort of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the feeling that this might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves." ...|$|E
500|$|Bassist Frank Zincavage met Iyall at the SF Art Institute; the two {{hit it off}} and {{discussed}} putting a band together. They formed one with Woods and Derrah a few weeks later, drawing inspiration from the [...] "burgeoning local punk and post-punk scenes". Iyall recruited Woods because she enjoyed playing {{with him in the}} Mommers and Poppers. [...] " [...] seemed only natural that we invite Peter Woods to join us [...] played clean and was a natural on rhythm guitar." [...] Romeo Void officially formed on Valentine's Day in 1979. According to Iyall, the name Romeo Void referred to [...] "a lack of romance" [...] and came to mind after they saw a local magazine with the headline [...] "Why single women can't get laid in San Francisco." [...] The band practiced in Iyall's flat in Mission District. It was decided that the group would embrace punk ideals despite the possibility that they become associated with the new wave movement. [...] "Even though I was going to the [...] so much, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> criticisms: Everyone was leaning against the wall wearing black," [...] Iyall said. [...] "I guess we were considered new wave, but for me Romeo Void was a reaction against the regimentation of everyone having to be bleached blond and everything being about despair and no future, when I thought the do-it-yourself thing should encompass all the different kinds of emotions, and all the different colors. [...] I was proud of being American Indian, so I purposely never bleached my hair blond." ...|$|E
2500|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> {{the effect}} of {{bringing}} political transformation {{to most of the}} principal parties involved in the conflict, transforming them into electoral democracies by bringing near-universal suffrage {{for the first time in}} history, such as Germany (German federal election, 1919), Great Britain [...] (United Kingdom general election, 1918), and Turkey (Turkish general election, 1923).|$|E

2500|$|After the Apollo 1 fire, NASA Administrator James Webb became {{distrustful of}} Mueller, but commented.

Next, a foot soldier fired at me, then charged me with his bayonet, which <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the good luck to parry, and I cut him down through the head; thus ended the contest." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the overall}} {{message of the}} film, the {{director}} said [...] "This movie ... concludes that all forms of life – humans, animals and robots – are equal.

[...] On his narrative intentions Oshii comments: [...] "I had a bigger budget than for Ghost in the Shell. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> more time to prepare it. Yet despite the economic leeway, abundant details and orientations, it was still important to tell an intimate story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Garðar {{spent six}} months at a Hertfordshire private school in England when he was aged nine and 11. He insists that {{there was never any}} {{pressure}} on him to become a singer. [...] "At home, mum was always playing piano and dad was singing. I'd listen to dad's records of other tenors and whole operas but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a huge pile of Bon Jovi, Queen and Shakin' Stevens albums.

Before, we were in a sort of rock'n'roll bubble, we were alternating the studio sessions and the live concerts, we were pretty much cut off from the real world. It's dangerous to live too much in this kind of bubble. We had the chance to distance ourselves a bit from everything that happened since 1996 up until now. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the occasion to reflect to the montagne russe that is my personal life after these seven years.

2500|$|Many {{basketball}} observers, {{in addition}} to Abdul-Jabbar, believe that Kareem's reticence, whether through disdain for the press corps or simply because of introversion, contributed to the dearth of coaching opportunities offered to Abdul-Jabbar by the NBA. In his words, {{he said he had}} a mindset he could not overcome, and proceeded through his career oblivious to the effect his reticence may have had on his future coaching prospects. Abdul-Jabbar said: [...] "I didn't understand that <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> affected people that way and that's what it was all about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I was way too suspicious and I paid a price for it." [...] Since he began lobbying for a coaching position in 1995, he has managed to obtain only low-level assistant and scouting jobs in the NBA, and a head coaching position only in a minor professional league.|$|E
2500|$|Tiffany {{was created}} as a new love {{interest}} for established character; Chris Warner. Alison James, who had theatre background, was cast in the role. After appearing on the show for three years, James decided to quit and the character was killed off. She stated, [...] "It {{took me a long}} time to decide to leave Shortland Street because it isn't easy to walk away from something you love. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> this fear I'd never get work again – it's a real fear. So it {{took me a long time}} to wrestle with the idea that saying no to work wasn't unwise, and that if you actually want to grow and develop as an actor you do have to stop and move on." [...] She found her final scenes draining, [...] "Everyone was acting around me and I was there, but my acting had basically stopped. I remember lying there thinking, 'I’m going to miss all these people.' I was quite teary, actually." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{month in}} advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the {{captaincy}} after the tournament. Sri Lanka reached the final of the tournament. Throughout the tournament Sangakkara was in prolific form with the bat scoring 465 runs from 9 matches and was the third highest run-scorer behind team-mate Tillakaratne Dilshan and India's Sachin Tendulkar. Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams. He offered to continue as Test captain if deemed necessary for transition to new skipper, but Dilshan was appointed captain across all formats. Reflecting on the decision afterwards, he said that [...] "captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly... It's rarely a job you will last long in... <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a two-year stint, and I enjoyed it at times, certainly on the field where our results showed we were one of the top two sides in the world for one-and-a-half years, especially in the shorter form of the game." ...|$|E
