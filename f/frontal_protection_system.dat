50|$|A <b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>System</b> (FPS) is {{a device}} fitted {{to the front}} end of a vehicle to protect both {{pedestrians}} and cyclists who are involved in the unfortunate event of a front-end collision with a vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Testing in 2001 {{showed that}} steel bull bars {{could lead to}} greater risk of injury. Later studies carried out by MIRA, one of the UK's leading testing-facilities, may have proved that the latest {{development}} of a vehicle <b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>System</b> can make many 4x4 vehicles safer {{in the event of}} front-end collisions with pedestrians or cyclists. Calculations based on these tests show that if fitted to a current large 4x4 vehicle, an FPS could save lives and reduce serious pedestrian-injuries.|$|E
50|$|Most {{pedestrian}} deaths occur due to {{the traumatic}} brain injury resulting from the hard impact of the head against the stiff hood or windshield. In addition, although usually non-fatal, injuries to the lower limb (usually to the knee joint and long bones) {{are the most common}} cause of disability due to pedestrian crashes. A <b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>System</b> (FPS) is a device fitted to the front end of a vehicle to protect both pedestrians and cyclists who are involved in a front end collision with a vehicle. Car design has been shown to have a large impact on the scope and severity of pedestrian injury in car crashes.|$|E
50|$|This {{legislation}} {{amounts to}} a de facto ban on <b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Systems,</b> due to {{the high cost of}} compliance and type testing, and the sheer complexity of the law. The type testing procedure can be seen here.|$|R
5000|$|Bullbars {{incorporating}} a winch are often known as [...] "winch bumpers", {{especially in the}} UK where the sale of bullbars that do not meet European standards, as mentioned above, was banned since 2007.

50|$|This {{requirement}} is not specifically aimed at bullbars but does effectively prescribe requirements for their construction.

Australian Standard AS4876.1-2002 Motor vehicle <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> Part 1: Road user protection was released in 2002, and applies construction rules to all bullbars manufactured since that date, regardless of the age of the vehicle that they are fitted to. Similar requirements for older vehicles fitted with bullbars manufactured before that Australian Standard was implemented exist only in state legislation.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is {{investigation}} of optimization strategies eligible for solving complex engineering design problems. An aim is to develop numerical algorithms for solving optimal design problems which may contain real and integer variables, a number of local extremes, linear- and non-linear constraints and multiple optimality criteria. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology proposed for solving optimal design problems is based on integrated use of meta-modeling techniques and global optimization algorithms. Design of the complex and safety critical products is validated experimentally. Findings: Hierarchically decomposed multistage optimization strategy for solving complex engineering design problems is developed. A number of different non-gradient methods and meta-modeling techniques has been evaluated and compared for certain class of engineering design problems. The developed optimization algorithms allows to predict the performance of the product (structure) for different design and configurations parameters as well as loading conditions. Research limitations/implications: The results obtained can be applied for solving certain class of engineering design problems. The nano- and microstructure design of materials is not considered in current approach. Practical implications: The methodology proposed is employed successfully for solving a number of practical problems arising from Estonian industry: design of car <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system,</b> double-curved surface forming process modeling, fixings for frameless glazed structures, optimal design of composite bathtub (large composite plastics), etc. Originality/value: Developed numerical algorithms can be utilised for solving a wide class of complex optimization problems...|$|E

40|$|<b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Systems</b> (FPS) {{have become}} a popular {{accessory}} for passenger vehicles. They are used to protect {{the front of a}} vehicle during minor impacts, and to attenuate the impact energy during major impacts. With the increased safety of modern passenger vehicles, the fitment of a FPS to a vehicle requires careful consideration to the design and installation of the FPS as they may modify vehicle crush characteristics. This is particularly important in vehicles fitted with air bags. These community and industry concerns triggered the research discussed in this thesis, which is the first comprehensive project undertaken in this particular area. This project generated comprehensive research knowledge on the impact response and energy absorption of FPS in order to evaluate performance. This involved a range of experimental testing supplemented by finite element analysis. Experimental testing was conducted using quasi-static and dynamic techniques to assess the overall performance of current FPS available. Finite element models were then generated and analysed using both implicit and explicit techniques, and calibrated against the experimental testing results. These models were used throughout the project to assess the FPS response, in particular the energy absorbed, to changes in impact characteristics. FPS assessment guidelines were developed from the knowledge generated from the numerous FPS tests and analyses carried out in this research project. These guidelines have been used in the design and evaluation of a number of FPS for airbag compatibility. The real life performance of vehicles fitted with these FPS, have given confidence to the assessment criteria developed in this research project. This project has demonstrated that FPS can be designed to complement the safety systems of modern passenger vehicles, and thus passenger safety. This {{would not have been possible}} without the comprehensive research carried out in this project...|$|R
40|$|Australian Standard AS 4876. 1 - 2002 {{stipulates}} {{requirements for}} motor vehicle <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> (VFPS), colloquially known as bull bars. Section 2 of the Standard sets design and installation requirements {{and has a}} particular focus on the geometry of the VFPS, stipulating that their geometry should generally conform to the frontal shape of the vehicle. The aim of this project {{was to examine the}} differences between pedestrian impacts with vehicles fitted with a VFPS with geometry that meets the requirements of Section 2 of AS 48761. 1 - 2002 and VFPS that do not meet these requirements. MADYMO was used to simulate pedestrian impacts with vehicles that had VFPS fitted. The simulations showed that conforming VFPS tend to redistribute impact forces to contacts with the bumper section of the VFPS. For an SUV impact, the increase in risk of pelvic injury produced by this change in loading pattern is only marginally offset by a small reduction in the probability of upper leg injury. For a sedan impact, increased risk in upper leg injury may be offset by a reduction in risk to lower leg injury, depending on the material of the VFPS. Conforming VFPS also tended to result in lower head impact speeds with the vehicle, reducing the severity of the impact with the head, resulting in a reduction in risk of serious head injury well over 50 % based on the change in the head injury criterion. The extent to which the results of the narrow set of impact conditions studied can be generalised to all collisions is not completely clear, although it seems reasonable to suggest that the effects will apply where the interaction with the bull bar and the pedestrian is at, or below, the pelvic region. It is less likely that the geometry of the bull bar would affect children to the same extent. The results of this brief simulation study support the expectation that the adoption of Section 2 of AS 4876. 1 - 2002 will lead to reductions in injury risk to people struck by VFPS.

40|$|It is {{important}} to know their mechanical properties and their failure mechanism during the impact in order to increased the safety of any vehicle. This thesis focuses on the design of bumper, spring and roll cage for lesser weight and better performance. Also it describes about the stress analysis on a car <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> (bumper) simulations. Research concentrates on composite material. It is considering their function, geometry, and other parameters that influence the compatibility of the bumper and roller cage In future research, these parts will face the static test and analysis will be done on their load distributions by applying the variation of load and locations. We analyze the basic concepts for improving the safety on the car by doing analysis on the car bumper and roller cage [...] This analysis was carried out by using ANSYS for structural physics that could simulate static (stationary), dynamic (moving) and thermal (heat transfer) problems to evaluate the behaviour of bumper system and roller cage. Another additional innovative step for improving crashworthiness is the use of material to produces the part to absorb energy during the process of a crash and that part is spring. Here we will use spring on the front side of the vehicle to absorb the energy of sudden impact and this will secure the driver as well as produce less injury to the person outside.
