5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20Â° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} <b>hobby</b> <b>shop</b> for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
25|$|Between films, Denny overheard {{a racket}} {{next door and}} went to investigate. He found the neighbor's son {{attempting}} to start {{one of the earliest}} radio control model airplanes. Denny attempted to help, but they instead ended up destroying the model. While attempting to get it fixed, Denny became acquainted with the newly forming model industry, one of whom convinced him to take it up as a hobby. In 1934 he started a small <b>hobby</b> <b>shop</b> with a partner on Hollywood Boulevard, but after two years it went out of business.|$|E
25|$|Birds of Tokyo {{entered the}} studio to record their fourth studio album in February 2012. The album was {{primarily}} recorded in Los Angeles, California on the western United States. The band recorded over a 6-month period lasting until July. Kingsize Studio and The <b>Hobby</b> <b>Shop</b> in Eagle Rock, along with the Sound Factory and Oceanway Studios in Hollywood hosted these sessions. A final week-long session was conducted in October 2012 at The Hoop Hut in Sydney, Australia before the album officially ceased recording later that month. The album is notably the first album to feature bassist Ian Berney, after founding member and previous bassist Anthony Jackson left the band due to spiritual reasons. March Fires is the first ever material released by the band not to be recorded with Jackson.|$|E

2500|$|Scales vary as well, {{with many}} kits {{from the early}} days being [...] "box scale"; that is, scaled to fit into a uniform sized box {{designed}} to fit conveniently on <b>hobby</b> <b>shop</b> shelves. [...] Scales have since become more standardized to enable modelers to construct consistent scale collections, but there are still many to choose from. [...] In Europe 1/400 scale remains popular, while in the United States and Japan the most popular scales are [...] (making a World War Two aircraft carrier about a foot long) and [...] (twice as long as [...] ). [...] Nevertheless, mainstream plastic kit manufacturers continue to produce kits as small as 1/1200 and as large as 1/72, with a few even larger.|$|E

5000|$|Cultural and {{technical}} changes, and competing interests (television, the space race, slot cars, etc.), soon relegated indoor larger-than-HO trains to an out-of-date perception. Additionally, the increased prevalence of discount stores ravaged the toy train companies' traditional distribution network (i.e. mom-and-pop <b>hobby</b> <b>shops,</b> and hardware and department stores). The discount stores demanded train sets at wholesale prices {{so low that}} the profit margins of the traditional manufacturers became unsustainable. Additionally, they did not offer the personal attention and repair services of traditional <b>hobby</b> <b>shops.</b> By trying to accommodate {{the demands of the}} retail discounters, Gilbert and other toy train manufacturers cheapened their lines. Their [...] "Pikemaster" [...] line exemplified the corruption of the products. This accelerated their downward economic spiral. Longtime train collectors and hobbyists were offended at this newer production, dismissing the new products as [...] "cheap junk", an accurate description.|$|R

Many of the twenty buildings were residences or churches, but the <b>Hobby</b> <b>Shop</b> was one of several commercial buildings in the group, along with Hamer's General Store, the Magruder Building, the 1830 Lawler's Tavern, and the four buildings of the Mechanicsburg Commercial Historic District.|$|E
