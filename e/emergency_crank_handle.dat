2500|$|Most {{fishing reels}} are {{suspended}} {{from the bottom of}} the rod, since this position requires no wrist strength to overcome gravity while enabling the angler to cast and retrieve without changing hands. [...] The baitcasting reel's unusual mounting position atop the rod is an accident of history. [...] Baitcasting reels were originally designed to be cast when positioned atop the rod, then rotated upside-down in order to operate the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> while playing a fish or retrieving line. [...] However, in practice most anglers preferred to keep the reel atop the rod for both cast and retrieve by simply transferring the rod to the left hand for the retrieve, then reverse-winding the <b>crank</b> <b>handle.</b> [...] Because of this preference, mounting the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> on the right side of a bait casting reel (with standard clockwise <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> rotation) has become customary, though models with left-hand retrieve have gained in popularity in recent years thanks to user familiarity with the spinning reel.|$|R

2500|$|The use of <b>crank</b> <b>handles</b> in trepanation drills was {{depicted}} in the 1887 edition of the Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines to the credit of the Spanish Muslim surgeon Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi; however, {{the existence of such}} a device cannot be confirmed by the original illuminations and thus has to be discounted. The Benedictine monk Theophilus Presbyter (c. 1070−1125) described <b>crank</b> <b>handles</b> [...] "used in the turning of casting cores".|$|R

50|$|The {{worm gear}} roller gin, which {{was invented in}} the Indian subcontinent during the early Delhi Sultanate era of the 13th - 14th centuries, came into use in the Mughal Empire some time around the 16th century, and is still used in India through to the present day. Another innovation, the {{incorporation}} of the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> in the cotton gin, first appeared in India some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire. The incorporation of the worm gear and <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> into the roller cotton gin led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production during the Mughal era.|$|R
50|$|The crank {{is geared}} {{to give a}} {{negative}} mechanical advantage {{so that it can}} crank the machine at high speed. Each rotation of the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> produces three rotations of the handwheel, and hence three stitches.|$|R
50|$|Nigrosene is an {{outdated}} trade {{name for a}} black dye made from oxidised aniline dispersed in water. It {{was used as a}} colourant in shoe polish until the 1940s, and as a dark stain for bedplates, brackets, <b>crank</b> <b>handles,</b> and wood.|$|R
50|$|The {{wind machine}} {{is played by}} {{rotating}} the <b>crank</b> <b>handle,</b> which {{is attached to the}} cylinder, to create friction between the wooden slats and the material covering that touches the cylinder but does not rotate as the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> is turned. This friction between the wood and the material covering creates the sound of rushing wind. The volume and pitch of the sound is controlled by {{the rate at which the}} crank is turned. The faster the handle is turned, the higher the resulting pitch and the louder the sound. The slower the handle is turned, the lower the pitch and the softer the volume. The sound of the wind machine can also be controlled by the tightness of the fabric covering the cylinder.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the <b>crank</b> <b>handle.</b> Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of <b>crank</b> <b>handles,</b> which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|R

50|$|The arithmometers of {{this period}} were four-operation machines; a {{multiplicand}} inscribed on the input sliders could be multiplied by a single-digit multiplier by simply pulling on a ribbon (quickly replaced by a <b>crank</b> <b>handle).</b> It was a complicated design and very few machines were built. Additionally, no machines were built between 1822 and 1844.|$|R

It was possible to operate the stepping switch by hand, but only by someone actually at the switch inside the centre locomotive body.|$|R
25|$|The {{worm gear}} roller cotton gin {{was invented in}} the Indian subcontinent during the early Delhi Sultanate era of the 13th14th centuries, and is still used in India through to the present day. Another innovation, the {{incorporation}} of the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> in the cotton gin, {{first appeared in the}} Indian subcontinent some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire. The production of cotton, which may have largely been spun in the villages and then taken to towns in the form of yarn to be woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the spinning wheel across India during the Delhi Sultanate era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase demand for cotton. The diffusion of the spinning wheel, and the incorporation of the worm gear and <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> into the roller cotton gin, led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{starting}} a Model T {{with the hand}} crank, the spark had to be manually retarded or the engine might [...] "kick back". The <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> was cupped in the palm, with the thumb tucked under the handle (not clasped over top of it), so that if the engine did kick back, the rapid reverse motion of the crank would throw the hand away from the handle, rather than violently twisting the wrist or breaking the thumb. Most Model T Fords had the choke operated by a wire emerging {{from the bottom of}} the radiator where it could be operated with the left hand. This was used to prime the engine while cranking the engine slowly; then the engine was started with a rapid pull of the <b>crank</b> <b>handle.</b> In good tune, an already-primed T engine only has to be cranked half a turn for it to successfully start.|$|R
50|$|The raganella {{is about}} the size of a breadbox and {{consists}} of a wooden frame into which are fastened four or five stiff but flexible wooden tines fastened to one side of the frame; the other ends of the tines are struck in rapid succession by a cog-wheel that is turned by a <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> mounted on the side of the frame.|$|R
5000|$|To reload the weapon, the <b>crank</b> <b>handle</b> {{could be}} {{unscrewed}} completely {{to remove the}} cylinder, which could then be replaced with a fresh one.
