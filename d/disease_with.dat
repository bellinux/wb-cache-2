30|$|Stigma {{related to}} podoconiosis can be {{compared}} with that related to communicable and non-communicable <b>diseases</b> <b>with</b> obvious physical manifestations. Podoconiosis-related stigma also intersects with that related to <b>diseases</b> <b>with</b> concealed attributes such as HIV/AIDS through the deeply rooted misconceptions related to its cause, transmission and prevention mechanisms. However, {{in contrast to a}} number of <b>diseases</b> <b>with</b> stigmatizing attributes such as leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, obesity, mental illness, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS (Van Brakel 2006; Heijnders and Van Der Meij 2006), very little research has been performed into the extent of stigma related to podoconiosis.|$|R
5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's <b>disease</b> <b>with</b> {{a careful}} medical history and neurological examination. People {{may be given}} levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping to confirm the PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the clinical presentation be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|A {{subgroup}} of solar urticaria, fixed solar urticaria, {{has also been}} identified. It is a rare, less intense form of the <b>disease</b> <b>with</b> wheals (swollen areas of the skin) that affect certain, fixed areas of the body. Fixed solar urticaria is induced by {{a broad spectrum of}} radiative energy with wavelengths ranging from 300–700nm.|$|E
5|$|Chronic copper {{toxicity}} {{does not}} normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion.

5|$|Distortion in the molars is {{the most}} common health problem found in woolly mammoth fossils.

5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the <b>disease</b> <b>with</b> their own work.|$|E

5|$|Rinderpest, {{which is}} caused by a virus closely related to measles virus, is a disease of cattle known since Roman times. The disease, which {{originated}} in Asia, was first brought to Europe by the invading Huns in 370. Later invasions of Mongols, led by Genghis Khan and his army, started pandemics in Europe in 1222, 1233 and 1238. The infection subsequently reached England following the importation of cattle from the continent. At the time rinderpest was a devastating <b>disease</b> <b>with</b> a mortality rate of 80–90%. The resulting loss of cattle caused famine.|$|E

5|$|The lower esophageal sphincter, or {{gastroesophageal}} sphincter, {{surrounds the}} lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach. It is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal , which causes heartburn and if it happens often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux <b>disease,</b> <b>with</b> damage of the esophageal mucosa.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} {{clinical}} forms of smallpox. Variola major was the severe and most common form, {{with a more}} extensive rash and higher fever. Variola minor was a less common presentation, and a much less severe <b>disease,</b> <b>with</b> historical death rates of 1 percent or less. Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common. In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons. This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by virus isolation.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the signficance of LP-X in the hepato-biliary diseases.

Incidence of LP-X in the biliary <b>diseases</b> <b>with</b> extrahepatic cholestrains was higher than it in the liver <b>diseases</b> <b>with</b> intrahepatic cholestasis. 3) Results of liver function test and histological examination indicated that qualitative fetermination of LP-X in patients with jaundice was specific for diagnosis of cholestasis. 3) The quantitative determination of LP-X seemed to be useful to differential diagnosis between intra and extrahepatic cholestasis...|$|R

5|$|To {{regain his}} strength, Edwards {{and his wife}} took a {{carriage}} to a rustic cottage refuge in Arkville in the Catskill Mountains but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement.

Edwards died at home at 185 East 116th Street in East Harlem late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.|$|E

The official {{cause of death was}} “Bright’s <b>Disease</b> <b>with</b> Uremic Blood Poisoning.” The news of Kalākaua's death did not reach Hawaii until January 29 when the Charleston returned to Honolulu with the remains of the king.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe <b>disease</b> <b>with</b> poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E
