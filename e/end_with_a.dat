5|$|Also like Bewick, many {{articles}} <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tail-piece, a small engraving, {{but here}} again Yarrell shows {{himself to be}} both more serious and less merely decorative than Bewick, with more information to impart. The Egyptian vulture article ends with a large and accurate engraving of another specimen, so the article shows both a young and an old bird, with clearly different plumage which is also described in the text.|$|E
5|$|City went {{another two}} weeks before playing again when their FA Cup run came to an <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2–1 defeat at their fellow Second Division side Chesterfield in the fourth {{qualifying}} round. They returned to league action on 21 November against Bolton Wanderers, nearly a month since their win against Barnsley. Drain, who had scored on his debut against Barnsley, scored Bradford's first ever hat-trick, but the game finished in a 3–3 draw. A week later, Drain scored for the third successive league match but City lost 3–2 to Burnley.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Bryan {{defeated}} Triple H in {{the first}} match on the main show {{to qualify for the}} triple threat main event match, where he defeated Batista and defending champion Randy Orton to become the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion. The event was also notable for The Undertaker's 21–0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania coming to an <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> loss to Brock Lesnar. The WWE Divas Championship was the other title defended on the main show, its only defense at WrestleMania, while the WWE Tag Team Championship was defended on the pre-show.|$|E
5|$|His films also {{typically}} <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> death, {{which is}} portrayed {{not as a}} tragedy, but as a happy moving on where the deceased looks down happily at the world below. Between Heaven and Earth ends with a birth, but it is similarly handled the passing of a character into a new world. This pattern is continued in Mr. Nobody, where two deaths open the film and a unique twist on death {{at the end of}} the film conveys a wistful sense of happiness.|$|E
5|$|However, Australia's {{winning run}} {{came to an}} <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 30-run loss in the fifth Test, with Woodfull scoring 22 and 18. He ended the series with a modest 204 runs at 34.00 as Australia won 4–1. He ended the summer with 477 runs at 47.70.|$|E
50|$|Short pieces may stay in {{a single}} key throughout. A typical pattern for a simple song might be as follows: <b>a</b> phrase <b>ends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cadence on the tonic, <b>a</b> second phrase <b>ends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> half cadence, then a final, longer, phrase <b>ends</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{authentic}} cadence on the tonic.|$|R
50|$|The Broncos {{began the}} second half <b>with</b> <b>a</b> drive that <b>ended</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> missed 50-yard field goal.

The Broncos responded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> drive <b>ending</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. They then attempted {{to tie the game}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> two-point conversion but failed <b>with</b> <b>an</b> incomplete pass to Javon Walker.|$|R

5|$|If none of {{the contestants}} in a quarter-final or semi-final game <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{positive}} score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.

5|$|In 1751, Francis Blomefield, in his Collectanea Cantabrigiensia, {{recorded}} StJames' {{as having}} a square tower, with four bells and a clock.

At this time, the south aisle, nave and chancel were also recorded as leaded.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 a Suffrage Pilgrimage was organised, to <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{rally in}} Hyde Park, London on 26 July. It {{was an attempt}} to remind the public of the larger {{constitutional}} and non-militant wing of the movement, and routes were planned from 17 British towns and cities, including Wales. Twenty-eight members from Welsh NUWSS branches left from Bangor on 2 July travelling through Wales where they were met with both support and hostility. A further branch left Cardiff on 7 July.|$|E

If the first number <b>ends</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> 8, 9, or 0, another number may be drawn as there are no numbers starting <b>with</b> <b>an</b> 8 or 9 and only 9 numbers starting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 0. Some halls will also redraw <b>a</b> number <b>ending</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 7 as there are only six numbers beginning <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 7.|$|R

50|$|In Estonian, the genitive marker -n has elided {{with respect}} to Finnish. Thus, the genitive always <b>ends</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel, and the {{singular}} genitive is sometimes (in a subset of words <b>ending</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vocal in nominative) identical in form to nominative.|$|R
5|$|The {{peptide bond}} has two {{resonance}} forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, {{so that the}} alpha carbons are roughly coplanar. The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. The <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> free amino group {{is known as the}} N-terminus or amino terminus, whereas the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus (the sequence of the protein is written from N-terminus to C-terminus, from left to right).|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's run of 49 league games unbeaten {{came to an}} <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 {{defeat at}} Manchester United on 24 October 2004. The team under Wenger's {{management}} enjoyed another relatively strong league campaign in 2004–05, but finished second to Chelsea, who ended the season 12 points in front. Consolation again came in the FA Cup; Arsenal defeated Manchester United on penalties, after a goalless final. The emergence of Cesc Fàbregas {{in the starting lineup}} prompted Wenger to sell Vieira to Juventus in July 2005. He noticed the two as a midfield pairing was ineffective, and felt keeping Fàbregas would benefit the club's future. The 2005–06 season marked the beginning of a transitional period for Arsenal as it was the club's final season at Highbury. The team finished fourth in the Premier League and outside the top two for the first time under Wenger's tenure. In Europe, however, Wenger assembled an inexperienced defence that beat Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal and conceded no goals in the knockout stages of the Champions League. They progressed to the final in May 2006, but ended the competition as runners-up to Barcelona.|$|E

5|$|Because male-female {{relationships}} are inherently unequal in her society, Wollstonecraft endeavours {{to formulate a}} new kind of friendship in The Wrongs of Woman: motherhood and sisterhood. It is Maria's pathetic story regarding the kidnapping of her child that first interests Jemima in her plight. The novel fragments also suggest that the tale might not <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> marriage, but rather with the creation of {{a new kind of}} family, one constituted by two mothers for Maria's child. With Jemima's rescue of Maria, Wollstonecraft appears to reject the traditional romantic plot and invent a new one, necessitated by the failure of society to grant women their natural rights.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{pay-per-view}} {{focused on}} the tournament, few major feuds were highlighted. Aside from Owen Hart, the tournament did not figure prominently into the future storylines {{of any of the}} other participants. The qualifying match between the 1–2–3 Kid and Adam Bomb did, however, help advance a storyline. Bomb and Kwang, both managed by Harvey Wippleman, began feuding shortly after King of the Ring when Wippleman and Kwang turned on Bomb. Bomb began wrestling as a face as a result. Their feud did not <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> major blow off match, however. Instead, it was quietly resolved in a dark match prior to the SummerSlam 1994 broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Bovidae have {{featured}} in stories {{since at least}} the time of Aesop's fables from Ancient Greece around 600 BC. Fables by Aesop include The Crow and the Sheep, The Frog and the Ox, and The Wolf and the Lamb. The mythological creature Chimera, depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat arising from its back, and a tail that might <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> snake's head, was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. The sheep, synonymous with the goat in Chinese mythology, is the eighth animal of the Chinese zodiac, and a symbol of filial piety.|$|E

5|$|Bradford's run {{without a}} league victory {{extended}} to eight games after a 2–1 defeat to Brentford. The run, which stretched back to 15 September {{came to an}} <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2–1 win over Chester City on 6 November 2007 when Alex Rhodes scored his first goal for the club. City again defeated Chester City four days later, {{this time in the}} FA Cup, when Peter Thorne's first goal for the club secured a 1–0 win. City won their third game in a row with a 4–1 victory over Dagenham & Redbridgetheir highest victory of the season, before the month ended with a 1–1 draw against Stockport County.|$|E
5|$|Columbus started March with a 2–0 shutout {{against the}} Colorado Avalanche. They {{proceeded}} {{to win their}} next game against the Phoenix Coyotes 5–2, which {{marked the first time}} that the Blue Jackets posted back-to-back regulation victories during the season. Columbus again defeated the Coyotes three days later to earn their first three-game win streak of the season. They extended the streak to four with a win over the Los Angeles Kings before it came to an <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 4–1 loss to the St. Louis Blues. It was the only four-game win streak of the season for the Blue Jackets. They immediately matched their four-game win streak with a four-game losing streak and with ten games remaining, the Blue Jackets were the first team eliminated from playoff contention. Shortly after being eliminated, they were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers 6–3; the loss clinched last place in the NHL for Columbus. It was the first time in franchise history the Blue Jackets finished in 30th place.|$|E
5|$|Greys Anatomy {{follows the}} lives of {{surgical}} interns and residents at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, {{with the help of}} their competent mentors. Every installment, typically, commences with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the theme of the episode. Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field. The season will always <b>end</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> finale, typically involving a tragic event such as a death or character departure. Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show puts an emphasis on their personal, rather than professional, lives. The series sets aside medical ethic concerns to focus on character development and relationships. Although the physicians treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, their primary motivation is customarily praise and competition.|$|E
