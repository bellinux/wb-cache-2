5|$|A {{study in}} 2000 {{found that the}} genetic {{distance}} between jackdaws {{and the other members}} of Corvus was greater than that within the rest of the genus. This led Pamela Rasmussen to reinstate the genus name Coloeus, created by Johann Kaup in 1829, in her Birds of South Asia (2005), a treatment also used in a 1982 systematic list in German by Hans Edmund Wolters. A study of corvid phylogeny undertaken in 2007 compared DNA sequences in the mitochondrial control region of several corvids. It found that the western jackdaw, and the closely related <b>Daurian</b> <b>jackdaw</b> (C.dauuricus) of eastern Russia and China, were basal to the core Corvus clade. The names Coloeusmonedula and Coloeusdauuricus have since been adopted by the International Ornithological Congress in their official list. The two species of jackdaw have been reported to hybridise in the Altai Mountains, southern Siberia, and Mongolia. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of specimens of the two species from their core ranges show them to be genetically distinct.|$|E
5|$|Within its range, {{the western}} jackdaw is unmistakable; its short bill and grey nape are {{distinguishing}} features. From a distance, {{it can be}} confused with a rook (Corvus frugilegus), or when in flight, with a pigeon or chough. Flying western jackdaws are distinguishable from other corvids by their smaller size, faster and deeper wingbeats and proportionately narrower and less fingered wing tips. They also have shorter, thicker necks, much shorter bills and frequently fly in tighter flocks. They can be distinguished from choughs by their uniformly grey underwings and their black beaks and legs. The western jackdaw is very similar in morphology, behaviour, and calls to the <b>Daurian</b> <b>jackdaw,</b> with which its range overlaps in western Asia. Adults are readily distinguished, since the Daurian has a pied plumage, but immature birds are much more similar, both species having dark plumage and dark eyes. The Daurian tends to be darker, with a less contrasting nape than the Western.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Daurian</b> <b>jackdaw</b> (Corvus dauuricus) is {{a bird in}} {{the crow}} family, Corvidae. It {{is closely related to}} the western jackdaw. The name derives from the Dauria region of eastern Russia.|$|E
50|$|It {{is about}} the same size as or {{slightly}} smaller (32 cm in length) than the western jackdaw, with the same proportions and identical habits. The principal difference lies in the plumage; many but not all adults have large areas of creamy white on the lower parts extending up around the neck as a broad collar. The head, throat, wings, and tail are glossy black and the ear coverts are grizzled grey. Darker adults and young birds resemble western <b>jackdaws,</b> though <b>Daurian</b> <b>jackdaws</b> have black irises, unlike the distinctive grey-white irises of the Eurasian jackdaw. The only other pied corvid species inhabiting the same region is the Chinese collared crow (Corvus torquatus) but as this is a much larger bird (about the same size or slightly larger than the carrion crow) confusion is unlikely to occur.|$|R
5000|$|Shishido {{was given}} the name Kavka for her stage name by copy editor Junpei Watanabe. Shishido always wore black, {{reminding}} him of a crow. He picked the Czech word , which refers to the <b>daurian</b> <b>jackdaw.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{species are}} the western jackdaw (Corvus monedula), which breeds in the British Isles and western Europe, Scandinavia, {{northern}} Asia and Northern Africa, and its eastern counterpart, the <b>Daurian</b> <b>jackdaw</b> (Corvus dauuricus), found from eastern Europe to Japan. The eastern species {{is smaller than}} the Jackdaw, and in the adult the pale areas of the plumage are almost white, whereas in the western bird these areas are pale grey. The iris is pale in Jackdaw and dark in <b>Daurian</b> <b>Jackdaw.</b> The two species are otherwise very similar in shape, calls, and behaviour. There is an argument for lumping the subgenus members as one species, {{but they do not}} interbreed where their ranges meet in Mongolia.|$|E
50|$|The {{region has}} given {{its name to}} various animal species {{including}} Daurian hedgehog, and the following birds: Asian brown flycatcher (Muscicapa daurica), <b>Daurian</b> <b>jackdaw,</b> Daurian partridge, Daurian redstart, Daurian starling, Daurian shrike and the red-rumped swallow (Hirundo daurica). The Mongolian wild ass (Equus hemionus hemionus) is regionally extinct from the region.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Daurian</b> <b>jackdaw</b> {{ranges from}} the {{southern}} part of eastern Siberia, south to Mongolia and throughout much of China. In the north of its range it migrates further south during the winter. It is a scarce winter visitor to Korea, a rare annual winter visitor to Japan, and a vagrant to Taiwan. There are a few records from Western Europe. It inhabits open woodland, river valleys, and open hills and mountains.|$|E
