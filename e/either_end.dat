5|$|At {{the final}} whistle, Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola offered his commiserations {{to each of}} Manchester United's players, while former Manchester United defender Gerard Piqué talked with his {{erstwhile}} teammates. Both teams then retreated to <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of the stadium to applaud their fans.|$|E
5|$|No light armor {{was fitted}} above the main belt or at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of the ship. This made Texas highly {{vulnerable}} to rapid-fire guns using high-explosive shells. This {{was not considered}} a significant threat at the time Texas was designed but would become so within a few years.|$|E
50|$|The {{platforms}} have beige windscreens {{and brown}} canopies with green frames at their center and waist-high black steel fences at <b>either</b> <b>ends.</b> They are offset as the Manhattan-bound platform {{is more to}} the north than the Coney Island-bound one and both have electrical distribution rooms at <b>either</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ascospores are {{ellipsoidal}} in shape, hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, with {{dimensions of}} 17–22 by 7–9µm. They are also biguttulate, containing two large oil droplets at <b>either</b> <b>end.</b> The spore-producing cells, the asci, are roughly cylindrical, eight-spored, operculate (opening by an apical lid to discharge the spores) and have dimensions of 200–350 by 12–17|µm. The {{diameter of the}} club-shaped paraphyses is 7–10µm at the apex.|$|E
5|$|Both {{platforms}} have concrete windscreens on <b>either</b> <b>end</b> {{and steel}} canopies at the portions underneath the center station building. The platforms are offset, with the southbound platform extending {{slightly to the}} north, and the northbound platform extending slightly further south. An elevator {{and a set of}} staircases and escalators from each subway platform go up to the shared fare control.|$|E

5|$|It {{should be}} borne {{in mind that}} the {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections at <b>either</b> <b>end,</b> which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become, since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections.|$|E
5|$|M-34 was {{designated}} and {{signed with the}} beginning of the state highway system around July1, 1919, along a route that extended to <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of its current routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, shortening M-34 to roughly its current length. A few more changes were made in the mid-1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, Connector 34, which is better known as Industrial Drive in the Adrian area.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads {{on their hands}} and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In {{order to provide}} more space, he added blocks at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of the frontage, and galleried wings {{on either side of}} the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.|$|E
5|$|The current three vessels {{were built}} in Dundee in 1963 by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to replace the paddle steamers, and were each named after {{prominent}} local politicians: John Burns, Ernest Bevin and James Newman (Newman was mayor of Woolwich, 1923–25). These ferries feature Voith-Schneider propulsion systems for manoeuvrability. A cycloidal propeller is fitted centrally at <b>either</b> <b>end,</b> and each is driven by a 500bhp 7-cylinder Mirrlees National diesel engine. In 2014 Transport for London introduced an Art On The River scheme, showing decorative artwork on the ferry vessels.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was built}} in the 1850s as part of the Opeongo and Ottawa Colonization Road, {{providing}} access to Renfrew County for settlement in the Opeongo Hills. However, it did not become a provincial highway until 1956. Aside from the change in number of the highways at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of the route, the route has remained the same since then.|$|E

5|$|The lack of armour on {{both ends}} of the design sparked controversy: after the former Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy Edward James Reed visited the ships under construction, he criticized this {{particular}} design feature, arguing that in case of damage to <b>either</b> <b>end</b> the entering water would have compromised the stability; the new Italian Minister of the Navy, Simone Pacoret di Saint-Bon, replied during a Parliament session that such an event was very unlikely, as it could happen only if all the bulkeads of the watertight compartments were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The older {{part of the}} brick-built hall {{consists}} of seven bays, over two floors. There are projecting bays at <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of the building, dressed with ashlar quoins. A central doorway is flanked with plain pilasters, also of ashlar. The roof is of a hipped design, with a central octagonal bellcote, topped by a small dome.|$|E
5|$|The {{pumping station}} {{operated}} continuously, providing {{water for the}} increasing traffic on the canal. Problems {{with the size of}} the water wheel, which was supported at <b>either</b> <b>end,</b> meant that the middle of the wheel sagged, putting strain on the bearings and stays. In the 1840s the trussing was changed from stays to tension rods to strengthen and lighten the wheel, along with improvements to the pumps. The changes to the wheel were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added dividing the wheel in two.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{configuration}} of the tracks on <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> of the station, trains can depart from any platform in any direction when necessary (mostly seen in peak time or disruptions).|$|R

5|$|The smooth spores {{are roughly}} elliptical, {{measuring}} 8–14 by 3–5μm; in maturity {{they have one}} cross-wall, and oil drops at <b>either</b> <b>end.</b> The asci (spore-bearing cells) measure 100–135 by 7–10μm. The paraphyses are shaped liked narrow cylinders with diameters up to 1.5μm, and have tips that are rounded or somewhat club-shaped. β-Carotene is the predominant pigment responsible for the yellow color of the fruit body.|$|E
5|$|After the US127 interchange, I-75 turns northward, {{and passes}} {{to the east}} of Grayling. There are a pair of {{interchanges}} on <b>either</b> <b>end</b> of town for BL I-75, and the southern one is a partial interchange; only northbound I-75 traffic may access the business loop and traffic entering the freeway may only access southbound I-75. There is no interchange further north for M-72; access to that highway is provided through the business loop. On the north side of Grayling, there is a full interchange for BL I-75/M-93 that provides the southbound I-75 connection to M-72 as well as access from both directions to the Hartwick Pines State Park.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered another seven Turboliner trainsets, {{which were}} {{delivered}} between 1976 and 1977. These were manufactured by Rohr Industries, and {{were known as}} RTL Turboliners. They {{were based on the}} earlier RTG series, but had American-style Janney couplers throughout and a different design of power car cab. The standard configuration of each set was five cars: power cars at <b>either</b> <b>end,</b> a food service car, and two coaches. In that configuration, each trainset could carry 264 passengers. At times, Amtrak operated Turboliners with an additional coach cut into the consist. These were the final gas turbine trainsets purchased by Amtrak; conventional diesel locomotive-hauled trains proved cheaper to operate.|$|E
50|$|The two big tanks Honnamanakere(formerly LakshmiSamudra) and Nachanahallikere(formerly KeshavaSamudra)situated at the <b>either</b> <b>ends</b> of {{the village}} also have {{historical}} importance.
