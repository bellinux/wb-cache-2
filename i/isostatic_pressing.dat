40|$|Intergranular {{pressure}} solution (IPS) is {{an important}} compaction and deformation mechanism in quartzose rocks, but the kinetics and rate-controlling process remain unclear. The aim {{of the present study}} is to test microphysical models for compaction creep by IPS against <b>isostatic</b> hot <b>pressing</b> experiments performed on quartz sand under conditions expected to favor pressure solution (confining pressure 300 MPa, pore water pressure 150 – 250 MPa, temperature 400 – 600 °C). Microstructural observations revealed widespread intergranular indentation features and confirmed that intergranular pressure solution was indeed the dominant deformation mechanism under the chosen conditions. For porosities down to 15 %, the mechanical data agree satisfactorily with a microphysical model incorporating a previously determined kinetic law for dissolution of loose granular quartz, suggesting that the rate-limiting mechanism of IPS was dissolution. The model also predicts IPS rates within one order of magnitude of those measured in previous experiments at 150 – 350 °C, and thus seem robust enough to model sandstone compaction in nature. Such applications may not be straightforward, however, as the present evidence for dissolution control implies that the compositional variability of natural pore fluids may strongly influence IPS rates in sandstones...|$|R

Titanate wasteform products we have developed or are developing are aimed at immobilization of: (a) tank wastes and sludges; (b) U-rich wastes from radioisotope production from reactor irradiation of UO 2 targets; (c) Al-rich wastes arising from reprocessing of Al-clad fuels; (d) 99 Tc; (e) high- Mo wastes arising from reprocessing of U-Mo fuels and (f) partitioned Cs-rich wastes. Other wasteforms include encapsulated zeolites or silica/alumina beads for immobilization of 129 I. Wasteform production techniques cover hot <b>isostatic</b> and uniaxial <b>pressing,</b> sintering, and cold-crucible melting. In addition, building on previous work on speciation and leach resistance of Cs in cementitious products, we are studying geopolymers.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a systematic study about ceramics made of zirconium oxide and titanium oxide (ZrO 2 -TiO 2) doped with tin oxide (SnO 2), strontium oxide (SrO 2) and niobium oxide (Nb 2 O 5). These ceramics {{can be applied}} as dielectric resonators in microwave systems for telecommunications. For a good microwave performance, these ceramics must reach some parameter values as high dielectric constant and high quality factor due to the dielectric losses. The ceramics were manufactured using suitable powder mixtures of ZrO 2 -TiO 2 with additions of 1 % of SnO 2, SrO 2 and Nb 2 O 5, resulting in four different kinds of samples for analysis. The samples were compacted by an uniaxial (190 MPa) and an <b>isostatic</b> (300 MPa) <b>pressing,</b> sintered at 1200 °C for 3 hours, characterized in the chemical compound formation using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and scanned for microstructure densification degree and grain distribution analysis in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).

40|$|Nuclear {{power is}} a popular and {{sustainable}} method to generate electricity. In order to increase the economic efficiency, {{it is possible to}} add dopants into nuclear fuel to increase the fuel burn-up. PuCrO 3 and PuAlO 3 have been demonstrated to be formed in UO 2 fuel because of the interaction of additives (Cr 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3) and Pu that is produced by neutron capture reactions. The formation of these phases will have impact on the properties of the waste form generated from the used fuel. Here, the thermophysical properties and radiation tolerance of these chromates and aluminates have been examined using Nd as a surrogate for Pu. In this project, two kinds of perovskite-type ceramic materials (NdCrO 3 and NdAlO 3) were investigated to simulate PuCrO 3 and PuAlO 3. They were prepared using co-precipitation followed by cold <b>isostatic</b> or uniaxial <b>pressing</b> and conventional sintering. Thereafter, heat capacity, thermal expansion and thermal diffusivity were measured to calculate the thermal conductivity of neodymium chromate and neodymium aluminate. Neodymium aluminate showed higher thermal conductivity than that of neodymium chromate. Ion beam irradiation using Au-ions and He-ions has been utilized to simulate the consequences of α-decay and the effects of irradiation on the structural and macroscopic properties have been investigated. Irradiation by Au-ions resulted in volume swelling, a loss in long-range order, a reduction in hardness for neodymium aluminate and an increase in hardness for neodymium chromate at fluences above 1014 Au-ions/cm 2. On the contrary, little effect on the materials properties was observed for samples irradiated with He-ions up to a fluence of 1017 ions/cm 2. In summary, the thermal conductivity of neodymium chromate and neodymium aluminate were investigated. The radiation tolerance of these two kinds of ceramic materials were also studied. The results indicated that the presence of plutonium chromate and plutonium aluminate may have significant impact on the properties of used uranium dioxide fuel...|$|R
40|$|Molybdenum disilicide is a {{promising}} candidate material for high temperature structural uses. However, its room-temperature toughness is rather low {{and has to}} be improved. The objective of this thesis is to improve the fracture toughness of MoSi 2 by alloying and composite processes. The feasibility of toughening of MoSi 2 by crystal structure modification was studied. MoSi 2 -based alloys containing the transition metals Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, V, Ti and Nb were prepared by arc melting and characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). It is found that the alloying elements Cr, V, Ti and Nb exhibit a limited solubility in the C 11 b structure of MoSi 2, while Fe, Co, Ni show no detectable solubility. Alloying with the above elements leads to precipitation of second phases. In a Mo-Cr-Si alloy, for instance, the precipitated phase is the (Cr,Mo) Si 2 with a C 40 structure, and it has a certain orientation relationship with the C 11 b matrix. In contrast, the solubility of some alloying elements in Mo 5 Si 3 is relatively high, and this offers an opportunity for crystalline modification. In fact, {{it was found that the}} Fe substitution for Mo in Mo 5 Si 3 leads to a D 8 m -to-D 8 8 structure change. This study shows that the toughening of MoSi 2 can not be simply achieved by crystal structure modification, while Mo 5 Si 3 has a potential of structure modification. Toughening of MoSi 2 by composite processing was more successful. MoSi 2 -ZrO 2 composites were produced by a powder metallurgy (PM) process, using powders of mechanical alloyed MoSi 2, unstabilised zirconia (UZ) and ytteria partially stabilised zirconia (YPSZ). Zirconia phases present in UZ- and YPSZ-composites were identified to be m-ZrO 2 and t-ZrO 2, respectively. MoSi 2 -SiC in-situ composite was prepared by hot pressing of MoSi 2 and C powders. The SiC phase is formed through solid reaction of MoSi 2 and C during fabrication. The fracture toughness of MoSi 2 -ZrO 2 (UZ) and MoSi 2 -SiC composites was found to be 2. 4 and 1. 8 times higher than that of pure MoSi 2, respectively. Mechanisms responsible for the toughening have been suggested and discussed. The fracture behaviour of MoSi 2 base materials was also investigated by SEM, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The dominating fracture mode is transgranular for pure MoSi 2 and MoSi 2 + 0. 2 %B, a mixed mode of transgranular and intergranular for YPSZ-composite, and intergranular for UZ-composite. AES and ESCA analyses show that the grain boundaries of these materials are covered with a SiO 2 film. In pure MoSi 2, the thickness of the SiO 2 film is estimated to be 10 - 20 nm. The influence of the SiO 2 phase on the fracture behaviour of the materials was discussed. As a part of this work, reaction synthesis of MoSi 2 and other refractory disilicides was studied. Nearly full-density disilicides MoSi 2, NbSi 2 and TaSi 2 were produced by reactive <b>isostatic</b> hot <b>pressing</b> (HIPing) from the compacts of elemental powders. Main phases present in the HIPed materials were identified to be disilicides, but small amount of 5 : 3 silicides were also detected by EDS. The fracture toughness and fracture modes of the HIPed materials were also determined. This study shows that the reaction HIPing is an effective process to produce high-density refractory metal disilicides directly from pure components...|$|R

Die Betriebsparameter einer vorhandenen RSV-Anlage sollten den speziellen Erfordernissen der neuen Systeme angepasst werden und aus den Pulvern sollten supraleitfaehige Sinterproben hergestellt werden. Im Rahmen der Arbeiten gelang es rasch, das RSV soweit zu optimieren, dass die Herstellung groesserer Chargen (YBaCuO; BiSrCaCuO) im 10 kg-Massstab Routine wurde, was fuer die Entwicklungen zur Herstellung von Sinterteilen von Vorteil war. Als Formgebungsverfahren wurden Axial-, Isostat- und Heisspressen sowie Folientechnik eingesetzt. Alle Verfahren wurden soweit auf die Verarbeitung der Supraleiter abgestimmt, dass supraleitfaehige Bauteile hergestellt werden koennen.

The task was to modify an existing reaction spray equipment to the specific requirements of the intended system for powder preparation and subsequent fabrication of superconducting, sintered specimens.

All the techniques were designed so as to yield superconducting specimens suitable for fabricating superconducting component parts.
