Several examples, including improved integration of the digester and analyses of the whole mill, show that this is an approach that gives good guidance early in the design process.

40|$|Grinding {{plays an}} {{important}} role in many industries and is still poorly understood because of complicated breakage behaviour of particles in the process. The lack of understanding of particle breakage has prevented the development of the fundamental understandings of the grinding process. This work investigated the breakage behaviours of particles under different grinding conditions. Physical experiments and numerical simulations were conducted in two different types of mills: a variable speed <b>impact</b> <b>mill</b> and a horizontal stirred mill. The effects of material characteristics and operation conditions were investigated. For the variable speed <b>impact</b> <b>mill,</b> it is shown that particle shape has a strong effect on the breakage behaviour. The irregular shape particles experience different crack mechanisms comparing with the regular shape particles, leading to the variation in breakage ratio. The breakage ratio increases significantly as the impact energy increases. Multiple impact tests show that the complete breakage can be reached at low impact energy after multiple impactions. Two material properties, resistance to fracture f_mat and threshold fracture energy W_(m,min) which describe the grindability of the materials, can be determined by fitting method. The results show that they are inversely proportional to each other. For the horizontal stirred mill, it is shown that the mill rotation speed plays a crucial role in particle breakage. The relationship between the grinding rate K_p and impact energy E_i in horizontal stirred mill has been analysed and the results show it follows the power law. The study of the relationship between grinding rate K_p and time indicates that the kinetics of the grinding process in horizontal stirred mill is in first order. The effect of increasing of the grinding media size shows a better grinding performance but the cost of power consumption is considerable. The CFD-DEM simulations of particle flow patterns reach an acceptable agreement with experimental results. Therefore, the model can be used to predict the variation of flow patterns of particles in the grinding process in horizontal stirred mill...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{concrete}} {{is second}} only to water in terms of its quantities used, with around 10 billion tons of concrete required each year. More than 900 million tons of old concrete from demolition or renovation are generated per year in Europe, the US and Japan. To date, no commercially viable process has been developed to effectively recycle old concrete to generate new input materials for cement and concrete production. This problem arises from the fact that concrete is a composite material comprising the aggregate, such as gravel or limestone chippings, and a binder matrix (the cement paste). Mechanical processing equipment such as an <b>impact</b> <b>mill</b> or jaw crusher merely succeeds in milling the old concrete, but does not disintegrate it to separate its constituents.

As-milled and heat treated products were characterised using techniques of combustion analysis, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), selected area electron diffracton (SAED) and high resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HRTEM). Both the mechanisms of hydrogen uptake and of hydrogen evolution during subsequent heat treatment {{were found to be}} dependent on the mode of milling. Samples milled under a ball-particle impact mode absorbed more hydrogen (2. 7 wt%) than the samples milled under shearing mode, but the fraction of hydrogen released during subsequent low temperature heat treatment (220 - 500 ºC) was significantly less than for the samples milled under shear. XRD of the shear milled product showed increased, but varying c-axis lattice parameters while XRD of the <b>impact</b> <b>milled</b> product showed complete loss of (002) graphite and formation of peaks which could be associated with CnHx species. Low temperature heat treatment of the shear milled product resulted in significant disorder in the graphite structure, characterised by a loss of diffraction peak contrast and high background scattering in both XRD and selected area electron diffraction patterns. In contrast there was little change in XRD patterns from <b>impact</b> <b>milled</b> samples during low temperature heat treatment. For the shear milled samples which were heat treated for short times there was also an associated loss of contrast from graphene layers in HRTEM images, however, HRTEM contrast from samples shear milled and heat treated for longer times showed an increased fraction of graphene sheets in the product. It was concluded that hydrogen uptake under <b>impact</b> mode <b>milling</b> was predominately via an irreversible mechanism involving destruction of graphene sheets and reaction to from product including CnHx -type molecules.

Upgrading {{decreases}} transportation costs, increases storage capacity, and improves combustion properties. The intention of the present work {{was to investigate the}} effect of chemical characteristics and physical characteristics on processing, handling characteristics, combustion, and ash melting, using upgraded biofuels. The raw materials used was spring-harvested reed canary-grass (RCG) and wood residues (stemwood without bark). RCG with different ash contents was upgraded to briquettes and combustion experiments were done in a 180 kW boiler. RCG was found to be a suitable raw material for briquetting and variation in ash content did not affect the briquette quality. Combustion experiments showed that RCG can be burned with good result and the variation in ash content did not effect flue gas emissions. The ash formed during combustion showed a tendency to melt. Estimation of melting behaviour was done by ASTM fusion test, a bench scale fluidised-bed combustion test (5 kW), and by extracting melting behaviours from the ternary diagram SiO 2 -CaO-K 2 O. For RCG with low ash content (3 - 4 %), the tendency to melt was higher compared to RCG with high ash content (5 - 10 %). Wood powder cut in various <b>impact</b> <b>mills</b> and knife mills was characterised using sieve analysis, laser diffraction, image analysis, and a funnel method for measuring the tendency to bridge. The wood powder fuels were then combusted in a 150 kW powder burner to study emissions as a function of particle properties.

Image analysis showed that particle shapes differed between the two types of mills. The bridging tendency was higher for powder produced by <b>impact</b> <b>mills</b> than by knife mills. Combustion experiments showed that particle characteristics affected fuel feeding, ignition, unburned pollutants, furnace temperature, and content of unburned matter in ash.

40|$|Cork is {{a natural}} raw {{materials}} used in numerous traditional and innovative applications among which the most famous are cork stoppers, insulation boards, and wall and floor covering. Cork exhibits a relatively homogeneous honeycomb structure composed of polyhedron cells filled with gas, which gives its specific properties such as elasticity or hydrophobic behavior. Mechanical properties of cork have been studied from a long time. However, in many industrial applications cork is increasingly used as granulate (> 200 μm) or powder (< 200 μm) obtained by milling processes. By generating failure in the raw material, the comminution of cork could damage cells and induce modifications in the mechanical behavior of cork particles but {{the relation between the}} size of the particles and the mechanical properties of the packaging is still little known. In this study, we investigate the effect of cork particles size reduction on the mechanical properties of the packing. To this end, eighteen discrete size fractions of cork from 0 to 25 μm to 2. 5 – 3 mm, generated by <b>impact</b> <b>milling</b> were characterized in term of shape, loaded density, and elastic recovery.

Whilst standard methods for the assessment of the milling characteristics of coal exist, {{this is not the case}} for torreﬁed materials—whether in pellet form or not. The grindability of the fuel directly impacts the overall efﬁciency of the combustion process and as such it is an important parameter.

40|$|Varicose veins affect {{one third}} of adults. Complications of varicose veins can have {{detrimental}} effects on the patient’s quality of life. Morphological changes including intimal hyperplasia, smooth muscle cells hypertrophy or atrophy and irregularities of extracellular matrix contents have demarcated varicose from non-varicose veins. Some of the biological mechanisms behind these changes have been illustrated by the studies investigating the individual expressions of proteins (proteomic) and genes (transcriptomics). The evidence from these studies also suggests the role of abnormal cell metabolism in the development of varicose veins. However, both transcriptomic and proteomic approaches are not able to fully explain the irregularities of cell metabolism. Metabolic profiling of tissue and biological fluids using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) has the ability to elucidate irregular cell metabolic pathways and functions of genes and enzymes in disease pathogenesis. Metabolic profiling approaches are also used to identify toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of drugs. Aims To identify the metabolic profile of varicose veins as compared to non-varicose veins with an aim to promote our understanding of the disease pathogenesis. Methods Ethical approval was obtained from the local ethics committee. Firstly, a preliminary study was performed. Varicose veins (n= 8) were removed from patients following varicose vein surgery. Non-varicose veins were removed from patients following operations where there was a removal of vein involved {{as a part of the}} procedure. Non-varicose veins tissue retrieved included great saphenous vein (n= 8) from bypass or amputation. Facial veins (n= 5) during the carotid endarterectomy were also removed. Metabolic profile of the intact varicose and non-varicose veins tissues were measured using 1 D magic angle spinning (MAS) 1 H NMR (600). In order to develop the most optimal organic and aqueous extraction method for vein tissues, 11 grams of varicose vein tissues retrieved from different patients was mixed using mortar and pestle and cryogenic <b>impact</b> <b>mill</b> in liquid nitrogen producing a homogenous tissue mixture. In total, 70 samples were prepared from this homogenate each having a weight of 145 +/- 5 mg. For extraction of aqueous metabolites, 20 samples were treated with two different solvents concentrations: 10 samples with Water: Methanol (1 : 1), and 10 samples with Water: Methanol (3 : 1). For optimisation of organic metabolites, remaining 50 samples were extracted using 5 different organic solvents including dichloromethane, chloroform, isopropanol, hexane and ether. Each group had 10 samples or replicates. All aqueous and organic extracts were run on 1 H NMR (600 MHz). Organic extracts were analyzed on ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Ex-vivo rat inferior vena cava stretch experiment was performed in vascular research laboratory, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, US. Inferior vena cava of the male Sprague dowley rat (n= 5) was divided into 4 segments. Two out of these 4 segments were kept at a basal tension of 0. 5 gram for 4 and 18 hours and the remaining two were stretched with 2 grams weight for 4 and 18 hours in an organ culture bath. Aqueous extracts from rat IVC segments were analysed using H 1 NMR (800 MHz). Organic extracts were analyzed on ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Lastly, comprehensive profiling of human varicose veins (n= 80) and non-varicose veins (n= 35) tissue extracts was performed. The most optimal extraction method employed to extracts metabolites from human veins tissue was developed as mentioned earlier and the same extraction protocol was used to extracts metabolites from human veins tissues. Aqueous extracts were run on 1 H NMR (600 MHz). Organic extracts were analyzed on ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Spectra obtained from NMR for all experiments were mathematically modeled and statistically analyzed using chemomeric software including MATLAB and SIMCA. Metabolites were assigned using human metabolome databases and previous published reports. Metabolite identification was confirmed using 2 D NMR. UPLC-MS based profiling data was analysed using MassLynx version 4. 1 and SIMCA. UPLC-MS based metabolites were assigned using MS/MS experiment and with support databases including lipodomics and human metabolome database (HMDB). Pathway analysis was performed using ingenuity database and published reports. Multiple testing corrections using Benjamini Yakatieli method was performed to exclude false discovery rate in the data. Pathways analysis was performed using ingenuity and KEGG pathways databases. Results Magic angle spinning NMR analysis of intact vein tissues showed the presence of lipid metabolites at a higher concentration in the non-varicose vein group whilst creatine, lactate, myo-inositol, and glutamate metabolites were more characteristic of the varicose vein group. The orthogonal partial least square (OPLS) coefficient plot revealed that the differential abundance of creatine, myo-inositol and lactate was highly correlated to varicose vein group. Metabolic profiles of facial veins were also different from varicose veins. Abundance of lipids was also noticed in facial veins. The most optimal method for human veins tissue extraction was found to be the consecutive approach of metabolites extraction via first extraction of organic metabolites with MTBE: methanol (3 : 1) followed by methanol: water (1 : 1) in terms of reproducibility and sensitivity. Metabolic differences in rat IVC segments were observed between rat IVC segments stretch for 18 hrs as compared to non-stretched for 18 hrs. Metabolites including choline, valine and triglycerides were found in high concentrations in stretched for 18 hrs group as compared to non-stretched for 18 hrs. Comprehensive metabolic profiling of veins tissue extracts using two metabolomics analytical platforms (NMR and UPLC-MS) was determined. Both organic and aqueous metabolites were extracted from vein tissues using the most optimal extraction method developed above. Multivariate analysis of the NMR data from 80 varicose veins and 35 non-varicose veins showed glutamate, taurine and myo-inositol metabolites in higher concentration in varicose veins wall as compared to non-varicose veins wall. Multivariate analysis of the lipid metabolites revealed significantly increased concentrations of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) in varicose veins as compared to non-varicose veins. Pathway analysis based on online databases and published reports showed association of myo-inositol with intracellular pathways linked to cellular proliferation and PC and SM with induction of inflammatory response. Conclusions and Future Work This novel work demonstrates a comprehensive metabolic profile of human varicose veins with metabolites including PC, SM, myo-inositol, glutamate and taurine differentially associated with varicose veins. This work unravels new cellular pathways which should be the focus of future research and may enable us to understand disease pathogenesis in more details and identify therapeutic targets. Moreover, this work first time provides a comprehensive extraction methodology for human vein tissue metabolites extractions comprising of MTBE: methanol (3 : 1) followed by water: methanol (1 : 1). This work also showed that prolonged stretch of 18 hrs duration changes metabolic profile of rat IVC segments. Open Acces...|$|E

The {{effect of the}} different comminution protocols on sintered body microstructure was evaluated for high temperature sintering in inert atmosphere (N 2). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that NiO powder surface chemistry is surprisingly sensitive to milling additive choice. In particular, the proportion of powder surface defect sites varied with additive, and methanol left an alcohol or alkoxy residue even after drying. Upon sintering to intermediate temperatures (1100 °C), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that slurry milled NiO powders exhibit hindered sintering behaviors. This effect was amplified for NiO milled with methanol, in which sub- 500 nm grain sizes dominated even after sintering to 1100 °C. Upon heating to high temperatures (1500 °C), simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry/thermogravimetric analysis (DSC/TGA) showed that the powders containing carbon residues undergo carbothermal reduction, resulting in a melting transition between 1425 and 1454 °C. Taken together, the results demonstrated that when processing metal oxide powders for advanced ceramics, the choice of milling additive is crucial as it exerts significant control over sintered body microstructure.|$|R

40|$|The {{review and}} {{analysis}} presented here {{indicate that it}} is both economically desirable and technically feasible for the {{pulp and paper industry}} to use the best known and available controls and treatments to safeguard the nation's waters. Government environmental authorities have overestimated the negative economic <b>impact</b> of <b>mills</b> adopting the technologies necessary to control effluents; they have overestimated the degree to which Canadians benefit from what are intended as temporary concessions on discharge controls to protect employment and income. Perhaps even more important, environmental authorities have failed to take into account adequately the enormous costs they may be imposing on present and future generations of Canadians as a result of concessions to pulp and paper manufacturers. ...|$|R
40|$|Vibro-impact {{oscillators}} have {{moving parts}} colliding with either moving or stationary components, {{and are often}} found in engineering applications, as vibration hammers, driving machinery, <b>milling,</b> <b>impact</b> print hammers, and shock absorbers [1, 2]. The practical interest {{in the study of}} vibro-impact oscillators lies in both their desirable and undesirable effects. The former are the basis of their operation, like an impact hammer, whereas the latter can be exemplified b...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{characteristic}} {{of stainless steel}} material, its milling performance is analyzed. Milling force of 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti stainless steel was obtained with single-factor test of milling depth, line spacing, and feed per tooth on a CNC Milling Machine. An empirical model for the milling force of stainless steel was established by regression. The validity of the model is verified by comparing the model data with the experimental data. The <b>impact</b> of <b>milling</b> parameters on milling force is sorted in order of milling depth, feed per tooth and line space according to the exponents in the model. The conclusions have great help for the milling cutting tool’s design of stainless steel and the selection of milling parameters...|$|R
40|$|Poor aqueous {{solubility}} {{of drugs}} generally leads to low dissolution rates, poor therapeutic efficiency and low bioavailability. The main {{aim of this}} study was to produce physical dispersions of Nimesulide with polymers Eudragit EPO and Mannitol and then subject it for milling, to analyze the role played by different type and concentrations of polymers and the mechanism of <b>impact</b> and attrition <b>milling</b> in enhancing the solubility of the pure drug and its physical dispersions. Using ball milling technique the physical dispersions of Nimesulide with the polymers, prepared in the ratios of 1 : 1, 1 : 3, 1 : 5 were subjected to size reduction for two different time intervals of 30 min and 90 min, individually. Particle size, flow property and solubility of the milled dispersions were assessed and compared with the non milled dispersions and the pure drug. The milled dispersions were fabricated into tablets and the evaluation parameters like weight variation, disintegration time, hardness and dissolution studies were conducted on the prepared tablets. In order to observe the changes in the solid state at powder level and molecular level, the formulations were characterized by Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD). The results obtained show that the physical dispersions prepared by milling with Mannitol helped in increasing the dissolution rate of the drug. Key words: Eudragit EPO, <b>impact</b> attrition <b>milling,</b> mannitol, physical dispersio...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} new {{instruments}} Economies of scale {{play a major role}} in making new mining projects economically viable and this has led to increased equipment sizes. Although this has been particularly evident in the size of haulage trucks and shovels used in the mining operation, this phenomena has also filtered into the area of minerals processing and into milling in particular. SAG and ball mills have grown in size and there are now many operational mills in the range of 28 – 40 feet in diameter with installed powers ranging between 8 – 20 MW. The very high capacity of these mills and the common use of variable speed drives often result in operational problems. These problems are associated with high-energy <b>impacts</b> striking <b>mill</b> liners resulting in poor energy efficiency, as well as the fracture of steel balls, accelerate...|$|R
