Typically, they {{are dressed in}} a beef broth and a little melted butter or in a <b>fresh</b> <b>sage</b> and melted butter sauce, as a complex sauce would detract from the flavours in the agnolotti pockets. In both cases topped with Parmigiano Reggiano cheese but no cheese resides in the agnolotti. The dish is associated with Piedmont in Italy and {{is not to be}} confused with Piacenza's stuffed pasta pockets called 'Anolini'.|$|E
40|$|Background: Salvia Officinalis (sage) {{has been}} used for centuries as a {{medicinal}} plant. Recently, it has become the centre of research as a natural memory enhancer of particular interest for treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease. It is also known that it contains polyphenols which have strong antioxidant effects and can be used to present cardiovascular disease. However it is not known whether the effects of sage can have prolonged beneficial effects. Aims/Objectives: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of <b>fresh</b> <b>sage</b> tincture on cognitive function on university students aged 18 - 30 via the use of three cognitive tests, the Stroop (colour word) task, and immediate word recall and number sequence test. Vascular function was also assessed via Pulse Wave Velocity, Augmentation Index, blood pressure and height and weight. Methods: Eight participants were recruited (aged 18 - 30) and received <b>fresh</b> <b>sage</b> tablets (Menoforce® 51 g tablets) which of they were to take one daily for 14 days. Assessment of cognitive function involved the three cognitive tests that assessed different aspects of memory at study days 0, 1, 7 and 14. Height and weight were measured before cardiovascular parameters which were also measured on study days which included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, pulse wave velocity and augmentation index. The results were then statistically analysed. Results: Sage significantly reduced time taken to complete Stroop (colour word) test (p< 0. 05) with further effects seen on the number sequence test where the length of numbers remembered over time increases although not significantly. Decreases were seen in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse wave velocity. Trends in augmentation index and heart rate seem to be very similar as the both increase and decrease at the same points. Conclusion: The findings of the study do support previous results that Salvia Officinalis can work significantly as a memory enhancer on processing memory long term, with further effects seen on working memory. Polyphenol content may be what contributes to a reduction in Pulse Wave Velocity, Augmentation Index, Blood Pressure and Heart Rate. There could be many mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of sage, so further studies should be aimed at what constitutes in particular are causing the cognitive enhancing effects and the improvement in vascular function.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} effect of aqueous extracts of dried sage (Salvia officinalis L.) in concentrations of 2 %, 5 % and 10 %, and the fresh parts of the plant in concentrations of 10 %, 20 % and 30 % on the feeding of Sitona lineatus L. on the broad bean (Vicia faba L.) leaves. The olfactometry response of the pest (response to olfactory stimuli) was also determined in relation to the sage. Extracts of dry and fresh parts of sage reveal the inhibitory effect on feeding of both males and females of pea leaf weevil, the stronger, the higher their concentrations, however, no apparent differences were registered between the analysed sexes. Dry plant extracts in 10 % concentrations and 30 % extracts of <b>fresh</b> <b>sage</b> parts caused 2 – 3 time reduction of Sitona lineatus feeding after 4 days of {{the experiment}}. An apparent repellent response of aroma substances originating from sage towards weevil beetles (both males and females) was registered, which suggests potential applications of this plant as a neighbouring plant in mixed stands or, e. g., as a component of border belts...|$|E

60|$|No dust or heat next morning! The desert floor {{appeared}} {{clean and}} damp, with <b>fresh</b> gray <b>sage</b> and shining bunches of cedar. We {{climbed into the}} high cedars, {{and then to the}} piñons, and then to the junipers and pines. Climbing so out of desert to forestland was a gradual and accumulating joy to me. What contrast in vegetation, in air, in color! Still the forest consisted of small trees. Not until next day did we climb farther to the deepening, darkening forest, and at last to the silver spruce. That camp, the fifth night out, was beside a lake of surface water, where we had our first big camp-fire.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the chemical composition of the essential oil from <b>fresh</b> leaves of <b>sage</b> (Salvia officinalis L.) from Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro State, for international trade. The oil was isolated by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus and analyzed through a combination of GC-FID and GC-MS. The yield was 2. 3 % on dry basis. Forty-seven constituents were identified according to their chromatographic retention indices and mass spectra, corresponding to 94. 90 % of the compounds present. The major constituents of the oil were &# 945;-thujone (40. 90 %), camphor (26. 12 %), &# 945;-pinene (5. 85 %) and &# 946;-thujone (5. 62 %). The essential oil studied was similar to those found in several European countries and can be a valuable product for the small farmers from the Petrópolis region in Rio de Janeiro State...|$|R
5000|$|The flocks {{still come}} down to you, o Clitumnus, from the far {{mountains}} that move with the murmur of breeze-swept ash groves and <b>fresh</b> scent of <b>sage</b> and thyme in the damps of evening. The young Umbrian shepherd immerses his reluctant sheep in your waters. By a farmhouse a barefoot mother sits and sings, nursing her child, who looks to the shepherd and smiles. The pensive father with goatish hair, at his painted cart, turns on his hips like the beasts of old, with {{the strength of a}} young bull, like those square of breast, erect and crowned by crescent horns, sweet in their eyes and snow-white, much beloved by gentle Virgil. The darkening clouds hang like smoke on the Apennines: grand, austere and green from the spreading mountains, Umbria watches. Hail, green Umbria, and you the fount of god Clitumnus. I feel in my heart the ancient home, my fevered brow touched by the olden gods of Italy.|$|R
60|$|Slone {{was packed}} and saddled {{and on his}} way before the sun reddened the canyon wall. He walked the horses. From time to time he saw signs of Wildfire's {{consistent}} progress. The canyon narrowed and the walls grew lower and the grass increased. There was a decided ascent all the time. Slone could find {{no evidence that the}} canyon had ever been traveled by hunters or Indians. The day was pleasant and warm and still. Every once in a while a little breath of wind would bring a fragrance of cedar and pinyon, and a sweet hint of pine and sage. At every turn he looked ahead, expecting to see the green of pine and the gray of sage. Toward the middle of the afternoon, coming to a place where Wildfire had taken to a trot, he put Nagger to that gait, and by sundown had worked up to where the canyon was only a shallow ravine. And finally it turned once more, to lose itself in a level where straggling pines stood high above the cedars, and great, dark-green silver spruces stood above the pines. And here were patches of <b>sage,</b> <b>fresh</b> and pungent, and long reaches of bleached grass. It was the edge of a forest. Wildfire's trail went on. Slone came at length to a group of pines, and here he found the remains of a camp-fire, and some flint arrow-heads. Indians had been in there, probably having come from the opposite direction to Slone's. This encouraged him, for where Indians could hunt so could he. Soon he was entering a forest where cedars and pinyons and pines began to grow thickly. Presently he came upon a faintly defined trail, just a dim, dark line even to an experienced eye. But it was a trail, and Wildfire had taken it.|$|R
