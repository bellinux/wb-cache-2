The lambs were fed pelletted diets containing alternatively: a) soybean b) faba bean; c) lupin or d) pea. Lambs fed the faba bean diet showed the greatest slaughter weight {{and a better}} carcass conformation; however, the carcasses were significantly fatter than those obtained from soybean fed lambs. The protein source {{did not affect the}} incidence of the different meat cuts of the half carcass with exception for the loin, that was higher in lambs fed with pea in comparison with those fed the lupin and soybean diets.

Introduction: One of the {{greatest}} problems confronting the American people of to-day is the food supply. In the United States we consume something like 14, 000, 000 tons of grain as human food and about 6, 000, 000 tons of beef annually. The amount of beef consumed annually by each person in the U. S. amounts to about 150 pounds. Every pound of beef produced by a choice feeder is worth from one to three cents more {{than that of the}} scrub. As to the time of year to feed, men differ. Many of our largest cattle feeders claim they cannot afford to feed during the winter months, as it requires more feed per pound of gain. The question of shelter and yards is very important. At the Experiment Station of Kansas there was a saving of 12 per cent in cost of feed, on steers well cared for, as compared with those that had but poor shelter and care. An experiment, the average of which out of 100 hogs in winter and 99 in summer, shoes a saving of 11 per cent in favor of summer feeding. Corn will perhaps even hold its place as the chief <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> stock and especially cattle and hogs. It is safe to <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> either grass or dry-lot feeding. In the feeding experiments of the Kansas Station they have been unable to find any combination of feeds that will equal corn and cob meal and good alfalfa hay. It takes all the way from 400 to 1500 pounds of feed to produce a hundred pounds of gain, the amount depending on the kinds of feed used and the length of the feeding period. From a fat-stock show record, the cost of gain is given as $ 4. 03 for calves, $ 7. 98 for yearlings, and $ 12. 54 for two-year-olds. The amount of grain required...|$|R

30|$|Interestingly, {{transfer}} {{studies on}} dairy cows and fattening pigs showed a different behaviour of PFAAs regarding partitioning to blood plasma, liver and edible tissues [1, 2]. Both species {{were exposed to}} PFAAs of different chain-length through the same naturally contaminated hay. Although there was an ad libitum feeding of PFAA-contaminated hay for dairy cows (app. 14  % of diet) and a restrictive feeding of a PFAA-hay containing pelleted <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> pigs (app. 17  % of diet), {{the results of the}} percent of PFAAs accumulation in the estimated mass of tissues are well comparable and indicate different toxicokinetics in both species. The results showed that PFBS and PFOA had no tendency of accumulation in blood plasma of dairy cows compared to PFHxS and PFOS, while the affinity for blood plasma were evenly high for all PFAAs in fattening pigs. Considering the PFAA accumulation in edible tissue, similar amounts of all examined PFAAs (40 – 49  %) were found in the meat of fattening pigs. This was in particular contrast to the different amounts of PFOS (43  %), PFOA (< 1  %) and PFBS (< 0.001  %) in the muscle tissues of the dairy cows [1, 2]. Furthermore, excretion of PFBS and PFOA via milk throughout the feeding study was very low (< 1  %) and cannot explain the low affinity for muscle in dairy cows. Because of the different findings, it was assumed that the difference of toxikokinetics in ruminants and monogastrics might be the consequence of their species-specific digestive system. The hypothesis was put forth that the microbial fermentation in rumen of bovine species might have an effect on PFAA recovery. It was posited that ruminal MOs may have effects on PFAA degradation because numerous studies in ruminants with other undesirable substances in feed, such as secondary plant compounds, mycotoxins, but also antibiotics have demonstrated the capacity of ruminal microorganisms to degrade potentially toxic compounds and thus protecting the host from detrimental effects [34 – 36]. Overall, MOs in the rumen are presumed to have an unexpectedly high capacity to degrade or transform fluorinated compounds.|$|R

To stop the alkaline reaction and carry out protein enrichment in the bagasse, a honey solution was added along with 2. 0 % of urea. Another protein supplement was generated using a mycelial byproduct of microbial transglutaminase enzyme, Maralfalfa grasses (Pennisetum sp) and a mixture of minerals accompanied by a certain quantity of freshly ground sugarcane. The formulations obtained {{in the course of}} the research were evaluated both comparatively and analytically and their respective levels of increasing digestibility and this was done by conducting digestibility tests in vitro. Similarly, the content of protein, minerals, moisture percentage, crude fiber, acid detergent fiber, nitrogen free extract, ash and lignin were determined. To carry out the physical characterization of integral bagasse fibers and its post-processing, different techniques were used, i. e. : a) X-Ray Diffraction b) infrared Spectroscopy by Fourier Transform, c) Scanning Electron Microscopy, d) Laser Scanning confocal Microscopy, e) X-Ray Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy f) Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. And to formulate the feed, the Pearson square and CONFOR software were used. Additionally, a mathematical model to assess daily gain was developed, and the increase in weight was evaluated for a period of 100 days, and this showed a greater daily weight gain in cattle fed with the final formulation (BPS). In accordance with the results obtained through DRX, FTIR, MEB AND MCBL techniques, it was possible to strengthen the increase in digestibility through the alkaline process. As part of the research, a technological process of production for a typical modular plant with a capacity of 30 t / d in one shift of 8 hrs was developed. This process was subjected to a preliminary technical and economic analysis which demonstrated the economic benefits of the production of such feed; it revealed that within less than five months, the investor could gain back his/her capital. Based on the above, the results obtained in the research could undoubtedly be rewarding on the market. It’s worth mentioning that the development cost of this feed falls in the same range as the current bovine feed prices on the market. This research aimed to help find a solution to one of the most pressing problems faced by the Mexican agricultural sector, the production of animal <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> cattle that would be in line with technical and economical feasibility...|$|R

40|$|Development of {{a native}} swine raising model, base on Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, {{emphasized}} the participatory approach of stakeholders. The areas and target population were purposively chosen from Ban Si Liam Yai, Lam Plaimas district, Buriram province and Ban Lak Sip-kao, Champasak, Lao PDR. The model was constructed by employing various tools such as observation, interview, A-I-C technique, study tours, SWOT analysis and experiment. The CRD was used with three treatments of protein levels in feed and four replications ineach treatment. The treatment means were compared by lsd method, and the validity of raising model was confirmed by the questionnaire means. The research findings revealed the positive contents including the availability of various animal feed plants within Ban Si Liam Yai such as fish-waste sources, rice bran and cassava; being easy to raise; little investment; being used for food and sale. Also, some negative contents found including improper feeding methods, no breeding selection, no disease prevention, low selling price and failure experiences of certain groups in the village. In case of Ban Lak Sip-kao, there was no marketing problem. However, the community participation was limited. The developed model consisted of: 1) The group establishment; 2) The members having qualifications relevant to Sufficiency Economy Philosophy; 3) Raising native swine for household consumption, selling some and obtaining manure as by-product; 4) Using hybrid breed; 5) Using pit pens; 6) Having one or two sows and three fatten pigs; 7) The boars being shared among members; 8) Avoidance of inbreeding; 9) Feedstuffs consisting of rice bran, dried leucaena leave, cassava chip and fermented fish-waste; 10) 10 - 12 % of protein <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> the <b>fatten</b> pigs, 9 - 10 % of protein <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> the sows and supplemented with animal feed plants; 11) Hog cholera vaccination and De-worming; 12) Net-working; and 13) Continuous development...|$|R

The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse economic and technical performances of the use of straws from Cassia obtusifolia as substitute feed to soybean straws and cotton seed cake <b>for</b> ram <b>fattening</b> in the Sahelian region of Burkina Faso. Five feed rations were tested with different levels of Cassia obtusifolia in substitution to soybean straws (Vigna unguiculata) and cotton cake at rates varying between 0 to 20 %. The control ration contained 40 % of cotton cake and 20 % of soybean straws. The results show that Cassia obtusifolia (CO) is an efficient feed resource. The average growth rate varied from 56. 6 ± 22. 3 g/day/animal in the control group to 105. 2 ± 33. 7 g/day/animal in the groups fed CO. Economically, rations with 25 % and 50 % cassia substituted to cotton cake showed low variable costs and high profit. These rations are likely to be accessible to any farmers regardless to their resources. On the other hand, the diet with 50 % CO substituted to soybean straws maintained high profits, in spite of high production costs. This ration could only be accessible to farmers owning relatively important resources...|$|R

40|$|The first stilbestrol feeding {{experiment}} with beef cattle was conducted 10 years ago (1953) at Iowa State University. Since then nearly every state university, many foreign countries and several feed manufacturers have conducted stilbestrol research. In these studies essentially all cattle feeding conditions have been explored. Information {{from more than}} 100 cattle experiments is used in this review to answer {{many of the questions}} posed at different times by different individuals regarding stilbestrol feeding.

40|$|The carob {{plant is}} {{known from the}} ancient years {{in the region of}} Mediterranean, where its fruit {{constituted}} nutritious food for the people and the animals. The present work constitutes study of efficiency of <b>feed</b> utilization <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> pigs after the addition of carob. With this study an effort was made to determine the main parameters, with which it is possible to utilize the ration <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> pigs, after adding to it carob produced in Greece. Thus, in relative experimentation with fattening pigs that began with their weaning and finished with their slaughter, we determined the increase of bodily weight, the consumption of food, the feed conversion ratio, the output of pigs in carcass, the quality of carcass (measuring the fat depth, the content of Weende nutritious substances in carcass), the digestibility of Weende nutritious substances in the ration, the quantification of tannins in carobs, the mortality and the consistency of produced excrements of <b>fattening</b> pigs. <b>For</b> the investigation of efficiency of feed utilization of fattening pigs with the addition of carob in their ration, 4 experimental circles were held with the use of 40 piglets per circle. In each experimental circle 40 weaning piglets were selected and after the placement of numbered eartags on them, they were separated in 4 teams A, B, C and D, each one with 10 piglets (5 males and 5 females) and they constituted subgroups A 1, A 2, A 3, A 4, B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4, C 1 C 2, C 3, C 4 and D 1, D 2, D 3, D 4 in the 4 circles of experimentation, respectively. The genotype of piglets that were selected and used in all circles of experimentation was F 1 generation hybrids from the >Seghers x +Whiteroc. Four types of experimental ration were prepared (A, B, C and D), one for each of the 4 groups, in a modern animal feed manufacturing unit, with the addition in them of 0 %, 7, 5 %, 10 %, and 12, 5 % respectively of milled carob of Greek production. The 4 types of ration were correctly balanced in energy and nitrogen and generally balanced in terms of all nutritious substances, covering the needs of pigs in the 3 stages of their fattening (weaning, pre-fattening and final fattening). During the experimentation, that lasted 150 days, all the parameters of the efficiency of <b>feed</b> utilization <b>for</b> pigs that were mentioned above, were determined. ...|$|R
40|$|Investigations on the {{possibility}} of using damaged maize in <b>feed</b> mixtures <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> pigs were carried out on four equal groups of early weaned pigs. The groups differed according to the proportion of healthy or defective maize in the feed mixtures. The control group (I) was given a feed mixture containing normal, healthy maize, the proportion of which in the mixture was taken as index 100. In groups II, III and IV normal maize in the feed mixtures was replaced with 25, 75 or 100 per cent defective maize. The experiment allowed the following conclusions:- The average daily gain throughout fattening was the highest in group I, which received a feed mixture with healthy maize, and the lowest in group IV, which was fed on defective maize. The established differences between groups I, II and III in comparison with group IV appear statistically justified (P< 0. 01). - Average feed consumption per 1 kg of gain throughout the fattening was the lowest in group I (3. 81 kg), followed by group II (3. 93 kg), group III (4. 06 kg) and group IV (4. 62 kg), i. e. it was higher by 3. 15, 6. 56 and 21. 26 per cent, respectively, relation to group I. The planned final weight of 108 kg was achieved within 122 days in group I, while in groups II, III and IV the fattening period had to be extended by 3, 15 and 45 days respectively. The obtained results evidently show that the increase of the proportion of infected maize in feed mixtures causes a decrease in average daily gains, increases feed consumption per 1 kg of gain and extends the fattening period which considerably fattening costs and thus has an adverse effect on the economy of production...|$|R
