40|$|The paper {{describes}} mathematical {{modeling and}} computation of thermal {{processes in the}} environment of mine dumps and industrial waste dumps. The developed program enables testing of various modeling methods and prediction of temperature field distribution and endogenous fires in mine dumps. It is possible to obtain enough information to design a mathematical model for spread prediction and possible dangerous endogenous fires from long time measurements of temperature fields below and above the surface. The present methodology is implemented in Matlab mathematical software environment, which enables the design of data <b>files</b> <b>processing</b> and implementation of algorithms for simulation of the temperature field in environment.

Two hearing thresholds are usually determined during fitting of audio processors – Hearing Threshold (HT) and Maximum Comfortable Level threshold (MCL). In this work, a common subjective approach together with three objective methods for CI fitting is described. Individual approaches are then compared to each other. The {{second half of}} the thesis is devoted to description of methodology for XML <b>files</b> <b>processing</b> in MATLAB programming software, treatment of available data by a created program and statistical evaluation of acquired results.

40|$|The Hadoop {{framework}} {{provides a}} powerful {{way to handle}} Big Data. Since Hadoop has inherent defects of high memory overhead and low computing performance in <b>processing</b> massive small <b>files,</b> we implement three methods and propose two strategies for solving small files problem in this paper. First, we implement three methods, i. e., Hadoop Archives (HAR), Sequence Files (SF) and CombineFileInputFormat (CFIF), to compensate the existing defects of Hadoop. Moreover, we propose two strategies for meeting the actual needs of different users. Finally, we evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} implemented methods and the validity of the proposed strategies. The experimental results show that our methods and strategies can improve the efficiency of massive small <b>files</b> <b>processing,</b> thereby enhancing the overall performance of Hadoop. © 2014 ISSN 1881 - 803 X...|$|R
