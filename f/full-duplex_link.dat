40|$|We {{present an}} experiment-based {{characterization}} of passive suppression and active self-interference cancellation mechanisms in full-duplex wireless communication systems. In particular, we consider passive suppression due to antenna separation {{at the same}} node, and active cancellation in analog and/or digital domain. First, we show that the average amount of cancellation increases for active cancellation techniques as the received self-interference power increases. Our characterization of the average cancellation {{as a function of}} the self-interference power allows us to show that for a constant signal-to-interference ratio at the receiver antenna (before any active cancellation is applied), the rate of a <b>full-duplex</b> <b>link</b> increases as the self-interference power increases. Second, we show that applying digital cancellation after analog cancellation can sometimes increase the self-interference, and thus digital cancellation is more effective when applied selectively based on measured suppression values. Third, we complete our study of the impact of self-interference cancellation mechanisms by characterizing the probability distribution of the self-interference channel before and after cancellation.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} power allocation {{schemes to}} manage the signal interference in a multiuser multicell network, where full-duplex transceivers are implemented at all base stations (BSs) and user equipment units (UEs). Beside the acute intracell and intercell interferences, the significant residual self-interference at the full-duplex receivers is the limiting factor for any network performance enhancement. To help control such severe interferences, we propose to associate each bidirectional <b>full-duplex</b> <b>link</b> with a net utility function, which consists of a utility and a flexible price. While the utility corresponds to the link throughput, the proposed logarithmic cost function allows for a moderate penalty. Our aim is to maximize the sum network utility subject to the power constraints at the BSs and UEs. To solve the highly nonconvex problem formulation, we propose two successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithms based on the difference-of-convex-functions programming and the geometric programming. In each algorithm, we specifically tailor the generic SCA framework and transform our formulated nonconvex problem into a sequence of convex power allocation programs. We prove that the developed iterative algorithms converge to locally optimal solutions that satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the original problem.

40|$|Abstract. Ethernet {{has been}} the world's most {{comprehensive}} networking for more than 30 years. This popularity is due to its simplicity, maturity, low costs and a wide existing base. Fast and Gigabit Ethernet have brought more bandwidth to the technology and by transmitting from half-duplex to <b>full-duplex</b> <b>link,</b> Ethernet’s throughput has increased. With these properties Ethernet is expected {{to speed up the}} deployment and use of next generation networks and services. The current activity in building Gigabit speed networks, growing network bandwidth and intensive network applications led to flow control and congestion control became a high priority in network design and research. Recently, the IEEE congestion management study group has been set up to deal with the congestion and flow control problems in Ethernet networks. They had standardized a method (IEEE 802. 3 x standard) to provide a pause-based flow control, which is applicable to all version of full-duplex Ethernet. The aim of this standard is to improve throughput, latency and packet loss. There are some problems for the IEEE 802. 3 x standard; for instance, pause-based flow control can potentially cause heal-of-line blocking and more congestion, and in some cases quality of service (QoS) can not operate properly due to equal punishment for different traffic priority. Recent studies carried out some of these problems and have attempted to solve them in order to improve the IEEE 802. 3 x standard. This paper analyzed and reviewed different proposed methods in terms of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} their contributions. In addition, this paper provided future trends on the development of IEEE 802. 3 x Ethernet flow control...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} assumptions made {{in the design of}} wireless networks is that the wireless devices have to be half-duplex, i. e., they cannot simultaneously transmit and receive in the same frequency band. The key deterrent in implementing a full-duplex wireless device, which can simultaneously transmit and receive in the same frequency band, is the large power differential between the self-interference from a device's own transmissions and the signal of interest coming from a distant source. In this thesis, we revisit this basic assumption and propose a full-duplex radio design. The design suppresses the self-interference signal by employing a combination of passive suppression, and active analog and digital cancellation mechanisms. The active cancellations are designed for wideband, multiple subcarrier (OFDM), and multiple antenna (MIMO) wireless communications systems. We then implement our design as a 20 MHz MIMO OFDM system with a 2. 4 GHz center frequency, suitable for Wi-Fi systems. We perform extensive over-the-air tests to characterize our implementation. Our main contributions are the following: (a) the average amount of active cancellation increases as the received self-interference power increases and as a result, the rate of a <b>full-duplex</b> <b>link</b> increases as the transmit power of communicating devices increases, (b) applying digital cancellation after analog cancellation can sometimes increase the self-interference and the effectiveness of digital cancellation in a full-duplex system will depend on the performance of the cancellation stages that precede it, (c) our full-duplex device design achieves an average of 85 dB of self-interference cancellation over a 20 MHz bandwidth at 2. 4 GHz, which is the best cancellation performance reported to date, (d) our full-duplex device design achieves 30 - 84 % higher ergodic rates than its half-duplex counterpart for received powers in the range of [- 75, - 60] dBm. As a result, our design is the first one to achieve Wi-Fi ranges; in comparison, no implementation to date has achieved Wi-Fi ranges. Consequently, we have conclusively demonstrated that Wi-Fi full-duplex is practically feasible and hence shown that one of the commonly made assumptions in wireless networks is not fundamental...|$|E

A promising physical layer approach to increase the spectral utilisation is full-duplex operation, where transceivers in the system transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band [1 - 3].

Accordingly, full-duplex systems can potentially double the spectral efficiency [2, 4, 5] and are of considerable interest for cognitive radio [6, 7], co-operative communications [8, 9], relay networks [10, 11] and 5 G wireless systems [3].
