25|$|What a book Melville has written! It <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> idea of {{much greater}} power than his {{preceding}} ones. It hardly {{seemed to me}} that the review of it, in the Literary World, did justice to its best points.|$|E

This <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> amazing sense of satisfaction. I’m so proud to represent Israel. I thank God for this opportunity."

He commented [...] "To be at my hometown club <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> extra incentive to do well". His debut came in a 1–0 victory at Brighton & Hove Albion on 8 August 2009, {{in which he was}} substituted in the 88th minute.

5000|$|In a long {{interview}} {{conducted by}} Alan Lomax in 1938, Jelly Roll Morton recalled {{that the first}} blues he had heard, probably around 1900, was played by a singer and prostitute, Mamie Desdunes, in Garden District, New Orleans. Morton sang the blues: [...] "Can’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lousy dime/ You can’t <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lousy dime/ Just to feed that hungry man of mine".

2500|$|On October 18, 1851, The Whale was {{published}} in Britain in three volumes, and on November 14 Moby-Dick appeared in the United States as a single volume. In between these dates, on October 22, 1851, the Melvilles' second child, Stanwix, was born. On December 1 Hawthorne wrote a letter of appraisal to Duyckinck, prompted in part by his disagreement with the review in Literary World: [...] "What a book Melville has written! It <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> idea of much greater power than his preceding ones. It hardly {{seemed to me that}} the review of it, in the Literary World, did justice to its best points." ...|$|E
2500|$|From an {{interview}} with Louella Parson in 1922: I {{will be out in}} California when Mr. DeMille begins operations. [...] Under my old contract I furnished eight continuities a year; now that I work only for William DeMille I only write four. [...] That <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to see my work through from the story to the screen. [...] It makes it possible for me to go over my script scene by scene with the producer, so he can make the picture with almost no changes. [...] In the old days I had to keep my nose to the grindstone continually so as to finish the eight pictures in time for the different directors for whom I was writing.|$|E
2500|$|On September 16, 2008, NOW {{gave its}} {{endorsement}} in the Presidential race to Democratic candidate Barack Obama and {{his running mate}} Joe Biden. The Independent reports, [...] "The feminist organisation almost never supports a presidential candidate, but the Alaska governor's Christian fundamentalist faith and her opposition to abortion rights has forced its hand." [...] Gandy explained, [...] "as the chair of NOW's Political Action Committee, I am frequently asked whether NOW supports women candidates just because they are women. This <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to once again answer that question with an emphatic 'No.' We {{recognize the importance of}} having women's rights supporters at every level but, like Sarah Palin, not every woman supports women's rights." [...] The conservative magazine the Weekly Standard responded, [...] "the old-fashioned feminists have fallen back on the old theme of false consciousness; that women who don't agree with them aren't really women at all." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tom Scudamore (Battlecry, sixteenth): [...] "He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> great spin for {{a circuit}} and a half, but got tired from Becher's second time. He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> great thrill {{for a long}} way." ...|$|R

25|$|All I {{suggested}} {{within that}} process was get a good, {{wide selection of}} kids. Let’s get {{a wide selection of}} personalities and temperaments and certainly skill level.

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Tom, {{shaking his}} head; [...] "no one will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> penny for playing; but Farmer Bowser might <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> penny to stop playing, if I {{went to his}} house. He did last week, you know." ...|$|R

'Well, Monsieur Gerard,' said he, at last, {{tapping his}} {{forefinger}} upon {{one of the}} brandebourgs of gold braid upon {{the front of my}} pelisse, 'I am informed that you are a very deserving young officer.
