The Editor in chief of The Village Voice, Tony Ortega, described the book as a [...] "remarkable account". Ortega noted, [...] "Headley's story provides a damning account of life working for Scientology ..." [...] He concluded the review by commenting, [...] "Perhaps the best service that Headley provides with Blown for Good is giving non-Scientologists the sense of what it's really like to work, day <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>day</b> out, in such a strange organization, from the lowliest laborer mucking out excrement in a Gold Base pond (Headley says shit {{was coming out of}} his ears and pores for days) to what kind of luxuries the celebrities and high-ranking members enjoy." ...|$|E

500|$|Citizen Kane was {{edited by}} Robert Wise and {{assistant}} editor Mark Robson. Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the [...] "camera tests" [...] and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles [...] "had an older editor assigned {{to him for}} those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked to have somebody else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits." [...] Wise and Robson began editing the film {{while it was still}} shooting and said that they [...] "could tell certainly that we were getting something very special. It was outstanding film day <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>day</b> out." [...] Welles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing. The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow dissolves. The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film [...] "in camera" [...] by leaving few options of how it could be put together. Wise said the breakfast table sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct [...] "timing" [...] and [...] "rhythm" [...] for the whip pans and over-lapping dialogue. The News on the March sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity. They used stock footage from Pathé News and the General Film Library.|$|E

[...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them day <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>day</b> out at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E
