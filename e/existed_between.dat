5|$|A {{direct grant}} grammar {{school was a}} type of {{selective}} secondary school in England and Wales that <b>existed</b> <b>between</b> 1945 and 1976. One quarter of the places in these schools were directly funded by central government, while the remainder attracted fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority and some by private pupils. On average, the schools received just over half of their income from the state.|$|E

5|$|In June 1717, Cosimo {{declared}} his {{wish that the}} House of Este should succeed the Electress. Charles VI had previously offered the Grand Duke territorial compensation—in {{the form of the}} State of Presidi—if he chose quickly, but reneged. In 1718, Charles VI repudiated Cosimo's decision, declaring a union of Tuscany and Modena (the Este lands) unacceptable. Hereafter, a stalemate <b>existed</b> <b>between</b> them.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationships that were hypothesized to <b>exist</b> <b>between</b> the variables birth order, family size, and parents college attendance and the dependent variable, college graduation. The three general hypotheses tested were: 1. A positive relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> a given position in birth order and college graduation. 2. An inverse relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> a given family size and college graduation. 3. A positive relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> a given status of parents' college attendance and college graduation. The 828 subjects were female freshmen who entered Oregon State University, fall term, 1963. Excluded from the study were all subjects who came from families of more than four siblings. Data for each subject were recorded from the official student personnel data cards. A series of chi-square tests of independence were performed in order to analyze the relationship between the family background variables and college graduation. Analysis of variance was also used in order to find out the main and interaction effects of the family background variables on college graduation. The following conclusions were made: 1. No relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> birth order and college graduation. 2. An inverse relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> family size and college graduation. 3. A positive relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> a mother's college attendance and a child's graduation from college. 4. The possible relationship which may <b>exist</b> <b>between</b> a father's college attendance and a child's graduation from college is inconclusive. 5. Individually, there is no significant difference between the effects of a mother's and father's college attendance on a child's graduation from college. 6. A positive relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> both parents' college attendance and a child's graduation from college. 7. Individually, a mother's college attendance has as much influence on a child's graduation from college as when college attendance by both parents is considered jointly. 8. When parents' education differs, each has equal influence on their child's propensity to graduate from college. 9. If one parent has attended college, there is a higher probability of a child graduating than if neither parent attended college. 10. Among students who came from families in which both parents attended college, no relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> birth order and the student's graduation from college. 11. Among students who came from families in which neither parent attended college, no relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> birth order and the student's college graduation. 12. Among students who came from families in which only the mother attended college, no relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> birth order and the student's college graduation. 13. Among students who came from families in which only the father attended college, no relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> birth order and the student's graduation from college. 14. Among students who came from families in which both parents attended college, no relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> family size and the student's college graduation. 15. Among students who came from families in which neither parent attended college, no relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> family size and the student's graduation from college. 16. Among students who came from families in which only the mother attended college, no relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> family size and the student's college graduation. 17. Among students who came from families in which only the father attended college, no relationship <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> family size and the student's graduation from college...|$|R

5|$|A strong {{relationship}} <b>existed</b> <b>between</b> Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to support his struggle against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces were critical to the defense of Zahir's sheikhdom against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} {{conducted using}} X-ray fluorescence {{has found that}} the pendant was made from a highly debased gold alloy, with only 37% of the alloy consisting of gold and the remainder consisting of silver with some copper. It is likely that the gold came from melted-down coins of the Merovingian dynasty of Francia. The Frankish currency underwent a similar debasing at around this time. The link with Francia is illustrative of the trading and cultural links that <b>existed</b> <b>between</b> Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E

5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings.

Following the construction of the Vale of Avoca {{in the first half of}} the 1920s, the newly formed Toronto Transit Commission extended the St. Clair streetcar line east to Mount Pleasant Road December 1, 1924 and then north to Eglinton Avenue on November 4, 1925.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} years of the war, a degree of tension <b>existed</b> <b>between</b> the {{government}} and the army, which divided its allegiance between government and King.

In November 1942, 12 Belgian soldiers mutinied, complaining about their inactivity. By 1943, the army's royalist stance had been moderated, allowing the government to re-gain the support of the military.|$|E

Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
