5|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{mobilisation}} the men of the AIF were selected under some of the toughest criterion of any army in World War I and it is believed that roughly 30 per cent of men that applied were rejected on medical grounds. In order to enlist, men had to be aged between 18 and 35 years of age (although it is believed that men as old as 70 and as young as 14 managed to enlist), and they had to be at least <b>five</b> <b>foot</b> six inches tall (168 centimetres), with a chest measurement of at least 34inches (86 centimetres). Many of these strict requirements were lifted later in the war, however, as the need for replacements grew. Indeed, casualties among the initial volunteers were so high, that of the 32,000 original soldiers of the AIF only 7,000 would survive {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|When the Phase II {{series was}} in development, {{original}} series designer Matt Jefferies updated the Enterprise design to feature a larger saucer with twin elevators (turbolifts) to the bridge, a wider secondary hull, docking ports, a dedicated photon torpedo weapon assembly {{at the base}} of the ship's neck, and angled struts supporting the nacelles. The nacelles themselves were completely changed to less cylindrical shapes and designed to feature glowing grilles on the sides. Likewise, an orbiting drydock, space office complex, and V'ger has been designed by artist Mike Minor. At the time Phase II was cancelled a roughly <b>five</b> <b>foot</b> long model of the Enterprise was under construction by Don Loos of Brick Price Movie Miniatures, and models of the drydock and V'ger were under construction as well. All of these models were abandoned, unfinished (although a Brick Price Enterprise was repurposed as the exploded Enterprise wreck in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock).|$|E

25|$|A small runner at <b>five</b> <b>foot</b> six inches, Kagwe did {{not take}} running seriously until he was 18. He was {{inspired}} by the feats of John Ngugi but the strength of athletes in Kenya forced him to try progressively longer distances. He competed mainly in the United States and his first race abroad was the Gasparilla Distance Classic in 1994, later that year he ran at the Boston Marathon and placed sixteenth with 2:11:52 hours. He was runner-up at the Cleveland Marathon and month later. He established himself further with a fourth-place finish at the Philadelphia Distance Run and third at the Twin Cities Marathon later that year. His first marathon win came in 1995, when he took the Pittsburgh Marathon title with a personal record of 2:10:24 hours. A win at the Atlantic City Half Marathon preceded his debut at the New York Marathon in 1995, at which he finished fifth.|$|E
25|$|The scene {{featuring}} Diesel smashing his car {{through the}} nose of a Soviet-era cargo aircraft during takeoff was conceived by Lin while producing Fast & Furious in 2009. At the time, the stunt was too expensive to film and did not fit into that film's story, but Lin commissioned digital pre-visualization artists to develop a mock-up of the idea. He attempted to revive the concept for Fast Five but the technology available proved insufficient and it still did not organically fit into the story. Filming the climactic scene practically was considered unfeasible as it involved throwing tanks {{through the air and}} having cars race alongside the moving aeroplane at 100 miles per hour. Lin opted to build various plane sets instead: a thirty foot high, seventy <b>five</b> <b>foot</b> long, fifty foot wide replica of the fuselage complete with wheels; the tail of the plane with a ramp allowing the cars to drive in and out; and a full scale build of the central fuselage, with wings, engines and the nose, that could be set on fire. For Dom's car to explode through the plane's nose, a Dodge Charger was placed on a pneumatic cannon mounted inside a ramp which was then towed by a 4x4 truck, all concealed behind the plane's nose replica. This was then clad in material soaked in flammable materials. The cannon fired the Charger {{through the nose}} as the material is ignited for the practical effect. The stunt driver had a burning 40-ton plane rig chasing them down the runway afterwards. The scene involved more than 200 crew members, and over 350 visual effects (VFX) artists at VFX studio Double Negative to complete. A typical shot of the craft's destruction could take over 100 man days to complete. The VFX team combined the filmed explosions and smoke with digital augmentations to place the plane into the scene.|$|E

[...] After playing 50 games for the Canadiens in 1997–98, Bure was traded. [...] He {{was sent to the}} Calgary Flames in a February 1, 1998, deal in exchange for Jonas Höglund and Zarley Zalapski. [...] The deal was welcomed by Bure, who appreciated both the ability to play closer to his family on the west coast as well as increased opportunity by joining a young Flames team. He recorded his first career hat trick in one of his first games in Calgary, against the Edmonton Oilers. Bure appeared in 16 games with the Flames that season and scored 38 points in 66 games combined between Montreal and Calgary.|$|E

Penguins' play-by-play announcer Mike Lange nicknamed Mullen [...] "Slippery Rock Joe" [...] for his ability to evade opposing players.|$|E

[...] When Helen returned, she found Northrup wearing Helen's own clothes and calling herself Parsons' [...] "new wife." [...] Such conduct was expressly permitted by the O.T.O., which followed Crowley's disdain of marriage as a [...] "detestable institution" [...] and accepted as commonplace the swapping of wives and partners between O.T.O. members.|$|E

Other editions included watercolours made for Thomas Butts in 1806, 1807, and 1809, one for John Flaxman in 1806 (lost), and an 1809 unsold version in tempera.

[...] He scored a touchdown against Minnesota in his first game, and made a key interception at Purdue's ten-yard line in the season's final game against Indiana. [...] A May 1944 newspaper article reported that the 19-year-old Elliott, {{who had been a}} [...] "high school sensation last year," [...] had won three major athletic letters in his first year as a Naval V-12 student at Purdue. [...] "A speedy 160-pound, <b>five</b> <b>foot</b> 10-inch performer, he lost little time making his mark in football last fall once he became eligible upon completion of his first V-12 term."

500|$|The {{basic units}} are the [...] "combat units", {{composed}} of <b>five</b> <b>foot</b> soldiers that {{are led by}} a leader with ties to the political branch. Their weapons and munitions are arbitrarily divided by type: short weapons, semi automatic weapons, rifles and shotguns are present in each unit to ensure balance. A car was also provided and used both for meetings and in incursions without attracting attention. Units in turn subscribe to specific 17-men cells, with three of the unit leaders forming the hierarchy along a pair if political and military leaders. These cells generally aim to have equipment that {{is comparable to the}} American military or law enforcement agencies. Additional support cells include trained medical personnel and are mostly in charge of logistics, maintenance, vehicles, equipment and media. Cells form 73-men formations in charge of a political member, which are assigned to specific districts and are generally independent of each other. The EPB usually plans in advance and establishes networks in places of interest, such as those in New York, Boston, Illinois, Texas and Connecticut used in the Wells Fargo heist of 1983.|$|E
