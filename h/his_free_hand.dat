5|$|Desmond Haynes was {{the fourth}} man to be {{dismissed}} for handling the ball in Test cricket, {{just over a year}} after Mohsin. Facing India in late 1983, Haynes had been struck on the bat and pad by the ball, which then headed towards the stumps. The West Indian batsman redirected the ball away from the stumps with <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b> Upon being given out, Haynes—who was ignorant of the law regarding handling the ball—argued with the umpire about the dismissal. After asking the bowler, Kapil Dev, if he wanted to withdraw his appeal, the umpire sent Haynes back to the pavilion. The first instance in One Day Internationals was in 1986, when the Indian batsman Mohinder Amarnath knocked away a turning delivery from Australia's Greg Matthews that was heading for the stumps. In 1993, Graham Gooch became the only player to be dismissed for handling the ball after scoring a century. Playing defensively to try and draw the Test match against Australia, Gooch blocked a short ball from Merv Hughes. The ball flicked off his bat and fell towards his stumps, prompting Gooch to instinctively punch the ball away: Australia won the match by 179 runs.|$|E
500|$|Technical fouls include holding, interference, pushing, illegal {{offensive}} screening (usually {{referred to}} as a [...] "moving pick"), [...] "warding off", stalling, and off-sides. A screen, as employed in basketball strategy, is a blocking move by an offensive player, by standing beside or behind a defender, to free a teammate to shoot, or receive a pass; as in basketball players must remain stationary when screening. Warding off occurs when an offensive player uses <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> to control the stick of an opposing player.|$|E
500|$|The {{dismissal}} of Daryll Cullinan in 1999 {{was the second}} instance in ODIs: facing the West Indian spinner Keith Arthurton, Cullinan fended the ball off into the ground. It bounced high in the air, and Cullinan removed his right hand from his bat to catch it as it fell again. Despite {{the fact that it}} was unlikely that the ball would land near the stumps, the West Indies captain, Brian Lara, appealed, and Cullinan was dismissed. The next occurrence was two years later, in a Test match between Australia and India. In the first innings of the match, Steve Waugh was struck on the pads by a delivery from Harbhajan Singh. The umpire turned down the appeal, but as he did so, the ball bounced and spun towards the stumps. Waugh was alerted by a shout from the non-striking batsman, and instinctively swept the ball away with <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b> The most recent instance came during the same year as Waugh's dismissal, in another Test match involving India. England's Michael Vaughan missed an attempted sweep against Sarandeep Singh, and the ball trickled along the ground after striking his pads. Vaughan brushed the ball away with his hand, despite {{the fact that it was}} not travelling towards the stumps. Initially, he claimed that he was attempting the give the ball back to the fielder at short leg, but he later admitted that he [...] "should have just held up [...] hands and said 'I got it all wrong, I'm an idiot.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{occasion}} of a batsman being given out handled {{the ball in}} international cricket occurred during a Test match between South Africa and England in Cape Town in 1957. In the second innings of the match, the South African Russell Endean padded away a delivery from Jim Laker. The ball looped off his pads into the air, and was falling towards his stumps until Endean instinctively knocked it away with <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b> He later suggested that he had [...] "thought of heading it away, but that seemed too theatrical." [...] The second instance came 22 years later during a bad-tempered series between Australia and Pakistan that also involved another rare dismissal method: Mankading. Andrew Hilditch was the victim in this match; {{he picked up the}} ball and returned it to the bowler after a wayward throw from a fielder. The bowler, Sarfraz Nawaz, appealed for the wicket and Hilditch was given out. Another Pakistan player, Asif Iqbal, distanced himself from the incident, commenting that he felt [...] "there was no need for us to stoop so low as to appeal against Hilditch". Hilditch's dismissal marked the only time that a non-striking batsman has been given out for handling the ball. The next case also occurred in a match between Australia and Pakistan. The match was marred by stones being thrown at the Australians in the field, providing a tense atmosphere. Mohsin Khan defended a delivery from Geoff Lawson, which then landed behind him. Mohsin pushed the ball away from the stumps with his hand, resulting in the wicket.|$|E

60|$|But {{suddenly}} there came the shuffling of steps outside, {{and he had}} hardly time to wrap the loose links round <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> when the door was unbolted and two pirates came in.|$|E
60|$|Then he <b>freed</b> <b>his</b> other <b>hand</b> and {{undid the}} {{troublesome}} gag, which {{had all but}} smothered him, and then unfastened his feet.|$|R

60|$|At {{sight of}} big Mister Haggin deserting him and being pulled {{away in the}} whaleboat, Jerry wriggled and voiced his anxiety in a low, whimpering whine. Captain Van Horn snuggled him closer in his arm with a caress of <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Another {{moment and}} the hands clasped, Nigel uttered an irrepressible shout as the hermit swung off, and, coming round with great {{violence}} {{to the spot}} where the negro had fixed himself, just succeeded in catching {{the edge of the cliff}} with <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

60|$|A {{quick look}} of {{comprehension}} came to Barney's eyes. The man upon the cot evidently noted it and rightly interpreted its cause, for, having <b>freed</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> he now slipped it quickly beneath the coverlet.|$|R

60|$|Next in event, and a most {{important}} event {{it was to}} prove, came Nalasu. Nalasu {{was an old man}} of three-score years, and he was blind, walking with a large staff with which he prodded his path. In <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> he carried a small pig by its tied legs.|$|E

2500|$|During live Rush performances, Lifeson uses MIDI {{controllers}} {{that enables}} him to use <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hands</b> and feet to trigger sounds from digital samplers and synthesizers, without taking his hands off his guitar. (Prior to this, Lifeson used Moog Taurus Bass Pedals before they were replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.) Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, {{beginning in the late}} 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound [...] "events" [...] that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).|$|R
2500|$|To trigger these {{sounds in}} real-time, Lee uses MIDI controllers, {{placed at the}} {{locations}} on the stage where he has a microphone stand. Lee uses two types of MIDI controllers: one type resembles a traditional synthesizer keyboard on a stand (Yamaha KX76). The second type is a large foot-pedal keyboard, placed on the stage floor (Korg MPK-130, Roland PK-5). Combined, they enable Lee to use <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hands</b> and feet to trigger sounds in electronic equipment that has been placed off-stage. It is with this technology that Lee and his bandmates are able to present their arrangements in a live setting {{with the level of}} complexity and fidelity that fans have come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of backing tracks or employing an additional band member. [...] A notable exception of this was during the Clockwork Angels Tour, when a string ensemble played string parts, which were originally arranged and conducted by David Campbell on Clockwork Angels.|$|R
