2500|$|On 19 September 1968, Perth {{departed}} from Sydney to replace Hobart in the Vietnam warzone. En route, a training exercise with RAAF aircraft revealed {{that one of}} the radars and both <b>identification-friend-or-foe</b> units had defects, which were repaired in Subic. Perth relieved her sister ship on 29 September, and after exercising with the Seventh Fleet, deployed to the gunline on 5 October. Four days later, the destroyer sailed north to relieve [...] as leader of the northern Sea Dragon unit, as that destroyer was experiencing faults with her gun turrets and targeting computer. The next day, Perth and [...] were joined by the battleship , with the battleship taking command of the unit and the Australian destroyer was reassigned back to the southern force. On 21 October, a day after rejoining the northern Sea Dragon unit, the destroyer observed the return of 14 North Vietnamese prisoners-of-war.|$|E

40|$|Although {{conventional}} (i. e., passive) radar absorbers {{are widely}} used for modifying the radar cross-section (RCS) of current military platforms, such absorbers may not have adequate performance to satisfy future requirements. Active absorbers, however, offer the potential to overcome the so-called Rozanov performance limit and to enable additional smart functionality such as monitoring damage, adaptive control of RCS or target appearance, <b>identification-friend-or-foe,</b> and absorb-while-scan. This paper outlines the concept and basic properties of a novel type of active radar absorber, the so-called phase-switched screen (PSS). The basic PSS topology is then modified so as to enable it to operate as a smart radar absorber when used together with an external sensor and feedback control loop. System implementation issues and the optimum choice of design parameters {{for a range of}} operational scenarios are discussed, and theoretical predictions are supported by measured performance data...|$|E
