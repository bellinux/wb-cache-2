5|$|Nicks {{writes that}} Manning would travel back to Washington, D.C., for visits. An ex-boyfriend helped her find <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the city's gay community, {{introducing}} her to lobbyists, activists, and White House aides. Back at Fort Drum, {{she continued to}} display emotional problems and, by August 2009, had been referred to an Army mental-health counselor. A friend told Nicks that Manning could be emotionally fraught, describing an evening they had watched two movies together—The Last King of Scotland and Dancer in the Dark—after which Manning cried for hours. By September 2009 her relationship with Watkins was in trouble; they reconciled for a short time, but it was effectively over.|$|E
5|$|Arha's {{childhood}} and youth are lonely; her only friends are Manan and Penthe, a priestess her own age. She {{is trained in}} her duties by Thar and Kossil, the priestesses of the two other major deities. Thar tells her of the undertomb and the labyrinth beneath the Tombs, teaching her the instructions to find <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> them. She tells of the treasure hidden within the labyrinth, which wizards from the archipelago have tried to steal in past years. When Arha asks about the wizards, Thar tells her that they are unbelievers who can work magic. When she turns fourteen, Arha assumes all the responsibilities of her position, becoming the highest ranked priestess in the Tombs. She is required to order the death of prisoners sent to the Tombs by the God-King of the Kargad lands; she has them killed by starvation, an act which haunts {{her for a long}} time. After Thar dies of old age, Arha becomes increasingly isolated: although stern, Thar had been fair to her. Kossil despises Arha and sees the Nameless Ones as a threat to her power.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the start}} of Parks and Recreation, Ron has two ex-wives, {{both of whom are}} named Tammy, which is also the name of Ron's mother. Ron despises and fears both of his ex-wives, and they are among the few {{individuals}} in the world who can break Ron's usually unwavering stoicism. Nevertheless, Ron shares an extremely passionate sexual connection with his second ex-wife; he compared having sex with her to [...] "doing peyote and sneezing, slowly, for six hours," [...] and added, [...] "That woman really knows <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> a penis." [...] Ron is so susceptible to Tammy 2's sexual temptations that he made a video-tape warning himself about her to play in case he ever got back together with her. Ron plays the saxophone, and secretly performs at out-of-town jazz clubs under the name Duke Silver, which he keeps secret from his colleagues in Pawnee. He wears a trilby hat and suit jacket while playing, fronts a band called the Duke Silver Trio, and has released such albums as Memories of Now, Smooth as Silver, and Hi Ho, Duke. His music is especially popular with older women (among them being April's mother), who find Duke Silver extremely attractive.|$|E

In an interview with Harper's Bazaar in 2011, Spears recalled the music video, saying, [...] "I just think it says a lot. It was directed so well, it was really colorful and the dancing was amazing". It begins with Spears driving away from the paparazzi, with {{a part of the}} instrumental version of the song [...] "Bombastic Love", featured on the album Britney, playing. She makes her way into an alleyway and decides to enter an abandoned factory, hoping her pursuers will be thrown off course. When she enters the building she begins to dance <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the warehouse. Britney's dancers, having spotted her walking into the factory, follow her inside.

Towards the end of the video, segments of Spears in a room with walls covered in pictures and articles about herself are also shown. These walls move in and out before the video ends, signifying that she is [...] "overprotected". At the end of the video, Britney walks to a wall, and exits the building.|$|E

5000|$|Billboards Kerri Mason, in her {{review of}} the album, {{comments}} that [...] "she enunciates {{the heck out of}} two tunes co-written by Perry." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com praised the songs hook, chorus and Clarksons voice, writing that they take the record to the next level. He was dismissive of the songs arrangement, describing it as [...] "standard rock". Lamb gave [...] "I Do Not Hook Up" [...] a four-star rating, stating that [...] "Kelly Clarkson proves she knows <b>her</b> <b>way</b> all <b>around</b> a melodic rock song, and you will find yourself singing along." [...] Ann Powers, a writer for Los Angeles Times, commented that it [...] "should be heard by every teen girl contemplating chucking her purity ring." [...] The Harvard Crimson writer Olivia S. Pei finds [...] "I Do Not Hook Up" [...] as a refreshing change from music like Katy Perrys single [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] (One of the Boys, 2008), while noting irony in the fact that Perry co-wrote the single. Pei also adds that [...] "I Do Not Hook Up" [...] and [...] "My Life Would Suck Without You" [...] show off Clarksons vocal versatility, but fails {{to make up for the}} absence of creative rhythms. Matt Busekroos of The Quinnipiac Chronicle commented that Clarkson adds more to the Perry-penned tracks [...] "with her voice and revamped studio production." ...|$|R
500|$|Regarding the feud between Mercedes and Mitzeee, All About Soap {{columnist}} Laura Morgan {{commented that}} it was shocking that she felt sorry for Mercedes.

500|$|Fraser McAlpine from BBC complimented {{the song}} and Kesha for knowing <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> a strong pop chorus, giving the single {{four out of five}} stars. McAlpine noted that [...] "some {{evidence}} of range would be welcomed at this point, [...] there's a whole other side to her that you'd never know if you just listened to the singles" [...] commenting that her persona was the [...] "boozy floozy card" [...] and that the power ballads on her album could have been better for a release. He went on to conclude [...] "even though her 'act' is to be far too revealing about her dirty habits, she has still managed to create something of a mystique cloud around herself". Billboard magazine's Monica Herrera was impressed with the song, calling it [...] "blissful". She went on to compliment the song for its strong chorus that has the ability to [...] "stick with the listener for days". Sara Anderson of AOL Radio called the song [...] "a playful take on a teen love obsession", complimenting [...] "Kesha's signature auto-tuned vocals and casual chatty ad-libs". Anderson commented on the chorus of the song calling it [...] "a modern Cyndi Lauper-inspired chorus". Nate Adams of No Ripcord was positive in his review of the song, calling it [...] "a fun little disco tune", and wrote that the singer [...] "isn't reinventing the wheel {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, but she has her share of catchy would-be hits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hái! {{received}} critical acclaim. Mojo {{praised the}} album {{at the time}} of its release and rated it 4 stars: [...] "Hái! boasts more than a few moments of jasmine-scented intimacy, where Sioux's inimitable Banshee yelp does daintily nuanced dances to Budgie's intricate marimba manipulations. A robust return". Time Out considered it as a [...] "spine-tingling achievement". Critic Peter Watts described it as [...] "mesmeric", saying: [...] "Siouxsie's voice is the dominant instrument here, snaking and curling around the bouncing drumming backdrop, elegiac and inhuman as she chants, purrs and whispers <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the album". Watts also hailed the song [...] "Tourniquet" [...] as tense, sensual and spellbinding. [...] The Independent wrote that Hái! was [...] "an album of dense atmospherics, frenetic rhythms and, of course, Siouxsie's visceral wailing." [...] Fiona Sturges qualified it as [...] "imaginative, raw and energetic". NME liked the album for its [...] "strangely skilful stuff", and Uncut praised it for its [...] "fearsome drumming". Simon Price wrote: [...] "It's as dense as its predecessors, built from layer upon layer of xylophones, bells and steel pipes from Budgie and [...] "taiko" [...] drummer Leonard Eto. Imagine the marching band from Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Tusk" [...] let loose on the marching powder in which the Mac themselves had been indulging, while Sioux coos like a 1940s siren over the top, and you're some way to imagining this Anglo-Japanese beauty".|$|E

60|$|Joan {{wanted a}} better {{position}} in which to watch and listen. She thought a moment, and then carefully felt <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> {{to the other side}} of the steps, and here, sitting down with her feet hanging over the drop, she leaned against the wall and through a chink between the logs had a perfect view of the large cabin. The men were filing in silent and intense. Joan counted twenty-seven in all. They appeared to fall into two groups, and it was significant that the larger group lined up on the side nearest Kells, and the smaller back of Gulden. He had removed the bandage, and with a raw, red blotch where his right ear had been shot away, he was hideous. There was some kind of power emanating from him, but it was not that which, was so keenly vital and impelling in Kells. It was brute ferocity, dominating by sheer physical force. In any but muscular clash between Kells and Gulden the latter must lose. The men back of Gulden were a bearded, check-shirted, heavily armed group, the worst of that bad lot. All the younger, cleaner-cut men like Red Pearce and Frenchy and Beady Jones and Williams and the scout Blicky, were on the other side. There were two factions here, yet scarcely an antagonism, except possibly in the case of Kells. Joan felt that the atmosphere was supercharged with suspense and fatality and possibility--and anything might happen. To her great joy, Jim Cleve was not present.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother!" [...] she said, but Hannah {{gazed at}} her uncomprehendingly. Janet stooped convulsively, and kissed her. Straightening up, she stood {{looking down at her}} mother for a few moments, and went out of the room, pausing in the dining-room, to listen, but Hannah {{apparently}} had not stirred. She took the box of matches from its accustomed place on the shelf beside the clock, entered the dark bedroom {{in the front of the}} flat, closing the door softly behind her. The ghostly blue light from a distant arc came slanting in at the window, glinting on the brass knobs of the chest of drawers-another Bumpus heirloom. She remembered that chest from early childhood; it was one of the few pieces that, following them in all their changes of residence, had been faithful to the end: she knew everything in it, and the place for everything. Drawing a match from the box, she was about to turn on the gas--but the light from the arc would suffice. As she made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the walnut bed she had a premonition of poignant anguish as yet unrealized, of anguish being held at bay by a stronger, fiercer, more imperative emotion now demanding expression, refusing at last to be denied. She opened the top drawer of the chest, the drawer in which Hannah, breaking tradition, had put the Bumpus genealogy. Edward had never kept it there. Would the other things be in place? Groping with her hands in the left-hand corner, her fingers clasped exultantly something heavy, something wrapped carefully in layers of flannel. She had feared her father might have taken it to the mill! She drew it out, unwound the flannel, and held to the light an old-fashioned revolver, the grease glistening along its barrel. She remembered, too, that the cartridges had lain beside it, and thrusting her hand once more into the drawer found the box, extracting several, and replacing the rest, closed the drawer, and crept through the dining-room to her bedroom, where she lit the gas in order to examine the weapon--finally contriving, more by accident than skill, to break it. The cartridges, of course, fitted into the empty cylinder. But before inserting them she closed the pistol once more, cocked it, and held it out. Her arm trembled violently as she pulled the trigger. Could she do it? As though to refute this doubt of her ability to carry out an act determined upon, she broke the weapon once more, loaded and closed it, and thrust it in the pocket of her coat. Then, washing the grease from her hands, she put on her gloves, and was about to turn out the light when she saw reflected in the glass the red button of the I.W.W. still pinned on her coat. This she tore off, and flung on the bureau.|$|E
