Writing the game record by hand distracts the player from the game {{and it is not}} very reliable. Video or photographic record lacks the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> abstract <b>notation.</b> In this thesis we discuss several ways of automatically extracting Go game records from photographs. We propose our own method based on Hough transform and RANSAC paradigm. We implement a reliable and easy to use system that allows players to take a game record effortlessly.

40|$|Relationships among {{different}} modeling perspectives have been systematically investigated focusing either on given notations (e. g. UML) or on domain reference models (e. g. ARIS/SAP). In contrast, many successful informal methods for business analysis and requirements engineering (e. g. JAD) emphasize team negotiation, goal orientation and <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> modeling <b>notations.</b> This paper addresses the question how much formal and computerized support {{can be provided}} in such settings without destroying their creative tenor. Our solution {{is based on a}} novel modeling language design, M-Telos, that integrates the adaptability and analysis advantages of the logic-based meta modeling language Telos with a module concept covering the structuring mechanisms of scalable software architectures. It comprises four components: (1) A modular conceptual modeling formalism organizes individual perspectives and their interrelationships. (2) Perspective schemata are linked to a conceptual meta meta [...] ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{discusses}} the possibility <b>of</b> using Laban <b>notation</b> to program humanoid robots. Laban notation documents human movements by {{a sequence of}} symbols that express movements as defined in the physical space. We show, by reasoning around the simple action of " taking a ball ", the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>notation</b> that is able to describe an action with different level of details, depending on the final objective <b>of</b> the <b>notation.</b> These characteristics make Laban notation suitable as a high level language and as a motion segmentation tool for humanoid robot programming and control. The main problem in robotics is to express actions that are defined and operate in the physical space in terms of robot motions that originate in the robot motor control space. This is the fundamental robotics issue of inversion. We will first show how symbols used by Laban to describe human gestures can be translated in terms of actions for the robot by using a framework called Stack of Tasks. We will then report on an experience tending to implement on a simulated humanoid platform the <b>notation</b> score <b>of</b> a " Tutting Dance " executed by a dancer. Once the whole movement has been implemented on the robot, it has been again notated by using Laban notation. The comparison between both scores shows that robot's movements are slightly different from dancer's ones. We then discuss about plausible origins of these differences...|$|R

However, the breakthrough, by which formal methods are routinely applied to software developments, has not yet been achieved. Many companies involved in such projects are scaling down their use of formal methods to a level that is in accordance with their current industrial relevance. For instance, they have only small teams of highly trained research staff [...] ...|$|R

50|$|In mathematics, abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> {{occurs when}} an author uses a {{mathematical}} notation {{in a way}} that is not formally correct but that seems likely to simplify the exposition or suggest the correct intuition (while being unlikely to introduce errors or cause confusion). However, the concept of formal correctness depends on time and on the context. Therefore, many notations in mathematics are qualified as abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> in some context and are formally correct in other contexts; as many notations were introduced a long time before any formalization of the theory in which they are used, the qualification <b>of</b> abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> is strongly time dependent. Moreover, many abuses <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> may be made formally correct by improving the theory. Abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> should be contrasted with misuse <b>of</b> <b>notation,</b> which should be avoided.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} methodology to manage business process design in a dynamic organizational context primarily by using i* modeling framework and Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). Agent-Oriented Conceptual Modeling (AOCM) notations {{such as the}} i* framework have gained considerable currency in the recent past. Such notations model organisational context and offer high-level social/anthropomorphic abstractions (such as goals, tasks, softgoals and dependencies) as modeling constructs. It {{has been argued that}} such notations help answer questions such as what goals exist, how key actors depend on each other and what alternatives must be considered. The technical focus <b>of</b> process modeling <b>notations</b> such as BPMN is especially suited for applications in the description, execution and simulation of business processes but is lacking in support for process redesign and improvement. These notations effectively provide a view of the responsibilities and required communications between classes of process participants, but do not provide a view of other social and inten- tional characteristics including the goals of participants and their inter-dependencies. We argue this gap can be minimised by using and correlating organisational models and process models in a complimentary fashion. Business processes represent the operational capabilities of an organisation. In order to ensure process continuity, the effective management of risk becomes an area of key concern. We argue {{there is a need for}} supporting risk identification with the use of higher-level organisational models and business process models. In this research we have conducted a detailed analysis of the concept that <b>flexibility</b> and combination <b>of</b> <b>notations</b> are required to facilitate the maintenance of the models. We have developed a methodology to support combined use <b>of</b> <b>notations</b> (i* and BPMN) for modeling business processes with a view to facilitate and support change at organisational and process models. We have also presented a methodology to integrate risks in process models through a set of intuitive metrics by extracting measures of actor criticality, and vulnerability from organisational models. This research has been vali- dated through a detailed case study involving a major government agency and through an experiment conducted among participants from industry and academia...|$|R
