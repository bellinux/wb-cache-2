5|$|The copy of John Lydgate's 15th century Life {{written for}} Henry VI of England {{is now in}} the British Library. The Wilton <b>Diptych</b> was painted during the reign of Richard II of England and is the most famous {{representation}} of Edmund in art. Painted on oak panels, it shows Richard kneeling in front of three saints—one of whom is Edmund—as they present the young king to the Virgin and Child.|$|E
5|$|Whaam! is a 1963 <b>diptych</b> {{painting}} by the American artist Roy Lichtenstein. It {{is one of}} the best-known works of pop art, and among Lichtenstein's most important paintings. Whaam! was first exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City in 1963, and purchased by the Tate Gallery, London, in 1966. It has been on permanent display at Tate Modern since 2006.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} <b>diptych</b> are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
50|$|Much smaller private altarpieces, often portable, {{were made}} for wealthy {{individuals}} to use at home, often as folding <b>diptychs</b> or triptychs for safe transport. In the Middle Ages very small <b>diptychs</b> or triptychs carved in ivory or other materials were popular.|$|R

500|$|Few intact <b>diptychs</b> survive. As with altarpieces, the {{majority}} were later separated and sold as single [...] "genre" [...] pictures. In the workshop system some were interchangeable, and the religious works may have been paired with newly commissioned donor panels. Later many <b>diptychs</b> were broken apart, thus creating two saleable works from one. During the Reformation, religious scenes were often removed.|$|R
5|$|Portrait <b>Diptych</b> of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the {{collective}} name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), {{when she was}} around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of {{the physical and emotional}} effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter.|$|E
5|$|The {{left-hand}} panel shows {{a fighter}} plane firing a rocket that, in the right-hand panel, hits a second plane which explodes in flames. Lichtenstein conceived the image from several comic-book panels. He transformed his primary source, a panel from a 1962 war comic book, by presenting it as a <b>diptych</b> while altering {{the relationship of}} the graphical and narrative elements. Whaam! is regarded for the temporal, spatial and psychological integration of its two panels. The painting's title is integral to the action and impact of the painting, and displayed in large onomatopoeia in the right panel.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{seems to}} be the {{left-hand}} wing of a dismantled <b>diptych,</b> perhaps with the Saint George and the Dragon panel now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. As an early van der Weyden, it takes influence from Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck. Van der Weyden served his apprenticeship under Campin, and the older master's style is noticeable in the architecture of the niche, the Virgin's facial type, her exposed breast and the treatment of her hair.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{consular}} <b>diptychs</b> systematically carried {{either a}} more or less elaborate portrait of the consul on the most richly decorated examples or a dedicatory inscription to him within a geometric and vegetal scheme on the simpler examples. The simpler examples were probably produced as a series from models prepared in advance, with the more sophisticated (and thus more expensive) <b>diptychs</b> reserved for the inner circle of the Roman aristocracy. The workshops responsible for their production were {{to be found in the}} Empire's two capitals at Rome and Constantinople, but the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 was probably responsible for the disappearance of western production at the end of the 5th century, with all surviving consular <b>diptychs</b> from the 6th century originating from Constantinople. The most common motif on 6th century consular <b>diptychs</b> from Constantinople shows the consul, standing, presiding over the consular games which marked his entry to the consulship.|$|R

5000|$|The routine {{distribution}} of such <b>diptychs</b> in the East {{is marked by}} a decision by Theodosius I in 384 to limit expenditure on the games of Constantinople by reserving ivory <b>diptychs</b> (and golden gifts) to consuls alone. In the western empire, they became a usual part of the public displays given by great aristocrats. Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, for example, distributed some to commemorate his son's quaestorian games in 393 and praetorian games in 401 respectively. Almost all depict the games, and on three separate occasions Symmachus links the presentation of these <b>diptychs</b> with the completion of the games. Their end is marked by the consulship's disappearance under the reign of Justinian in 541.|$|R
5|$|A coinage commemorating Edmund was minted {{from around}} the time East Anglia was absorbed by the kingdom of Wessex and a popular cult emerged. In about 986, Abbo of Fleury wrote {{of his life and}} martyrdom. The saint's remains were {{temporarily}} moved from Bury St Edmunds to London for safekeeping in 1010. His shrine at Bury was visited by many kings, including Canute, who was responsible for rebuilding the abbey: the stone church was rebuilt again in 1095. During the Middle Ages, when Edmund was regarded as the patron saint of England, Bury and its magnificent abbey grew wealthy, but during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, his shrine was destroyed. Medieval manuscripts and works of art relating to Edmund include Abbo's Passio Sancti Eadmundi, John Lydgate's 14th-century Life, the Wilton <b>Diptych</b> and a number of church wall paintings.|$|E
5|$|Blythburgh, a {{mile from}} Bulcamp and {{situated}} near the fordable headwaters of the Blyth estuary, was afterwards {{believed to be the}} location of the tombs of Anna and Jurmin. It is a candidate for a monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name 'Bulcamp' indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide circumstantial evidence of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity. Part of an 8th-century whalebone <b>diptych</b> or writing-tablet, used for liturgical purposes, has been found near the site.|$|E
5|$|Landscape was a {{secondary}} concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare {{and when they}} did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or arcades. They were rarely based on actual locations; the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes. Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.1430 Crucifixion and Last Judgement <b>diptych</b> and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin.|$|E

5|$|Most {{art historians}} {{believe that there}} are a number of {{indicators}} that the panel was the left-hand wing of a dismantled <b>diptych.</b> The frame contains clasps, implying it was once hinged to a second panel. The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying right-hand wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance is directed at a space beyond the edge of the panel, suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a right-hand wing. The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a right angle to the nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are at the left of the panel, facing right.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{paintings}} were commissioned for royal and ducal palaces, for churches, hospitals, and convents, and for wealthy clerics and private donors. The richer {{cities and towns}} commissioned works for their civic buildings. Artists often worked {{in more than one}} medium; van Eyck and Petrus Christus are both thought to have contributed to manuscripts. Van der Weyden designed tapestries, though few survive. The Netherlandish painters were responsible for many innovations, including the advancement of the <b>diptych</b> format, the conventions of donor portraits, new conventions for Marian portraits, and, through works such as van Eyck's Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin in the 1430s, laying the foundation for the development of landscape painting as a separate genre.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{was the son}} of Bogdan, who was a son of Alexander the Good, Prince of Moldavia. Stephen's mother, Maria Oltea, {{was most}} {{probably}} related to the princes of Wallachia, according to historian Radu Florescu. The date of Stephen's birth is unknown, though historians estimate that he was born between 1433 and 1440. One church <b>diptych</b> records that he had five siblings: brothers Ioachim, Ioan, Christea; and sisters Sorea and Maria. Some of Stephen's biographers hypothesize that Cârstea Arbore, father of the statesman Luca Arbore, was the prince's fourth brother, or that Cârstea was the same as Ioachim. These links with the high-ranking Moldavian boyars are known to have been preserved through matrimonial connections: Maria, who died in 1486, was the wife of Șendrea, gatekeeper of Suceava; Stephen's other brother-in-law, Isaia, also held high office at his court.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{mention of}} the work appears in 1841, when scholars believed the two panels were wings of a lost triptych. The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the <b>diptych</b> in 1933. At that time, the work was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert because key areas formally resembled pages of the Turin-Milan Hours, which were then believed to be of Hubert's hand. On the evidence of technique and the style of dress of the figures, the majority of scholars believe the panels are late works by Jan van Eyck, executed in the early 1430s and finished after his death. Other art historians hold that van Eyck painted the panels around the early 1420s and attribute the weaker passages to a younger van Eyck's relative inexperience.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as either the left-hand wing of a since dismantled <b>diptych,</b> or as the front piece of a double-sided panel. Art historian Erwin Panofsky suggests that the Washington Saint George and the Dragon of 1432–35 {{is the most likely}} opposite wing. In that work, St. George, facing inwards and to the right, slays the dragon before a Libyan princess. Although the pairing might seem incongruous, his Madonna Standing is widely thought to have been attached with the St. Catherine of Alexandria in Vienna. In both panels, the saints face inwards and are within fully realised landscapes. In contrast, in both left-hand panels, the Madonna and Child are positioned frontally (although eye contact is avoided) and isolated within cold grisaille architectural spaces.|$|E
5|$|They {{were created}} either as pendants, that is {{conceived}} as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or <b>diptych</b> wings. However this formation {{may have been a}} later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident.|$|E

5|$|Two near-contemporary copies, usually {{attributed}} to the Ghent Master of 1499 and Jan Gossaert, were completed while the original was {{in the collection of}} Margaret of Austria, great-granddaughter of Philip the Good. Both present variants of the Madonna panel as the left wing of a devotional <b>diptych,</b> with a donor portrait as the right wing. However, the two donor panels have very different settings. The 1499 version shows the Cistercian abbot Christiaan de Hondt praying in his luxurious quarters, while Gossaert presents the donor Antonio Siciliano, accompanied by Saint Anthony, in a panoramic landscape setting. It is not known if either work is based on an original left-hand panel painted by van Eyck.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was born}} at the Archbishop's Palace, Bordeaux, in the English principality of Aquitaine, on 6 January 1367. According to {{contemporary}} sources, three kings"the King of Castille, the King of Navarre and the King of Portugal"were present at his birth. This anecdote, {{and the fact that}} his birth fell on the feast of Epiphany, was later used in the religious imagery of the Wilton <b>Diptych,</b> where Richard is one of three kings paying homage to the Virgin and Child. His elder brother Edward of Angoulême died near his sixth birthday in 1371, and Richard became his father's heir. The Black Prince finally succumbed to his long illness in June 1376. The Commons in parliament genuinely feared that Richard's uncle, John of Gaunt, would usurp the throne. For this reason, the prince was quickly invested with the princedom of Wales and his father's other titles.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{approach}} to kingship {{was rooted in}} his strong belief in the royal prerogative, the inspiration {{of which can be}} found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant. Richard rejected the approach his grandfather, Edward III, had taken to the nobility. Edward's court had been a martial one, based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains. In Richard's view, this put a dangerous amount of {{power in the hands of}} the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France. At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them livery badges with his White Hart, which are also worn by the angels in the Wilton <b>Diptych</b> (right). He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.|$|E

As well as small <b>diptychs</b> and triptychs with densely packed religious scenes, usually from the New Testament, secular objects, usually in a lower relief, were also produced.|$|R
