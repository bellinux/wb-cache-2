50|$|A VDO is {{not only}} possessed {{by people who have}} teeth, however; for {{completely}} edentulous individuals who do not have any teeth with which to position themselves in maximum <b>intercuspation,</b> VDO can be measured based on subjective signs related to esthetics and phonetics.|$|E
50|$|In dentistry, maximum <b>intercuspation</b> {{refers to}} the occlusal {{position}} of the mandible in which the cusps of the teeth of both arches fully interpose themselves with the cusps of {{the teeth of the}} opposing arch. This position used to be referred to as centric occlusion.|$|E
50|$|The dental midline is the midsagittal line of maxillary and mandibular dental arches {{possessing}} {{teeth of}} ideal size, shape, and position, when situated in maximum <b>intercuspation.</b> Each arch also possesses its own midline, {{which can be}} used to refer to the location of contact between the mesial surfaces of the central incisors. Thus, if an individual's mandibular teeth are shifted over to the left in a mesial-distal dimension, by 2 mm, for example, that individual's midline would be said to be deviated 2 mm to the left.|$|E
50|$|After {{extraction}} of a tooth, the clot in the alveolus fills in with immature bone, which later is remodeled into mature secondary bone. However, {{with the loss}} of teeth, a patient becomes edentulous, either partially or completely, and the alveolar bone undergoes resorption. The underlying basal bone of the body of the maxilla or mandible remains less affected, however, because it does not need the presence of teeth to remain viable. The loss of alveolar bone, coupled with attrition of the teeth, causes a loss of height of the lower third of the vertical dimension of the face when the teeth are in maximum <b>intercuspation.</b> The extent of this loss is determined based on clinical judgment using the Golden Proportions.|$|E

40|$|Fabrication of occlusal splints in centric {{relation}} for temporomandibular disorders (TMD) patients is arguable, since this {{position has been}} defined for asymptomatic stomatognathic system. Thus, maximum <b>intercuspation</b> might be employed in patients with occlusal stability, {{eliminating the need for}} interocclusal records. This study compared occlusal splints fabricated in {{centric relation}} and maximum <b>intercuspation</b> in muscle pain reduction of TMD patients. Twenty patients with TMD of myogenous origin and bruxism were divided into 2 groups treated with splints in maximum <b>intercuspation</b> (I) or centric relation (II). Clinical, electrognathographic and electromyographic examinations were performed before and 3 months after therapy. Data were analyzed by the Student's t test. Differences at 5 % level of probability were considered statistically significant. There was a remarkable reduction in pain symptomatology, without statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) between the groups. There was mandibular repositioning during therapy, as demonstrated by the change in occlusal contacts on the splints. Electrognathographic examination demonstrated a significant increase in maximum left lateral movement for group I and right lateral movement for group II (p 0. 05) in the electromyographic activities at rest after utilization of both splints. In conclusion, both occlusal splints were effective for pain control and presented similar action.

30|$|The OP is a {{two-dimensional}} segmentation of a three-dimensional phenomenon; on cephalometric radiograph, {{a straight line}} is used to represent an imaginary plane {{at the level of}} occlusion. There are various ways for determining the occlusal plane, in which the bisected occlusal plane (BOP) is most commonly used. As proposed by Downs [13], the BOP is a line connecting the point bisecting the first molar cusp height and the point bisecting the incisal overbite. The functional occlusal plane (FOP) is a plane formed by bisecting the <b>intercuspation</b> of the first premolars and the <b>intercuspation</b> of the first molars [14, 15]. Maxillary and mandibular occlusal planes have also been used in literatures [16 – 18].|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the electromyographic activity of masticatory muscles {{in women with}} myogenic or mixed TMD treated with ultrasound and ultrasound associated with stretching. METHODS: Sixteen women with myogenic or mixed TMD, according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorder (RDC/TMD), participated in the study. The patients were evaluated using surface electromyography (sEMG) of the masseter and anterior temporalis muscles, during maximum <b>intercuspation,</b> before and immediately after application of therapeutic resources. All patients were treated by ultrasound (US), ultrasound associated with stretching and placebo ultrasound, by turns, once a week with a one-week minimum interval between them. RESULTS: There was greater symmetry of the masseter muscle electrical activity after ultrasound associated with stretching (p= 0. 03). The electromyographic values for the maximum <b>intercuspation</b> {{as well as the}} symmetry of anterior temporal muscle (p= 0. 47, p= 0. 84, p= 0. 84) and anteroposterior coefficient (p= 0. 07, p= 0. 84, p= 0. 57) showed no statistically significant difference after the intervention, placebo, ultrasound and ultrasound with stretching. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a single application of ultrasound and ultrasound associated with stretching were not able to modify the activity pattern of the masticatory muscles during maximum <b>intercuspation,</b> except the symmetry of the masseter muscle that increased with the last, in women with myogenic or mixed temporomandibular disorder...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjectives The study {{dealt with}} full dental {{prosthetic}} reconstruction on four implants. The {{aim was to}} analyse the influence of material parameters on the mechanical behaviour of the restored mandible compared to the natural mandible. Methods A finite element model of an edentulous mandible with prosthetic rehabilitation was established. Four materials were investigated for {{the framework of the}} prosthesis (zirconia, titanium, gold and nickel-titanium (NiTi)), as well as three cortical bone thicknesses. Various muscles were employed to simulate the main stages of mastication. Three distinct phases of mastication were modelled: maximum <b>intercuspation,</b> incisal clench and unilateral molar clench. Results The zirconia framework demonstrated the highest stresses and NiTi the weakest. The highest stresses in the framework were obtained during maximum <b>intercuspation.</b> The highest stresses at the bone-implant interface were recorded on the working axial implant during unilateral molar clench and on tilted implants during maximum <b>intercuspation.</b> The influence of the framework's material stiffness on the stresses at the bone-implant interface was insignificant for axial implants (except the right implant during unilateral molar clench) and slightly more significant for tilted implants. Mandibular flexion decreased with an increase of the cortical bone thickness and the stiffness of the prosthetic framework's material. Conclusions Among all materials, NiTi allowed a better preservation of the mandibular flexure, during all the mastication stages. Compared to stiffer materials, NiTi also permitted physiological mechanical conditions at the bone/implant interface, in almost all mastication stages...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this}} in vivo {{study was}} to {{investigate}} how reproducible individuals find their habitual <b>intercuspation.</b> METHODS: A new type of highly accurate measuring procedure was involved using an intraoral optical scanning device (Cerec Bluecam). First, a pilot test investigated the accuracy of the procedure within a standardized setting. With regard to the in vivo study, fifteen participants with full dentition were selected. For each of these individuals, eight scans were taken both in the morning and in the afternoon. Furthermore, during each session, scans were taken both in horizontal and upright position. In order to compare this to ubiquitous used processes, plaster replicas of five individuals were investigated as well. The scans were analysed, and the differences in the position of the lower jaw were calculated by a specialized superimposition program (n= 570 comparisons/OraCheck). RESULTS: The results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between the time of day and the position of the patient. The overall mean±SD value for locating the habitual <b>intercuspation</b> was 42 ± 34 μm, however ranging from 22 ± 9 μm to 77 ± 58 μm for single individuals. On the other hand, the differences in positioning plaster replicas reached a mean of 135 ± 77 μm. CONCLUSIONS: The reproducibility of the habitual <b>intercuspation</b> can be obtained under in vivo conditions by a newly developed and highly accurate measuring procedure. Individuals with full dentition show values in average of 42 μm. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Determining the occlusal jaw relation is an important precondition in restorative dentistry and many methods are proposed for a proper occlusal registration.

40|$|Dental {{occlusion}} varies among individuals, {{and achieving}} correct physiological occlusion after osteotomy {{is essential for}} the complex functioning of the stomatognathic system.

Occlusal information was evaluated for 30 healthy adults with normal occlusion and 40 patients undergoing orthognathic surgery. T-Scan had a high degree of reliability for consecutive measurements (Pearson correlation, r[*]=[*] 0. 98). For most parameters, occlusal distribution was better after surgery than before surgery. More teeth contributed to occlusion at maximum <b>intercuspation</b> after surgery than before surgery (14 vs. 10). In addition, the difference in the posterior force distribution was reduced after surgery (17. 6 [*]±[*] 13. 8 vs. 22. 7 [*]±[*] 21. 4 before surgery), indicating better occlusal force distribution after surgery. The maximum percentage force on teeth (p[*]=[*] 0. 004) and the number of teeth contributing to occlusion (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) also differed significantly.

Sequence of records is- at maximum <b>intercuspation</b> (MIP); in manual leading to central relation and in eccentric jaw movements. In the same sequence is investigated control group- 30 people (15 women and 15 men) aged between 21 and 45 who didn’t have bruxism and/or bruxomania and dentition is preserved. Results: In the control group 85 % of cases there is a balance of forces in both halves of the dental arch. In patients with bruxism is established uneven distribution of forces in MIP and articulation blockages (95 %). There are three major reasons that impede spontaneous bilateral closing- force outliers (93 % of cases); low force outliers (82 %) and presence of interceptive contacts and sliding occurring {{in the beginning of}} occlusion time until MIP (in all patients). Conclusions: In order to achieve a balanced occlusion in patients with bruxism and/or bruxomania required are correct diagnosis, registration and removal of preliminary contacts, articulation blockages and infraocclusion.

The sample of the study consisted of 10 asymptomatic young adult patients divided into two types of standard occlusion: normal occlusion and Angle Class I occlusion. In order to obtain the centric relation, a JIG device and mandible manipulation were used to deprogram the habitual conditions of the jaw.
