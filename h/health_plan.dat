In May 1999, {{he was named}} president and CEO of Harvard Vanguard's parent company, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a non-profit health benefits organization. The company had lost $58 million in 1998 and was predicted to lose over $90 million in 1999. Baker responded by cutting the workforce by 90 people, increasing premiums, establishing new contracts with Massachusetts physicians, reassessing the company's financial structure, and outsourcing its information technology. During his tenure as CEO, the company had 24 profitable quarters {{in a row and}} earned recognition from the National Committee for Quality Assurance as its choice for America's Best <b>Health</b> <b>Plan</b> for five straight years.|$|E

40|$|Background: Since 1994 formal <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> {{have been}} used for {{coordination}} of health care services between the regional and local level in Denmark. From 2007 a substantial reform has changed the administrative boundaries of the system and a new tool for coordination has been introduced. Purpose: To assess the use of the pre-reform <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> as a tool for strengthening coordination, quality and preventive efforts between the regional and local level of health care. Methods: A survey addressed to: all counties (n= 15), all municipalities (n= 271) and a randomised selected sample of general practitioners (n= 700). Results: The stakeholders at the administrative level agree that <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> have not been effective as a tool for coordination. The development of <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> are dominated by the regional level. At the functional level 27 percent of the general practitioners are not familiar with <b>health</b> <b>plans.</b> Among those familiar with <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> 61 percent report that <b>health</b> <b>plans</b> influence their work to only a lesser degree or not at all. Conclusion: Joint <b>health</b> <b>planning</b> is needed to achieve coordination of care. Efforts must be made to overcome barriers hampering efficient whole system planning. Active policies emphasising the necessity of <b>health</b> <b>planning,</b> despite involved cost, are warranted to insure delivery of care that benefits the health of the population...|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 2004, Fletcher {{proposed}} changes to the health benefits of state workers and retirees. Fletcher's plan provided discounts for members who engaged in healthier behavior, which he called a transition from a sickness initiative to a wellness initiative. Acknowledging that out-of-pocket expenses would rise, Fletcher proposed a 1% salary increase to offset the additional costs. State employees, particularly public school teachers, broadly opposed Fletcher's plan, and the Kentucky Educators Association called for an indefinite strike, to begin October 27, 2004. To address the opposition, Fletcher called a special session of the legislature to begin October 5, 2004. Although the state was still operating under an executive spending plan, Fletcher did not include the budget or his tax reform proposal in the session's agenda, a move praised by both parties, allowing them to focus only on concerns over the <b>health</b> <b>plan.</b> In a fifteen-day session, the General Assembly passed a plan that allocated $190 million more to health insurance for state workers and restored many of the most popular benefits in the previous insurance plan. Immediately after the session adjourned, the Kentucky Educators Association voted to cancel their proposed strike.|$|E

The new <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> also extends health benefits to unmarried heterosexual domestic partners of city employees. On October 10, 2006, the City Council approved an ordinance to prohibit smoking in public places, including restaurants and bars. The ordinance was passed with protest, and several amendments to the ordinance reflect this.

That is, 5 categories of health coverage can be considered separately, including dental and vision coverage.

Since limited-coverage plans are exempt from HIPAA requirements, the odd case exists in which the applicant to a general group <b>health</b> <b>plan</b> cannot obtain certificates of creditable continuous coverage for independent limited-scope plans such as dental to apply towards exclusion periods of the new plan that does include those coverages.|$|E
