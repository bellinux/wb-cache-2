40|$|Abstract—The {{coordination}} {{of a large}} group of robots to solve a specified task is a difficult problem. Centralized approaches can be computationally intractable, brittle, and unresponsive to change. Distributed approaches are not as prone to these problems, but they can be highly sub-optimal. This work introduces a novel economic approach for coordinating robots based on the free market system. The free market approach defines revenue and cost functions across the possible plans for executing a specified task. The task is accomplished by dividing it into sub-tasks and allowing the robots to bid and negotiate to carry out these sub-tasks. Cooperation and competition emerge as the robots execute the task while trying to maximize their personal profits. Initial simulation results indicate the approach is successful at producing effective global plans for a team of several robots performing an <b>interior</b> <b>sensing</b> task. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{takes up}} {{the topic of the}} <b>interior</b> <b>senses</b> and {{sensible}} cognition as elaborated by Dominic of Flanders, a fifteenth-century Dominican thinker, in his short commentary, Expositio super libros De anima. At a time when Averroistic Aristotelianism was flourishing, and as nominalism spread across the Continent, Dominic’s account of the soul and the <b>interior</b> <b>senses</b> demonstrates a commitment to Thomas Aquinas and, more broadly, scholastic realism. Dominic adopts the fourfold model of the internal senses advanced by Thomas. He carries forth Thomas’s insistence that the sensus communis is both the root (radix) and end (terminus) of sensitivity as such and the individual senses; he follows Thomas in privileging the cogitativa, and posits a more perfect form of memoria in man. Our study concludes by looking briefly at his Quaestiones in XII libros Metaphysica, where we find an innovative account of experimentum, which reveals the thought of a capable philosopher. status: publishe...|$|R

The essay proposes that our growing intimacy with cameras and screens, combined with an apparently intensifying imperative to perform ourselves to real or imagined audiences via various screen-based channels of mediation, could be said to be transforming us into postmodern "performing subjects"...|$|R

Whether it be from inside a house to the backyard, or from Kingston to Banff National Park, what enables each character’s quiet self-discovery is the movement from one place to another; in a sense, each character must be uprooted in order to grasp an <b>interior</b> <b>sense</b> of belonging. As the stories are predominantly set outdoors, they often depict encounters between protagonists and the wilderness in ways that reflect how fleeting moments can have the most richly complicated effects on the individual’s perception of the world.

40|$|This thesis re-investigates Clement Greenberg’s discredited {{abstract}} expressionist {{claim that}} painting should seek its own purity through the acknowledgment of its material. I argue that Greenberg’s physical, bodily determination of painting (but not its purity) is re-located as a criticality in contemporary practice {{because of the}} changes {{brought about by the}} simulacrum and the digital. By utilizing the particularities of ‘painterly’ issues such as materiality, depth and opticality into the virtual, this claim responds to Arthur C. Danto’s ‘end of history’ theories where he argues that artists are no longer bound to the dictates of grand master narratives of art. For Danto, contemporary art has irrevocably deviated from the narrative discourses which define it such as Greenberg’s. Not satisfied with either postmodern strategies of parody in painting that claim a linear end to the modernist canon, or with recent claims that contemporary painting is beyond postmodernism, I convert Greenberg’s physical determinism using Andrew Benjamin’s notion that contemporary abstract painters, through making, accept and transform the historical/modernist premise of the yet-to-be-resolved object/painting by staging a repetition of abstraction as an event of becoming. This ‘re-styling’ of abstract painting is then examined as an ontological conjoining of Greenberg with Merleau-Ponty’s claim that the painter transforms the relationship between the body and a painting by overlapping the <b>interior</b> <b>sense</b> of self with the world of external objects. I argue that contemporary painting can offer a philosophical dialogue between the painter’s subjectivity as a mirroring of the painter’s personal style through objective ornamental materiality. This dialogue is developed through Stephen Perrella’s Hypersurface theory which proposes a non-subjective, deterritorialised, architectural parallel of the digital as a transparent, fluid system of multi-dimensional signs in which the contemporary subject traverses. Consequently, I suggest, the symbolic virtual changes the body’s sensuous relation to time and space and is central to contemporary painting’s criticality.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} representation of self in the poetry of Violet Jacob (1863 - 1946) and Marion Angus (1865 - 1946), two Scottish poets who wrote primarily in Scots in the inter-war years. Until recently, many critics have dismissed the work of Jacob and Angus as 'minor' in its themes or significant only as it anticipates the Scots poetry of Hugh MacDiarmid. The general absence of their work from print, and the narrow range of their poems appearing in anthologies, support the impression that their poetry is limited in scope. This dissertation suggest that in fact their poetry makes {{a significant contribution to}} the development of Scottish poetry. Their work builds upon Scottish literary traditions, interpolating balladic form and language into their lyrics, and drawing upon the rich folksong and dramatic monologue traditions as models for representing voice and self. Folk belief, too, informs their work, providing a symbolic background for many poems. To indicate the depth to their work, the thesis considers their poetry in a range of broader, interrelated contexts. By situating their poetry within historical, sociological, and literary milieus, and by placing their poems within a continuum of Scottish writing, one can discern key tensions underlying and informing their work. As the predominance of first-person speakers in their poetry indicates, Jacob and Angus shared an interest in the psychology of the poetic self. Each poem offers a different representation of self, highlighting what the poetic self utters (or omits) in response to the world around it. Drawing upon a range of contemporaneous commentary and contemporary critical theory, the thesis analyzes how both poets portray the self in relation to its <b>interior</b> <b>sense</b> of time, its conception of space, and its interaction with other selves. The thesis falls into two parallel halves - the first devoted to an investigation of the self in Jacob's work, the second in Angus's. Key similarities and differences in each author's technique become evident in comparing their work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract According to researchers, radifs {{can be one}} of {{the main}} {{components}} of the ancient Persian poetry made by Iranian talent and muse. Radif as one of the pillars of the side music, has played a major role in classical Persian poetry, and Persian poets have  shown great  attention to composing  radif-consisting  poems, since ancient times. In the early Persian poetry, radif is used slightly but the more the Persian poetry completed, the more application of radif have seen, and gradually, poets intended to use simple types instead of those complicated. One of the poets who have shown special attention to using radif and its application forms are of high-frequency in his poems, is khaghani. In this essay, we have tried to analyze  Khaghani's poem statically. For this purpose, we have provided accurate statistics of the radif-consisting poems and those are not radif-consisting. We  studied various types of radifs in all khaghani's Divan as well. Then it is proved that the frequency of his radif-consisting poems is higher than the other with no radif. Statistical analysis shows that 815 of 1212 khaghani`s poems consist  radifs. This number  equals 20 / 68 % of his all poems. Study of radif in different form showes that poem with radif appreciably are more predominant than poems without radif. 81 / 77 % of Ghazels, 39 / 64 % of  odes, 88 / 54 % of  quatrains/rubais, 22 / 64 %  of fragments  and 66 / 79 % of his small odes have radif. The types of radif in Khaghani's poem includes: verb, noun (noun phrase), letters, adverbs, pronouns, adjectives and phrases, or sentences (such as overnight). But the verb type (70 %) is mostly used in his poetry. In this article  we discussed the functions of radif in khaghani' poems and concluded that the main functions of  radif in his poetry are as follows: 1 - Creating unity between poet and audience When the reader can guess the word (or phrase) in a particular situation, he will find himself as a contributor in composing poet. 2 -  coordination of radif with theme and motif Coordination of radif and poetry is of high importance in view of the great poets such as khaghani. Of course, creating such a figure seems to be elaborate especially in long odes. Keeping this coordination needs a strong sense and high capacity that khaghani have. 3 - Creating new figures of thoughts and speeches Repeatition of radifs in Khaghani`s poem created new themes and combinations. Forozanfar says: "khaghani is among the great poets of Iran in inventing of combinations and pleasant ironies"(Forozanfar, 1384 : 617) 4 -  Foregrounding an image or theme One of the aims of radif is foregrounding the poet repeat a word, theme or image in order to highlight and make it important. Special position of radif in the end of poem and the pause after or before it increases emphasis and focus on it. 5 - Inducing the <b>interior</b> <b>sense</b> of poem Poet sometimes repeats a word or phrase in the poem sequence and  aims at inducing an <b>interior</b> <b>sense</b> to the audience. Sadness, happiness, hope, hopelessness, and any other senses are conveyable through these repetitions. 6 - Unifying thought and imagination Poet with the help of radif leads the poem to a unique thought for example, khaghani in one poem selected word "safahan" as radif  to highlight it, and establish poetic concepts about this city until the end as well. 7 - Strengthening the music of poetry Musical function of  radif  is featured in khaghani's  poem and he used these radifs beautifully with the aim of making  his poem melodious and musically rich. 8 - Creating visual pleasure Sometimes the writing form of radif in khaghani's poem - specially in the long noun and verb type of  radifs  - creates a visual balance and pleasure for reader. At the end, we should say that the Divan of  poetry  of  any poet (except for Mowlavi) is not like khaghani's, because of  containing diverse images and new radifs...|$|R

The Bible though sees a man as a complete whole, in which the soul, {{the spirit and the}} body are described as certain aspects of the functioning of this whole, and not its autonomous parts. A man is also understood as predestined by God to be saved thanksto the redemptory mission of the Messiah – Jesus Christ. Apostle Paul introduces the idea that a man consists of the body, the spirit and thesoul.

The mind tends to God,it can purify itself of the evil and introduce and maintain the holiness coming from God. The Fathers of the Philocalia considered the heart asthe spiritual centre of the human person directly engaged in the spiritual warfare, and its purification considered as an indispensable condition of man’s transformation. God loves man, He created him on His image, gave him freedom and calls him unceasingly to the completion of the divine likeness – that is to the natural participation in the divine life. During the earthly life this participation is attained by a slow process of elevation aboveone’s own limits and opening oneself to the action of the uncreatedenergies of God. This process implies the purification of the hole humanbeing by an ascetic effort in order to overcome the sinfulness. Ascesis inChristianity is understood as a practice of renouncements, aiming at thespiritual freedom of any disordered attachement to the created reality. Monastic ascesis is a complete renouncement, a constant crucifying ofoneself in order to fight with the passions, to keep God’s commandmentsand to acquire virtues. This ascesis had different forms, of which themost important and significant is the practicing of the “pure prayer”,“the prayer of the heart” which helps a man to purify himself of thepassions and acquire the knowledge of God, the ultimate peace and the contemplation of God. </p...|$|R

McCarthy did not wish to continue to build in the now unfashionable Perpendicular Gothic of Duff. His solution was to start building a Decorated Gothic Cathedral of the fourteenth century on top of the purportedly sixteenth century foundations and walls. Decorated Gothic tracery was inserted into the existing window openings and at the West end, he reduced the size of the traceried window and inserted below it an arcade of apostolic statues. The pitch of Duff's roof was raised a full 20 ft, adding greatly to the exterior impact of the building and permitting the insertion of clerestory and triforium to the <b>interior.</b> A <b>sense</b> of drama was added to the transepts by the addition of asymerical spired turrets to their ends and the addition of rose windows to their gables.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to provide}} an accurate, concrete and complete account {{of the human body}} in St. Thomas's mature texts in order to show that St. Thomas ascribed to the human body a rich and important causality which contributes positively to human existence. As St. Thomas inscribes his anthropology in an Aristotelian framework, a first section (Chapters 1 and 2) is devoted to an examination of Aristotle's views on matter and the body. The second section is, then, devoted to the human body in St. Thomas's anthropology. Chapter 3 examines St. Thomas's general anthropology from the 'viewpoint of soul', outlining his adoption of Aristotle's hylomorphic theory as regards human beings and paying particular attention to points on which his analysis differs from that of Aristotle. Chapter 4 sets forth the methodology we employ in our examination of the human body in St. Thomas's philosophy. Before studying the human body from the 'viewpoint of body', we first address, in Chapter 5, the issues of human individuation in St. Thomas's philosophy and of Aquinas's views on the elements. In regards to the question of matter being the principle of individuation, we argue that St. Thomas distinguishes two sorts of 'individuation' and that, although materia signata is the cause of our being unum de numero (which is one kind of 'individuation'), it is not the cause of our being unum numero (esse being the principle of this kind of 'individuation'). Regarding elemental change and the composition of the elements, we show that, according to St. Thomas, elements are composed of substantial form and prime matter, that their changes are not accidental but substantial (i. e., involve generation and corruption) and that the qualities or powers of a corrupted element remain virtually in the composite. Chapters 6 - 8 then study the human body from the 'viewpoint of body', examining the causality of matter in each level of life: vegetative (Chapter 6), sensitive (Chapter 7) and intellective (Chapter 8). At the vegetative level, the role of matter in generation, nutrition and growth is discussed, as is St. Thomas's doctrine regarding the necessary qualities of the human body. In Chapter 7, the causality of matter in sensation is examined in regards to (a) organs and faculties; (b) the exterior senses (of which the sense of touch is primary and, for this reason, will be the focus of our discussion); (c) the functions of the human heart with respect to our vital operations, movement and erect position; (d) the <b>interior</b> <b>senses</b> and their relation to the structure of the human brain; and (e) appetites and emotions. The final chapter, Chapter 8, then examines the causality of matter at the level of intellective life. There we show that the human soul requires matter (more precisely, a human body) to acquire knowledge, exercise its acquired knowledge and to make particular decisions. As St. Thomas's views regarding the nature of man and the causality of matter have important implications for the separated state of the soul and, also, as regards the resurrection of the body, we discuss these implications, examine the consistency of St. Thomas's position with the assumptions of his anthropology and his theory of knowledge and argue that causality he ascribes to the material dimension of human beings is truly significant, extending even to our final beatitude.

We show that many of the newly developed global vorticity boundary conditions can actually be written as some local formulas derived earlier. We also show that if we couple a standard centered difference scheme with 3 rd or 4 th order explicit Runge-Kutta methods, the resulting schemes have no cell Reynolds number constraints. For high Reynolds number flows, these schemes are stable under the CFL condition given by the convective terms. Finally we show that the classical MAC scheme is the same as Thom’s formula coupled with second order centered differences in the <b>interior,</b> in the <b>sense</b> that one can define discrete vorticity in a natural way for the MAC scheme, and get the same values as the ones computed from Thom’s formula. We use this to derive an efficient 4 th order Runge-Kutta time discretization for the MAC scheme from the one for Thom’s formula. We present numerical results for driven cavity flow at high Reynolds number (105) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} passive {{magnetic}} shielding on dc magnetic field gradients imposed by both {{external and internal}} sources is studied. It is found that for concentric cylindrical or spherical shells of high permeability material, higher order multipoles in the magnetic field are shielded progressively better, by a factor related {{to the order of}} the multipole. In regard to the design of internal coil systems for the generation of uniform internal fields, we show how one {{can take advantage of the}} coupling of the coils to the innermost magnetic shield to further optimize the uniformity of the field. These results demonstrate quantitatively a phenomenon that was previously well-known qualitatively: that the resultant magnetic field within a passively magnetically shielded region can be much more uniform than the applied magnetic field itself. Furthermore we provide formulae relevant to active magnetic compensation systems which attempt to stabilize the <b>interior</b> fields by <b>sensing</b> and cancelling the exterior fields close to the outermost magnetic shielding layer. Overall this work provides a comprehensive framework needed to analyze and optimize dc magnetic shields, serving as a theoretical and conceptual design guide as well as a starting point and benchmark for finite-element analysis.

2500|$|Artist Juli Kearns first {{identified}} and created maps of spatial discrepancies {{in the overall}} layout of the Overlook Hotel location, the interiors of which were constructed in studios in England. These spatial discrepancies included windows appearing in impossible places, such as in Stuart Ullman's office which is surrounded by interior hallways, and apartment doorways positioned in places where they cannot possibly lead to apartments. Rob Ager is another proponent of this theory. Jan Harlan, an Executive Producer on The Shining, {{was asked about the}} discontinuity of sets by Xan Brooks of The Guardian and confirmed the discontinuity was intentional, [...] "The set was very deliberately built to be offbeat and off the track, so that the huge ballroom would never actually fit inside. The audience is deliberately made not to know where they're going. People say The Shining doesn't make sense. Well spotted! It's a ghost movie. It's not supposed to make sense." [...] Harlan further elaborated to Kate Abbot for the same newspaper, [...] "Stephen King gave him the go-ahead to change his book, so Stanley agreed – and wrote a much more ambiguous script. It's clear instantly there's something foul going on. At the little hotel, everything is like Disney, all kitsch wood on the outside – but the <b>interiors</b> don't make <b>sense.</b> Those huge corridors and ballrooms couldn't fit inside. In fact, nothing makes sense." ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOn November 12, 2014, the Philae module {{landed on}} the surface of the nucleus of 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Among the {{instruments}} on-board Philae, the Permittivity Probe experiment (hereafter PP-SESAME), which is part of the SESAME (Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic Monitoring Experiment) package, operated both during descent and on the surface. The primary scientific objective of this experiment is to measure the low frequency (10 Hz- 10 kHz) complex permittivity i. e. the dielectric constant and electrical conductivity, of the first meters of the cometary nucleus. Doing so, it aims at providing insights into the composition of the mantle and in particular into the water content and porosity of the first meters below the surface. In this paper, we will present the data acquired at the final landing site of Philae known as Abydos and the approach we have developed to analyze them. We emphasize that, because the configuration of operation of PP-SESAME was far from nominal, we had to adapt our analysis method in order to account for all available constraints on Philae attitude and environment at Abydos. We also had to do without the in-flight calibration performed during the descent phase but unfortunately perturbed by the concurrent operations of the bistatic radar CONSERT. We find that the first meters of the nucleus at Abydos are made of a likely pure dielectric material (i. e. with a null conductivity) which dielectric constant is larger than 2. 3. This lower bound of the dielectric constant is significantly higher than the value of 1. 27 inferred from the propagation time of the CONSERT signals that propagated through the smaller lobe of the comet in the vicinity of Abydos reaching depths of a few hundreds of meters. Thus, while PP-SESAME measurements put no constraint on the dust-to-ice ratio, they strongly suggest that the first meters of the nucleus are significantly more compacted (with a porosity below 50 %) than its <b>interior</b> as <b>sensed</b> by CONSERT (found to have a porosity in of 75 to 85 %, consistent with the low density of the nucleus). In light of other Philae and Rosetta observations, we will discuss the implications of these findings in terms of formation and evolution of cometary mantles...|$|R
40|$|Autobiographical {{documentary}} films {{involve the}} first-person recollection by filmmakers {{of events that}} have shaped their identity. Frequently in autobiographical documentaries {{there is a sense}} of poignancy in the process of looking back at the past, a sense of yearning for that which is gone, even if that past was not always positive when it originally occurred. What is the nature of this yearning for the past inherent in the process of articulating autobiographical experience, and how can the emotion in the process of re-approaching past experiences be expressed in the most moving way possible in the autobiographical documentary? In the retelling of lived events, the autobiographical documentary filmmaker frequently finds it important to communicate a sense of the way their identity in the present has emotionally coloured the tone and emphasis of their memory of the past event. In this way there is frequently a self-reflexive subjectivity to autobiographical documentaries that allows the filmmaker to evoke his or her own attitude to the remembered past and, increasingly, incorporates into the film’s discourse an implicit questioning of the ability of the representation process to provide access to an authentic sense of the past. This thesis will examine ways this aspect of memory can be movingly evoked in autobiographical documentaries. Much of this process of detailing the emotional resonance that memory holds for the filmmaker involves evoking interior emotional states, for which it is difficult to provide the same sort of visual evidence that is an integral component of documentary discourse when making claims about the external world. This project aims to investigate the sophisticated poetics that has developed in the autobiographical documentary form regarding the depiction of the past. How can cinematography, editing, voiceover, and sound design work in an imaginative, poetic way to express the sense of nostalgia, mourning, and the self-reflexive questioning of the process of representation that frequently characterizes the discourses of autobiographical documentaries? Can an <b>interior,</b> subjective <b>sense</b> of memory be communicated through creative means in a discourse that is conventionally focused on concretely verifiable facts about the external world? This thesis closely analyses the specific ways in which fourteen significant documentaries evoke a subjective sense of autobiographical memory, and how the filmmakers responsible for these particular films have depicted a sense of the crisis of the ability of autobiographical documentary to provide access to an authentic past through the articulation of memory.

40|$|I {{believe that}} the final design of the Café/Bookshop/Record Store could work well in Amsterdam. The use of the {{building}} mostly targets the city’s young demographic, from people on their lunch break, to music lovers and backpackers. The building is a centre for Dutch culture for both residents and tourists. The idea of the building is based on existing café/bookstores in Sydney. The inclusion of a record store stems from a café in Buenos Aires, which combines music records with a coffee shop. The use of semi-levels was inspired by industrial warehouses, which feature the offices and amenities on a mezzanine to maximise storage space. In my opinion, the most successful aspect of the design {{is the use of}} semi-levels to separate spaces. By raising and lowering half-levels I was able to create a differentiation between areas without using walls or other elements that might restrict the view. Furthermore, the use of levels instead of walls embeds the <b>interior</b> with a <b>sense</b> of spaciousness. This separation also emphasises the concept of the building in three phases: an outdoor area, an indoor café and lastly a relaxing area at the back. Designing in Amsterdam was an enjoyable yet challenging experience. I chose a site that would present typical building issues associated with the city, such as narrow sites and little natural light and ventilation. I am happy with how the design addresses the need for natural light, especially near the reading areas. However I would have liked to include a method of natural ventilation, as the façade cannot be opened to the exterior. If I were to continue this design further, I would add a rear courtyard to the building, as I believe it would enhance the concept of stages. Nonetheless I am satisfied with my response to the design problem and am positive that it could work in Amsterdam. BDES 1020 (Architecture Studio 102...|$|R
