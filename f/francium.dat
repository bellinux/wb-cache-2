5|$|<b>Francium</b> coprecipitates {{with several}} caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, {{which results in}} small amounts of <b>francium</b> perchlorate. This coprecipitation {{can be used to}} isolate <b>francium,</b> by {{adapting}} the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which provides other methods of separation. Nearly all <b>francium</b> salts are water-soluble.|$|E
5|$|<b>Francium</b> is also {{predicted}} {{to show some}} differences due to its high atomic weight, causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions {{of the speed of}} light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent. In contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation energy are {{predicted to}} be higher than caesium's due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons; also, its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low. Thus, contrary to expectation, caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals, not <b>francium.</b> All known physical properties of <b>francium</b> also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium, such as the first ionisation energy, electron affinity, and anion polarisability, though due to the paucity of known data about <b>francium</b> many sources give extrapolated values, ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become inapplicable at <b>francium.</b> Some of the few properties of <b>francium</b> that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity (47.2 kJ/mol) and the enthalpy of dissociation of the Fr2 molecule (42.1 kJ/mol). The CsFr molecule is polarised as Cs+Fr−, showing that the 7s subshell of <b>francium</b> is much more strongly affected by relativistic effects than the 6s subshell of caesium. Additionally, <b>francium</b> superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have significant covalent character, unlike the other alkali metal superoxides, because of bonding contributions from the 6p electrons of <b>francium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Linus Pauling {{estimated}} the electronegativity of <b>francium</b> at 0.7 on the Pauling scale, {{the same as}} caesium; the value for caesium has since been refined to 0.79, {{but there are no}} experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for <b>francium.</b> <b>Francium</b> has a slightly higher ionization energy than caesium, 392.811(4)kJ/mol as opposed to 375.7041(2)kJ/mol for caesium, as would be expected from relativistic effects, and this would imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two. <b>Francium</b> should also have a higher electron affinity than caesium and the Fr− ion should be more polarizable than the Cs− ion. The CsFr molecule is predicted to have <b>francium</b> at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. <b>Francium</b> superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in <b>francium</b> being more involved in the francium–oxygen bonding.|$|E
5|$|<b>Francium's</b> {{ability to}} be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its {{relatively}} simple atomic structure, has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|R
500|$|The {{alkali metals}} can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens (sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), {{and all the}} alkali metal {{chalcogenides}} are known (with the exception of <b>francium's).</b> Reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides, with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question. For example, sodium can react with sulfur to form the sulfide (Na2S) and various polysulfides with the formula Na2Sx (x from 2 to 6), containing the [...] ions. Due to the basicity of the Se2− and Te2− ions, the alkali metal selenides and tellurides are alkaline in solution; when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium, alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the [...] and [...] ions. They may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present, and are colourless, water-soluble compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium or tellurium. The alkali metal polonides are all ionic compounds containing the Po2− ion; they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around 300–400°C.|$|R
5|$|Francium-223, {{the only}} {{naturally}} occurring isotope of <b>francium,</b> {{is the product}} of the alpha decay of actinium-227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium minerals. In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one <b>francium</b> atom for every 1018 uranium atoms. It has been calculated that there is at most 30g of <b>francium</b> in the earth's crust at any time, due to its extremely short half-life of 22 minutes.|$|E
5|$|There are 34 known {{isotopes}} of <b>francium</b> {{ranging in}} atomic mass from 199 to 232. <b>Francium</b> has seven metastable nuclear isomers. Francium-223 and francium-221 {{are the only}} isotopes that occur in nature, though the former is far more common.|$|E
5|$|This process, {{developed}} by Stony Brook Physics, yields <b>francium</b> isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211, {{which are then}} isolated by the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The production rate of a particular isotope depends on {{the energy of the}} oxygen beam. An 18O beam from the Stony Brook LINAC creates 210Fr in the gold target with the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5n. The production required some time to develop and understand. It was critical to operate the gold target very close to its melting point {{and to make sure that}} its surface was very clean. The nuclear reaction embeds the <b>francium</b> atoms deep in the gold target, and they must be removed efficiently. The atoms quickly diffuse to the surface of the gold target and are released as ions, but this does not happen every time. The <b>francium</b> ions are guided by electrostatic lenses until they land in a surface of hot yttrium and become neutral again. The <b>francium</b> is then injected into a glass bulb. A magnetic field and laser beams cool and confine the atoms. Although the atoms remain in the trap for only about 20 seconds before escaping (or decaying), a steady stream of fresh atoms replaces those lost, keeping the number of trapped atoms roughly constant for minutes or longer. Initially, about 1000 <b>francium</b> atoms were trapped in the experiment. This was gradually improved and the setup is capable of trapping over 300,000 neutral atoms of <b>francium</b> a time. These are neutral metallic atoms in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Enough <b>francium</b> is trapped that a video camera can capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce. The atoms appear as a glowing sphere about 1 millimeter in diameter. This was the first time that anyone had ever seen <b>francium.</b> The researchers can now make extremely sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms, providing the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in <b>francium.</b> Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions. <b>Francium</b> has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>francium</b> is the {{heaviest}} alkali metal {{that has been}} discovered, {{there has been some}} theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first period 8 element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after <b>francium</b> and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties. Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or <b>francium.</b> This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and <b>francium.</b> This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for <b>francium.</b> This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects. The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium. On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C.|$|E
5|$|Astatine is an {{extremely}} radioactive element; all its isotopes have short half-lives of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into other astatine isotopes, bismuth, polonium or radon. Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of one second or less. Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only <b>francium</b> is less stable, and all the astatine isotopes more stable than <b>francium</b> are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|Bulk <b>francium</b> {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general {{appearance}} of the other elements in its periodic table column, {{it is assumed that}} <b>francium</b> would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E
5|$|<b>Francium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolFr and atomic number87. It {{used to be}} known as eka-caesium and actinium K. It is the second-least electronegative element, behind only caesium, and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine). <b>Francium</b> is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, radium, and radon. As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of ununennium {{is predicted to}} be {{similar to that of the}} alkali metals, but it would probably behave more like potassium or rubidium than caesium or <b>francium.</b> This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects, would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and <b>francium.</b> This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilization of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionization energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for <b>francium.</b> the {{chemistry of}} ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of <b>francium.</b> On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue+ ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilized and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other alkali metal, in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilization and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionization energy than what would otherwise be expected. Many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding: this effect is also seen to a lesser extent in <b>francium,</b> which shows some 6p3/2 contribution to the bonding in <b>francium</b> superoxide (FrO2). Thus, instead of ununennium being the most electropositive element, as a simple extrapolation would seem to indicate, caesium instead retains this position, with ununennium's electronegativity most likely being close to sodium's (0.93 on the Pauling scale). The standard reduction potential of the Uue+/Uue couple is predicted to be −2.9V.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its extreme rarity in nature, most <b>francium</b> is {{synthesised}} in the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5 n, yielding francium-209, francium-210, and francium-211. The greatest quantity of <b>francium</b> ever assembled to date is about 300,000 neutral atoms, which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above. When the only natural isotope francium-223 is specifically required, it is produced as the alpha daughter of actinium-227, itself produced synthetically from the neutron irradiation of natural radium-226, one of the daughters of natural uranium-238.|$|E
5|$|<b>Francium</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{unstable}} of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of only 22minutes. The only comparable element is astatine, whose most stable natural isotope, astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56seconds, although synthetic astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1hours. All isotopes of <b>francium</b> decay into astatine, radium, or radon. Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived isotope of each synthetic element up to and including element 105, dubnium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Francium</b> was {{discovered}} by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis. Outside the laboratory, <b>francium</b> is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores, where the isotope francium-223 continually forms and decays. As little as 20–30g (one ounce) exists {{at any given time}} throughout the Earth's crust; the other isotopes (except for francium-221) are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{alkali metals}} except lithium and caesium {{have at least}} one {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope: sodium-22 and sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur naturally, and all isotopes of <b>francium</b> are radioactive. Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century, although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes. (<b>Francium</b> had not been discovered yet at that time.) The natural long-lived radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of natural potassium, and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive. This natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925. Natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive, with 27.83% being the long-lived radioisotope rubidium-87.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{discovered}} {{alkali metals}} occur in nature as their compounds: {{in order of}} abundance, sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally <b>francium,</b> which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity; <b>francium</b> occurs only in the minutest traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium (Uue), {{which is likely to}} be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects, which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration, which results in weak metallic bonding. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities, melting and boiling points, as well as heats of sublimation, vaporisation, and dissociation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. The ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii, as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy. Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of <b>francium</b> is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about <b>francium</b> shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of <b>francium</b> are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Francium</b> has no {{commercial}} applications, {{but because}} of francium's relatively simple atomic structure, among other things, {{it has been used}} in spectroscopy experiments, leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels, similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|E
5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable isotope, with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and {{it is highly unlikely}} that an isotope of <b>francium</b> with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149keV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4MeV decay energy).|$|E
5|$|Perey {{named the}} new isotope actinium-K (it is now {{referred}} to as francium-223) and in 1946, she proposed the name catium (Cm) for her newly discovered element, as she believed {{it to be the}} most electropositive cation of the elements. Irène Joliot-Curie, one of Perey's supervisors, opposed the name due to its connotation of cat rather than cation; furthermore, the symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to curium. Perey then suggested <b>francium,</b> after France. This name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1949, becoming the second element after gallium to be named after France. It was assigned the symbol Fa, but this abbreviation was revised to the current Fr shortly thereafter. <b>Francium</b> was the last element discovered in nature, rather than synthesized, following hafnium and rhenium. Further research into francium's structure was carried out by, among others, Sylvain Lieberman and his team at CERN in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The first 94 {{elements}} occur naturally; {{the remaining}} 24, americium to oganesson (95–118) occur only when synthesized in laboratories. Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are primordial and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements. No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) {{has ever been}} observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine (element 85); <b>francium</b> (element 87) has been only photographed {{in the form of}} light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).|$|E
5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and <b>francium.</b> Each of these elements has one valence electron in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns1), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the alkali metals are very reactive elements. Ununennium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s1. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.|$|E
5|$|<b>Francium</b> is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was calculated to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E
5|$|In the gas phase, and at {{very low}} {{temperatures}} in the condensed phase, the alkali metals form covalently bonded diatomic molecules. The metal–metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from Li2 to Cs2, but then decrease after that to Uue2, due to the aforementioned relativistic effects that stabilize the 8s orbital. The opposite trend is shown for the metal–metal bond-dissociation energies. The Uue–Uue bond should be slightly stronger than the K–K bond. From these M2 dissociation energies, the enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) of ununennium is predicted to be 94kJ·mol−1 (the value for <b>francium</b> should be around 77kJ·mol−1).|$|E
5|$|Soviet chemist D. K. Dobroserdov was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to claim to have found eka-caesium, or <b>francium.</b> In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity {{in a sample of}} potassium, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, potassium-40). He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element russium after his home country. Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of Odessa, and he did not pursue the element further.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are a group (column) in the {{periodic}} table consisting of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and <b>francium</b> (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of {{the periodic table}} of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide {{the best example of}} group trends in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} of the hydrogen-like ununennium atom—oxidized so it {{has only}} one electron, Uue118+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.99 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like <b>francium</b> is 1.29 and the figure for hydrogen-like caesium is 1.091. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 240pm, very close to that of rubidium (247pm); the metallic radius is also correspondingly lowered to 260pm. The ionic radius of Uue+ {{is expected to be}} 180pm.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{is nearly}} half as dense as uranium and plutonium, and is harder {{than either of}} them. It becomes superconductive below 1.4K. Thorium's melting point of 1750°C is above both those of {{actinium}} (1227°C) and protactinium (1568°C). In the beginning of period 7, from <b>francium</b> to thorium, the melting points of the elements increase (as in other periods), {{because the number of}} delocalised electrons each atom contributes increases from one in <b>francium</b> to four in thorium, leading to greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one to four. After thorium, there is a new downward trend in melting points from thorium to plutonium. The number of f electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6, due to the itinerance of the f-orbitals, increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals, and the formation of directional bonds resulting in more complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding. (The f-electron count for thorium is a non-integer due to a 5f–6d overlap.) Among the actinides, thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density; actinium is lighter. Thorium's boiling point of 4788°C is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points, behind osmium, tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Mendeleev {{published}} his periodic {{table in a}} new form, with groups of similar elements arranged in columns rather than in rows, and those columns numbered I to VIII corresponding with the element's oxidation state. He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing, but should exist. These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional naturally occurring elements. It is often stated that the last naturally occurring element to be discovered was <b>francium</b> (referred to by Mendeleev as eka-caesium) in 1939. However, plutonium, produced synthetically in 1940, was identified in trace quantities as a naturally occurring element in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Radioisotopes of caesium {{require special}} precautions: the {{improper}} handling of caesium-137 gamma ray sources {{can lead to}} release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic {{in the city of}} Goiânia, Brazil, was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with caesium-134, iodine-131, and strontium-90, caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the Chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health. Radioisotopes of <b>francium</b> would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.|$|E
5|$|The Uue–Au bond {{should be}} the weakest of all bonds between gold and an alkali metal, but should still be stable. This gives {{extrapolated}} medium-sized adsorption enthalpies (−ΔHads) of 106kJ·mol−1 on gold (the <b>francium</b> value should be 136kJ·mol−1), 76kJ·mol−1 on platinum, and 63kJ·mol−1 on silver, the smallest of all the alkali metals, that demonstrate {{that it would be}} feasible to study the chromatographic adsorption of ununennium onto surfaces made of noble metals. The enthalpy of adsorption of ununennium on a Teflon surface is predicted to be 17.6kJ·mol−1, which would be the lowest among the alkali metals: this information would be very useful for future chemistry experiments on ununennium. The ΔHsub and −ΔHads values are not proportionally related for the alkali metals, as they change in opposite directions as atomic number increases.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, <b>francium</b> is expected to be an exception.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower the}} values of {{ionization}} energy, electronegativity and electron affinity, the more metallic character the element has. Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties. Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period (or row) and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and relativistic effects, tends to increase going down a group (or column or family). Thus, the most metallic elements (such as caesium and <b>francium)</b> are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements (oxygen, fluorine, chlorine) at the top right. The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped dividing line between metals and nonmetals found on some periodic tables, {{and the practice of}} sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|There were {{at least}} four {{erroneous}} and incomplete discoveries before Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris, France discovered <b>francium</b> in 1939 by purifying a sample of actinium-227, which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220keV. However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80keV. Perey thought this decay activity might {{have been caused by}} a previously unidentified decay product, one that was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the alpha decay of actinium-227. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure that she later revised to 1%.|$|E
