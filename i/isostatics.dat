40|$|Abstract. Selective Laser Sintering could {{manufacture}} high complex {{metal parts}} in short time but with high porosity and low strength. The components from Cold <b>Isostatic</b> Pressing have excellent performance with uniform organizational structure, high size precision, and high density. It, however, could not form high complex parts {{because of the}} difficulties of bag manufacture. So {{it will be a}} good method to combine Selective Laser Sintering and Cold <b>Isostatic</b> Pressing to make complicated metal parts. In this paper, the specimens of stainless steel were made by the combined Selective Laser Sintering and Cold <b>Isostatic</b> Pressing forming route. And the simulation of Cold <b>Isostatic</b> Pressing was carried out by finite element method and Drucker-Prager-Cap constitutive model in ABAQUS/Explicit computer program. The property of metal powder was measured by experiments. The effects of bag on Cold <b>Isostatic</b> Pressing have been discussed. It is different from the Cold <b>Isostatic</b> Pressing of metal powder that the bag has little influence on both shape and size of the specimen. The results of simulation show a good agreement between the experimental results and the calculated results. The simulation can give a useful direction to dimension and shape designs of the combined forming of Selective Laser Sintering and Cold <b>Isostatic</b> Pressing...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} elastic {{properties}} of thermal networks of Hookean springs. In the purely mechanical limit, such systems {{are known to}} have a vanishing rigidity when their connectivity falls below a critical, <b>isostatic</b> value. In this work, we show that thermal networks exhibit a nonzero shear modulus G well below the <b>isostatic</b> point and that this modulus exhibits an anomalous, sublinear dependence on temperature T. At the <b>isostatic</b> point, G increases as the square root of T, while we find GaTα below the <b>isostatic</b> point, where α 0. 8.

40|$|A {{new method}} which {{involves}} {{the determination of}} {{a function of the}} complex variable representing the field of <b>isostatics</b> is used for the solution of stress distribution in rectangular bars compressed by uniformly distributed normal loads. This function is determined to have a convenient form for the expression of boundary conditions by simple relations. The Schwarz-Christoffel transformation is used for the definition of the function mapping the <b>isostatics</b> from the half space to the rectangular bars. Conformal mapping introduces normal stresses to the longitudinal boundaries of the bar. Elimination of these stresses is obtained by using a method of multiple Fourier series {{in a part of the}} bar. Stresses are calculated on the boundaries, the axis of symmetry and five sections at the neighbourhood of the load. Four cases are considered with various ratios of the loading interval to the width of the bar. © 1964...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{solves the}} problem, {{in a closed}} form, of the stress {{distribution}} in an infinite plate containing two collinear and transverse edge-cracks, subjected to an axial loading at infinity. The distribution of stresses and displacements all over the cracked plate was effectively solved by applying the method of <b>isostatics,</b> {{as it has been}} developed by the author in 1959. The solution of the problem was formulated as a Boussinesq-type problem, where the ligament between the symmetric edge cracks corresponded to the constant displacement zone of the rigid punch. The stress distribution in the cracked plate was expressed by an analytic function of the complex variable, which represented the field of <b>isostatics</b> (i. e. the principal stress trajectories). The advantage of the method over all other existing solutions is that it gives the components of stresses all over the field with the same degree of accuracy, based on a closed-form type of solution. These stresses are given in graphical form along characteristic sections of the plate. Therefore, the method is proved effective for solving completely the problem of externally cracked plates with the same accuracy, as the closed-form solution of an internal crack. The advantages of this fact may be appreciated when one has to find out crack opening displacements all over the lengths of the cracks and, in general, needs data outside the close neighbourhood of the crack tips. © 1986 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

40|$|Stress {{paths in}} {{granular}} matter often suffer sudden large-scale rearrangements {{when the system}} is slightly perturbed, i. e. granular systems are unstable. We show in this paper that the observed instability {{is due to the}} minimally rigid, or <b>isostatic,</b> character of the system's contact network. It is first demonstrated that the contact network of a granular packing becomes <b>isostatic</b> (minimally rigid) in any dimension in the limit of large stiffness-to-load ratio. We next show that, in this <b>isostatic</b> limit, the load-stress response function becomes power-law distributed and takes exponentially large (growing as exp(H) where H is the system's height) positive and negative values. Large negative values of the load-stress response function imply instability, since only positive (compressive) stresses are allowed in non-cohesive granular packings. Thus there is an <b>isostatic</b> phase transition in the limit of large stiffness (or small load), and the resulting <b>isostatic</b> phase has an anomalously large susceptibility to perturbation.

40|$|The <b>isostatic</b> {{residual}} map better images short wavelength structures {{within the}} upper crust {{that are of}} interest in this study. However, the continued presence of long wavelength anomalies in the <b>isostatic</b> residual map indicates that the region containing the study area is either not in <b>isostatic</b> equilibrium or assumptions used in the determination of the <b>isostatic</b> correction are not entirely valid (e. g. the crust is not responding in an Airy manner with effect elastic thickness Te= 0) or there are density variations in the upper mantle. The long wavelength anomalies seen in the <b>isostatic</b> residual map are negative anomaly to the southeast of the Cover Rocks and positive anomaly to the north and northeast of the Cover Rocks. To effectively eliminate the dominating effect of these anomalies, the <b>isostatic</b> residual anomaly map has been further corrected by the Decompensative correction. Decompensative anomalies are considered to be produced in the main by density inhomogeneities in the upper 15 - 20 km of the crust. The <b>Isostatic</b> correction has eliminated the gravity compensating effect of topography but other long wavelength gravity effects due to features not accounted for in the Airy model remain. The decompensative correction attempts to remove the anomalies associated with sources deeper than the crust. These gravity effects are isolated by upward continuation. Therefore, the <b>isostatic</b> residual anomaly has been upward continued to 40 km so that the resulting field due to sources at or deeper than 40 km can be estimated. The resultant decompensative anomalies can be assumed to be produced mainly by density inhomogeneities in the upper 15 - 20 km of the crust.
