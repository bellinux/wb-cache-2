Much of the work using these sensors involves working in either the static or the dynamic mode, however there is little work described in the literature involving the use of the two modes in parallel. This thesis describes the development of a dual-mode microcantilever-based sensing platform for applications of quantitative biosensing in a liquid.

The <b>dual-mode</b> <b>device</b> includes {{a body of}} semiconductor material having opposed from and rear facets.

An at least partially optically reflective surface is positioned a first predetermined distance from one of the facets during operation of the device in the amplification mode. In the signal generation mode, the at least partially optically reflective surface is positioned a second predetermined distance from the one facet so as to induce optical oscillation within the body of semiconductor material. In a preferred implementation, a semiconductor diode laser having opposed first and second facets is utilized as an optical source. An at least partially optically reflective surface is positioned a predetermined distance from one of the first and second facets in order that a resonant cavity is formed therebetween.

40|$|The {{networked}} communications {{requirements for}} {{programs such as}} Future Combat Systems and others have spawned numerous developments {{in the area of}} low profile, low cost, yet high performance transceivers. A primary objective for these next-generation unattended devices is maximum mission life; hence the radios employ not only low power circuit designs, but also power-efficient routing protocols and fast acquisition waveforms to support duty cycling. The network architecture of the systems employing these transceivers is similarly optimized. In numerous scenarios, low power (< 1 watt transmitted output) transceivers compose the local network that interconnects relatively closely spaced nodes, typically front line sensors. A typically higher-powered, and higher data rate transceiver within the network provides the longer link (tens of kilometers) to a Command and Control Station. Operational considerations specific to each system, such as the number of nodes, anticipated traffic volume, latency requirements, forward error correction, encryption, etc., are used to determine the data rate for both the local and long haul links. Additional requirements for low probability of detection, low probability of intercept, and anti-jam protection provide the final input to the process of waveform selection or design. In many cases, unique transceivers are designed to satisfy the requirements for each of the two links. However, judicious trade-offs between the two can yield a single <b>dual-mode</b> <b>device</b> capable of operating in a low power, low rate mode for sensor interoperability while also offering higher layer communications.

40|$|A {{proposal}} for an all-optical memory {{based on a}} bistability of single-mode states in a dual-mode diode laser with time-delayed optical feedback is presented. The system is modeled using a multimode extension of the Lang-Kobayashi equations with injected optical pulses. We uncover the bifurcation structure by deriving analytical expressions for {{the boundaries of the}} bistable region and demonstrate how the delay time in the external cavity determines an optimal pulse duration for efficient switching of the memory element. We also show the relevant role played by gain saturation and by the dual-mode solutions of the Lang-Kobayashi equations for the existence of the bistable regions.

40|$|Abstract—As {{essential}} {{building blocks}} of the future smart grid, microgrids can efficiently integrate various types of distributed generation (DG) units to supply the electric loads at the minimum cost based on the economic dispatch. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized economic dispatch approach such that the optimal decision on power generation is made by each DG unit locally without a central controller. The prerequisite power generation and load information for decision making is discovered by each DG unit via a multiagent coordination with guaranteed convergence. To avoid a slow convergence speed which potentially increases the generation cost because of the time-varying nature of DG output, we present a heterogeneous wireless network architecture for microgrids. Low-cost shortrange wireless communication devices are used to establish an ad hoc network as a basic information exchange infrastructure, while auxiliary <b>dual-mode</b> <b>devices</b> with cellular communication capabilities are optionally activated to improve the convergence speed. Two multiagent coordination schemes are proposed for the single-stage and hierarchical operation modes, respectively. The optimal number of activated cellular communication devices is obtained based on the tradeoff between communication and generation costs. The performance of the proposed schemes is analyzed and evaluated based on real power generation and load data collected from the Waterloo Region in Canada. Numerical results indicate that our proposed schemes can better utilize the cellular communication links and achieve a desired tradeoff between the communication and generation costs {{as compared with the}} existing schemes.

40|$|Abstract—Many mobile {{handsets}} manufactured {{today are}} equipped with wireless data modules that can provide users with the alternative to access Internet telephony service for voice communications. Due to the limited coverage area of wireless data service, however, a call established through VoIP service {{may need to be}} transferred transparently to mobile telephony service, and vice versa, for maintaining voice call continuity. In this paper, we investigate the problem of supporting seamless voice communications across heterogeneous telephony systems on <b>dual-mode</b> mobile <b>devices</b> such as GSM-Wi-Fi handsets. While related work has investigated the problem of seamless vertical handoffs across heterogeneous wireless data networks, solutions based on packet-switched protocols cannot be used in this context since GSM is a circuit-switched telephony system. Rather, to enable seamless voice communications across heterogeneous telephony systems, we show in this paper that the support of digital signal processing (DSP) techniques during handoffs is critical. To substantiate our argument, we start with a framework based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for supporting vertical handoffs on <b>dual-mode</b> mobile <b>devices.</b> We then identify the key obstacle in achieving seamless voice call continuity across circuit-switched and packet-switched systems and explain why a “make-before-break ” handoff with DSP support is necessary. We thus propose a solution that incorporates time scaling algorithms to process voice streams during handoffs for supporting seamless voice call continuity, and we investigate mechanisms to reduce the overheads of the proposed solution. To evaluate the performance of the proposed solution, we conduct testbed experiments using a GSM-Wi-Fi dual-mode notebook. Evaluation results show that such a cross-disciplinary solution involving signal processing and networking can effectively support seamless voice communications across heterogeneous telephony systems...|$|R

40|$|Communication between neurons is {{achieved}} by rapid signal transduction via highly specialized structural elements known as synaptic contacts. In addition, numerous extrasynaptic mechanisms provide a flexible platform for the local regulation of synaptic signals.

40|$|Semiconductor lasers {{have the}} {{potential}} to address a number of critical applications in advanced telecommunications and signal processing. These include applications that require pulsed output that can be obtained from self-pulsing and mode-locked states of two-section devices with saturable absorption. Many modern applications place stringent performance requirements on the laser source, and a thorough understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying these pulsed modes of operation is therefore highly desirable. In this thesis, we present experimental measurements and numerical simulations of a variety of self-pulsation phenomena in two-section semiconductor lasers with saturable absorption. Our theoretical and numerical results will be based on rate equations for the field intensities and the carrier densities in the two sections of the device, and we establish typical parameter ranges and assess the level of agreement with experiment that can be expected from our models. For each of the physical examples that we consider, our model parameters are consistent with the physical net gain and absorption of the studied devices. Following our introductory chapter, the first system that we consider is a two-section Fabry-Pérot laser. This example serves to introduce our method for obtaining model parameters from the measured material dispersion, and it also allows us to present a detailed discussion of the bifurcation structure that governs the appearance of selfpulsations in two-section devices. In the following two chapters, we present two distinct examples of experimental measurements from <b>dual-mode</b> two-section <b>devices.</b> In each case we have found that single mode self-pulsations evolve into complex coupled dualmode states following a characteristic series of bifurcations. We present optical and mode resolved power spectra as well as a series of characteristic intensity time traces illustrating this progression for each example. Using the results from our study of a twosection Fabry-Pérot device as a guide, we find physically appropriate model parameters that provide qualitative agreement with our experimental results. We highlight the role played by material dispersion and the underlying single mode self-pulsing orbits in determining the observed dynamics, and we use numerical continuation methods to provide a global picture of the governing bifurcation structure. In our concluding chapter we summarise our work, and we discuss how the presented results can inform the development of optimised mode-locked lasers for performance applications in integrated optics...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the investigation and development of two types of fibre devices for applications in optical communications: surface-plasmon fibre devices and chirped fibre grating devices. Firstly the suitability of long range surface plasmons (LRSP) for selective fibre mode excitation was assessed both theoretically and experimentally. The envisaged application was for mode tapping or coupling in modal multiplexed systems, where different regions of the fibre mode spectrum carry different communication channels. The idea was achieved by depositing a thin metal layer on a side-polished fibre and arranging that the LRSP mode is phase-matched to a fibre mode. Under this condition, resonant tunnelling of light from the core into the metal layer and from the metal layer into the core occur; this is then tapped off/in through a high index prism (or a second identical side-polished fibre) placed against the fibre face. the intervening space being filled with a layer whose refractive index may be varied. Different fibre modes are then selected by altering the index of this layer, i. e., by altering the phase index of the plasmon mode. An extensive theoretical modelling was conducted. the fabrication process mastered and experimental characterization techniques were implemented and used to fully understand the device behaviour and performance. Tests with <b>dual-mode</b> fibre <b>devices</b> proved that good modal selection can be achieved for higher order modes whereas lower order mode selection suffer from some inherent cross coupling. Additionally, the potential use of surface plasmon resonance in conjunction with optical fibres was studied and proposals for other fibre devices based on this effect were pointed. Next, linearly chirped fibre gratings were investigated. The objective was to develop and characterize devices for dispersion compensation in long fibre telecommunications links and thus allow to increase the information capacity of the installed fibre network. A high resolution measurement system was set up which provided unique and accurate information about the grating dispersion and spectrum. Several types of fibre gratings fabricated using different technologies were measured and the results used by the fabrication groups to refine their techniques. A variable-chirp fibre grating was implemented and investigated in detail, providing important information about the properties of linearly chirped gratings in general. An original chirped grating device which has a fixed dispersion and tunable central wavelength was demonstrated. This device can track the laser signal over satisfactorily broad wavelength ranges, thus allowing to partially overcome the grating narrow-band limitation...|$|R
40|$|Our need {{to reduce}} global energy use is well known and without question, not just froman {{economic}} standpoint but also to decrease human impact on climate change. Emergingadvances in this area result from the ability to tailor-make materials and energy-savingdevices using solution–phase chemistry and deposition techniques. Colloidallysynthesized nanocrystals, with their tunable size, shape, and composition, and unusualoptical and electronic properties, are leading candidates in these efforts. Because ofrecent advances in colloidal chemistries, the inventory of monodisperse nanocrystals hasexpanded to now include metals, semiconductors, magnetic materials, and dielectricmaterials. For a variety of applications, an active layer composed of a thin film ofrandomly close-packed nanocrystals is not ideal for optimized device performance; here,the ability to arrange these nano building units into mesoporous (2 nm < d < 50 nm) architectures is highly desirable. Given this, {{the goal of the}} work in this dissertation is todetermine and understand the design rules that govern the interactions between ligand-strippednanocrystals and polymeric materials, leading to their hierarchical assembly intocolloidal nanocrystal frameworks. I also include the development of quantitative, andnovel, characterization techniques, and the application of such frameworks in energyefficiency devices such as electrochromic windows. Understanding the local environment of nanocrystal surfaces and their interactionwith surrounding media is vital to their controlled assembly into higher-order structures. Though work has continued in this field for over a decade, researchers have yet toprovide a simple and straightforward procedure to scale across nanoscale materialsystems and applications allowing for synthetic and structural tunability and quantitativecharacterization. In this dissertation, I have synthesized a new class of amphiphilic blockcopolymer architecture-directing agents based upon poly(dimethylacrylamide) -b-poly(styrene) (PDMA-b-PS), which are strategically designed to enhance the interactionbetween the hydrophilic PDMA block and ligand-stripped nanocrystals. As a result,stable assemblies are produced which, following solution deposition and removal of theblock copolymer template, renders a mesoporous framework. Leveraging the use of thissacrificial block copolymer allows for the formation of highly tunable structures, wherecontrol over multiple length scales (e. g., pore size, film thickness) is achieved through thejudicious selection of the two building blocks. I also combine X-ray scattering, electronimaging, and image analysis as novel quantitative analysis techniques for the physicalcharacterization of the frameworks. Last, I demonstrate the applicability of these porous frameworks as platforms forchemical transformation and energy efficiency devices. Examining the active layer in anelectrochromic window, I show a direct comparison between, and improved performancefor, devices built from both randomly close-packed nanocrystals and those arranged inmesoporous framework architectures. I show that the framework also serves as a scaffoldfor in-filling with a second active material, rendering a <b>dual–mode</b> electrochromic <b>device.</b> These results imply that there may exist a broad application space for these techniques inthe development of ordered composite architectures...|$|R
