50|$|The {{check-valve}} assembly fixed {{within the}} <b>float</b> <b>collar</b> prevents flow {{back of the}} cement slurry when pumping is stopped. Without a <b>float</b> <b>collar</b> or float shoe, the cement slurry placed in the annulus could U-tube, or reverse flow back into the casing. The greater density of cement slurries than the displacement mud inside the casing causes the U-tube effect.|$|E
5000|$|... 2. Valves {{to prevent}} cement {{backflow}} did not close. Weatherford’s Auto-Fill <b>float</b> <b>collar,</b> which includes two flapper-type check valves, was installed at Macondo 180 ft above the reamer shoe at casing bottom. The valves are held open by a 2-inch diameter auto-fill tube {{to allow the}} casing to fill with mud while it is lowered down the well. BP’s casing installation procedure stated: [...] "slowly increase (mud) pump rates greater than 8 bpm to convert the float equipment (~ 500 - 700 psi) per Weatherford recommendation". As the flow rate drag force during circulation and cementing was only around 30% of that required, the auto-fill tube was almost certainly not ejected and the flapper valves never closed. Some evidence suggests that personnel on the Deepwater Horizon mistakenly believed that the high pressure needed to establish mud circulation had converted the <b>float</b> <b>collar.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>float</b> <b>collar</b> is {{installed}} {{near the bottom}} of the casing string. Cement plugs land on it during the primary cementing operation, thus retaining inside the casing a small portion of the cement slurry that may have become contaminated as the top plug scrapes the inside of the casing. It is similar to a float shoe; often both are used for redundancy. The internal check valves may be flapper type or spring-loaded balls.|$|E
50|$|The righting reflex is {{the attempt}} of cats {{to land on}} their feet at the {{completion}} of a jump or a fall. They can do this more easily than other animals due to their flexible spine, <b>floating</b> <b>collar</b> bone, and loose skin. Cats also use vision and/or their vestibular apparatus to help tell which way to turn. They then can stretch themselves out and relax their muscles. The righting reflex does not always result in the cat landing on its feet{{at the completion of}} the fall.|$|R
50|$|Casing will be {{installed}} at various depths while drilling. It {{is held in}} place by cement, which also provides zone isolation. Down-hole equipment such as Centralizers and Turbolizers are used to ensure obtaining satisfactory zone isolation. <b>Float</b> Shoes and <b>Collars</b> (<b>float</b> valves) prevent backflow after the cement has been pumped into place.|$|R
40|$|The dipoles {{for several}} {{different}} machines (LHC, SSC, HERA) were designed using non-magnetic metallic collars {{to contain the}} superconducting coils. The coils are of two types, main and floating. This paper describes a structure with combined steel and plastic <b>collars.</b> Since the <b>floating</b> <b>collars</b> do not give {{an important contribution to}} the global rigidity of the dipole we propose to suppress them. The plastic collars are just fillers to limit the helium contained in the cold mass. Some data about thermoplastic materials to be possibly used for the collars are given and some estimations of mass and cost of this configuration are made. Finally the results of the tests of a 1 -m-long twin aperture dipole with mixed steel-plastic collars are shortly described. The replacement of expensive alloys by high performance plastic in non-structural components can be a cost-effective solution in view of future projects where superconducting magnets are involved and contained costs are a key issue...|$|R
5000|$|Cementing is {{performed}} by circulating a cement slurry through {{the inside of}} the casing and out into the annulus through the casing shoe {{at the bottom of the}} casing string. In order to precisely place the cement slurry at a required interval on the outside of the casing, a plug is pumped with a displacement fluid behind the cement slurry column, which [...] "bumps" [...] in the casing shoe and prevents further flow of fluid through the shoe. This bump can be seen at surface as a pressure spike at the cement pump. To prevent the cement from flowing back into {{the inside of the}} casing, a <b>float</b> <b>collar</b> above the casing shoe acts as a check valve and prevents fluid from flowing up through the shoe from the annulus.|$|E
5000|$|... 3. Cementing inadequate. Cementing {{proceeded}} a) without flushing the annulus {{around the}} shoe track at sufficiently high rate and duration to ensure full circumferential removal of compressed sediment and good distribution of cement, and b) without converting the <b>float</b> <b>collar</b> to activate its two check valves to prevent cement backflow. Cement quality and strength {{may have been}} reduced by contamination on its way down the casing, or by mixing with lower density mud in the rathole. There was no cementing evaluation log at Macondo, which may have shown it to be inadequate. 4. Pressure test wrongly interpreted. Drill pipe was run to 8,367 ft ready for mud displacement. During the [...] "negative pressure test", for {{which there was no}} detailed procedure, no flow from the kill line was accepted and 1,400 psi on the drill pipe was ignored.|$|E
40|$|In {{the shadow}} of {{challenges}} with salmon lice, fish escapements and a desire of increased production growth, there have been less focus on the safety for the personnel on the fish farms and in the marine aquaculture operations. Studies shows that the aquaculture industry {{is the second most}} dangerous industry in Norway after the fishery industry. At the same time, the industry is facing increasing production costs. Considering this, it is important to assess systematically every operation with respect to both safety and efficiency. Larger vessels, heavier operations, together with more exposed sites, makes operations more demanding and will reinforce this need. Furthermore, due to the new development concessions, many new concepts and methods are under development and will enter the market shortly. This will lead to unfortunate consequences if not properly assessed. Therefore, in order to secure the predicted growth in a sustainable way, it is more important than ever to ensure health, safety and the environment (HSE) together with efficient operations in Norwegian Aquaculture. The objective of this master thesis was to perform a Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) and a Continual Improvement Assessment (CIA) in order to answer the research questions established in the problem definition. These questions were to investigate whether the service vessels and <b>floating</b> cage <b>collars</b> are fitted to each other to create optimal working conditions with respect to both operational efficiency and HSE. The study will thus, give awareness of issues regarding risk, safety and efficiency in marine operations in the aquaculture industry. Furthermore, measures on both vessels and <b>floating</b> <b>collars</b> that could improve both operational efficiency and HSE, have been investigated. The thesis is limited to look at three essential marine operation between service vessels and <b>floating</b> net <b>collars.</b> These operations are net cleaning, service and maintenance of <b>floating</b> <b>collars</b> and delousing with tarpaulin. These operations are regularly performed, and especially the last operation demands many people and vessels to participate in order to be carried out. From hazard identification, a total of 62 hazards were found within the following operational phases: work on deck/net cage and entering/disembarking vessel/net cage (8 hazards), lift operations (10 hazards), net cleaning operations (5 hazards), vessel berthing to net cage (18 hazards), delousing the fish (12 hazards) and cleaning of <b>floating</b> <b>collar</b> (9 hazards). Based on these hazards, generic accident categories were established and the following accident categories were identified to represent the total risk picture: trip/slip, hit by object, squeeze/trapped and collision/contact. Based on predefined risk acceptance criteria, the overall individual risk and overall individual third parties risk were found to be unacceptable, which agrees {{with the fact that the}} industry is the second most dangerous to work in. Thus, according to the ALARP principle, risk-reducing measures are mandatory to implement. Furthermore, the risk related to environment and property were found to be high. Thus, service vessels and <b>floating</b> cage <b>collars</b> are according to these results, not fitted to each other in order to create optimal working conditions with respect to HSE. To evaluate efficiency in the operations, the third step of the continual improvement model, KOSTER III, was utilised. This showed that; poor and inadequate design, not properly fitted equipment, lacking or inadequate planning and procedures leading to among others delayed and aborted operations, are recurring causes to inefficient operations. Thus, service vessels and <b>floating</b> cage <b>collars</b> are in many areas not properly fitted to each other in order to create optimal working conditions with respect to operational efficiency. Measures for increased efficiency and safety should therefore be established. For each of the assessments, a brainstorming session were held in order to establish risk control measures and improvement measures. These measures were combined into ten practical and well thought out control options for improving of both safety and operational efficiency. These ten control options consist of six main areas: Planning, prevent falling into sea and drowning, prevent collision and contact, improve vessel stability and crane operation, improvement for new vessels and operation specific improvement. Re-evaluation of the risk picture shows that it is necessary to implement a combination of control options in order to reduce the overall risk level sufficiently. Based on individual risk reduction potential, the following recommendations has been made: -	Control option 1 : Measures related to better planning and decision support system -	Control option 4 a: General measures related to improving vessel stability and crane operation -	Control option 2 c: Measures for personnel training and safety related to prevention of falling into sea and drowning Based on third parties individual risk reduction potential, the following recommendations has been made: -	Control option 3 a: Measures on net cage related to prevention of collision and contact -	Control option 1 : Measures related to better planning and decision support system -	Control option 2 c: Measures for personnel training and safety related to prevention of falling into sea and drowning Based on environmental and property risk reduction potential, the following recommendations has been made: -	Control option 1 : Measures related to better planning and decision support system -	Control option 3 a: Measures on net cage related to prevention of collision and contact Furthermore, some recommendations have been made based on implicit cost-effectiveness consideration and on how difficult they are to implement: -	Control option 1 : Measures related to better planning and decision support system -	Control option 2 c: Measures for personnel training and safety related to prevention of falling into sea and drowning -	Control option 2 a: Measures on net cage related to prevention of falling into sea and drowning The risk level is found to be unacceptable, and the main recommendations are therefore based on the quantitatively risk reduction potential. Many of the established control options that are not further recommended above might therefore in an operational efficiency point of view, give a larger improvement in the efficiency. However, as the control options are based on both risk reduction and improvement measures, they will also improve operational efficiency. Overall, the study shows that by ensuring efficient operations often contribute to safe operations and vice versa...|$|R
30|$|Extended reach wells (ERWs), {{especially}} horizontal extended reach {{well with}} a high HD (horizontal displacement) to TVD (true vertical depth) ratio, represent a frontier technology and challenge the drilling limitations. Oil and gas reservoir in beaches or lakes and offshore can be effectively exploited by using extended reach drilling (ERD) technology. This paper focuses on the difficult technological problems encountered during exploiting the Liuhua 11 - 1 oil field in the South China Sea, China. Emphasis is on investigating the key subjects including prediction and control of open hole limit extension in offshore ERD, prediction of casing wear and its prevention and torque reduction, ϕ 244.5 mm casing running with <b>floating</b> <b>collars</b> to control drag force, and steerable drilling modes. The basic concept of limit extension in ERD is presented and the prediction method for open hole limit extension is given in this paper. A set of advanced drilling mechanics and control technology has been established and its practical results are verified by field cases. All those efforts may be significant for further investigating and practicing ERD limit theory and control technology in the future.|$|R

The plastic bags had a volume of 11. 5 m 3, a total depth of 5. 5 m and they were moored to <b>floating</b> <b>collars.</b> The bags were made of polyethylene coated with black PVC. Each bag {{was covered with a}} roof so the larvae were in a totally dark water column the first month. The general salinity was that of Atlantic water. Supplied water had a salinity of 30 - 32 o/oo. The halibut larvae reached the functional stage 40 days after hatching and natural zooplankton was added. At this time opening gradually was made in the roof of three of the bags while in two bags light was supplied by underwater lamps. Survival to the first feeding stage was about 45 %. Almost all functional larvae started to feed, and they reached a size of 20 mm at metamorphosis and bag termination 45 days after first feeding was observed.

40|$|In this master thesis the {{vertical}} wave loads and vertical {{responses of the}} <b>floating</b> <b>collar</b> of a circular fish farm have been investigated. The response has been investigated for a collar without the presence of mooring system and net cage. First, a linear model was used to calculate displacements, relative motion between the floater and the surface and bending stresses. The linear displacements and bending stresses in regular long crested waves were compared with a nonlinear model for the excitation forces. The nonlinear excitation forces were obtained by integrating the hydrostatic and dynamic pressures over the exact wetted surface of the floater. Two different configurations of the <b>floating</b> <b>collar</b> were investigated; a floater with only one plastic ring and a floater with two concentric rings. The radius and the displaced mass of the two configurations were equal. The response was calculated by mode superposition. The added mass is mode dependent, and thus a modal formulation of the added mass was used. The modal resonance frequencies for one ring were higher than the modal resonance frequencies for two rings. The three first resonance frequencies for two rings, corresponding to heave, pitch and the first elastic mode, are 2. 25 rad/s, 2. 69 rad/s and 2. 91 rad/s. The relative motion for low wave frequencies is higher for one ring than for two rings. The bending stresses are significantly higher for two rings between a wave frequency of 1. 5 rad/s and 2. 9 rad/s. The linear model was used to calculate standard deviations for bending stresses in irregular waves. For low spectral peak periods the JONSWAP spectrum gave larger {{standard deviations for the}} bending stresses than the ISSC spectrum. For peak periods larger than 4. 5 s the ISSC spectrum gave the largest standard deviations. For regular waves the linear and nonlinear model gave similar results for modal displacements and maximum bending stresses in the floater for small wave frequencies. At the modal resonance frequencies the nonlinear modal forces for the modes at resonance were significantly lower than the linear forces. This resulted in a reduced nonlinear response compared with linear theory at resonance. Damping was seen to only {{have a significant effect on}} the response at resonance for both the linear and nonlinear model. For some frequencies, modal excitation forces with frequencies two times, three times or higher than the incident wave frequency were observed. This induced higher frequency components in the response. The higher frequency components were close to the modal resonance frequency. Although the floater does not have forward speed, this kind of response from continueous wave loads can be associated with nonlinear springing response for ships. </p...|$|R
40|$|In India, {{open sea}} cage {{culture has been}} {{successfully}} demonstrated and several experimental offshore cages for mariculture were installed along the coast for on-farm demonstration by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Cochin. In the present study, a model cage was fabricated and tested in a towing tank under different waves and current load conditions. The tension on the mooring chain was measured during the experimental study, besides the towing speed and wave parameters. Based on the experimental data, drag coefficient for the cage net twine was estimated. The tensions in the mooring chain and the cage net twine of the prototype cage were predicted based on the model data. The maximum tension on a single twine of the outer and inner fish net were estimated as 0. 15 N and 0. 028 N respectively. The force on the net was more than 1. 7 times the force on the <b>floating</b> <b>collar</b> and sinker pipe. The tension in the mooring line is mainly due to the force on the net. Further {{it was observed that}} the force on the net due to current was 10 times higher than that due to wave. This information will be useful in future while deciding the diameter of the cage, the type of net to be used for cage according to the site where the cage is to be installed...|$|R
50|$|Soon, a Fourth Dimensional Being with a {{testicle}} for a head appears and scolds Rick for {{attempting to}} piece time together with just a crystal. He gives Rick, Morty and Summer time-stabilizing collars that restore order by fusing the timelines into a single one.

Rick attempts to trick the being and instructs Morty and Summer to break off their collars, but the resulting chain of uncertainty further splits their realities into dozens of different timelines. After defeating the testicle monster, Rick notes that time is falling apart. Summer's collar transports her back to her time, but one of the Mortys' collar is broken. With the garage falling away piece by piece, the Morty with the broken collar falls into the spaceless void and Rick jumps after him. He gives Morty his collar and instead prepares to face death.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four essays on pricing fixed income derivatives and risk management. The first essay presents pricing and duration formulas for floating rate bonds and interest rate swaps with embedded options. It combines Briys et al. 2 ̆ 7 s approximation with the extended Vasicek term structure model to value caps and floors. Using this approach, it computes the durations of caps, floors, <b>collars,</b> <b>floating</b> rate bonds with collars and interest rate swaps with collars, and provides comparative statics analyses of these durations {{with respect to the}} underlying variables such as the cap rate, the floor rate, the interest rate volatility, and the level of interest rates. ^ The second essay explores a class of polynomial Taylor series expansions for approximating the bond return function, and examines its implication for managing interest rate risk. The generalized duration vector models derived from alternative Taylor series expansion extend Fong and Fabozzi 2 ̆ 7 s M-square model and Nawalkha and Chambers 2 ̆ 7 M-vector model, and the empirical tests show that immunization results can be improved for models g(t) = tα with α less than 1 when higher order generalized duration vectors are used. ^ The third essay develops a methodology to build recombining trees for pricing American options on bonds under deterministic volatility HJM models. Without imposing the HJM drift restriction, our approach uses the Nelson-Ramaswamy transformation to generate recombining forward rate trees. We show that the option prices obtained from our recombining trees satisfy Merton 2 ̆ 7 s bond option PDE when step size approaches zero. Numerical simulations provide evidence that this approach is efficient in pricing both European and American contingent claims. ^ The fourth essay obtains computationally efficient trees for pricing European options under two types of proportional volatility HJM models. We construct a numeraire economy in which European options are priced using a maturity-specific equivalent martingale measure. We then show that for the two types of proportional volatility models, European option prices are independent of the forward rate drift under this maturity-specific equivalent martingale measure. Our method is particularly beneficial when used to price long-dated caps, floors and collars because these instruments involve a large number of long-dated puts and calls. ...|$|R
