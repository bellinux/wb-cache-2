5|$|Many {{species of}} Pokémon {{are capable of}} <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> a larger and more {{powerful}} creature. The change is accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to {{a wider variety of}} attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee is capable of <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion as of the release of Sun and Moon. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species.|$|E
5|$|The Ghost in The Shell manga by Masamune Shirow {{prominently}} features spider-like, AI-equipped, multi-legged combat vehicles called Fuchikoma (<b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> the Tachikoma, Uchikoma and Logicoma {{in subsequent}} anime {{versions of the}} series). These mobile weapons platforms are used {{by the members of}} Section 9 to aid in their various missions.|$|E
5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega <b>Evolving</b> <b>into</b> Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E
50|$|Cretolamna is {{believed}} to have <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the genus Otodus sometime in the Paleocene. Otodus {{is believed}} to have <b>evolved</b> later <b>into</b> the Carcharocles genus. Others believe that Cretolamna <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the Paleocene shark Palaeocarcharodon, which some think <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Carcharodon carcharias.|$|R

5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun {{will begin to}} {{collapse}} again, <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> a compact white dwarf star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, FAU has {{undertaken}} {{an effort to}} increase its academic and research standings while also <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> a more traditional university. The university has raised admissions standards, increased research funding, built new facilities, and established notable partnerships with major research institutions. Changes include an on-campus stadium, additional on-campus housing, {{and the establishment of}} a College of Medicine in 2010.|$|E
5|$|No {{effort to}} depict vampires in popular fiction was as {{influential}} or as definitive as Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). Its portrayal of vampirism {{as a disease}} of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in Victorian Europe where tuberculosis and syphilis were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> the modern fictional vampire.|$|E
5000|$|The Baopuzi lists animals {{associated}} with longevity, including (chap. 3, tr. Luo 2003:4124, cf. Ware 1967:56), [...] "A macaque may <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> an ape after 800 years. After another 500 years it <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Jue, and Jue will <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> Chanchu (toad) after 1,000 years." ...|$|R

5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 billion years ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 billion years ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} six weekly services, {{one of them}} located in the Rue Battant {{especially}} for people with disabilities. Each meeting is devoted to a particular Christian practice: evangelization, prayer, Bible reading, singing, and weekly worship. Meetings are composed of biblical sermons and studies, testimonies of religious experiences, hymns, meditation, worship, and prayers. Services are dynamic, charismatic and emotional, often <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> ecstasy and trance; glossolalia results when the pastor calls the Holy Spirit to come upon the congregation, and usually lasts 30 to 60 minutes. Women must have their heads covered during worship.|$|E
5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E
50|$|Charmander <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Charmeleon {{who then}} <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Charizard, which was {{originally}} its last form. Since {{the release of}} Pokémon X and Y, Charizard can mega <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> Mega Charizard {{for the duration of}} a battle. This gives it upgraded stats and a damage bonus, but is temporary.|$|R
50|$|This game {{features}} two Sinnoh related Pokémon {{species from}} the Diamond and Pearl generation introduced in Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys, {{both of which}} <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> previous species. They are Munchlax, which <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Snorlax, and Bonsly, which <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Sudowoodo. However, they cannot be obtained in the Advanced series titles, because they lack the Sinnoh Pokédex, although the player can temporarily use Bonsly during one minigame.|$|R

5|$|In March 1992, John C. Hitt became UCF's fourth president, {{ushering}} {{in an era}} of unprecedented growth and prominence for the university. Once known mainly as a small commuter and technology school, in recent years UCF has undertaken an effort to increase its academic and research standings while also <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> a more traditional research university. When Hitt took office, UCF's enrollment was 20,302, and as of 2014 enrollment consists of 60,821 students attending classes on twelve campuses spread across Central Florida. The university consists of thirteen colleges and employs more than 10,150 faculty and staff. Under the direction of Hitt, UCF has raised admissions standards, increased research funding, built new facilities, and established notable partnerships with major research institutions.|$|E
5|$|Jazz {{influenced}} many performers of all {{the major}} styles of later popular music, though jazz itself never again became such {{a major part of}} American popular music as during the swing era. The later 20th-century American jazz scene did, however, produce some popular crossover stars, such as Miles Davis. In the middle of the 20th century, jazz evolved into a variety of subgenres, beginning with bebop. Bebop is a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, improvisation based on harmonic structure rather than melody, and use of the flatted fifth. Bebop was developed in the early and mid-1940s, later <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> styles like hard bop and free jazz. Innovators of the style included Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, who arose from small jazz clubs in New York City.|$|E
5|$|The Pokémon {{franchise}} {{revolves around}} 805fictional species of collectible monsters, each having unique designs and skills. Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon are creatures that inhabit the fictional Pokémon World. The {{designs for the}} multitude of species can draw inspiration from anything, such as inanimate objects, real-world animals, or mythology. Many Pokémon are capable of <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> more powerful species, while others can undergo form changes and achieve similar results. Originally, {{only a handful of}} artists led by Ken Sugimori designed Pokémon, however, by 2013 a team of 20artists worked together to create new species designs. Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida lead the team and determine the final designs. Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.|$|E

50|$|In the 17th century, the whitedish <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> a meatless dessert pudding {{with cream}} and eggs and, later, gelatin. In the 19th century, {{arrowroot}} and cornflour were added and the dish <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the modern blancmange.|$|R
50|$|Several of the {{facilities}} <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> hospitals or medical facilities: Glockner Tuberculosis Sanatorium <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Penrose Hospital. Beth-El Hospital, with the National Deaconess Sanitarium, <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Memorial Hospital. St. Francis Hospital was a hospital that had a sanatorium in its three building complex. Union Printers Home and the Modern Woodmen Tuberculosis Sanatorium, now Mount Saint Francis, are going concerns with skilled nursing care. Today, however, the structure's usages are different. Miramont Castle, which {{was the site of}} the Montcalm Sanitarium, is now a museum. National Methodist Sanatorium <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> a building for the Ent Air Force Base and its site is now part of the United States Olympic Training Center.|$|R
5|$|The Texas League, a {{baseball}} league, {{was founded in}} the 1800s, temporarily discontinued, and then restarted in the early 1900s <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> a minor league. During the 1930s investors in Galveston, particularly Shearn Moody, established the Galveston Buccaneers baseball team, a successor to the former Galveston Pirates. The Buccaneers won the league championship in 1934 but the team was sold in 1937 after Moody's death. After the war, the new Gulf Coast League was established and the Galveston White Caps team was created. Galveston won the championship in 1953 but the team then faded and was disbanded in 1955 {{as the rest of}} Galveston's economy was collapsing.|$|E
5|$|What is now WesternU {{first opened}} in 1977 as the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific (COMP), {{offering}} the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree (D.O.). This {{was the first}} medical school in California to open after a complicated era in the relations of allopathic and osteopathic medicine, notably when the California College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons - only the second DO school in America - briefly became independent as an M.D. granting school before soon <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine. Upon its foundation in 1977, the WesternU College of Medicine was the only osteopathic medical school west of the Rocky Mountains,.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Imperial court, {{administration}} and military, the primary language {{used in the}} eastern Roman provinces even before {{the decline of the}} Western Empire was Greek, having been spoken in the region for centuries before Latin. Following Rome's conquest of the east its 'Pax Romana', inclusionist political practices and development of public infrastructure, facilitated the further spreading and entrenchment of Greek language in the east. Indeed, early on {{in the life of the}} Roman Empire, Greek had become the common language of the Church, the language of scholarship and the arts, and, to a large degree, the lingua franca for trade between provinces and with other nations. Greek for a time became diglossic with the spoken language, known as Koine (eventually <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> Demotic Greek), used alongside an older written form until Koine won out as the spoken and written standard.|$|E

50|$|As {{one species}} <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> another, its teeth may become {{difficult}} to classify, exhibiting characteristics of both species.

5|$|Gene {{duplication}} is not {{the only}} way that venom has become more diverse. There have been instances of new venom proteins generated by alternative splicing. The Elapid snake Bungarus fasciatus, for example, possesses a gene that is alternatively spliced to yield both a venom component and a physiological protein. Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific venom components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor is believed to have had genes for neurotoxic PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic Crotalus species. The various recruitment events had resulted in snake venom <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> a very complex mixture of proteins. The venom of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families, and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins. The composition of this mixture has been shown to vary geographically, and to be related to the prey species available in a certain region. Snake venom has generally evolved very quickly, with changes occurring faster in the venom than in the rest of the organism.|$|E
5|$|In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde {{proposed}} a northern origin for the chestnut-shouldered fairywren group {{due to the}} variety of forms {{in the north and}} their absence in the southeast of the continent. Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during a warm and wetter period around 2 million years ago {{at the end of the}} Pliocene or beginning of the Pleistocene. Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in loss of habitat and fragmentation of populations. Southwestern birds gave rise to what is now the red-winged fairywren, while those in the northwest of the continent became the variegated fairywren. Further warmer, humid conditions again allowed birds to spread southwards; this group, occupying central southern Australia east to the Eyre Peninsula, became the blue-breasted fairywren. Cooler climate after this resulted in this being isolated as well and <b>evolving</b> <b>into</b> a separate species. Finally, after the end of the last glacial period 12,00013,000years ago, the northern variegated forms have again spread southwards. This has resulted in the ranges of all three species overlapping. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified.|$|E
5|$|Over 300,000 {{people took}} part and raised $3.5 {{million in the}} first Terry Fox Run. Schools across Canada were urged to join the second run, held on September 19, 1982.
