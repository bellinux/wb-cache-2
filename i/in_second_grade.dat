5|$|In {{the public}} school system of Baltimore city, music {{education}} is a part of each grade level to high school, at which point it becomes optional. Beginning in first grade, or approximately six years old, Baltimore students begin to learn about melody, harmony and rhythm, and are taught to echo short melodic and rhythmic patterns. They also begin to learn about different musical instruments and distinguish between different kinds of sounds and types of songs. As students progress through the grades, teachers go into more detail and require more proficiency in elementary musical techniques. Students perform rounds <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>grade,</b> for example, while movement (i.e. dance) enters the curriculum in third grade. Beginning in middle school in the sixth grade, students are taught to make mature aesthetic judgements, and to understand and respond to a variety of forms of music. In high school, students may choose to take courses in instrumentation or singing, and may be exposed to music {{in other areas of the}} curriculum, such as in theater or drama classes.|$|E

500|$|Park's music {{takes its}} roots in R and hip hop, more {{specifically}} from the 90's. He {{is influenced by the}} work of American artists he grew up listening to, such as Usher, Michael Jackson, Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Ginuwine, Musiq Soulchild, Justin Timberlake, Eminem, Jay-Z, Nas, Tupac, Dr. Dre, and Canibus. Park credits Usher as his idol and as one of his biggest influences, who he started listening to in the 6th grade. He also cites Michael Jackson as his role model, as [...] "he is the best". He cites both Usher and Michael Jackson as singers and dancers who influence him vocally and in dance, as he attempts to mimic them, looking at their music videos. Park also cites Chris Brown as an inspiration, and wants [...] "to be a singer who can be good at both singing and rapping like [...] ". Park began listening to hip hop music when he was <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>grade,</b> after one of his cousins let him listen to Warren G's [...] "Regulate".

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, [...] "The 100th episode [...] is a fine one, with Principal Skinner's idea for a novel and {{the conduct of the}} staff at the Italian restaurant as highpoints." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said the opening scene of episode reminded him of when he was <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>grade</b> and got a puppy for Christmas. Jacobson said, [...] "I still recall the excitement when my mom brought [...] into school for the others to see, and the first segment of [...] reflects the atmosphere caused by a doggie visit. The rest of the episode gets into Skinner’s life nicely. Toss in a great Alien reference and the episode offers yet another solid show." [...] Jacobson also said he liked the appearance of Flanders's [...] "beatnik father". Gary Mullinax of The News Journal called the episode [...] "very funny" [...] and named it one of his top-ten favorite episodes. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B+ grade, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score. Dave Manley of DVDActive said in a review of The Simpsons: Greatest Hits that it was [...] "certainly one of the weaker [...] – I can only assume {{the fact that it was}} episode 100 is what gets it onto this disc." ...|$|E
500|$|In Takumi's {{initial draft}} of the story, the second episode, [...] "Turnabout Sisters", was the first episode of the game. The {{development}} team decided {{that it did not}} work well as something that would ease players into the game, because of its length among other factors. Because of this, Takumi wrote a shorter episode, [...] "The First Turnabout", which was used as the game's first episode. Takumi wanted players to focus on the thrill of [...] "nailing the culprit", especially for the first episode; because of this, the culprit of the first episode is shown in that episode's opening, as this was the most direct way Takumi could think of doing it. According to Takumi, it was a challenge to write the episode, as, in addition to keeping it short, he had to set up the world of Ace Attorney and the types of characters that players would meet. The third episode was written {{for the sake of the}} character Miles Edgeworth, and the theme of the fourth episode was [...] "rekindling the relationship". In it, Takumi tried to portray an intensively strong friendship between Phoenix and Edgeworth; he did wonder if that was what people got from it, saying that some people interpreted the bond between Phoenix and Edgeworth as [...] an [...] "intensively passionate bond". Because of these two episodes, Takumi considered Edgeworth to in a way be the game's protagonist. The classroom trial in the game's fourth episode was based on real events: when Takumi was <b>in</b> <b>second</b> <b>grade,</b> he had found a 5 yen coin and put it in his pocket; his teacher accused him of stealing it from another student, and made him apologize to her.|$|E
