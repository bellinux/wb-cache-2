5|$|The {{development}} team {{wanted to}} introduce a new talent agency that would be separate from 765 Pro to better suit {{the details of the}} story, such as how the idols at 876 Pro are <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> while the idols at 765 Pro already have an establish fanbase. Tanaka would go on to say that the scenario in Dearly Stars would not have worked without having a different company president—in this case, the president of 876 Pro, Minori Ishikawa. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story. However, Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge, such as the introduction of the choreography panel to make adjustments to an idol's dance sequence or the positioning and manipulation of in-game cameras. The staff also altered how the lessons and auditions operate in Dearly Stars compared to previous games in the series, which also modified the game's degree of difficulty.|$|E

They give minimal {{protection}} from bumps and impacts, but they do protect drums and cymbals from precipitation. They are adequate for drums transported in private vehicles to go to local gigs and sessions. They are often the only option for young drummers who are <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't {{necessarily}} get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E

She worked with record {{producers}} Timbaland and Missy Elliott, {{who contributed to}} her second studio album, One in a Million. Missy Elliott recalled Timbaland and herself being nervous to work with Aaliyah, since Aaliyah had already released her successful début album while Missy Elliott and Timbaland were <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>out.</b> Missy Elliott also feared {{she would be a}} diva, but reflected that Aaliyah [...] "came in and was so warming; she made us immediately feel like family." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} story, the staff wanted to {{incorporate}} Hibiki Ganaha and Takane Shijō, {{who had already}} been introduced in The Idolmaster SP, but because the two games were being developed simultaneously, Hibiki's and Takane's role in the main story of Dearly Stars was kept to a minimum. For the dance sequences during performances, Kujioka chose to employ talent star Fumi Sakura, as opposed to professional dancers who {{had been used in}} The Idolmaster games up to that point. Kujioka wanted the dance sequences to be closer to what he calls an [...] "idol's aura"—a certain emotional charm that is not a part of an idol's skill at dancing, according to him. Also, because of the idols in Dearly Stars are young and are <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>out,</b> Kujioka told Sakura to purposefully mess up some dance portions to reflect this inexperience.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} release included [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] as {{the fifth}} track. However, {{a month before}} the band released Leave Home, Ramones' manager Danny Fields announced to the band that Carbona was a registered trademark and that their record label had to remove the song from the album's track listing. Legs McNeil recalled: [...] "I was shocked. It was such a great song, so radio-friendly—like a song the Beatles or the Rolling Stones would have written if they were <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> in 1976, with great harmonies and catchy lyrics." [...] Although early purchasers of the Sire release got an album that included the song, [...] "Carbona Not Glue" [...] was later replaced by [...] "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker" [...] for the US release, and [...] "Babysitter" [...] for the UK release. In the early 90's, after being unavailable for years, the song was bootlegged as a 45RPM single with [...] "I Can't Be" [...] as the B-side. [...] The single's cover sported a faux Sub Pop Singles design, despite not actually being released by the label. The song was revived on the 2001 Extended Edition of the album, which also included [...] "Babysitter".|$|E
500|$|On the season's fight {{sequences}} and choreography, Bernthal said, [...] "The fights are all character-driven and {{the fights}} tell a story." [...] Cox added that [...] "there is absolutely {{an attempt to}} make sure every punch or kick that is thrown is like a line of dialogue; there is motive behind it, there is reason behind it, it means something." [...] Cox's stunt double, Chris Brewster, explained how the series' fight choreography has evolved, with the first season having shown Murdock <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> as a vigilante—"he fought with all heart and soul, but wasn't a polished fighter....he was more raw and gritty"—while the second season sees the character having learned from previous mistakes—"his style is more defined and thought out now, but he will always fight with the Daredevil flair". As for the fighting styles of Punisher and Elektra, Brewster said that because of the Punisher's military background he uses a lot of weapons, and his [...] "hand to hand style is more of a close quarter combat nature", while Elektra was trained by Stick and the Hand, so she has similar movement to Daredevil who was also trained by Stick. [...] "However," [...] Brewster continued, [...] "The Hand are trained assassins who are all about stealth takeouts and quick kills. Her style shows elements of" [...] that as well. The season uses multiple different martial art styles, including kali, Chinese kung fu, wing chun, kenjutsu, and boxing.|$|E
500|$|The ZX Spectrum {{version of}} Wonder Boy in Monster Land {{received}} preview coverage in Your Sinclair magazine. They praised the new additions {{made to the}} game that separated it from Wonder Boy; they called the game [...] "a good arcade adventure with a smattering of strategy thrown in". The magazine reviewed the game four months later. The reviewer noted the diverse level designs and many [...] "surprises" [...] the player will encounter, and they praised the game's learning curve, saying that it [...] "is well thought out and you really {{feel as if you}} made some progress before you die". It was criticized for its long multi-load times on the ZXSpectrum, its jumping mechanics in which the character [...] "floats around", and the graphics which was not as good as its predecessor. The reviewer called Wonder Boy in Monster Land [...] "a souped-up version of Wonderboy, which improves much on the original theory but at a slight cost to gameplay". Reviewers from UK-based magazine The Games Machine called it [...] "probably the best conversion you could expect on the Spectrum". Crash magazine praised the ZXSpectrum version of the game for its detailed sprites and smooth movements, playability, and combat system. The reviewer further commended the game for the differences that set it apart from the original Wonder Boy game, citing the cartoon-like feel and the vast arrays of enemies and items; just as in Your Sinclair, it was criticized for its slow multi-loading. Overall, the reviewer said the game is [...] "great fun for the experienced games player or the person <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> in the Spectrum world". Sinclair User magazine praised its gameplay, citing the ability to stab enemies with a sword, to collect gold and items left behind, and to go into shops and pubs and buy equipment. Further praise went to the colorful and detailed graphics and animations, though they said they tend not to perform well in more complex background settings. Spanish magazine MicroHobby said that the ZXSpectrum version brought nothing new from its arcade counterpart, but the execution was good; they lauded the game's graphics and its challenging and addictive gameplay, but they criticized it for its lack of originality.|$|E

And we <b>just</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> with that, cut it all up, arranged it. Used that balearic flute vibe, like a bird in the forest."

2500|$|The most {{influential}} African American {{of the nineteenth}} century, Douglass {{made a career of}} agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> in the world, Douglass replied without hesitation: [...] "Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Two new {{categories}} of content were introduced during the patch cycle of Heavensward, post-launch: Exploratory Missions and Deep Dungeon. Exploratory Missions {{are designed to}} emulate the feel of [...] "first generation" [...] MMORPGs in which players hunted notorious monsters in the field with hidden spawn conditions. It also fills {{a gap in the}} game's content repertoire for huge-scale battles with extremely large numbers of players. However, it was not well-received at launch because of the simplicity of its battle mechanics, the repetitive nature of the gameplay loop, and the randomness of the loot drops which were not tied to skill or effort spent. Deep Dungeon is a roguelike randomly generated instance, inspired by Chocobo Mystery Dungeon. Yoshida wanted to allow veteran players to party with their friends who are <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>out</b> more quickly; as such, characters are temporarily reset to level one upon entering and level quickly back to the maximum {{over the course of the}} first 50 floors. The first section is considered casual content but reaching the 200th floor is intended as a challenge for hardcore players.|$|E

They <b>just</b> <b>started</b> <b>out</b> of curiosity, with no ambition to become actors whatsoever. Acting in films was just the icing on the cake. But they had this youthful energy that young people of the time connected to, so after their first film became a hit, they caught the acting bug. Years after their acting debuts with Les Charlots, Gérard Rinaldi and Luis Rego pursued successful solo acting careers outside of the group.|$|R
