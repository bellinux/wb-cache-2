5|$|The {{side effects}} of {{amphetamine}} are varied, {{and the amount of}} amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Amphetamine products such as Adderall, <b>Dexedrine,</b> and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of serious side effects than dosages used for therapeutic reasons.|$|E
5|$|Legitimate use of Preludin {{required}} a doctor's prescription, but Kirchherr's mother {{was able to}} obtain it from a local chemist who supplied the drug without asking questions. Epstein later asked the Star-Club owner, Weissleder, not to publish photographs showing the group playing with tubes of Preludin. Starr explained that <b>Dexedrine</b> too was in plentiful supply in Hamburg, as it was known to produce increased wakefulness and focus, in association with decreased fatigue, and decreased appetite.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{stimulant}} and non-stimulant medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. The most commonly used stimulant medications include methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (<b>Dexedrine),</b> and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse). Non-stimulant medications with a specific indication for ADHD include atomoxetine (Strattera), guanfacine (Intuniv), and clonidine (Kapvay). Other medicines which may be prescribed off-label include bupropion (Wellbutrin), tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs, or MAOIs. The presence of comorbid (co-occurring) disorders can make finding the right treatment and diagnosis much more complicated, costly, and time-consuming. So it is recommended to assess and simultaneously treat any comorbid disorders.|$|E
25|$|The stimulants are {{the first}} line of {{treatment}} for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in patients without tic disorders. Current prescribed stimulant medications include: methylphenidate (brand names Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), dextroamphetamine (<b>Dexedrine),</b> and mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall). Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option. These include the alpha-2 agonists (clonidine and guanfacine), tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine and nortriptyline), and newer antidepressants (bupropion and venlafaxine). There have been case reports of tics worsening with bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin). There is good empirical evidence for short-term safety and efficacy for the use of desipramine, bupropion and atomoxetine (Strattera).|$|E
25|$|Underwood {{was born}} March 10, 1983, in Muskogee, Oklahoma, to Carole (Shatswell) and Stephen Underwood. She is the {{youngest}} of three daughters and was raised on her parents' farm in the nearby rural town of Checotah. Her father worked in a sawmill while her mother taught elementary school. She has two older sisters, Shanna and Stephanie. Extremely hyperactive, {{she was diagnosed with}} attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at age five and was prescribed Ritalin and <b>Dexedrine,</b> medicines she still takes as an adult. During her childhood, Underwood performed at Robbins Memorial Talent Show, and sang at her local church, First Free Will Baptist Church. She later sang for local events in Checotah, including Old Settler's Day and the Lion's Club.|$|E
25|$|The TCAs {{were used}} in the past in the {{clinical}} treatment of ADHD, though they are not typically used anymore, having been replaced by more effective agents with fewer side effects such as atomoxetine (Strattera, Tomoxetin, Attentin) and stimulants like methylphenidate (Ritalin, Focalin, Concerta), and amphetamine (Adderall, <b>Dexedrine,</b> Vyvanse). ADHD is thought to be caused by an insufficiency of dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Most of the TCAs inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine, though not dopamine, and as a result, they show some efficacy in remedying the disorder. Notably, the TCAs are more effective in treating the behavioral aspects of ADHD than the cognitive deficits, as they help limit hyperactivity and impulsivity, but have little to no benefits on attention.|$|E
500|$|The {{substituted}} derivatives of amphetamine, or [...] "substituted amphetamines", are a {{broad range}} of chemicals that contain amphetamine as a [...] "backbone"; and <b>Dexedrine,</b> is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) .... (b) Examples of synthetic, pharmaceutically important substituted amphetamines.}} specifically, this chemical class includes derivative compounds that are formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms in the amphetamine core structure with substituents. The class includes amphetamine itself, stimulants like methamphetamine, serotonergic empathogens like MDMA, and decongestants like ephedrine, among other subgroups.|$|E
500|$|Tracy was {{prone to}} bouts of {{depression}} and anxiety: he was described by Mrs. Tracy as having [...] "the most volatile disposition I've ever seen—up in the clouds one minute {{and down in the}} depths the next. And when he's low, he's very, very low." [...] He was plagued by insomnia throughout his life. As a result, Tracy became dependent on barbiturates to sleep, followed by <b>dexedrine</b> to function. Hepburn, who adopted a nursing role towards Tracy, was unable to understand her partner's unhappiness. She wrote in her autobiography: [...] "What was it?... Never at peace... Tortured by some sort of guilt. Some terrible misery." ...|$|E
500|$|Altered {{dopamine}} neurotransmission is {{implicated in}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD), a condition associated with impaired cognitive control, in turn leading to problems with regulating attention (attentional control), inhibiting behaviors (inhibitory control), and forgetting things or missing details (working memory), among other problems. [...] There are genetic links between dopamine receptors, the dopamine transporter, and ADHD, in addition to links to other neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. The most important relationship between dopamine and ADHD involves the drugs that are used to treat ADHD. Some of the most effective therapeutic agents for ADHD are psychostimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) and amphetamine (Adderall, <b>Dexedrine),</b> drugs that increase both dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain. The clinical effects of these psychostimulants in treating ADHD are mediated through the indirect activation of dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, specifically dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor A2, in the prefrontal cortex.|$|E
2500|$|Stimulants are {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed medications for ADHD. The stimulant medications indicated to treat ADHD are [...] methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), dexmethylphenidate (Focalin), mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (<b>Dexedrine),</b> lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), and in rare cases methamphetamine (Desoxyn). Controlled-release pharmaceuticals may allow once daily administration of medication in the morning. This is especially helpful for children who do not like taking their medication {{in the middle of}} the school day. Several controlled-release methods are used.|$|E
2500|$|Whitman sawed off {{the barrel}} and butt {{stock of the}} shotgun, then packed it into his footlocker, along with a Remington 700 6-mm bolt-action hunting rifle, a [...]35-caliber pump rifle, a [...]30-caliber carbine (M1), a 9-mm Luger pistol, a Galesi-Brescia [...]25-caliber pistol, a Smith & Wesson M19 [...]357 Magnum revolver, and more than 700 rounds of ammunition. He also packed food, coffee, vitamins, <b>Dexedrine,</b> Excedrin, earplugs, jugs of water, matches, lighter fluid, rope, binoculars, a machete, three knives, a {{transistor}} radio, toilet paper, a razor, {{and a bottle of}} deodorant. He put khaki coveralls on over his shirt and jeans.|$|E
2500|$|Although Cash {{cultivated}} {{a romantic}} outlaw image, he never served a prison sentence. Despite landing in jail seven times for misdemeanors, he stayed only one night on each stay. On May 11, 1965, {{he was arrested}} in Starkville, Mississippi, for trespassing late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (He used this to write the song [...] "Starkville City Jail", which he discussed on his live At San Quentin album.) While on tour that year, he was arrested October 4 in El Paso, Texas by a narcotics squad. The officers suspected he was smuggling heroin from Mexico, but found instead 688 <b>Dexedrine</b> capsules (amphetamines) and 475 Equanil (sedatives or tranquilizers) tablets that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, he received a suspended sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Radner {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, to Jewish parents, Henrietta (née Dworkin), a legal secretary, and Herman Radner, a {{business}}man. Through her mother, Radner was a second cousin of business executive Steve Ballmer. She grew up in Detroit with a nanny, Elizabeth Clementine Gillies, whom she called [...] "Dibby" [...] (and on whom she based her famous character Emily Litella), and an older brother named Michael. She attended the exclusive University Liggett School in Detroit (it began its relocation to Grosse Pointe later that year). Toward {{the end of her}} life, Radner wrote in her autobiography, It's Always Something, that during her childhood and young adulthood, she battled numerous eating disorders: [...] "I coped with stress by having every possible eating disorder from the time I was nine years old. I have weighed as much as 160 pounds and as little as 93. When I was a kid, I overate constantly. My weight distressed my mother and she took me to a doctor who put me on <b>Dexedrine</b> diet pills when I was ten years old." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ginsberg {{also made}} an intense study of haiku and the {{paintings}} of Paul Cézanne, from which he adapted a concept important to his work, which he called the Eyeball Kick. He noticed in viewing Cézanne's paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color, the eye would spasm, or [...] "kick." [...] Likewise, he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku. Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry, putting together two starkly dissimilar images: something weak with something strong, an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture, something holy with something unholy. The example Ginsberg most often used was [...] "hydrogen jukebox" [...] (which later became {{the title of a}} song cycle composed by Philip Glass with lyrics drawn from Ginsberg's poems). Another example is Ginsberg's observation on Bob Dylan during Dylan's hectic and intense 1966 electric-guitar tour, fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines, opiates, alcohol, and psychedelics, as a <b>Dexedrine</b> Clown. The phrases [...] "eyeball kick" [...] and [...] "hydrogen jukebox" [...] both show up in [...] "Howl", as well as a direct quote from Cézanne: [...] "Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus".|$|E
2500|$|In 1976 Kevin Rowland {{formed a}} punk band called The Killjoys, based in Birmingham, England, which gained minor {{success with the}} release of their single [...] "Johnny Won't Get to Heaven"/"Naïve" [...] in 1977. Kevin [...] "Al" [...] Archer joined in early 1978, but due to {{internal}} arguments and tension between Rowland {{and the rest of the}} group the band dissolved. On [...] "a hot night in July 1978" [...] Rowland decided to form a new band, which would eventually become Dexys Midnight Runners, telling Archer [...] "I'm going to do what I really want to do: form a great group. We'll wear great clothes and make soulful music." [...] Throughout July Rowland and Archer auditioned 30–40 people to join the group, the eventual band consisting of 8 members. Later that summer the band would create their name, after the drug <b>Dexedrine</b> which was used by fans of Northern soul, and began a rigorous rehearsing and writing schedule, practicing for about 9 hours every day. In November 1978 the band entered the UK live circuit and gained a reputation for their strong performances, which included covers of classic soul songs and originals. Rowland and Archer employed a strict code of conduct, ruling out and drinking or drug use before performances, and introduced many of the band members to activities such as shoplifting expeditions and bumping trains.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dexedrine</b> is an {{amphetamine}} {{which used}} to be the gold-standard for fighter pilots flying long and multiple sorties in a row, and therefore may have at some point been available if astronauts were in need of a strong stimulant. Today, Modafinil has largely - if not entirely - replaced Dexedrine; reaction time and reasoning among pilots who are sleep-deprived and on <b>Dexedrine</b> suffer, and get worse the longer the pilot stays awake. In one study, helicopter pilots that were given six-hundred milligrams of Modafinil every three hours were able to perform with the same accuracy as they did at pre-deprivation levels for 40 hours without sleep; significant impairment would have been evident had the pilots been given <b>Dexedrine</b> instead.|$|E

5000|$|Three years later, in 1935, {{the medical}} {{community}} {{became aware of the}} stimulant properties of amphetamine, specifically dextroamphetamine, and in 1937 Smith, Kline, and French introduced tablets under the tradename <b>Dexedrine.</b> In the United States, <b>Dexedrine</b> was approved to treat narcolepsy, attention disorders, and obesity. In Canada indications once included epilepsy and parkinsonism. Dextroamphetamine was marketed in various other forms in the following decades, primarily by Smith, Kline, and French, such as several combination medications including a mixture of dextroamphetamine and amobarbital (a barbiturate) sold under the tradename Dexamyl and, in the 1950s, an extended release capsule (the [...] "Spansule"). Preparations containing dextroamphetamine were also used in World War II as a treatment against fatigue.|$|E
