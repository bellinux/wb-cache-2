40|$|The {{suppression}} of protoplasmic incompatibility resulting from nonallelic gene interactions has been {{obtained by the}} coupled effect of mutations in the modA and modB genes (Bernet 1971). Due to their female sterility, modA modB strains provide an experimental tool {{to determine whether or}} not the mod and incompatibility loci are involved in a function other than protoplasmic incompatibility. Present results show that modA modB female sterility is a nonautonomous trait since heterokaryotic mycelia that include a modA modB nucleus and a female <b>fertile</b> <b>nucleus</b> (wild-type, modA or modB) produce modA modB protoperithecia, which are also formed by culture on medium supplemented with specific amino acids. Using modA modB strains, which are sterile at 32 ° and fertile at 26 °, we have shown that the mod genes have no specific sequential timing. Indeed, the mod mutations may prevent the achievement of the female sexual cycle at any developmental stage from before early differentiation of protoperithecia until ascospore maturation. Employing different modA and modB mutations, we have shown that protoperithecia in modA modB cultures are generally distributed in female fertile rings; this result indicates that protoperithecia occur only in mycelial areas that have a restricted range of age at the time that modA modB thalli complete growth. Furthermore, nonsense mutations of incompatibility genes suppress the modA modB female fertile rings or restrict their width, suggesting that incompatibility loci, like the mod loci, are involved in protoperithecium formation. Taken together, these results lead to the postulate that mod and incompatibility genes do not determine, sensu stricto, protoperithecial function, as previously supposed (Boucherie and Bernet 1974), but may be involved in the homeostatic control of stationary cell functions essential for the complete development of the female sexual cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} nondestructively {{determine}} {{the presence and}} quantity of fissile and <b>fertile</b> <b>nuclei</b> in various matrices is important in several nuclear applications including international and domestics safeguards, radioactive waste characterization and nuclear facility operations. Material irradiation followed by delayed neutron counting is a well known and useful nondestructive assay technique {{used to determine the}} fissile-effective content of assay samples. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using Kalman filters to unfold individual isotopic contributions to delayed neutron measurements resulting from the assay of mixes of uranium and plutonium isotopes. However, the studies in question used simulated measurement data and idealized parameters. We present the results of the Kalman filter analysis of several measurements of U/Pu mixes taken using Argonne National Laboratory's delayed neutron nondestructive assay device. The results demonstrate the use of Kalman filters as a signal processing tool to determine the fissile and fertile isotopic content of an assay sample from the aggregate delayed neutron response following neutron irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Nontandem {{terminal}} chromosome duplications {{derived from}} N. crassa translocation T(I→VI) NM 103 give rise mitotically to some daughter nuclei {{which have become}} euploid by loss of {{one or the other}} of the two duplicated segments. Loss of the segment in normal sequence occurs as often as loss of the translocated segment. This is in contrast to all of several other Neurospora duplications that have been studied, where loss of the segment in normal sequence is absent or rare. ——T(NM 103) has the distal two thirds of linkage group IR exchanged with the right tip of VI. Crosses to normal sequence produce a class of morphologically distinct progeny with IR chromosome duplications. For a few days after germination, test crosses of these progeny are barren (make perithecia but few or no spores, as observed commonly with Neurospora duplications). Growing duplication cultures become <b>fertile</b> by accumulating <b>nuclei</b> which have been reduced to either normal sequence (by loss of the segment in translocation sequence) or translocation sequence (by loss of the segment in normal sequence). Both types usually appear within the first week of growth. Naturally formed mixtures or heterokaryons of NM 103 duplication nuclei and their reduced euploid products have been studied by plating and by progeny testing. Determination of nuclear type is based on culture morphology, expression of genetic markers, and crossing behavior. Within the limits of testing, loss is found to begin precisely at the interchange points. The unique finding of frequent breakdown of normal-sequence linkage group I chromosomes is not dependent on the strain from which the chromosome was derived. Many different strains were tested, and for each one evidence was found that nuclei reduced to translocation sequence had been produced from duplication nuclei by loss of the segment in normal sequence...|$|R
