Roasted coffee has an optimal typical shelf life of two weeks, and ground coffee about 15 minutes. Without some sort of preservation method, coffee becomes stale. The first large-scale preservation technique was vacuum packing in cans. However, because coffee emits CO2 after roasting, coffee to be vacuum-packed must be allowed to de-gas for several days before it is sealed. To allow more <b>immediate</b> <b>packaging,</b> pressurized canisters or foil-lined bags with pressure-relief valves can be used. Refrigeration and freezing retards the staling process.

40|$|Objectives To {{identify}} the practical problems that older people {{experience with the}} daily use of their medicines and their management strategies to address these problems and to determine the potential clinical relevance thereof. Design Qualitative study with semistructured face-to-face interviews. Setting A community pharmacy and a geriatric outpatient ward. Participants Community-dwelling people aged 70 and older (N = 59). Measurements Participants were interviewed at home. Two researchers coded the reported problems and management strategies independently according to a coding scheme. An expert panel classified the potential clinical relevance of every identified practical problem and associated management strategy using a 3 -point scale. Results Two hundred eleven practical problems and 184 management strategies were identified. Ninety-five {{percent of the participants}} experienced one or more practical problems with the use of their medicines: problems reading and understanding the instructions for use, handling the outer packaging, handling the <b>immediate</b> <b>packaging,</b> completing preparation before use, and taking the medicine. For 10 participants, at least one of their problems, in combination with the applied management strategy, had potential clinical consequences and 11 cases (5 % of the problems) had the potential to cause moderate or severe clinical deterioration. Conclusion Older people experience a number of practical problems using their medicines, and their strategies to manage these problems are sometimes suboptimal. These problems can lead to incorrect medication use with clinically relevant consequences. The findings pose a challenge for healthcare professionals, drug developers, and regulators to diminish these problems...|$|E
40|$|Cilazapril, a moisture-sensitive compound, {{is known}} to undergo rapid {{degradation}} which could be additionally facilitated {{by the presence of}} excipients that contain or absorb moisture. Hence we investigated the stability of cilazapril in two commercially-available dosage forms and in binary mixtures with the selected excipients used in the studied commercial formulations i. e. : hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, maize starch and talc in order to detect any possible, stability-affecting incompatibilities. Also the impact of the blister made of oriented polyamide/aluminum/polyvinyl chloride//aluminum on cilazapril-containing tablets was researched. A validated HPLC and HPLC-MS methods were used for analysis and the isothermal stress testing conditions were applied (temperature range 318 – 343  K, relative humidity 76. 4 % for tablets and temperature 333  K, relative humidity range 50. 9 – 76. 4 % for binary mixtures). It was shown that the degradation of cilazapril in both, model mixtures and tablets follows the autocatalytic model kinetics and it is more rapid than that observed for pure substance, evidenced by higher degradation rate constants. The <b>immediate</b> <b>packaging</b> protects cilazapril in tablets from degradation only in case of the original drug while in its blistered generic counterpart a slight but statistically insignificant increase of cilazapril decay occurs when compared to bare tablets (p <  0. 05). The degradation product of cilazapril in tablets and binary mixtures was identified as cilazaprilat. It was also observed that the increase of relative humidity or the presence of hypromellose, lactose and talc significantly impairs the stability of cilazapril in the aforementioned order. Only maize starch exhibited a positive effect on cilazapril stability (10. 8 % loss of cilazapril in binary mixture after 360  days of stressing compared to 35 % loss of pure cilazapril in analogous test conditions) probably thanks to its moisture-scavenging properties. It was suggested that in the manufacture of cilazapril-containing solid dosage forms the procedure of wet granulation should be avoided while hygroscopic excipients should be substituted by their non-hygroscopic counterparts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Few {{studies in}} Africa have {{explored}} {{in detail the}} ability of output-based aid (OBA) voucher programs to increase access to gender-based violence recovery (GBVR) services. Methods A qualitative {{study was conducted in}} 2010 and involved: (i) in-depth interviews (IDIs) with health managers, service providers, voucher management agency (VMA) managers and (ii) focus group discussions (FGDs) with voucher users, voucher non-users, voucher distributors and opinion leaders drawn from five program sites in Kenya. Results The findings showed promising prospects for the uptake of OBA GBVR services among target population. However, a number of factors affect the uptake of the services. These include lack of general awareness of the GBVR services vouchers, lack of understanding of the benefit <b>package,</b> <b>immediate</b> financial needs of survivors, as well as stigma and cultural beliefs that undermine reporting of cases or seeking essential medical services. Moreover, accreditation of only hospitals to offer GBVR services undermines access to the services in rural areas. Poor responsiveness from law enforcement agencies and fear of reprisal from perpetrators also undermine treatment options and access to medical services. Low provider knowledge on GBVR services and lack of supplies also affect effective provision and management of GBVR services. Conclusions The above findings suggest {{that there is a need}} to build the capacity of health care providers and police officers, strengthen the community strategy component of the OBA program to promote the GBVR services voucher, and conduct widespread community education programs aimed at prevention, ensuring survivors know how and where to access services and addressing stigma and cultural barriers. </p...|$|R
40|$| federal {{distribution}} of powers, arguing that determining {{the validity of}} an appropriation law requires us to “remember what position a national government occupies” and to take a broad view in doing so, all the while {{being careful not to}} overstep the division of power between {{the federal government and the}} states. In the AAP Case, thirty years later, Justice Mason largely endorsed the views of Chief Justice Latham. Using an argument closely resembling those put forward in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Case, his Honour argued that section 81 provides a parliamentary sanction for both the withdrawal of money and for its expenditure, but does not “supply legal authority for the Commonwealth’s engagement in the activities in connexion with which the moneys are to be spent. ” How section 81 can authorise the actual spending on a particular purpose without simultaneously authorising the Commonwealth’s “engagement” in that purpose was not entirely clear. Giving special consideration of the federal balance of power, Chief Justice Barwick in the AAP Case held that the words “purposes of the Commonwealth” were strictly words of limitation, not words conferring power. While these “purposes” may not be confined to the heads of legislative power in sections 51 and 52, they were nevertheless not a matter that should be left to the whim of parliament. The overriding imperative for Chief Justice Barwick was to maintain the federal {{distribution of}} power, irrespective of how desirable it might be to give the Commonwealth power in “affairs truly national in nature. ” All this confusion makes it marginally easier to sympathise with Pape’s motivation for bringing the present case (although, perhaps only from an academic perspective, rather than one of personal finances). Despite ultimately losing the case, Pape won on the essential core of his challenge in having the High Court unanimously reject the proposition that section 81 provides a substantive source of power simply to spend. It follows that the real power to actually spend the money appropriated needs to be found elsewhere in the Constitution. But, having agreed on this much, the High Court split on exactly where that might be. The “executive” power (s 61) Having settled the proper operation of sections 81 and 83 of the Constitution, the High Court then turned to determine whether the stimulus package could be justified as an exercise of the executive power (s 61) in combination with the incidental power (s 51 (xxxix)). A bare majority of the court (Chief Justice French, and Justices Gummow, Crennan and Bell in a joint judgment) believed that it could. These judgements borrowed heavily from the reasoning of Justice Mason in the AAP Case that the executive power allows the government to engage in activities “peculiarly adapted to the government of a nation and which cannot otherwise be carried on for the benefit of the nation. ” Justices Hayne and Kiefel together conceded that the executive power is broad enough to encompass concern with “national issues,” but rejected the argument that the stimulus package could be justified on this basis. Their Honours still held the Tax Bonus Act be valid, but only to the extent that the provisions of the Act could be read down to redefine the payments as a refund on tax liability (rather than as a bonus), such that the law could be seen as one with respect to taxation under s 51 (ii). Only Justice Heydon, in dissent, held that the payments were wholly invalid. Yet, even for the four Justices who upheld the Act as being supported by section 61, there was disagreement as to the true scope of the executive power and how the Tax Bonus Act might be a law with respect to it. While wary of attempts to define the full extent of the powers of the Executive too concretely, Chief Justice French favoured a conservative interpretation of section 61. His Honour held that the executive power was not limited to the legislative powers listed in section 51 and 52. Nevertheless, the power has to be capable of serving the proper purposes of a national government – that is, it must allow for a capacity to engage in enterprises and activities peculiarly adapted to the Commonwealth as a national polity. The executive power extends to “short-term fiscal measures to meet the adverse economic conditions affecting the nation as a whole, where such measures are on their face peculiarly within the capacity and resources of the Commonwealth Government” (such was His Honour’s description of the Tax Bonus Act). Still, Chief Justice French insisted, as did Justices Hayne and Kiefel in their judgment, that no matter how broadly interpreted, the executive power could not be used to disturb the federal balance of power. “National emergency” The majority’s joint judgment (authored by Justices Gummow, Hayne and Bell) similarly refrained from defining the outer-limits of the executive power, but broadly accepted the proposition that section 61 confers on the executive the power to engage in activities “peculiarly adapted to the government of a nation. ” The most remarkable aspect of the majority reasoning is that their Honours determined whether the need for an <b>immediate</b> fiscal stimulus <b>package</b> falls within the executive power by drawing an analogy to “a state of emergency in circumstances of a natural disaster. ” Since the executive is the arm of government most capable and equipped to respond to such a crisis, it follows that it must have a constitutional mandate to do so. In defence of this claim, the majority noted that “the world is experiencing a global recession triggered by a global financial and economic crisis which is the most severe deterioration in the global economy since the Great Depression and the most significant economic crisis since the Second World War. ” Reference was made to, amongst other things, the G 20 Meeting in November 2008, reports issued by the International Monetary Fund, and the government’s own forecasts as evidence that the economic downturn could indeed be categorised as a “crisis” in the constitutionally relevant sense of the word. The other Justices were quick to reject the “national crisis” analogy relied on by the majority, but Justice Heydon was particularly critical: “Modern linguistic usage suggests that the present age is one of ‘emergencies’, ‘crises’, ‘dangers’ and ‘intense difficulties’, of ‘scourges’ and other problems… Even if only a very narrow power to deal with an emergency on the scale of the global financial crisis were recognised, it would not take long before constitutional lawyers and politicians between them managed to convert that power into something capable of almost daily use. The great maxim of governments seeking wider constitutional powers would be: ‘Never allow a crisis to go to waste. ’” Having the benefit of hindsight, and given that the panic surrounding the financial crisis has somewhat abated, we might legitimately ask whether the majority was too quick to call upon the notion of a “national crisis” in this case. Looking forward, it may also be that the majority’s reading of the executive power is so broad as to make the unanimous finding as to the scope of section 81 redundant. If you reject the proposition that section 81 provides parliament with free rein to spend public money on any purpose it sees fit, but replace it with the proposition that anything vaguely resembling a “crisis” or “emergency” might justify an expansive use of the executive power in support of such spending anyway, is the practical effect on the parliamentary power to spend not essentially the same? Indeed, on one reading, it seems as though the confusion over the meaning of the phrase “purposes of the Commonwealth” found in section 81 has merely been replaced with confusion over the meaning of “peculiarly adapted to the government of a nation. ” As Justice Heydon pointed out, there are clearly good practical and political reasons to prevent appropriations from being abused as a means of creating de facto legislative powers. But there is an equally legitimate concern that the capacity of the federal government to spend public money is not too tightly constrained. The practical implications of rendering Acts of appropriation invalid after they have been passed – or even after the money has already been spent – are vast. Still, given the substitution of focus from section 81 to section 61, it may be something of an over-statement to claim that all parliamentary appropriations made over the last century thought to be supported by a “power” in section 81 are now at risk of being declared constitutionally invalid. It is far from clear that the Pape Case has compromised the spending power of the Commonwealth. The phrase “purposes of the Commonwealth” in section 81 was, at its widest, basically unlimited. While it is unlikely that the scope of the executive power will ever be quite that expansive, notions of being “peculiarly suited to national government” and of “national crisis” might be sufficiently broad to allow the Commonwealth to largely do what it wants anyway. On the other hand, neither of these concepts have been adequately defined in the present case and the ambiguity inherent in both might ultimately make life for the Commonwealth more difficult than it has been in the past when it comes to spending from the public purse. • Tessa Meyrick is researcher with the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law at the University of New South Wales Photo: Linda & Colin McKie/ iStockphoto. com  ...|$|R
