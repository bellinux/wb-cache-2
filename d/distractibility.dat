50|$|Mental {{disorders}} also {{go along}} with changes in different aspects of mind-wandering. In many disorders it is the regulation of the overall amount of mind-wandering that is disturbed, leading to increased <b>distractibility</b> when performing tasks. Additionally, the contents of mind-wandering is changed; thoughts can be more negative and past-oriented, particularly unstable or self-centered.|$|E
50|$|A {{continuous}} performance task, continuous performance test, or CPT, is any {{of several}} kinds of neuropsychological test that measures a person's sustained and selective attention. Sustained attention {{is the ability to}} maintain a consistent focus on some continuous activity or stimuli, and is associated with impulsivity. Selective attention is the ability to focus on relevant stimuli and ignore competing stimuli. This skill is associated with <b>distractibility.</b>|$|E
50|$|Individuals with ADHD exhibit {{deficiencies}} in self-regulation and self-motivation {{which in turn}} foster problematic characteristics such as <b>distractibility,</b> procrastination and disorganization. They are often perceived by others as chaotic, with a tendency to need high stimulation to be less distracted and function effectively. The learning potential and overall intelligence of an adult with ADHD, however, are {{no different from the}} potential and intelligence of adults who do not have the disorder.|$|E
50|$|The third edition was {{published}} in 1991 (WISC-III; Wechsler, 1991) and brought with it a new subtest {{as a measure of}} processing speed. In addition to the traditional VIQ, PIQ, and FSIQ scores, four new index scores were introduced to represent more narrow domains of cognitive function: the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), the Perceptual Organization Index (POI), the Freedom from <b>Distractibility</b> Index (FDI), and the Processing Speed Index (PSI).|$|E
50|$|For {{addicts and}} alcoholics, the {{physical}} dimension is best {{described by the}} allergy-like bodily reaction, which results in the compulsion to continue using substances after the initial use. For groups not related to substance abuse, this physical manifestation could be more varied including, but not limited to: compulsive hoarding, <b>distractibility,</b> eating disorders, dysfunctional enabling, hyperactivity, hypomania, insomnia, irritability, lack of motivation, laziness, mania, panic attacks, psychosomatic illnesses, poor impulse control, procrastination, self-injury and suicide attempts.|$|E
50|$|One {{study of}} 2600 {{children}} found that early exposure to television (around age two) {{is associated with}} later attention problems such as inattention, impulsiveness, disorganization, and <b>distractibility</b> at age seven.

5000|$|There {{have also}} been {{proposed}} revisions to part B of the diagnostic criteria for a Hypomanic Episode, {{which is used to}} diagnose For Bipolar I Disorder 296.40, Most Recent Episode Hypomanic. Part B lists [...] "inflated self-esteem, flight of ideas, <b>distractibility,</b> and decreased need for sleep" [...] as symptoms of a Hypomanic Episode. This has been confusing in the field of child psychiatry because these symptoms closely overlap with symptoms of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the criticisms}} {{associated}} with using animals to research essentially human conditions, Sagvolden supported his Dynamic Developmental Theory of ADHD using research primarily done using Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats. In addition, {{numerous studies have}} been conducted in the SHR in relation to other elements of ADHD, for example, looking at the impact of different drug treatments such as atomoxetine and methylphenidate on tests of impulsivity and attention and hyperactivity, investigating possible neural correlates of heightened <b>distractibility</b> in ADHD and assessing reward function.|$|E

50|$|Overall, {{studies have}} shown that people with ADHD tend to have lower scores on {{intelligence}} quotient (IQ) tests. The significance of this is controversial due to the differences between people with ADHD and the difficulty determining the influence of symptoms, such as <b>distractibility,</b> on lower scores rather than intellectual capacity. In studies of ADHD, higher IQs may be over represented because many studies exclude individuals who have lower IQs despite those with ADHD scoring on average 9 points lower on standardized intelligence measures.|$|E
5000|$|The crux of Saiving's {{argument}} in the article is that the focus on pride characteristic of traditional Christian interpretations of sin reflects male experience {{in a way that}} is inappropriate to the experience of most, if not all, women, who are much more likely to be prone to [...] "triviality, <b>distractibility,</b> and diffuseness; lack of an organizing center or focus; dependence on others for one's self-definition; tolerance at the expense of standards of excellence ... in short, underdevelopment or negation of the Self." ...|$|E
5000|$|A key {{component}} of the hypothesis is that the proposed [...] "hyperfocus" [...] aspect of ADHD is a gift or benefit under appropriate circumstances. The hypothesis also explains the <b>distractibility</b> factor in ADHD individuals and their short attention span for subject matter that does not trigger hyperfocus, along with various other characteristics such as apathy towards social norms, poor planning and organizing ability, distorted sense of time, impatience, attraction to variety or novelty or excitement, and impulsiveness. It is argued that in the hunter-gatherer cultures that preceded farming societies, hunters needed hyperfocus more than gatherers.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} schutzhund titles: Schutzhund 1 (SchH1), Schutzhund 2 (SchH2), and Schutzhund 3 (SchH3). SchH1 {{is the first}} title and SchH3 is the most advanced. Additionally, before a dog can compete for an SchH1, it must pass a {{temperament}} test called a B or BH (Begleithundprüfung, which translates as [...] "traffic-sure companion dog test"). The B tests basic obedience and sureness around strange people, strange dogs, traffic, and loud noises. A dog that exhibits excessive fear, <b>distractibility,</b> or aggression cannot pass the B and so cannot go on to schutzhund.|$|E
5000|$|The CCAS {{has been}} {{described}} in both adults and children. The precise manifestations may vary on an individual basis, likely reflecting the precise location of the injury in the cerebellum. [...] These investigators subsequently elaborated on the affective component of the CCAS, i.e., the neuropsychiatric phenomena. They reported that patients with injury isolated to the cerebellum may demonstrate <b>distractibility,</b> hyperactivity, impulsiveness, disinhibition, anxiety, ritualistic and stereotypical behaviors, illogical thought and lack of empathy, aggression, irritability, ruminative and obsessive behaviors, dysphoria and depression, tactile defensiveness and sensory overload, apathy, childlike behavior, and inability to comprehend social boundaries and assign ulterior motives.|$|E
50|$|In {{more modern}} times, {{research}} surrounding attention disorders has traditionally focused on hyperactive symptoms, but began to newly address inattentive symptoms in the 1970s. Influenced by this research, the DSM-III (1980) {{allowed for the}} first time a diagnosis of an ADD subtype that presented without hyperactivity. Researchers exploring this subtype created rating scales for children which included questions regarding symptoms such as short attention span, <b>distractibility,</b> drowsiness, and passivity. In the mid 1980s, it was proposed that as opposed to the then accepted dichotomy of ADD with or without hyperactivity (ADD/H, ADD/noH), instead a three factor model of ADD was more appropriate, consisting of hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention-disorganization, and slow tempo subtypes.|$|E
5000|$|By 1974 Levinson's {{cerebellar}} {{and related}} inner-ear theory that dyslexia {{has been mentioned}} in the popular press. His cerebellar-vestibular theory led him to treating children with dyslexia as he would children with an inner ear problem, using anti-motion sickness medication. He also used the same over-the-counter medication to help treat the associated attention deficit, hyperactivity, impaired concentration and <b>distractibility.</b> In interviews about his treatment he has stated that [...] "The inner ear and cerebellum work like a fine-tuner to the brain", and the motion sickness medication helps with the fine tuning. His findings suggested that cerebellar problems cause a scrambling of information, which secondarily confuse higher brain processors.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{described}} in the hypomanic episode are also commonly associated with ADHD, such as increased energy, <b>distractibility</b> and impulsive or risk-seeking behavior. This is of particular concern in child psychiatry because symptoms, especially hyperactivity, may be counted twice toward both disorders or may inflate the prevalence of ADHD.While childhood ADHD often presents with hyperactivity, adult ADHD often does not. The unstable lifestyle often found both in people with ADHD and in those with cyclothymia can cause problems for differential diagnosis. Important distinguishing factors include that ADHD is characterized mainly by problems with concentration and memory, while cyclothymia mainly by periods of elevated self-confidence and elation.|$|E
5000|$|Inattention is the {{cardinal}} and required symptom to diagnose delirium and is noticeable on interview by <b>distractibility</b> and inability to shift and / or sustain attention. [...] More formal testing can include {{the months of}} the year backwards, serial sevens or digit span tests. Disorientation (another symptom of confusion, and usually a more severe one) describes the loss of awareness of the surroundings, environment and context in which the person exists. It may also appear with delirium, but it is not required, as noted. Disorientation may occur in time (not knowing what time of day, day of week, month, season or year it is), place (not knowing where one is) or person (not knowing who one is).|$|E
50|$|LI is {{affected}} by many factors, {{one of the most}} important of which is context. In virtually all LI studies, the context remains the same in the stimulus pre-exposure and test phases. However, if context is changed from the pre-exposure to the test phase, then LI is severely attenuated. The context-dependency of LI plays major roles in all current theories of LI, and in particular to their applications to schizophrenia, where it has been proposed that relationship between the pre-exposed stimulus and the context breaks down; context no longer sets the occasion for the expression of the stimulus-no consequence association. Consequently, working-memory is inundated with experimentally familiar but phenomenally novel stimuli, each competing for the limited resources required for efficient information processing. This description fits well with the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly high <b>distractibility,</b> as well as with research findings.|$|E
50|$|Case #1: A 30-year-old, {{right-handed}} man {{was admitted}} to the department of neurology for irritability, inappropriate behavior, and morbid hyperphagia with obesity. His inappropriate laughter and persistent pun and joke telling was a sharp contrast to his personality as an intellectual theological scholar, known for his exceptional memory as opposed to his sense of humor. This behavior was generally prompted by environmental stimuli such as physician’s rounds or blood sampling. To the patient, his behavior seemed normal, which explains why he remained nondiscriminating toward his jokes, their context, and their impression on those around him. Neurological examination revealed mild spastic left hemiparesis with minimal motor coordination and impairment of voluntary fine movements. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed hypoperfusion, or decreased blood flow, in the right frontoparietal area. Additionally, verbal and performance tests showed evidence of poor concentration skills, high <b>distractibility,</b> and difficulty with visual-spatial tasks. The patient’s performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was severely impaired, suggesting frontal dysfunction.|$|E
50|$|Alexander Thomas, Stella Chess, Herbert G. Birch, Margaret Hertzig and Sam Korn {{began the}} classic New York Longitudinal {{study in the}} early 1950s {{regarding}} infant temperament (Thomas, Chess & Birch, 1968). The study focused on how temperamental qualities influence adjustment throughout life. Chess, Thomas et al. rated young infants on nine temperament characteristics, each of which, by itself, or with connection to another, affects how well a child fits in at school, with their friends, and at home. Behaviors for {{each one of these}} traits are on a continuum. If a child leans towards the high or low end of the scale, it could be a cause for concern. The specific behaviors are: activity level, regularity of sleeping and eating patterns, initial reaction, adaptability, intensity of emotion, mood, <b>distractibility,</b> persistence and attention span, and sensory sensitivity. Redundancies between the categories have been found and a reduced list is normally used by psychologists today.|$|E
5000|$|Broadbent et al. (1982) {{developed}} the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), a self-report measure designed {{to identify the}} presence of [...] "cognitive slippage." [...] For {{the purposes of the}} CFQ, however, they used this term to refer to lapses in attention, difficulty processing information, memory issues, perception problems, and complications in decision-making. As such, their definition tapped into issues such as [...] "forgetfulness" [...] or [...] "inattention" [...] rather than the clinically significant cognitive dysfunction defined by Meehl. Yates, Hannell, and Lippett (1985) designed a study to evaluate the predictive value of the CFQ as a means to identify psychological vulnerability under stressful conditions, such as during a test. 72 female participants were administered the CFQ as well as the Test Anxiety Scale as they completed two tasks - the former of which, they were told, was a practice test for the later. It was found that during the second test condition, subjects did report more [...] "cognitive slippage" [...] in the form of mind-wandering and <b>distractibility.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Cerebellar {{cognitive}} affective syndrome (CCAS), {{also called}} [...] "Schmahmann's syndrome" [...] {{is a condition}} that follows from lesions (damage) to the cerebellum of the brain. This syndrome, described by Dr. Jeremy Schmahmann and his colleagues refers to a constellation of deficits in the cognitive domains of executive function, spatial cognition, language, and affect resulting from damage to the cerebellum. [...] Impairments of executive function include problems with planning, set-shifting, abstract reasoning, verbal fluency, and working memory, and there is often perseveration, <b>distractibility</b> and inattention. Language problems include dysprosodia, agrammatism and mild anomia. Deficits in spatial cognition produce visual-spatial disorganization and impaired visual-spatial memory. Personality changes manifest as blunting of affect or disinhibited and inappropriate behavior. These cognitive impairments result in an overall lowering of intellectual function. [...] CCAS challenges the traditional view of the cerebellum being responsible solely for regulation of motor functions. It is now thought that the cerebellum is responsible for monitoring both motor and nonmotor functions. The nonmotor deficits described in CCAS {{are believed to be}} caused by dysfunction in cerebellar connections to the cerebral cortex and limbic system.|$|E
50|$|The Child Mania Rating Scale (CMRS) {{was created}} as a {{complement}} already existing measures like the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale and the Young Mania Rating Scale, which were formulated for adults and adolescents respectively. The purpose of the CMRS is to both assess the symptoms of mania in pediatric bipolar disorder, and to accurately discriminate the symptoms of mania from symptoms of ADHD. It {{is important that the}} CMRS accurately discriminate from symptoms of ADHD because core symptoms of adolescent Bipolar Disorder and ADHD are shared between the two disorders: hyperactivity, impulsivity, and <b>distractibility.</b> The CMRS was designed specifically for younger children {{who may or may not}} have the ability to accurately answer questions about their behavior. As a result, the questionnaire is filled out by parents are/or caregivers who work with the children on a daily basis. Previous mania scales were designed for use by either the clinician or the patient. Therefore, the CMRS is unique in that it allows parents and caregivers to contribute information about their child's symptoms. This is especially important in cases where the child may be too young to fill out the questionnaires themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Delinking early trauma {{from the}} {{etiology}} of dissociation has been explicitly rejected by those supporting the early trauma model. However, a 2012 review article supports the hypothesis that current or recent trauma may affect an individual's assessment of the more distant past, changing {{the experience of the}} past and resulting in dissociative states. [...] Giesbrecht et al. have suggested there is no actual empirical evidence linking early trauma to dissociation, and instead suggest that problems with neuropsychological functioning, such as increased <b>distractibility</b> in response to certain emotions and contexts, account for dissociative features. A middle position hypothesizes that trauma, in some situations, alters neuronal mechanisms related to memory. Evidence is increasing that dissociative disorders are related both to a trauma history and to [...] "specific neural mechanisms". It has also been suggested {{that there may be a}} genuine but more modest link between trauma and DID, with early trauma causing increased fantasy-proneness, which may in turn render individuals more vulnerable to socio-cognitive influences surrounding the development of DID. Another suggestion made by Hart indicates that there are triggers in the brain that can be the catalyst for different self-states, and that victims of trauma are more susceptible to these triggers than non-victims of trauma; These triggers are said to be related to DID.|$|E
5000|$|Pharmacology divides {{hallucinogens}} {{into three}} classes.
