5|$|Bishop Short and {{his family}} moved into the house later in 1851, and resided there until Bishop's Court, North Adelaide, {{was ready to be}} {{occupied}} in 1856. During the same year, Sir Samuel Davenport purchased the house and land from Bishop Short and lived in 'The Lodge', a small cottage at the entrance to what became the <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> Beaumont House, until Short vacated Claremont.|$|E
5|$|The {{church and}} {{cemetery}} are accessible through a gravel <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> the north; to the west, {{a cluster of}} tall oak trees blocks access to the road. Capon Chapel is landscaped with boxwoods on its north and south sides, a single holly on its east side, and forsythias along its west side. The Capon Chapel property consists of the church structure (c. 1852), and its associated cemetery, which is enclosed partly by the historic wrought iron fence and partly by a chain link fence. A flagpole stands {{at the center of}} the cemetery's eastern perimeter.|$|E
5|$|In late 2006, the Jamul Indian tribe {{prepared}} {{to construct a}} casino, but many expressed concerns {{about the amount of}} traffic that would now travel on SR 94. In 2007, Caltrans declared that the construction required a permit to connect to SR94 and to construct on the state right-of-way. At the end of the year, the tribe had started construction on the <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the information needed to determine if the proposed traffic signal should be approved. In late 2009, the tribe filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the driveway with the highway. The tribe made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and the tribe came to an agreement in 2009, where the tribe would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation.|$|E

25|$|For example, given a deeded {{easement}} to use someone else's <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> reach a garage, if a fence or permanently locked gate {{prevents the}} use, nothing {{is done to}} remove and circumvent the obstacle, and the statutory period expires, then the easement ceases to have any legal force, although the deed held by the fee-simple owner stated that the owner's interest was subject to the easement.|$|E

50|$|Most expressways {{under the}} federal {{definition}} have speed limits of 45-55 mph (70-90 km/h) in urban areas and 55-70 mph (90-110 km/h) in rural areas. Urban expressways are usually free of private driveways, but occasional exceptions include direct <b>driveways</b> <b>to</b> gas stations and shopping malls at major intersections (which would never be allowed on a true freeway).|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} {{originally}} {{housing for the}} prison's employees and their families. Residents rent their <b>driveways</b> <b>to</b> media vans during controversial executions.

This garners much media attention.|$|R
25|$|The {{trackbed}} {{is partly}} the <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> {{a new house}} next {{to the site of}} a former level crossing. The station building is now part of the aptly named Beeching's Way Industrial Estate. The main buildings were, in 1995, occupied by John White (Alford) Printers, which used a workshop erected across part of the trackbed and abutting the station building. The remaining section of the trackbed {{to the rear of the}} station has been infilled and used as a car park. The platform roof has been removed In 2009, the station building and attached industrial unit were sold to Jackson's Building Centres and reopened as building suppliers. The station building has been extensively restored externally.|$|E
25|$|SR 574 {{begins at}} a stop-controlled T-intersection at SR 566 in {{northern}} Seneca Township. The route heads northeast through mostly forest {{with an occasional}} driveway for lake access. The road curves to the northwest after entering Wayne Township, passing the main entrance road for the Seneca Lake State Park. Shortly after the access road, the state route descends in elevation to a small village with a cluster of houses and turns onto {{the top of the}} Senecaville Dam. The route enters Guernsey County and is now {{on the top of the}} earthen dam. After crossing the dam's main spillway, SR 574 intersects the <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> the Senecaville Lake Fish Hatchery. The route finishes crossing the dam, passes a small baseball field, and ends at SR 313 in Richland Township.|$|E
25|$|A ninth or tenth century cross {{stands on}} a modern base in the grounds (see below) {{and is the only}} {{remaining}} example surviving from a collection of several stones, put together by Captain Robert Riddell, and once placed along the <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> the house; one or more may have been at the site originally. Francis Grose recorded that stones from nearby Lag and Morton Castles were in the collection at one time; the Lag stone cut with the letters I. G. and the arms of the Grierson family, namely three cushions, in the centre of a mullet. Robert Riddell {{went so far as to}} construct an imitation Bronze Age circle of weathered stones. This bogus stone circle of 38 stones, all standing except three, one of which is in the centre and one just west of the circle; the site was named Templewood.|$|E
50|$|While World War II slowed their expansion, {{the years}} after the war found large growth in {{roadworks}} and also in the building of the Comalco Aluminium Smelter and Roxburgh Hydro plant.

25|$|The gate to {{the field}} below the mound has three {{sandstone}} gateposts laid horizontally, {{two of them are}} exceptionally large and could be the ornamented gateposts from the old entrance and <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> Chapelton (old) House. The actual drive is now represented by the curling pond behind the walled up entrance and the OS maps show an entrance here until at least 1911. Chapeltoun Mains has only one gatepost and both High Chapeltoun and Chapelhill house have none. These changes probably reflect the requirement to have access for large modern farm machinery. The gateposts are machine cut sandstone and the same design is found elsewhere, such as at the Kennox lodge, Cankerton and opposite Peacockbank Farm (previously Pearce Bank) near Stewarton, near the original entrance road to Lochridge. In 1775 Armstrong's map shows the road going no further than Lochridge (formerly Lochrig). A wind-pump is shown situated above Chapeltoun House on the 1923 OS map.|$|E
500|$|On the church's northeastern {{elevation}} {{there are}} three large, symmetrical stained-glass windows, each with a fixed upper sash and a lower hopper sash. Like the main façade's doorways and windows, the sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks of the stained-glass windows are white-painted stone. Below the windows is an exposed coursed-stone foundation with five tie-rod masonry anchor plates. A small brick chimney is present on this elevation. The church's southwestern elevation also has a coursed-stone foundation, with five tie-rod anchor plates, banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained-glass windows with fixed upper sashes and lower hopper sashes and encased with white-painted stone sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks. On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line. Downspouts are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations. The church's southeastern (rear) elevation has an exposed coursed-stone foundation [...] high, due to its location on sloping ground. At {{the center of this}} elevation is a protruding, gabled brick extension for the interior altar, with symmetrical stained-glass windows on both sides. The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum flashing. An 1895 wrought-iron fence encloses the property's northwestern perimeter, and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> the two main entrances.|$|E

2500|$|A {{private road}} once ran across {{all of the}} Hollins holdings, {{crossing}} Bayview Ave and through the estate of HB Hollins Jr., where it continued into what is now Hecksher State Park. [...] The outline of this road can be seen running through the woods {{on one of the}} last undeveloped parcels of land off White Oak Lane. [...] As recently as the 1980s, one area resident was concerned as the road was still listed as a legal right-of-way in his property deed. [...] a local historian believes that parts of this road, particularly the part of it {{on the east side of}} bayview avenue which included the <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> HB Hollins Jrs. house, Crick Holly, was one of the earliest roads in the area and connected the first Nichol settlement located on the shore of the bay in Hecksher Park with Gibbs Patent, and a grist mill which Nichol and Gibbs operated on the west side of Chaplain's Creek and on to the village of islip. [...] This road ran diagonal across all of the known and modern, grid like, roads in the area and the last of it, with the exception of what remains in Hecksher Park, was the <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> HB Hollins Jrs. Crick Holly; if this was in fact a colonial era road, and there is strong evidence it was, it was obliterated with little attention when Crick Holly was developed in the 1980s. [...] The locals at the time assumed the road was the <b>driveway</b> <b>to</b> a Hollins' House; now it appears to have had more significance.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{elements}} of the Middle Road, to which engineers paid particular attention in future highway design, was controlled access. While the section between the Humber River and Highway 27 was built without allowance for private driveways, and was thus controlled-access, many at-grade intersections lie along the Middle Road west of Highway 27, and many adjoining landowners built <b>driveways</b> <b>to</b> the highway for access, an issue that {{led to the creation of}} legislation to allow the designation of a road as 'controlled-access'.|$|R
5000|$|Both routes 159 Portland Hills Link and 185 Sackville Link saw {{unprecedented}} ridership in {{the first}} few months of service.
