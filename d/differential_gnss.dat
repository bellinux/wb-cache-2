The practicality of MAV mapping is seriously enhanced {{with the ability to}} determine parameters of exterior orientation (EO) with sufficient accuracy, in both absolute and relative senses (change of attitude between successive images). While <b>differential</b> carrier phase <b>GNSS</b> satisfies cm-level positioning accuracy, precise attitude determination is essential for both direct sensor orientation (DiSO) and integrated sensor orientation (ISO) in corridor mapping or in block configuration imaging over surfaces with low texture. Limited cost, size, and weight of MAVs represent limitations on quality of onboard navigation sensors and puts emphasis on exploiting full capacity of available resources. Typically short flying times (10 - 30 minutes) also limit the possibility of estimating and/or correcting factors such as sensor misalignment and poor attitude initialization of inertial navigation system (INS). This research aims at increasing the accuracy of attitude determination in both absolute and relative senses with no extra sensors onboard. In comparison to classical INS/GNSS setup, novel approach is presented here to integrated state estimation, in which vehicle dynamic model (VDM) is used as the main process model. Such system benefits from available information from autopilot and physical properties of the platform in enhancing performance of determination of trajectory and parameters of exterior orientation consequently. The navigation system employs a <b>differential</b> carrier phase <b>GNSS</b> receiver and a micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) grade inertial measurement unit (IMU), together with MAV control input from autopilot.

40|$|Nowadays, Global Navigation Satellite Systems or GNSS {{allow to}} measure {{positions}} in real-time with an accuracy {{ranging from a}} few meters to a few centimeters mainly {{depending on the type}} of observable (code or phase measurements) and on the positioning mode used (absolute or differential). The best precisions can be reached in differential mode using phase measurements. In differential mode, mobile users improve their positioning precision thanks to so-called “differential corrections” provided by a fixed reference station. For example, the Real-Time Kinematic technique (RTK) allows to measure positions in real-time with a precision usually better than a decimeter. In practice, the ionospheric effects on GNSS radio signals remain the main factor which limits the precision and the reliability of real-time differential positioning. As differential applications are based on the assumption that the measurements made by the reference station and by the mobile user are affected in the same way by ionospheric effects, these applications are influenced by gradients in TEC between the reference station and the user. For this reason, local variability in the ionospheric plasma can be the origin of strong degradations in positioning precision. In this paper, we characterize local variability in the ionosphere which can pose a threat to high precision real-time <b>differential</b> positioning. <b>GNSS</b> carrier phase measurements can be used to monitor local TEC variability: small-scale ionospheric structures can be detected by monitoring TEC high frequency changes at a single station; as ionospheric disturbances are moving, we can expect that such structures will induce TEC temporal variability which can be detected at a single station. We applied this method (called the “one-station” method) to the GPS data collected at the permanent (mid-latitude) station of Brussels from 1994 to 2007 and performed a climatological study of the ionospheric structures on this period which covers more than one solar cycle. Two main types of structures have been observed: Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TID’s) and “noise-like” structures. TID’s have strong seasonal and solar cycle dependence when noise-like structures are “ionospheric variability” which is usually observed during geomagnetic storms. The largest Rate of TEC (RoTEC) detected at Brussels during the period considered in our study were observed during severe geomagnetic storms. Moreover, we found that strong irregularities occur even during solar minimum. This means that, even during periods where the probability of occurrence of ionospheric irregularities is very low, large RoTEC can occur. The one-station method allows to measure variability in time but <b>GNSS</b> <b>differential</b> applications are affected by variability in space between the user and the reference station. Therefore, in a second step, we measured TEC differential variability (using double differences of phase measurements) during few typical ionospheric conditions: quiet ionospheric activity, medium and large amplitude TID’s and noise-like variability due to a severe geomagnetic storm. We also analyzed the effects of the baseline length and orientation on the residual ionospheric term. As a last step, we developed a software which reproduces positioning conditions experienced by RTK users on the field. We used this software to assess positioning errors due to the different ionospheric conditions considered in the previous step. Again, the largest effects were observed during the occurrence of geomagnetic storms. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Code-based autonomous solutions can cause major errors in the estimated position, due primarily to multipath effects. A custom procedure of autonomous GPS positioning has been developed, boosting the positioning performance through appropriate processing of code and Doppler observations. Besides the common positioning procedures, robust estimation methods have been used to minimise the effects of gross observation errors. In normal conditions, <b>differential</b> <b>GNSS</b> yields good results, however, under adverse conditions, it fails to improve significantly the receiver 2 ̆ 7 s position. Therefore, a so-called conditional DGPS has been developed which determines the position differentially by using data from the strong signals only. These custom-developed procedures have been tested in different conditions in static and kinematic cases and the results have been compared to those processed by the receiver...|$|E
40|$|Ground-based pseudolite {{navigation}} {{systems have}} several limitations, such as low vertical accuracy, susceptibility to multipath effects, and near-far signal problems. These limitations could be addressed with an airborne pseudolite system. However, to ensure high user positioning accuracy the aerial signal transmitters {{have to be}} accurately positioned. Commonly used methods {{are based on the}} “inverted GNSS” principle, with ground stations monitoring the pseudolites, or the <b>differential</b> <b>GNSS</b> (DGNSS) technique with one or more reference stations. However, the inverted GNSS method introduces delay for user positioning, while DGNSS has stringent requirements that include simultaneous measurements made by both the pseudolite(s) and the reference station(s), and a limitation on the distance between pseudolite(s) and reference station(s). To address such problems the authors propose an airborne pseudolite system, where the pseudolites are positioned using the GNSS Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique. To enhance the pseudolite positioning performance, inter-pseudolite range measurements could be used as additional observations. The performance of the proposed system is validated using simulation tests. The results show that A-PL achieves the best positioning accuracy with measurements from both G-PLs and limited GNSS satellites or only from G-PLs where no satellite signals are available...|$|E
40|$|Combined multi-global {{navigation}} satellite system (GNSS) signals {{are capable of}} improving satel-lite availability for both standalone and differential positioning. Currently, the potential for high-accuracy automobile navigation using GNSS is constrained by severe multipath and poor satellite geometry, especially in “urban canyons ” in large cities. With <b>differential</b> <b>GNSS</b> (D-GNSS) position-ing, inconvenient system time differences can be removed by reference-station processing, allow-ing a user’s receiver position to be accurately calculated using four or more visible satellite signals. Therefore, in the future, we can filter numerous multi-GNSS measurements based on their quality {{in order to enhance}} the positioning performance in urban environments. In this paper, we present several methods that use multi-GNSS to filter signals from satellites containing severe multipath errors. In addition, we select single-frequency code-based D-GNSS because it has significant poten-tial due to its low cost and robustness. The first method uses the measured carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N 0). When only reflected signals are received in dense urban areas, the C/N 0 will decrease by more than 6 dB-Hz, with the exception of high-elevation satellites. Thus, by comparing the measured and expected C/N 0 at various elevation angles, {{we may be able to}} detect the presence of sever...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} released TanDEM-X intermediate {{digital elevation model}} (IDEM) product by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) provides elevation models at 12 -m spatial resolution and above. It was derived from bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry using the two TerraSAR-X satellites flying in close constellation. The {{aim of this study}} was to validate the vertical accuracy of the IDEM data at study sites in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Two validation locations are presented: a dried up former reservoir (Nhlanganzwani Dam) characterized by bare soil and grassland and the peninsula between the Sabie and Sand Rivers near Skukuza characterized by dense woody cover. The results show that the IDEM elevation data are affected by residual vegetation canopy height and landform features smaller than the IDEM resolution cell. The scattering phase centers are located in the canopy but at a lower height than the location of the LiDAR first return signal. When only LiDAR ground hits or <b>differential</b> <b>GNSS</b> ground survey points are used for comparison, the IDEM data have an rmse <; 1 m and a small bias of less than 0. 25 m in moderate terrain.

40|$|The GPS {{observations}} of both Latvian permanent GNSS networks – EUPOS®-Riga and LatPos, {{have been collected}} {{for a period of}} 8 years – from 2007 to 2014. Local surface displacements have been derived from obtained coordinate time series eliminating different impact sources. The Bernese software is used for data processing. The EUREF Permanent Network (EPN) stations in surroundings of Latvia are selected as fiducial stations. The results have shown a positive tendency of vertical displacements in the western and central parts of Latvia – station heights are increasing, and negative velocities are observed in the eastern part. Station vertical velocities are ranging in diapason of 4 mm/year. In the case of horizontal displacements, site velocities are up to 1 mm/year and mostly oriented to the south. The comparison of obtained results with data from the deformation model NKG_RF 03 vel has been made. Additionally, {{the purpose of this study}} is to analyse GPS time series obtained using two different data processing strategies: Precise Point Positioning (PPP) and estimation of station coordinates relatively to the positions of fiducial stations also known as <b>Differential</b> <b>GNSS</b> (DGNSS) ...|$|E
