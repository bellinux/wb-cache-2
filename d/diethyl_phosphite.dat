Friedel-Crafts cyclization of the olefin with the equivalent of PPA then gives the thiopyran (3). Acylation with acetyl chloride {{in the presence of}} aluminium chloride gives the methyl ketone (4).

40|$|The {{application}} of the Arbusov reaction to generate a nucleoside-containing phosphoryl halide for use in oligonucleotide synthesis has been investigated. In Arbusov reactions on mixed trialkyl phosphites, t-butyl halide is always lost in preference to methyl, ethyl or cyclo-pentyl halide. Exploitation of this apparent SNI nature of {{the second stage of}} the reaction was proposed. The phosphitylating agent t-butyl methyl phosphorochloridite was found not to be isolable and t-butyl methyl N, N-dimethyl phosphoramidite upon phosphitylation of a 5 '-protected monomer using tetrazole as acid catalyst was prone to loss of isobutylene The use of alternative groupings, namely, 2 -methoxyethyl, 1 -methoxypropan 2 -yl, allyl, 1 -methoxy- 2 -methyl propan- 2 -yl and 1 -methylcyclopentyl to exploit the SNI nature of the reaction proved unsuccessful. Dimethyl phosphorochloridite was found to phosphitylate a 5 '- protected monomer efficiently. Reaction with bromine proceeded with exclusive loss of methyl bromide. SN 2 attack at methyl is thought to occur preferentially since bromide ion is sterically prevented from attacking the 3 '-position by the nucleobase and the bulky trityl protecting group. The resulting phosphorobromidates were found to phosphorylate the 5 '-hydroxyl of a 3 '-protected monomer efficiently in solution in the presence of l-methylimidazole. DMF, DMPU, pyridine and tetrazole have also been investigated as activating agents. Using o-chlorophenyl as the internucleotide protecting group this procedure was unsuccessful but this led to a series of interesting acid catalysed ligand exchange reactions on aryl <b>diethyl</b> <b>phosphites</b> containing various substituted aryl groups, those with the most electron-withdrawing substituents generally exchanging most rapidly. The route beginning from dimethyl phosphorochloridite was investigated on a CPG polymer support. A thymidine residue bearing an acid labile 5 '- 0 -protecting group and attached through its 3 '-position via a succinate linkage and a LCAA spacer to the polymer support was deprotected with trichloroacetic acid. Subsequent phosphorylation of the free 5 '-hydroxyl was found to be inefficient, the reason suggested being that the longer phosphorylation reaction times required on the solid support allowed demethylation of the active phosphorylating agent by halide ion to occur...|$|R

Dissociations of neutral 1, as identified by variable-time measurements, involved rate-determining isomerization to 2 followed by fast loss of water. A competitive loss of H occurs from long-lived excited states of 1 produced by vertical electron transfer.

40|$|Este trabalho pode ser dividido em três partes principais: (a) - síntese dos substratos (b) - isolamento dos produtos de reação (c) - estudos cinéticos No item (a), foram preparadas cerca de vinte e seis Bases de Schiff do tipo ArCH=NAr contendo diversos substituintes na posição para dos dois anéis. Preparou-se, também, um composto contendo um substituinte alquilamina(n-butilamina) no lugar da porção anilínica da molécula; dois N-metilados (sais,na forma de tosilatos); e um na forma de nitrona. No item(b) os produtos finais de reações foram isolados e identificados. Estas reações foram de adição nucleofílica simples ou seguida por uma eliminação-b. Os estudos cinéticos (item c) concentraram-se nas reações das Bases de Schiff com semicarbazida. O mecanismo proposto é em duas etapas; a saber, uma adição nucleofílica seguida por eliminação-b. Assim, prevê-se que aceptores no anel anilínico facilitariam e doadores dificultariam as duas etapas. Em contraste,aceptores e doadores no anel benzal facilitariam uma das etapas e dificultariam a outra. Os nossos resultados foram concordantes com estas previsões. Encontramos alguns casos onde há pouco ou nenhum aumento de velocidade com a temperatura. Verificamos ainda que as reações com a nitrona e os dois sais são muito dificultadas. A nitrona reage mais lentamente do que a Base de Schiff correspondente a 25 °C, velocidade relativa = 0, 22. O sal PhCH=N PhMe Tos não reage nem a 100 °C(18 horas); o sal PhCH=N n-BuMe Tos só reage lentamente nesta faixa de temperatura com 30 % de reação. Foi verificado também, o efeito da variação de pH e especialmente a catálise ácida. As reações da N-benzilidenanilina com o dietil fosfito e dietil malonato foram ambas de y -primeira ordem com relação ao nucleófilo, sendo que o dietil fosfito é bem mais reativo que o dietil malonato. The {{experimental}} {{work can be}} divided into three principal parts: (a) - synthesis of substrates (b) - isolation of reaction products (c) - kinetic studies In part (a) some twenty-six Schiff Bases of the type ArCH=NAr were prepared containing various substituents, principally in the para positions of the two rings. Also prepared were: a compound containing an alkyamine (n-butylamine) in place af an aniline residue, a nitrone, and two N-methylated derivatives (salts, in the form of tosylates). In part (b) the final reaction products were isolated and identified. These reactions were of nucleophilic addition, either simple or followed by a b-elimination. The kinetic studies, part (c), dealt mainly with the reactions of Schiff Bases with semicarbazide. The mechanism proposed is of two steps, viz. nucleophilic addition, followed by b-elimination. It is possible to predict that, as substituents in the aniline ring, eIectron-withdrawing groups facilitate and electron-releasing groups hinder both steps. In contrast, as substituents in the benzal ring, both types of groups facilitate one step and hinder the other. Our results are in accordance with these predictions. In a few cases there was little or no increase in velocity of reaction with increase of temperature. We also showed that the reactions of the two salts were considerably hindered. The nitrone reacts more slowly than the carresponding Schiff Base at 25 °C (relative rate=O, 22). The salt PhCH=N Me Ph Tos does not react at alI during 18 hours at 100 °C and the salt PhCH=N Me n-Bu Tos reacts very slowly in this temperature range, and proceeds to 30 % reaction.

40|$|A {{multiplexed}} {{method for}} performing MS/MS on multiple ions simultaneously in a miniature rectilinear ion trap (RIT) mass spectrometer has been developed. This method uses an ion encoding procedure {{that relies on}} the mass bias that exists when ions are externally injected into an RIT operated with only a single phase RF applied to one pair of electrodes. The ion injection profile under such conditions ions is Gaussian-like {{over a wide range}} of RF amplitudes, or low mass cutoff (LMCO) values, during ion accumulation. We show that this distribution is related to ion m/z and is likely caused by ions having an optimal range of pseudo-potential well depths for efficient trapping. Based on this observation, precursor ion intensity changes between two different injection LMCO values can be predicted, and these ion intensity changes are found to be carried through to their corresponding product ions, enabling multiplexed MS/MS spectra to be deconvoluted. The gas-phase reactions of a series of coordinatively unsaturated [Ni(L) n]y+ complexes, where L is a nitrogen-containing ligand, with chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants in a miniature rectilinear ion trap mass spectrometer were investigated as part of a new approach to detect CWA.

The [Ni(L) n] 2 + complexes are found to be particularly reactive with the simulants of mustard gas and tabun, allowing their detection at low parts-per-billion (ppb) levels. These detection limits are well below the median lethal doses for these CWAs, which indicates the applicability of this new approach, and are about two orders of magnitude lower than electron ionization detection limits on the same mass spectrometer. The use of coordinatively unsaturated metal complexes as reagent ions offers the possibility of further tuning the ion-molecule chemistry so that desired compounds can be detected selectively or at even lower concentrations. Mass spectrometry has become a tool for studying noncovalently bound complexes. Specifically, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has found increasing use for the determination of affinity (Ka) or dissociation (Kd) constants. Direct measurement of the equilibrium components by ESI-MS is the most straightforward approach for determining binding equilibrium constants, but this approach is prone to error and has some inherent limitations. Transferring complexes from solution to the gas phase may perturb the equilibrium concentrations and/or different ionization efficiencies may cause the resulting ion signals not to reflect actual solution concentrations. Furthermore, ESI only works under a limited range of solvent conditions (i. e. low ionic strengths), which limits the broad applicability of this approach. We propose an approach based on covalent labeling in the context of metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) reactions that, when combined with MS, overcomes such limitations when determining metal-ligand binding constants. The MCO-MS approach will provide concurrent information regarding metal binding site and metal-protein binding affinity. Optimization of the MCO reaction through isotopic mass tags will permit enhanced identification of modified residues. Application of this method to study the affinity and binding interactions of other divalent metals with β 2 m are likely to provide insight into the specificity of copper for causing β 2 m amyloid formation...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} cyclometalated gold(III) {{complexes}} with N-heterocyclic carbine (NHC) or alkynyl as auxiliary ligand were synthesized and characterized. Complexes [AuIII(R 1 –C^N^C) (NHC) ](OTf) and [AuIII(C^N^C) (C≡CR 2) ] (HC^N^CH = 2, 6 -di(naphthalene- 2 -yl) pyridine; R 1 = H or 4 -methoxyphenyl; R 2 =aryl) are emissive in solution {{at room temperature}} with quantum yields {{in the range of}} 0. 65 – 11. 4 % and lifetimes ranging from 98 to 506 s. [AuIII(4 -(4 -OMePh) –C^N^C) (NHC) ](OTf) showed prominent photochemical properties. This complex effectively catalyses photo-induced oxidation of secondary amines (to the corresponding imines) and -functionalization of tertiary amines in good to excellent yields; it also acts as a photosensitizer for hydrogen generation in a water/acetonitrile mixture, producing more than 350 turnovers of hydrogen after 4 hours of irradiation. Palladium(II) meso-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin was found to be an efficient and robust catalyst for the photo-induced oxidative C–H bond functionalization reactions. Several kinds of -functionalized tertiary amines were obtained in good to excellent yields by irradiating a mixture of palladium(II) catalyst, corresponding tertiary amine and nucleophile under aerobic conditions. The nucleophiles for these reactions include cyanide, nitromethane, dimethyl malonate, <b>diethyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> and acetone. Two examples of novel intramolecularly cyclized amines were also described. Comparison of the UV-vis absorption spectra before and after reaction indicated that the palladium catalyst was highly robust. The practical potential of this catalyst was shown by the success in reactions at a low catalyst loading and on a large scale. The palladium(II) catalyst could also sensitize photo-induced oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide and photo-induced hydrogen production in a water/acetonitrile mixture with up to 240 turnovers. [FeIII(L-N 4 Me 2) Cl 2][FeCl 4] (L-N 4 Me 2 = N,N’-dimethyl- 2, 11 -diaza[3, 3] (2, 6) pyridinophane) was demonstrated to be an active catalyst for water oxidation. When cerium ammonium nitrate (CAN) was used as the oxidant, the iron(III) catalyst oxidized water to oxygen with up to 93 turnovers after 30 minutes in 0. 1 M nitric acid, whereas changing the oxidant to sodium periodate (NaIO 4) resulted in only 44 turnovers of oxygen after 30 minutes. The mechanism of the reaction was explored by high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), 18 O labeling, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, kinetic plots and DFT calculations. In the case of using CAN, an FeIV-oxo species was detected by ESI-MS and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The rate of oxygen evolution was found to be linearly dependent on both concentrations of catalyst and oxidant. 18 O labeling studies confirmed that the origin of oxo ligands was from water and was irrespective of the choice of oxidant. This reaction was proposed to involve a coupling between an FeIV-oxo species and a hydroxocerium(IV) radical. In the case of using NaIO 4, an FeV-dioxo species was detected by ESI-MS as a major species, and a small amount of FeIV-oxo species was detected by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As the rate of oxygen evolution was found to be linearly dependent on the concentration of catalyst only, the reaction was proposed to involve a cis-FeV-dioxo species. DFT calculations showed that the cis-FeV-dioxo species was capable of oxidizing water to oxygen through the formation of an [FeIII(L-N 4 Me 2) (OO?) (OH) ]+ intermediate. published_or_final_versionChemistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
