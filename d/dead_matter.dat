5|$|Typhula quisquiliaris fruit {{bodies are}} {{typically}} found in rows, growing from plant detritus. The species favours bracken, especially Pteridium aquilinum, but the colonisation of <b>dead</b> <b>matter</b> from other plants is not unknown. Upon these substrates, it feeds as a saprotroph, {{breaking down the}} dead organic matter in order to sustain itself. The species has been recorded in Europe and northern Africa. In Europe, the fruit bodies can be encountered from April to December.|$|E
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on <b>dead</b> <b>matter.</b> Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E

It is shown that the time independence of the contributions portrays another system by itself and constitutes the equilibrium solution of the original time independent system. A system of <b>dead</b> organic <b>matter</b> that reduces the dissipation coefficient of the decomposer organism is annexed to the oxygen consumption-terrestrial organism system towards the end of consummation of the system. With the methodology reinforced with the explanations, we write the governing equations with the nomenclature for the systems of plants-nutrients.

60|$|The Unknown.--I shall gladly state what I know, {{which is}} very little. In physics and in chemistry, the science of <b>dead</b> <b>matter,</b> we possess many facts and a few {{principles}} or laws; but whenever the functions of life are considered, though the facts are numerous, yet there is, as yet, scarcely any approach to general laws, and we must usually end where we begin by confessing our entire ignorance.|$|E

60|$|These {{experiments}} {{seem almost}} childishly simple, and one wonders {{how it was}} {{that no one ever}} thought of them before. Simple as they are, however, they are worthy of the most careful study, for every piece of experimental work since done, in regard to this subject, has been shaped upon the model furnished by the Italian philosopher. As the results of his experiments were the same, however varied the nature of the materials he used, it is not wonderful that there arose in Redi's mind a presumption that, in all such cases of the seeming production of life from <b>dead</b> <b>matter,</b> the real explanation was the introduction of living germs from without into that <b>dead</b> <b>matter.</b> And thus the hypothesis that living matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter, took definite shape; and had, henceforward, a right to be considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of Biogenesis; and I shall term the contrary doctrine--that living matter may be produced by not living matter--the hypothesis of Abiogenesis.|$|E

60|$|But after all, this seeming {{ignition}} {{of the sea}} can not be wholly {{produced by}} <b>dead</b> <b>matter</b> therein. There are many living fish, phosphorescent; and, under certain conditions, by a rapid throwing off of luminous particles must largely contribute to the result. Not to particularize this circumstance as true of divers species of sharks, cuttle-fish, and many others of the larger varieties of the finny tribes; the myriads of microscopic mollusca, well known to swarm off soundings, might alone be deemed almost sufficient to kindle {{a fire in the}} brine.|$|E
60|$|Amb.--We {{are very}} much obliged to you for your {{geological}} illustrations; but they remind me a little {{of some of the}} ideas of our friend Philalethes in his remarkable vision, and with which we may at some time amuse you in return for your geology should we be honoured with more of your company. You are obliged to have recourse to creations for all the living beings in your philosophical romance. I do not see why you should not suppose creations or arrangements of <b>dead</b> <b>matter</b> by the same laws of infinite wisdom, and why our globe should not rise at once a divine work fitted for all the objects of living and intelligent natures.|$|E
60|$|Life {{consists}} of individuals. These individuals are definite things, {{they are not}} like the lumps and masses, nor even the limitless and motionless crystals, of non-living matter, and they have two characteristics no <b>dead</b> <b>matter</b> possesses. They can assimilate other matter into themselves and make it part of themselves, and {17} they can reproduce themselves. They eat and they breed. They can give rise to other individuals, {{for the most part}} like themselves, but always also a little different from themselves. There is a specific and family resemblance between an individual and its offspring, and there is an individual difference between every parent and every offspring it produces, and this is true in every species and at every stage of life.|$|E

30|$|Carbon {{balances}} {{of living}} biomass, <b>dead</b> organic <b>matter</b> and wood-based products were calculated {{as described in}} Pukkala (2014). Decomposition of <b>dead</b> organic <b>matter</b> was simulated using the Yasso 07 decomposition model (Liski et al. 2009; Tuomi et al. 2011). The yields of cowberries and bilberries {{were obtained from the}} models of Turtiainen et al. (2013) and Miina et al. (2009). The total berry yield (bilberry[*]+[*]cowberry) was used in DEA. The scenic beauty index was calculated with the model of Silvennoinen et al. (2001).|$|R
50|$|The {{carbon and}} {{nutrients}} in <b>dead</b> organic <b>matter</b> are {{broken down by}} a group of processes known as decomposition. This releases nutrients that can then be re-used for plant and microbial production, and returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere (or water) where it can be used for photosynthesis. In the absence of decomposition, <b>dead</b> organic <b>matter</b> would accumulate in an ecosystem and nutrients and atmospheric carbon dioxide would be depleted. Approximately 90% of terrestrial NPP goes directly from plant to decomposer.|$|R
60|$|Her soul too {{was carried}} {{forward to the}} altar, to the {{threshold}} of Eternity, in reverence and fear and joy. But ever she hung back in the transit, mistrusting {{the culmination of the}} altar. She was not to be flung forward on the lift and lift of passionate flights, to be cast at last upon the altar steps as upon the shore of the unknown. There was a great joy and a verity in it. But even in the dazed swoon of the cathedral, she claimed another right. The altar was barren, its lights gone out. God burned no more in that bush. It was <b>dead</b> <b>matter</b> lying there. She claimed the right to freedom above her, higher than the roof. She had always a sense of being roofed in.|$|E
60|$|The {{characteristic}} is {{not wholly}} confined to living organisms. For example, magnetized steel {{looks just like}} steel {{which has not been}} magnetized, but its behaviour is in some ways different. In the case of <b>dead</b> <b>matter,</b> however, such phenomena are less frequent and important than in the case of living organisms, and it is far less difficult to invent satisfactory hypotheses as to the microscopic changes of structure which mediate between the past occurrence and the present changed response. In the case of living organisms, practically everything that is distinctive both of their physical and of their mental behaviour is bound up with this persistent influence of the past. Further, speaking broadly, the change in response is usually of a kind that is biologically advantageous to the organism.|$|E
60|$|And in {{the next}} place, if {{the results of the}} {{experiments}} I refer to are really trustworthy, it by no means follows that Abiogenesis has taken place. The resistance of living matter to heat is known to vary within considerable limits, and to depend, to some extent, upon the chemical and physical qualities of the surrounding medium. But if, in the present state of science, the alternative is offered us,--either germs can stand a greater heat than has been supposed, or the molecules of <b>dead</b> <b>matter,</b> for no valid or intelligible reason that is assigned, are able to re- arrange themselves into living bodies, exactly such as can be demonstrated to be frequently produced in another way,--I cannot understand how choice can be, even for a moment, doubtful.|$|E

5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of <b>dead</b> organic <b>matter,</b> which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated <b>dead</b> organic <b>matter.</b>|$|R
