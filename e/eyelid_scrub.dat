None of them yielded positive cultures for virulent bacteria from the eyelids and conjunctiva. Most of the patients reported significant reduction in the subjective symptoms and in {{the severity of the}} clinical signs as well. No adverse effects were observed. The results of our study suggest that this product is of value as a detergent <b>eyelid</b> <b>scrub</b> in the treatment of chronic blepharitis. D 1 ep Ann Pharmacother 1991; 25 : 359 - 60. BLEPHARITIS, an inflammation of the eyelidmargins, is an extremely commondisease. ' It is present in almost 20 per-centof the general population. Types include simplesqua-mous blepharitis, a superficial nondestructive dermatitis, and follicular (purulent) blepharitis, wherein the follicle...|$|E

Posterior blepharitis affects the posterior lamella of the eyelid and involves inflammation of the meibomian glands, whereas anterior blepharitis affects the anterior lamella of the eyelid and the eyelashes; either version can be inflammatory or infectious in nature. Each of these conditions can incite or propagate the other; anterior blepharitis, if not treated, can lead to meibomian gland disease, and vice versa. Blepharitis is typically chronic, and {{can be associated with}} a variety of systemic diseases such as dermatitis, as well as ocular diseases such as dry eye, conjunctivitis, or keratitis. The standard treatment regimen historically consists of lid hygiene with warm compresses and <b>eyelid</b> <b>scrubs,</b> although these treatment modalities may have limited efficacy for many patients, especially those with more severe disease. Adjunctive treatment includes systemic and topical antibiotics, topical corticosteroids, and tear replacement therapy. Topical antibiotics are recommended to decrease the bacterial load, and topical corticosteroids may help in cases of severe inflammation. Azithromycin ophthalmic solution 1 % in DuraSite® (AzaSite®; Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Durham, North Carolina, USA) has been proposed as a novel treatment for posterior blepharitis, based on its well-known anti-infective profile, its anti-inflammatory properties, its excellent tissue penetration, and its regulatory approval for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.
