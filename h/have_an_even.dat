The resulting shape consists of circular arcs (at most as many as sides of the polygon), can be constructed algorithmically in linear time, and can be drawn with compass and straightedge.

5|$|All {{meitnerium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known meitnerium isotope, 278Mt, is also the heaviest known; it has a half-life of 7.6seconds. (The unconfirmed 282Mt is yet heavier and appears to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> longer half-life of 67seconds.) A metastable nuclear isomer, 270mMt, {{has been reported to}} also have a half-life of over a second. The isotopes 276Mt and 274Mt have half-lives of 0.72 and 0.44seconds respectively. The remaining four isotopes have half-lives between 1 and 20milliseconds. The undiscovered isotope 281Mt has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay; no known meitnerium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. Some unknown isotopes, such as 265Mt, 272Mt, 273Mt, and 279Mt, are predicted to have half-lives longer than the known isotopes. Before its discovery, 274Mt and 277Mt were predicted to have half-lives of 20seconds and 1minute respectively, but they were later found to have half-lives of only 0.44seconds and 5milliseconds respectively.|$|E

The most stable known roentgenium isotope, 282Rg, is also the heaviest known roentgenium isotope; it has a half-life of 2.1minutes. (The unconfirmed 286Rg is even heavier and appears to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> longer half-life of about 11minutes, {{which would make it}} one of the longest-lived superheavy nuclides known.) The isotopes 280Rg and 281Rg have also been reported to have half-lives over a second. The remaining isotopes have half-lives in the millisecond range. The undiscovered isotope 287Rg has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay; however, no known roentgenium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. The unknown isotopes 277Rg and 283Rg are also expected to have long half-lives of 1second and 10minutes respectively. Before their discovery, the isotopes 278Rg, 281Rg, and 282Rg were predicted to have long half-lives of 1second, 1minute, and 4minutes respectively; however, they were discovered to have shorter half-lives of 4.2milliseconds, 17seconds, and 2.1minutes respectively.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the great}} rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the {{primordial}} isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single beta-stable nuclide, since {{there is not a}} difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (isobars) free to beta decay toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number of neutrons. Beryllium is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris {{is greatly}} {{threatened}} by the pet trade, and is sold as an exotic pet throughout southeast Asia. The slow lorises are the most commonly traded protected primates in southeast Asia. When sold as a pet it often will have its teeth pulled out to prevent injury to the owner. This may cause dental infections which have up to a 90% death rate. Once it has lost its teeth, reintroduction to the wild is impossible. Due to a very high mortality rate in captivity due to stress, improper nutrition and infection, the pet trade is inflated by replacements.

5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (<b>having</b> <b>an</b> odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree.

In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph <b>has</b> <b>an</b> odd number of even degree vertices.

If we have 2 nodes {{with an odd}} number of edges, the walk must begin at one such node and end at the other. Since there are only 4 nodes in the puzzle, the solution is simple.

25|$|Because it is a {{bipartite graph}} {{that has an}} odd number of vertices, the Herschel graph does not contain a Hamiltonian cycle (a cycle of edges that passes through each vertex exactly once).

Thus, a cycle passing once through each of the eleven vertices cannot exist in the Herschel graph. It is the smallest non-Hamiltonian polyhedral graph, whether the size of the graph is measured in terms of its number of vertices, edges, or faces; there exist other polyhedral graphs with 11 vertices and no Hamiltonian cycles (notably the Goldner–Harary graph) but none with fewer edges.|$|E
25|$|Four-stroke radials have an {{odd number}} of {{cylinders}} per row, so that a consistent every-other-piston firing order can be maintained, providing smooth operation.

Moreover, this always leaves a one-piston gap between the piston on its combustion stroke and the piston on compression.
