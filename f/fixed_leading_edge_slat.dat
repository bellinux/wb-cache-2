50|$|On 15 January 1943, the {{prototype}} CA-4, A23-1001, crashed {{on a test}} flight to assess powerplant performance and evaluate aerodynamic effects of a new <b>fixed</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat.</b> During the return to the CAC airfield at Fisherman's Bend, the pilot, Squadron Leader Jim Harper, had detected a fuel leak in the port Pratt & Whitney R-1830 engine. As the problem worsened he attempted {{to shut down the}} engine, feathering the propeller; however, the actuation of the feathering switch caused an explosion and uncontrollable fire. The three man crew subsequently attempted evacuation at 1000 ft, yet only Harper succeeded in parachuting free, while the CAC test pilot Jim Carter and power plant group engineer Lionel Dudgeon were both killed. The airframe subsequently impacted 3 mi south-west of Kilmore, Victoria. The wreckage was recovered and used for components.|$|E

Fuel {{is stored in}} the wet wings. The aircraft is built from aluminum-lithium alloy with titanium used in high-stress areas. A 30-parameter, five-hour flight data recorder, engine fire-detection systems and an ice detector are also standard, as are hydraulic brakes. However, unlike most modern aircraft, the Be-103 is not equipped with wing flaps.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design that}} emerged, while superficially {{similar to the}} Wirraway, was really a new type that used some Wirraway {{components}} rather than a conversion. The only major components used in both types without alteration were the tail group and the landing gear. The fuselage was completely new, with a [...] hopper installed between the engine and the high-mounted single-seat cockpit. The Wirraway wing was substantially altered {{for use in the}} Ceres. The outer wing panels had slotted trailing-edge flaps and <b>fixed</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats,</b> while the centre-section was substantially altered to accommodate the hopper, the higher weights of the Ceres, the different flaps (the Wirraway had split flaps) and the new type's fixed landing gear with CAC Mustang main wheels as opposed to the Wirraway's retractable gear (the same landing gear legs were used however). The increase in wingspan and wing area of the Ceres compared to the Wirraway was also incorporated in the centre-section, and the end result was an aircraft with much more docile stalling characteristics than those of the Wirraway. The engine was the same type, a Pratt & Whitney R-1340, but altered so that it was direct-drive instead of geared as on the Wirraway. The three-bladed variable-pitch propeller was also different, being of wider chord and smaller diameter compared to the Wirraway's to suit the Ceres' different operating regime and the direct-drive engine.|$|R
2500|$|Development of the Pegazair {{started in}} 1985 by Serg Dufour of Mont-Saint-Michel, Quebec. Originally it {{consisted}} of {{a new set of}} Pega-STOL wings with retractable <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> to be installed on Zenair CH 701 STOLs to replace their wings which have <b>fixed</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> slots. Dufour went on to develop a new fuselage and tail to match the wings. The Pegazair is a two seats in side-by-side configuration, strut-braced, high-wing monoplane with conventional landing gear. Fuselage construction is welded steel tubing with aluminum skin. The wings employ full length flaperons and <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> that deploy automatically. The tailplane is slotted for slow speed authority. The prototype was outfitted with a [...] Continental A-65 engine.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{purpose of}} this thesis is to design and analyze the new {{generation}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> of a commercial jet to reduce the structural noise with the application of new conceptual design approaches. Recent scientific research show that the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> account for the structural noise during the flight operation therefore, when the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> is deployed under different flight conditions, an open gap/slot is formed between the high lift device and the wing box. However, since the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> includes flexible sections, {{it is assumed that}} defining an adaptive system inside the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> may reduce the structural noise by utilizing bending properties of these flexible sections. Hence, electromechanical actuator designing gains also great importance in the whole process. In this study, we have used, finite element modelling of the slat structure to examine the required structural deformations and strengths; our work is based on the software ANSYS/Workbench. To be realistic in deciding the right geometry in the follow up steps, we have first studied a generic geometry having no aerodynamics or actuator forces application. The whole simulation was performed by defining dummy forces and dummy material properties. The simulation lead to having a global overview of the mechanical behaviour of the structure; further, once the influent parameters were tested, realistic aerodynamic forces and material properties were defined, {{and as a result of}} bending of the flexible sections the required gap closure was formed between the trailing <b>edge</b> of the <b>slat</b> and the wing box. Subsequently, the suitable actuator design and required strength analysis are also performed on the last section. This study has also proved that the use of adaptive systems on the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> improves flight comfort by reducing the structural noise and provides less fuel consumption; this is significant for the long run considerations of aeroplane manufacturers. es Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.

50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash was {{determined}} to be a stall caused by the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> (strictly speaking, Krueger flaps) having been left in the retracted position. Even though the trailing edge flaps were deployed, without the slats being extended the aircraft's stall speed was higher and the maximum angle of attack was lower. As a result, the aircraft was unable to climb out of ground effect. The flight engineer was found to have failed to open the slat system bleed air valves as required on the pre-flight checklist. This prevented bleed air from flowing to the 747's pneumatic slat system and, since the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> on the 747 are pneumatically driven, kept it from deploying the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> for takeoff. The take-off warning system that would have sounded an alarm due to the flaps not being lowered did not have a separate warning that the slats' pneumatic valve had not been opened by the flight engineer.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} in the Langley Low Turbulence Pressure Tunnel {{to determine the effects of}} Reynolds number and Mach number on the two-dimensional aerodynamic performance of two supercritical type airfoils, one equipped with a conventional flap system and the other with an advanced high lift flap system. The conventional flap system consisted of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> and a double slotted, trailing edge flap with a small chord vane and a large chord aft flap. The advanced flap system consisted of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> and a double slotted, trailing edge flap with a large chord vane and a small chord aft flap. Both models were tested with all elements nested to form the cruise airfoil and with the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> and with a single or double slotted, trailing edge flap deflected to form the high lift airfoils. The experimental tests were conducted through a Reynolds number range from 2. 8 to 20. 9 x 1, 000, 000 and a Mach number range from 0. 10 to 0. 35. Lift and pitching moment data were obtained.

5000|$|The {{flight crew}} testified {{that they had}} not engaged the flaps, and the NTSB {{concluded}} that [...] "if the flightcrew's recollections are accurate," [...] the slat extension must have been caused by a mechanical failure or defect. However, the NTSB ultimately concluded that the flight crew was probably attempting to use 2º of flaps at cruising speed: While cruising at Mach 0.816 and 39,000 feet pressure altitude and with the autopilot controlling the aircraft, an attempt was made to extend 2º of trailing edge flaps independently of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats,</b> probably in an effort to improve aircraft performance When retraction of the flaps was ordered, the Number 7 <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> failed to retract, causing the uncommanded roll to the right. The Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the isolation of the No. 7 <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> in the fully or partially extended position after an extension of the Nos. 2, 3, 6, and 7 <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> and the subsequent retraction of the Nos. 2, 3, and 6 slats, and the captain's untimely flight control inputs to counter the roll resulting from the slat asymmetry. Contributing to the cause was a preexisting misalignment of the No. 7 slat which, when combined with the cruise condition airloads, precluded retraction of that slat. After eliminating all probable individual or combined mechanical failures, or malfunctions which could lead to slat extension, the Safety Board determined that the extension of the slats {{was the result of the}} flightcrew's manipulation of the flap/slat controls. Contributing to the captain's untimely use of the flight controls was distraction due probably to his efforts to rectify the source of the control problem. [...] Captain Gibson appealed the NTSB's findings, first to the NTSB itself, and then to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Both petitions were rejected: the former for lack of new evidence, and the latter for lack of jurisdiction due to the NTSB's [...] "unreviewable discretion".|$|R
