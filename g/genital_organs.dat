5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments and contains the gut and <b>genital</b> <b>organs.</b> The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has {{a pair of}} clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm {{make their way to}} a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether {{the central nervous system}} is involved in the effect of Chinese herbal medicine on sexual function recovery in orchidectomized rats. MethodsOrchidectomized rats were administered intragastrically with a decoction of “kidney-nourishing” Chinese herbal medicine once per day for 28 days. Accessory <b>genital</b> <b>organ</b> weight, plasma testosterone, and mating behavior were investigated. The expression of c-Fos and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in neuronal cells in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. ResultsThere was a decrease in accessory <b>genital</b> <b>organ</b> weight, plasma testosterone, and sexual behavior, as well as a low number of c-Fos-positive cells and a large nNOS-positive cell area in orchidectomized rats. Administration of the herbal medicine increased accessory <b>genital</b> <b>organ</b> weight, testosterone level, mating behavior, and c-Fos-positive cell number, while it decreased the nNOS-positive cell area in orchidectomized rats. ConclusionAn increase of plasma testosterone after administration of “kidney-nourishing” herbal medicine might contribute to the elevated sexual function and activity in orchidectomized rats. In addition, a central nervous system mechanism, such as the functional alteration of NAc, might be involved...|$|R
25|$|One common {{cultural}} practice, {{irrespective of}} religion or economic status, is female genital mutilation (FGM), {{also known as}} female genital cutting (FGC), a procedure that involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female <b>genital</b> <b>organs</b> for non-medical reasons. The practice has been made illegal in Ethiopia in 2004. FGM is a pre-marital custom mainly endemic to Northeast Africa {{and parts of the}} Near East that has its ultimate origins in Ancient Egypt. Encouraged by women in the community, it is primarily intended to deter promiscuity and to offer protection from assault.|$|E
25|$|To Freud {{sexuality}} {{is composed of}} partial drives (i.e. the oral or the anal drives) each specified by a different erotogenic zone. At first these partial drives function independently (i.e. the polymorphous perversity of children), {{it is only in}} puberty that they become organized {{under the aegis of the}} <b>genital</b> <b>organs.</b> Lacan accepts the partial nature of drives, but 1) rejects the notion that partial drives can ever attain any complete organization: the primacy of the genital zone, if achieved, is always precarious; and 2) he argues that drives are partial in that they only represent sexuality partially not in the sense that they are a part of the whole. Drives do not represent the reproductive function of sexuality but only the dimension of jouissance.|$|E

Many of the bodies were horribly mutilated, ears and noses cut off and <b>genital</b> <b>organs</b> amputated and stuffed into their mouths. Breasts of some of the nurses were cut off, the women being brutally raped. A German military judge who was at the scene stated in an interview during the 1970s that he saw a female body with her legs spread-eagled and a broomstick rammed into her genitals. In the cellar of the main train station around 120 Germans were herded into a large storage room and then mowed down with machine guns.|$|E

It has sometimes been referred to as female circumcision, although this term is misleading because it implies it is analogous to the circumcision of the foreskin from the male penis. Consequently, the term mutilation was adopted to emphasise the gravity of the act and its place as a violation of human rights. Subsequently, the term cutting was advanced to avoid offending cultural sensibility that would interfere with dialogue for change. To recognise these points of view some agencies use the composite female {{genital mutilation}}/cutting (FMG/C).|$|E
500|$|The {{vestibular}} bulbs {{are more}} closely related to the clitoris than the vestibule because of the similarity of the trabecular and erectile tissue within the clitoris and bulbs, and the absence of trabecular tissue in other <b>genital</b> <b>organs,</b> with the erectile tissue's trabecular nature allowing engorgement and expansion during sexual arousal. The vestibular bulbs lie close to the crura {{on either side of the}} vaginal opening; internally, they are beneath the labia majora. When engorged with blood, they cuff the vaginal opening and cause the vulva to expand outward. Though some texts state that they surround the vaginal opening, this does not appear to be the case and tunica albuginea does not envelop the erectile tissue of the bulbs. In Yang et al.'s assessment of the bulbs' anatomy, they conclude that the bulbs [...] "arch over the distal urethra, outlining what might be appropriately called the 'bulbar urethra' in women." ...|$|E
