This was partially ensured in December, when a political agreement was reached for Oslo Package 2, a <b>financing</b> <b>plan</b> for investments in public transport in Oslo and Akershus between 2002 and 2011.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} <b>financing</b> <b>plan</b> {{called for a}} 50-cent toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road to finance the Silver Line (25 cents at the main plaza and 25 cents at the ramp plazas), the increase in projected costs resulted in the MWAA Board approving {{an increase in the}} surcharges. Effective January 1, 2010, the fare surcharge was increased to 50 cents at both the main plaza and ramp plazas, with additional 25-cent increases in main-plaza tolls set for 2011 and 2012. These toll surcharges are designed to support MWAA's 52.6% share of the projected $5.25 billion combined cost of Phase I and Phase II. MWAA has justified these toll increases as necessary to meet an estimated $220 million in annual debt-service costs projected by 2020. These toll revenue requirements were {{based on the assumption that}} the federal government, although it contributed $900 million to Phase I, would not contribute funds for Phase II.|$|E
5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also going to be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the <b>financing</b> <b>plan</b> was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1994, the National Basketball Association's {{franchise}} relocation committee {{voted unanimously}} to block {{the sale of the}} franchise to Top Rank resulting in the Timberwolves remaining in Minneapolis through at least the 1994–95 season. Top Rank's offer was rejected by the league due to questions surrounding their <b>financing</b> <b>plan.</b> The $152 million purchase price would have been paid for through $40 million from unknown investors; up to $76.25 million in loans from banks that had yet to make commitments; and $50 million or more from undisclosed sources based on projected revenues from the un-built arena in New Orleans. Also, the league filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis seeking an injunction against any transfer of the team from Minnesota. On June 21, 1994, the league officially denied sale of the franchise to Top Rank resulting in the Timberwolves remaining in Minneapolis. On June 28, 1994, Top Rank would file a counter-suit in Louisiana Civil District Court. The suit sought to have ownership fulfill their contractual obligation to sell the team to Top Rank. The following day, federal district court ruled that the franchise was to remain in Minneapolis through June 15, 1995.|$|E

5|$|The <b>financing</b> <b>plan</b> {{involved}} {{public and}} private funding. At the time, the city planned to pay $75million for the acquisition {{of the land and}} construction of the stadium project. However, a 2017 audit revealed that it had actually paid $91million after accounting for additional costs associated with the expedited schedule and infrastructure work around the project site. The stadium is owned by the city and is leased to the team for 30years, until 2045. The Sounds ownership group spent $50million on a new, mixed-use and retail development next to the facility. The construction of two apartment buildings with retail space beyond the left field wall is scheduled to be completed in early 2018. North of the site, Embrey Development Corp. built a privately funded apartment complex called The Carillon. The city's original $75million planned expenditure resulted in taking on $4.3million in annual debt, paid for by five city revenue streams: an annual $700,000 Sounds' lease payment, $650,000 in stadium-generated sales tax revenue, $750,000 in property taxes from the Sounds development, $675,000 in property taxes from the Embrey development, and $520,000 in tax increment financing. The additional overage was paid with existing Metro capital funds. The city pays $345,000 for annual maintenance of the stadium.|$|E

Due to this, Bernier proposed the establishment of a <b>financing</b> <b>plan,</b> which would have an immediate effect but would be paid in a prolonged manner. Five days later, Bernier announced changes in the executive positions within the project, not discarding his own exclusion due to his new office in the COPUR.|$|E
25|$|During the , the Twins {{pushed for}} a new <b>financing</b> <b>plan</b> based on ideas gleaned from their {{advisory}} committee. The $300 million site-neutral plan would have featured a $150 million contribution from the Pohlads, $50 million from private enterprises, and the remaining $100 million {{in the form of}} an interest-free loan from the state of Minnesota. Many viewed the deal as significantly better for taxpayers than the 1997 plan. But the details of the financial arrangements once again were very complicated. Ultimately, the proposal fell victim to a political climate filled with distaste for the economics of baseball, general anti-stadium sentiments, and an unrelated budget standoff which nearly shut down the Minnesota government.|$|E

Specifically, the university issued $85 million in bonds, and borrowed the remaining $17 million by way of low-interest commercial paper. In addition, a few aspects of the stadium expansion project were scaled back, including {{a reduction in the}} number of new seats (the original plan called for 14,000 seats, but only 11,500 were actually added). Also included in the original expansion plan was the construction of new locker rooms in the South end zone. The construction of these locker rooms was deferred to a later date.|$|E
25|$|As Santee's {{dramatic}} drawing {{became more}} widely published, and Lambrecht and Pogin ramped up their lobbying efforts, others {{began to realize}} {{the advantages of the}} site. This included Mark Oyaas, founder of New Ballpark, Inc., a separate group of downtown Minneapolis business leaders, who sought to create a private <b>financing</b> <b>plan</b> for a stadium. They quickly settled on Rapid Park as their preferred ballpark site, which enhanced its visibility significantly. The Twins, however, completely ignored Rapid Park, and kept their distance from all of the ad hoc working groups. They would eventually go on record as believing that the Rapid Park site was too small and constrained to house the type of facility they sought to build.|$|E
25|$|On June 17, 2009, {{the city}} council and WCSA came to an {{agreement}} on a new <b>financing</b> <b>plan</b> crafted by city CFO Natwar Gandhi.

To obtain the additional equity money, ING Clarion Real Estate Investment was added as a new partner in the project. The higher equity participation meant that Marriott would {{no longer need to}} seek private lending as part of the agreement—which meant construction could go forward without the long delay that would occur while seeking bank loans. The city's total contribution would be $267 million ($135 million in equity financing, $80 million in loans, and $52 million in WCSA bond refinancing), all to be raised by a joint city-WCSA bond issue.|$|E

25|$|The {{plans were}} {{approved}} by the Metro (regional government) council in July 2006 and by the Portland city council in September 2007, the council committing to allocating $27 million of city funds. The estimated {{total cost of the}} project is $147 million, just over half of which is to be paid for with federal funds. On April 30, 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced the approval of $75 million in federal funding for the Eastside streetcar project, the full amount that had been requested by Portland. This allocation, secured in large part through the efforts of Oregon Representatives Earl Blumenauer and Peter DeFazio, was both the largest and the final component of the <b>financing</b> <b>plan,</b> and consequently the announcement meant the project could proceed to construction as soon as the city council had approved construction contracts. Twenty million dollars in state funds, $15.5 million from a Local Improvement District and a combination of various other local or regional sources complete the funding plan. Construction began in August 2009.|$|E
25|$|Although a {{strengthened}} public-health {{system has}} accelerated the national tuberculosis control effort, progress in tuberculosis control has also strengthened the public-health system. In terms of policy, the national tuberculosis control program has clear targets and well-defined technical policies {{based on the}} DOTS strategy. National and international partners work in a cohesive manner toward the same targets, with the same implementation framework. Other public-health programs are learning from this successful model. In financial terms, funding from different partners is harmonized under one <b>financing</b> <b>plan</b> with clear funding needs and gaps—another model for other programs. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the past—when tuberculosis services were not free—and the success in tuberculosis control {{over the past few}} years—when tuberculosis services have been free—have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS—e.g., directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs—are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programs. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them. In terms of information systems, the tuberculosis program's quarterly recording and reporting system has long been a model for other disease control programs. With the new internet-based reporting system for communicable diseases, the tuberculosis program leads the way in the use of information to improve public-health outcomes. Finally, the model of collaboration between hospitals and CDC facilities provided by the tuberculosis control program {{is one of the best}} examples to date of how hospitals should be involved in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and has influenced the development of new policies that involve hospitals in the work of public health.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, {{before he}} {{became a member of the}} city council, Schiff co-authored an {{amendment}} to the City of Minneapolis Charter that mandated a voter referendum on city stadium subsidies that cost taxpayers over $10 million. As of 2009, the Minnesota Vikings were moving forward on a $870 million plan to rebuild a downtown stadium on the site of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The team also considered building a new stadium in other cities, including Anoka, Minnesota and Los Angeles, California. Though supportive of the Vikings remaining in Minneapolis in 2012, Schiff became an outspoken critic of the <b>financing</b> <b>plan</b> for the stadium when it came to a vote before the Minneapolis City Council, in part because it bypassed the charter amendment. [...] Schiff also argued that the plan's estimated cost to Minneapolis taxpayers, cited at $150 million in construction costs, failed to account for interest, maintenance costs, and upgrades over the course of the stadium's expected 30-year lifespan. In a Star Tribune editorial, Schiff quoted figures presented by the city's chief financial officer, Kevin Carpenter, which estimated a cumulative, 30-year cost that could range from $675 million to $890 million. Despite Schiff's objections, the Minneapolis City Council approved the stadium financing 7-6. Subsequently, the football team moved forward with plans to demolish the Metrodome and rebuild a new stadium on the site, and Governor Mark Dayton signed a <b>financing</b> <b>plan</b> approved by the legislature.|$|E
