5|$|Despite {{receiving}} praise in pre-release showings, Sonic the Hedgehog {{was released}} to notably negative reception.

5|$|In May 1941, {{following}} {{the construction of}} the central north–south Stuart Highway, the federal government announced <b>its</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> build the east–west highway between Norseman and Port Augusta. A northerly route, close to the Trans-Australian Railway, had been considered, but extensive limestone outcrops made it impractical. Taking a route east from Norseman, with some detours around limestone ridges, would allow a road to be formed quickly and easily. With a war in the Pacific seemingly imminent, construction soon began, in July 1941. The Army was responsible for fuel, food, and communications, while the state government departments of Main Roads (Western Australia) and Highways (South Australia) managed the actual construction.|$|E
