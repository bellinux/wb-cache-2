500|$|Erie is {{situated}} in northwestern Pennsylvania at [...] (42.114507, -80.076213), on the southern shore of Lake Erie across from the Canadian province of Ontario. It is [...] northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, [...] southwest of Buffalo, New York, and [...] north of Pittsburgh. Erie's bedrock is Devonian shale and siltstone, overlain by <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> and stratified drift. Stream drainage in the city flows northward into Lake Erie, then through Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence River, {{and out to the}} Atlantic Ocean. South of Erie is a drainage divide, beyond which most of the streams in western Pennsylvania flow south into the Allegheny or Ohio rivers. [...] Lake Erie is about 571 feet above sea level, while the city of Erie is about 728 feet above sea level.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Glacial</b> <b>till</b> plains are a till plain landform in {{northern}} Ohio, {{located near the}} shore of Lake Erie and created by the retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation.

40|$|Although {{extensively}} used as {{core material}} in dams {{in many parts}} of the world, internal instability and suffusion potential of <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> is still a relatively unexplored field. Statistically, dams with cores of <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> have higher frequency of internal erosion incidents than dams with other types of core soils. Such potential overrepresentation may stem back to the erodibility of the <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> itself. One mechanism that may be influential is suffusion due to internal instability. The literature offers several methods to evaluate a soils vulnerability to this mechanism, however, in terms of <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> soils; the validity of assessment criteria is unclear. An offset in applicability may, at best, provide too conservative guidance, but at worst, it may be misleading, confusing or erroneous. Thus, the applicability of available state-of-the-art criteria for internal instability of <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> soils is investigated in this paper. Using gradations from: laboratory tests performed by the author at Luleå University of Technology; gradations from experimental suffusion tests in the literature; and gradations from existing dams, a total of 36 <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> gradations are evaluated. The study indicates that the approach by Kenney-Lau and its Li-Fannin adaptation provide predictions relatively more accurate in identifying <b>glacial</b> <b>till</b> gradations with unstable performance due to suffusion.

2500|$|The {{evolution}} of land plants {{at the onset}} of the Devonian period caused a long term increase in planetary oxygen levels and reduction of [...] levels, which resulted in the Karoo Ice Age. It is named after the <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> found in the Karoo region of South Africa, where evidence for this ice age was first clearly identified. There were extensive polar ice caps at intervals from 360 to 260 million years ago in South Africa during the Carboniferous and early Permian Periods.

50|$|As {{developed}} between 1894 and 1909, the Kansan Stage {{was based on}} a model that assumed that the Pleistocene deposits contained only two <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> and one volcanic ash bed within Nebraska and Kansas. Of these two proposed <b>glacial</b> <b>tills,</b> the Kansan till, which defined the Kansan Stage, was the upper of the two <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> and the Nebraskan till, which defined the Nebraskan Stage, was the lower of the two <b>glacial</b> <b>tills.</b> It was argued that a single paleosol developed in the Nebraskan till and interglacial deposits separated the Kansan and Nebraskan tills. The paleosol and deposits were used to define the Aftonian (interglacial) stage that separated the Kansan and Nebraskan stages.|$|E

5000|$|In time, the {{stratigraphy}} of Pleistocene deposits {{was found}} to be far more complex then the two <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> and one volcanic ash bed on which the Yarmouthian, Kansan, Nebraskan, and Aftonian glacial - interglacial nomenclature was originally based. Detailed research by Boellstorff demonstrated that the two <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> and one ash bed stratigraphic model, on which the Yarmouthian, Kansan, Nebraskan, and Aftonian glacial - interglacial nomenclature was based, was completely wrong. This research found that at the type locations for the Kansan and Nebraskan tills numerous <b>glacial</b> <b>tills,</b> which were separated by numerous paleosols, existed. In addition, fission track dating and geochemical analysis demonstrated what was thought to be one volcanic ash layer was actually three separate volcanic ash layers, i.e. the 602,000 year-old Lava Creek B volcanic ash; the 1,293,000 year-old Mesa Falls volcanic ash, and the 2,003,000 year-old Huckleberry volcanic ash. In addition, detailed studies of <b>glacial</b> <b>tills</b> in Kansas have found that at different outcrops, the same glacial till has been identified as being either a [...] "Kansan" [...] till or [...] "Nebraskan" [...] till. Also, {{it was found that the}} Afton Soil (paleosol), which was used define the Aftonian interglacial, is buried by a younger glacial till that was considered to be a [...] "type Nebraskan" [...] glacial till as well as having developed in an older glacial till that was considered to be a [...] "type Nebraskan" [...] glacial till. As a result, the basic assumptions on which the Yarmouthian (interglacial), Kansan (glacial), Aftonian (interglacial), and Nebraskan (glacial) nonmenclature was originally defined {{was found to}} be lacking any scientific basis. As a result, this nonmenclature was abandoned by Quaternary geologists in North America and merged into the Pre-Illinoian Stage.|$|E

5000|$|This climatic and chronological {{framework}} {{was composed}} of four glacial and interglacial stages. It was developed between 1894 and 1909 by geomorphologists and Quaternary geologists to subdivide glacial and nonglacial deposits within the United States of America. From youngest to oldest, they were the Wisconsin glaciation, Sangamonian (interglacial), Illinoian Stage (glacial), Yarmouthian, Kansan glaciation, Aftonian (interglacial), and Nebraskan stages. The Yarmouthian (Yarmouth) Interglacial was defined first {{on the basis of}} [...] "interglacial" [...] sediments encountered in wells dug in southeasterm Iowa.
