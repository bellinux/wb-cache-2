5|$|The {{congestion}} {{within the}} station <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> noted by Network Rail {{and it is}} keeping the situation under review. Transport for London (TfL) has recommended that specific improvement works (new entrance doors, removal of interior wall, wider stairs to platforms and second station entrance) be carried out between 2014 and 2019.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs on}} Abbey Road have been covered {{many times and}} the album <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> covered in its entirety. One month after Abbey Roads release, George Benson {{recorded}} a cover version of the album called The Other Side of Abbey Road. Later in 1969 Booker T. & the M.G.'s recorded McLemore Avenue (the location of Stax Records) which covered the Abbey Road songs and had a similar cover photo.|$|E

5|$|Blade Runner {{continues}} to reflect modern trends and concerns, {{and an increasing}} number of critics consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. It was voted the best science fiction film ever made in a 2004 poll of 60 eminent world scientists. Blade Runner is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell film series, which <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> highly influential to the future-noir genre. Blade Runner has been very influential to the cyberpunk movement. It also influenced the cyberpunk derivative biopunk, which revolves around biotechnology and genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|Despite Mega Man 4 {{receiving}} positive critical reviews {{during its}} early 1990s release, {{the game is}} widely regarded today to represent a downward shift from {{the quality of the}} first three games in the series. The Mega Buster <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> considered an overused mechanic by several sources. Mega Man 4 was re-released on the Japanese PlayStation, PlayStation Network, and mobile phones; the North American Mega Man Anniversary Collection; and worldwide on the Virtual Console for 3 Nintendo systems (Wii, Nintendo 3DS and Wii U).|$|E
5|$|Research, in 2008, by {{scientists}} from Pennsylvania State University found {{high levels of}} the pesticides fluvalinate and coumaphos in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides. These chemicals {{have been used to}} try to eradicate varroa mites, a bee pest that <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> thought to be a cause of CCD. Researchers from Washington State University, under entomology professor Steve Sheppard in 2009, confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between it and significantly reduced bee longevity.|$|E

5|$|The present {{church was}} {{believed}} to have been built upon the insistence of the Proctor-General, William de Guineville, under the ownership of Bec Abbey, to serve the growing population. He used the priory at Manor Farm as his main residence The first recorded vicar was William de Berminton in 1327. The building <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> remodelled in parts over the centuries and was substantially restored by George Gilbert Scott in 1870. It received Grade B listed status as an Anglican church in 1950, corresponding as Grade II.|$|E
5|$|A bone {{unique to}} pterosaurs, {{known as the}} pteroid, {{connected}} to the wrist and helped to support a forward membrane (the propatagium) between the wrist and shoulder. Evidence of webbing between the three free fingers of the pterosaur forelimb suggests that this forward membrane {{may have been more}} extensive than the simple pteroid-to-shoulder connection traditionally depicted in life restorations. The position of the pteroid bone <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> controversial. Some scientists, notably Matthew Wilkinson, have argued that the pteroid pointed forward, extending the forward membrane. This view was contradicted in a 2007 paper by Chris Bennett, who showed that the pteroid did not articulate as previously thought and could not have pointed forward, but rather inward toward the body as traditionally thought. Peters (2009) proposed that the pteroid articulated with the ‘saddle' of the radiale (proximal syncarpal) and both the pteroid and preaxial carpal were migrated centralia. This view of the articulation of the pteroid has since been supported by specimens of Changchengopterus pani and Darwinopterus linglongtaensis, both of which show the pteroid in articulation with the proximal syncarpal.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} baseball event in Australia {{took place in}} Melbourne, Victoria in 1857, between teams from Collingwood and Richmond. Accounts vary as to the details, including {{whether it was a}} single game or a series of threegames, though details in common include a score of 350–230 in favour of Collingwood, and that the rules used were some form of hybrid between cricket and baseball, with teams batting until all players were out, and runs being scored for every base crossed, rather than just for reaching home plate. Though there are no records to confirm it, the commonly held belief is that baseball in Australia originated on the Ballarat gold-fields among American miners. The Claxton Shield, the first annually recurring national tournament, commenced in 1934. Though the tournament <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> supplanted at various points in its history, the physical Shield is still awarded to the national champions in the Australian Baseball League. From 2011, the national champions will meet other champions from Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei in the Asia Series.|$|E

5|$|Tillmore Brook joins {{from the}} west, {{and the course}} turns to the east. At Durleighmarsh, a hamlet which forms part of the civil parish of Rogate, it passes the ruins of Durford Abbey, a Premonstratensian monastery {{situated}} on the north bank. It is a scheduled ancient monument, and the site includes a threshing barn with a water wheel and associated drive shafts. On the south bank is Durford Mill. This mill house is a grade II listed structure, and was built of clunch in 1770. The mill <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> modernised and enlarged, and is not listed. A little further downstream, Harting Road crosses the river at Durford Bridge, build in the early 1600s with four semi-circular arches. It was restored in 1924. To the north of Habin, another hamlet in Rogate, North Lane crosses the river on Habin Bridge, which has four round-headed arches, and was probably built in the seventeenth century, but might be earlier. It is built of stone, and was restored in the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|While {{the palace}} <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{completely}} destroyed, {{a significant amount}} of information regarding it has been obtained from contemporary and almost contemporary sources. The Heian Palace figures as a background for action in many Heian period literary texts, both fiction and non-fiction. These provide important information on the palace itself, court ceremonies and functions held there as well as everyday routines of the courtiers living or working there. Notable examples include the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu, the so-called Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon and the chronicle Eiga Monogatari. In addition, paintings in certain emakimono picture scrolls depict (sometimes fictional) scenes that took place at the palace; the Genji Monogatari Emaki, dating from about 1130 is perhaps the best-known example. Finally, there are also partially damaged contemporary maps of the palace from the 10th and 12th centuries showing the layout and function of the buildings within Dairi.|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E

5|$|Like {{with many}} large {{cities in the}} United States, Denver’s CBD and the {{adjacent}} neighborhoods were blighted {{with the presence of}} many open parking lots in the 1970s and 80’s. Recent focus to redevelop these open lots and increase density/activity in the city’s core have been hugely successful as many of these lots are today being turned into large residential, retail and commercial developments. This is especially true around the newly redeveloped and highly popular Union Station area in Denver’s LoDo (Lower Downtown) neighborhood. What used to be open land, parking lots, warehouses and rail yards as recently as {{the turn of the century}} is now several city blocks of new residential and commercial buildings as well as a new RTD underground bus terminal, rail platforms/pavilions and a park. There are also improved pedestrian friendly connections to the RiNo (River North), Five Points, Auraria and Highland neighborhoods from the new development. Historic Union Station <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> fully renovated and turned back into a travel and activity hub. It now includes the Denver Amtrak station, a new boutique hotel and several restaurants, bars & shops all centered on the large Great Hall inside and a public plaza outside along Wynkoop Street. Starting in April 2016 the University of Colorado A-Line commuter train began service directly connecting Union Station and downtown Denver to Denver International Airport and the airport's new 500+ room Westin Hotel & conference center.|$|E
5|$|The Old Market Hall cinema {{opened in}} 2004 in the Tudor market hall {{positioned}} in Shrewsbury Square. The independent cinema features daily screens of films {{from around the}} world along with a cafe and bar. Theatre Severn is the town's main performing arts complex. It is situated in Frankwell next to the Welsh Bridge {{on the bank of the}} River Severn. The theatre includes two performance spaces, the 635 seat Main Auditorium and a smaller studio space, the Walker Theatre which can accommodate 250 seating or 500 standing. The venue also includes a full sized dance studio, function rooms and restaurant. The new complex replaced the old theatre, the Music Hall, which <b>itself</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> refurbished and expanded in preparation for its current use as home to Shrewsbury Museum and Art Gallery (opened 2014). Further museums in the town include the acclaimed Shropshire Regimental Museum, based at Shrewsbury Castle, and the restored 19th century steam-powered Coleham Pumping Station, which opens for tours on specific days each year. Nearby National Trust properties include Attingham Park, former home of the Noel-Hill family, Barons of Berwick, and the last remaining Town Walls Tower which dates from the 14th century.|$|E
