5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles {{above ground level}} in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud. Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm {{is related to the}} evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the <b>hailstone</b> and what would be left on the ground.|$|E
5|$|As {{flagship}} of Battleship Division 7 (BatDiv 7), Iowa departed the United States on 2 January 1944 for the Pacific Ocean, transiting the Panama Canal on 7 January {{in advance}} of her combat debut in the campaign for the Marshall Islands. From 29 January to 3 February, she supported carrier air strikes made by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman's Task Group 38.3 (TG 38.3) against Kwajalein and Eniwetok atolls. Her next assignment was to support air strikes against the major Japanese naval and logistics base at Truk, Caroline Islands. Iowa, in company with other ships, was detached from the support group on 16 February 1944 to conduct an anti-shipping sweep around Truk, {{with the objective of}} destroying enemy naval vessels escaping to the north. On 21 February, she was underway with the Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 58 or TF 38, depending on whether {{it was part of the}} 5th Fleet or 3rd Fleet) while it conducted the first strikes against Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and Guam in the Mariana Islands. During this action, Iowa, along with her sister New Jersey, sank the Japanese light cruiser , the cruiser having escaped Truk the day before following Operation <b>Hailstone,</b> the US air attack on Truk.|$|E
5000|$|Any form of {{thunderstorm}} {{that produces}} precipitating <b>hailstones</b> {{is known as}} a hailstorm. Hailstorms are generally capable of developing in any geographic area where thunderclouds (cumulonimbus) are present, although they are most frequent in tropical and monsoon regions. The updrafts and downdrafts within cumulonimbus clouds cause water molecules to freeze and solidify, creating <b>hailstones</b> and other forms of solid precipitation. Due to their larger density, these <b>hailstones</b> become heavy enough to overcome the density of the cloud and fall towards the ground. The downdrafts in cumulonimbus clouds can also cause increases in the speed of the falling <b>hailstones.</b> The term [...] "hailstorm" [...] is usually used to describe the existence of significant quantities or size of <b>hailstones.</b>|$|R

25|$|Hail {{forms in}} a very intense updraft in a {{supercell}} or a multicellular thunderstorm. As for tornadoes, BWER detection and a tilted updraft are indicative of that updraft but {{does not lead to}} predict hail. The presence of a hail spike in the reflectivity pattern is an important clue. It is an area of weak reflectivity extending away from the radar immediately behind a thunderstorm with hail. It is caused by radiation from the radar bouncing from <b>hailstone</b> to <b>hailstone</b> or the ground before being reflected back to the radar. The time delay between the backscattered radiation from the storm and the one with multiple paths causes the reflectivity from the hail to appear to come from a farther range than the actual storm. However, this artefact is visible mostly for extremely large hail.|$|E

25|$|The size of {{individual}} hailstones that reach surface level {{is determined by}} speed of the updraft which create the individual ice crystals at atmospheric levels. Larger hailstones are capable of producing damage to property, and particularly with very large hailstones, resulting in serious injury or death due to blunt-force trauma induced by {{the impact of the}} hailstones. <b>Hailstone</b> size is typically correspondent to the size of an object for comparative purposes.|$|E
500|$|Stones {{larger than}} 2cm (0.80in) are usually {{considered}} {{large enough to}} cause damage. [...] The Meteorological Service of Canada issues severe thunderstorm warnings when hail that size or above is expected. The US National Weather Service has a 2.5cm (1in) or greater in diameter threshold, effective January 2010, an increase over the previous threshold of ¾-inch hail. Other countries have different thresholds according local sensitivity to hail; for instance grape growing areas could be adversely impacted by smaller <b>hailstones.</b> <b>Hailstones</b> can be very large or very small, depending on how strong the updraft is: weaker hailstorms produce smaller <b>hailstones</b> than stronger hailstorms (such as supercells).|$|R

500|$|Furthermore, the hailstone’s speed {{depends on}} its {{position}} in the cloud’s updraft and its mass. [...] This determines the varying thicknesses of the layers of the <b>hailstone.</b> [...] The accretion rate of supercooled water droplets onto the <b>hailstone</b> depends on the relative velocities between these water droplets and the <b>hailstone</b> itself. This means that generally the larger hailstones will form some distance from the stronger updraft where they can pass more time growing. [...] As the <b>hailstone</b> grows it releases latent heat, which keeps its exterior in a liquid phase. Because it undergoes 'wet growth', the outer layer is sticky (i.e. more adhesive), so a single <b>hailstone</b> may grow by collision with other smaller hailstones, forming a larger entity with an irregular shape.|$|E
500|$|The storm's updraft, with {{upwardly}} directed wind speeds {{as high as}} , {{blows the}} forming hailstones up the cloud. As the <b>hailstone</b> ascends it passes into areas of the cloud where the concentration of humidity and supercooled water droplets varies. [...] The hailstone’s growth rate changes depending on the variation in humidity and supercooled water droplets that it encounters. [...] The accretion rate of these water droplets is another factor in the hailstone’s growth. [...] When the <b>hailstone</b> moves into an area with {{a high concentration of}} water droplets, it captures the latter and acquires a translucent layer. [...] Should the <b>hailstone</b> move into an area where mostly water vapour is available, it acquires a layer of opaque white ice.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturers {{claim that}} what would {{otherwise}} have fallen as <b>hailstones</b> then falls as slush or rain. It {{is said to be}} critical that the machine is running during the approach of the storm in order to affect the developing <b>hailstones,</b> although all manufacturers unanimously agree that the area of effect of their device is only 100 to 200 square meters directly above.|$|R

500|$|Thus, {{a unique}} {{trajectory}} in the thunderstorm {{is sufficient to}} explain the layer-like structure of the <b>hailstone.</b> [...] The only case in which multiple trajectories can be discussed is in a multicellular thunderstorm, where the <b>hailstone</b> may be ejected {{from the top of}} the [...] "mother" [...] cell and captured in the updraft of a more intense [...] "daughter" [...] cell. [...] This, however, is an exceptional case.|$|E
500|$|Like other {{precipitation}} in cumulonimbus clouds, hail {{begins as}} water droplets. As the droplets rise {{and the temperature}} goes below freezing, they become supercooled water and will freeze on contact with condensation nuclei. A cross-section through a large <b>hailstone</b> shows an onion-like structure. [...] This means the <b>hailstone</b> is made of thick and translucent layers, alternating with layers that are thin, white and opaque. [...] Former theory suggested that hailstones were subjected to multiple descents and ascents, falling into a zone of humidity and refreezing as they were uplifted. [...] This up and down motion {{was thought to be}} responsible for the successive layers of the <b>hailstone.</b> [...] New research, based on theory as well as field study, has shown this is not necessarily true.|$|E
500|$|The size of hailstones is best {{determined}} by measuring their diameter with a ruler. [...] In {{the absence of}} a ruler, <b>hailstone</b> size is often visually estimated by comparing its size to that of known objects, such as coins. [...] Using the objects such as hen's eggs, peas, and marbles for comparing <b>hailstone</b> sizes is imprecise, due to their varied dimensions. The UK organisation, TORRO, also scales for both hailstones and hailstorms. [...] When observed at an airport, METAR code is used within a surface weather observation which relates {{to the size of the}} <b>hailstone.</b> [...] Within METAR code, GR is used to indicate larger hail, of a diameter of at least [...] [...] GR is derived from the French word grêle. [...] Smaller-sized hail, as well as snow pellets, use the coding of GS, which is short for the French word grésil.|$|E
