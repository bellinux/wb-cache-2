True <b>endomitosis</b> in the anther tapetum of the liliaceous plant Eremurus is described. The nuclear membrane does not disappear, but during metaphase the chromosomes are condensed, often considerably more than in normal mitosis. When the pollen mother cells (PMCs) go through the last premeiotic mitosis, the tapetal cells have one diploid nucleus which divides while the cell remains undivided. The two diploid nuclei may undergo an <b>endomitosis</b> and the resulting tetraploid nuclei a second <b>endomitosis.</b> An alternative pathway is an ordinary mitosis-again without cell division instead {{of one of the}} endomitotic cycles. The cytological picture in the tapetum is further complicated by restitution in anaphase and fusion of metaphase and anaphase groups during mitosis, processes which could give rise to cells with one, two, or three nuclei, instead of the expected two or four. No sign of the so-called [...] "inhibited" [...] mitosis is seen in these tapetal cells.

Repeated rounds of endocycling can lead to the production of polytene chromosomes in which sister chromatids are tightly configured in parallel arrays. In contrast, <b>endomitosis</b> is a form of endoreplication in which cells undergo aspects of mitosis but fail to execute telophase and/or cytokinesis. Duplicated chromosomes produced by <b>endomitosis</b> exist as discrete units in a single polyploid nucleus or may be packaged into separate nuclei, depending on the phase at which mitosis is aborted. In certain instances (e.g. trophoblast giant cells), the distinction between endocycling and <b>endomitosis</b> is clouded, as the cell undergoes early mitotic events such as chromosome condensation that tend to diminish the physical association among homologous chromosomes. It should also be noted that endocycling does not always involve replication of the entire genome, and that certain regions are often replicated more frequently than others.|$|E

5000|$|The best-studied {{example of}} a mitosis-to-endocycle {{transition}} occurs in Drosophila follicle cells and is activated by Notch signaling. [...] Entry into endocycles involves modulation of mitotic and S-phase cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Inhibition of M-phase CDK activity is accomplished via transcriptional activation of Cdh/fzr and repression of the G2-M regulator string/cdc25. [...] Cdh/fzr is responsible for activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and subsequent proteolysis of the mitotic cyclins. String/cdc25 is a phosphatase that stimulates mitotic cyclin-CDK complex activity. Upregulation of S-phase CDK activity is accomplished via transcriptional repression of the inhibitory kinase dacapo. Together, these changes allow for the circumvention of mitotic entry, progression through G1, and entry into S-phase. The induction of <b>endomitosis</b> in mammalian megakaryocytes involves activation of the c-mpl receptor by the thrombopoietin (TPO) cytokine and is mediated by ERK1/2 signaling.

Of the D-type cyclins, cyclin D 3 is present at high levels in megakaryo-cytes undergoing <b>endomitosis</b> and is markedly upregulated following exposure to the proliferation-, matura-tion-, and ploidy-promoting factor, Mpl ligand.

Thus, while our model supports a key role for cyclin D 3 in the endomitotic cell cycle, it also points to the unique role of Mpl ligand in priming megakaryocytes towards platelet fragmentation.

We have asked whether key factors involved in the assembly and licensing of replication origins are equally regulated during <b>endomitosis.</b> Cdc 6, cdt 1 and geminin expression was analysed during differentiation of two human megakaryoblastic cell lines, HEL and K 562, which respectively do and do not establish endoreplication cycles. Geminin was downregulated, whereas cdt 1 levels were maintained upon differentiation of both cell lines, independently of whether cells entered extra S-phases. In contrast, cdc 6 was present and remained nuclear only in differentiated endoreplicating cells. Interestingly, cdc 6 protein expression was re-established in K 562 cells that underwent <b>endomitosis</b> after transient or stable cyclin E over-expression. The high levels of cyclin E reached in these cells appeared to influence the stabilization of cdc 6 protein rather than its RNA transcription rate. Finally, cdc 6 overexpression drove HEL cells into endoreplication cycles in the absence of differentiation stimuli. Our results show that both cdt 1 and cdc 6 are differentially regulated during megakaryocytic differentiation and suggest an active role of cdc 6 in <b>endomitosis.</b> 2 Bermejo et al...|$|E

Very little is known about how such a dramatic alteration of the cell cycle in a physiological setting is achieved. Thrombopoietin-induced signaling is essential for induction of <b>endomitosis.</b> Here we show that calcium- and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB 1), a known regulator of platelet integrin Î±(IIb) Î²(3) outside-in signaling, regulates <b>endomitosis.</b> We observed that CIB 1 expression is increased in primary mouse megakaryocytes compared to mononuclear bone marrow cells as determined by Western blot analysis. Following PMA treatment of Dami cells, a megakaryoblastic cell line, we found that CIB 1 protein expression increased concomitant with cell ploidy. Overexpression of CIB 1 in Dami cells resulted in multilobated nuclei and led to increased time for a cell to complete cytokinesis as well as increased incidence of furrow regression as observed by time-lapse microscopy. Additionally, we found that surface expression of integrin Î±(IIb) Î²(3,) an important megakaryocyte marker, was enhanced in CIB 1 overexpressing cells as determined by flow cytometry. Furthermore, PMA treatment of CIB 1 overexpressing cells led to increased ploidy compared to PMA treated control cells. Interestingly, expression of Polo-like kinase 3 (Plk 3), an established CIB 1 -interacting protein and a key regulator of the mitotic process, decreased upon PMA treatment of Dami cells. Furthermore, PMA treatment augmented the interaction between CIB 1 and Plk 3, which depended on the duration of treatment.

Our {{previous study}} demonstrated that feeding {{is required for}} continued <b>endomitosis</b> in the silk gland cells of silkworm larvae. Furthermore, the insulin signaling pathway {{is closely related to}} nutritional signals. To investigate whether the insulin signaling pathway is involved in <b>endomitosis</b> in silk gland cells, in this study, we initially analyzed the effects of bovine insulin on DNA synthesis in endomitotic silk gland cells using 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling technology, and found that bovine insulin can stimulate DNA synthesis. Insulin signal transduction is mainly mediated via phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt, the target of rapamycin (TOR) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in vertebrates. We ascertained that these three pathways are involved in DNA synthesis in endomitotic silk gland cells using specific inhibitors against each pathway. Moreover, we investigated whether these three pathways are involved in insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis in endomitotic silk gland cells, and found that the PI 3 K/Akt and TOR pathways, but not the ERK pathway, are involved in this process. These results provide an important theoretical foundation for the further investigations of the mechanism underlying efficient <b>endomitosis</b> in silk gland cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathways}} {{that regulate}} the S-phase events {{associated with the}} control of DNA replication are poorly understood. The bone marrow megakaryocytes are unique in that they leave the diploid (2 C) state to differentiate, synthesizing 4 to 64 times the normal DNA content within a single nucleus, {{a process known as}} <b>endomitosis.</b> Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells model this process, becoming polyploid during phorbol diester-induced megakaryocyte differentiation. The mitotic arrest occurring in these polyploid cells involves novel alterations in the cdk 1 /cyclin B 1 complex: a marked reduction in cdk 1 protein levels, and an elevated and sustained expression of cyclin B 1. Endomitotic cells thus lack cdk 1 /cyclin B 1 -associated H 1 -histone kinase activity. Constitutive over-expression of cdk 1 in endomitotic cells failed to re-initiate normal mitotic events even though cdk 1 was present in a 10 -fold excess. This was due to an inability of cyclin-B 1 to physically associate with cdk 1. Nonetheless, endomitotic cyclin B 1 possesses immunoprecipitable H 1 -histone kinase activity, and specifically translocates to the nucleus. We conclude that mitosis is abrogated during <b>endomitosis</b> due to the absence of cdk 1 and the failure to form M-phase promoting factor, resulting in a disassociation of mitosis from the completion of S-phase. Further studies on cyclin and its interacting proteins should be informative in understanding <b>endomitosis</b> and cell cycle control...|$|E

Colchicinized metaphases from uncultured (spleen and intestine) and cultured tissues (blood) were also analyzed. We report two antagonic non-random chromosome arrangements in untreated premeiotic cells: the parallel configuration with homologue chromosomes associated {{side by side}} in the metaphase plate and the antiparallel configuration having homologue chromosomes with antipolar distribution in the metaphase ring. The antiparallel aspect also appeared in colchicinized cells. The spatial chromosome arrangement in both configurations is groupal size-dependent and maintained through meiosis. We also describe, in untreated gonia cells, <b>endomitosis</b> followed by reductional mitosis which restores the diploid number. In B. jararaca males we observed that some gonad regions present changes in the meiotic mechanism. In this case, endoreduplicated cells segregate the diplochromosomes to opposite poles forming directly endoreduplicated second metaphases of meiosis with the suppression of first meiosis. By a successive division, these cells form nuclei with one set of chromosomes. Chromosome doubling in oogonia is known in hybrid species and in parthenogenetic salamanders and lizards. This species also presented chromosome rearrangements leading to aneuploidies in mitosis and meiosis. It is suggested that somatic pairing, <b>endomitosis,</b> meiotic alterations, and chromosomal aberrations can be correlated processes.

40|$|SummaryPolyploidization is {{a natural}} process that {{frequently}} accompanies differentiation; its deregulation is linked to genomic instability and cancer. Despite its relevance, why cells select different polyploidization mechanisms is unknown. Here we report a systematic genetic analysis of <b>endomitosis,</b> a process inÂ which megakaryocytes become polyploid by entering mitosis but aborting anaphase. Whereas ablation of the APC/C cofactor Cdc 20 results in mitotic arrest and severe thrombocytopenia, lack of the kinases Aurora-B, Cdk 1, or Cdk 2 does not affect megakaryocyte polyploidization or platelet levels. Ablation of Cdk 1 forces a switch to endocycles without mitosis, whereas polyploidization {{in the absence of}} Cdk 1 and Cdk 2 occurs in the presence of aberrant re-replication events. Importantly, ablation of these kinases rescues the defects in Cdc 20 null megakaryocytes.
