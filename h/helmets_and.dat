5|$|Imitating the Greek {{example of}} martial {{exercises}} and issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery, Philip II transformed the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well-trained fighting force. Philip II's infantry wielded peltai shields that already disembarked from the hoplon style shield featured in sculpted artwork of a Katerini tomb dated {{perhaps to the}} reign of Amyntas III of Macedon. His early infantry were also equipped with protective <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> greaves, as well as sarissa pikes, yet according to Sekunda they were eventually equipped with heavier armor such as cuirasses, since the Third Philippic of Demosthenes in 341 BC described them as hoplites instead of lighter peltasts. As evidenced by the Alexander Sarcophagus, troops serving Alexander the Great were also armored in the hoplite fashion. However, Errington argues that breastplates were not worn by the phalanx pikemen of either Philip II or Philip V's reign periods (during which sufficient evidence exists). Instead, he claims that breastplates were only worn by military officers, while pikemen wore the kotthybos stomach bands along with their <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> greaves, wielding a dagger as a secondary weapon along with their shields.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{major cause}} of TBI are vehicle accidents, their {{prevention}} or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI. In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle <b>helmets,</b> <b>and</b> presence of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E

5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} has {{a number}} of characteristics that distinguish the Swedish style from heraldry in other European countries. Common features of Swedish heraldry {{are similar to those of}} other Nordic countries and Germany, placing it in the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, distinguished from Gallo-British heraldry and other heraldic traditions by several key elements of heraldic style. One of these is the use of multiple <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> crests, which cannot be displayed separately from the main shield. These <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> crests are considered to be as important as the shield, each denoting a fief over which the bearer holds a right. In Scandinavia (as distinct from the German custom), when an even number of helmets is displayed, they are usually turned, with their crests, to face outward; when an odd number, the center helmet is turned affronté and the rest turned outward (whereas in Germany the helmets are turned inward to face the center of the escutcheon). Additionally, the crests are often repetitive of charges used on the main shield, and marks of cadency typically occur in the crest, rather than on the shield as in Gallo-British heraldry. Also, the use of heraldic furs on the shield, while common in Gallo-British heraldry, is rare in German-Nordic heraldry. Furs in Scandinavia are generally limited to ermine and vair, which sometimes appear in mantling, supporters, or the trimmings of crowns, but rarely on the shield.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|Daft Punk are a French {{electronic}} music duo formed in 1993 by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. The duo achieved significant {{popularity in the}} late 1990s {{as part of the}} French house movement and had continuous success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, rock and synthpop influences. They are also known for their visual stylization and disguises associated with their music; the duo have worn ornate <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> gloves to assume robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001 and rarely grant interviews or appear on television. The duo were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (also known as Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.|$|E

The set contains 2231 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. Modeled to look like a realistic 1930s fire station, the set includes a bell tower, an opening garage door, a 1930s style fire truck, and 4 minifigures with a fire-dog. Like Green Grocer, all floors in the Fire Brigade set are fully furnished. The Fire Brigade is the first Modular House to come with a vehicle, the 1930s style fire truck. The set also includes some new, unique pieces, such as gold fire <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> a red sliding garage door.|$|E

Early in a game against Oakland, Masterton was checked hard by two players causing him to flip over backwards and land on his head. Masterton was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries, and died there two days later. The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league with the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy later in the season. Following Masterton's death, players slowly began wearing <b>helmets,</b> <b>and</b> starting in the 1979–80 season, the league mandated all players entering the league wear them.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{military}} equipment was mass-produced in state-run fabricae ("factories") which brought together advanced forging technology and skilled artisans. Roman weapons were mostly made of internally produced steel such as chalybs Noricus which {{was superior to}} unhardened iron. In contrast, forging technology, capacity and personnel were more limited in Germania libera, although {{there is evidence that}} production and standardization of equipment had greatly improved since the time of the Roman Principate. Steel-making was also known in Germania libera (spathae and rapier-like swords out of flexible steel were in use). But Alamanni production of sophisticated forge-products such as metal armour, <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> swords was on a much smaller scale than the Romans'. Simple weapons such as axes and knives seem often to have been made of unhardened iron.|$|E

5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{manganese}} improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing {{the formation of}} a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to 863MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel. It was used for British military steel <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> later by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} encompasses heraldic {{achievements in}} modern and historic Sweden. Swedish heraldic style {{is consistent with}} the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, noted for its multiple <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> crests which are treated as inseparable from the shield, its repetition of colours and charges between the shield and the crest, and its scant use of heraldic furs. Because the medieval history of the Nordic countries was so closely related, their heraldic individuality developed rather late. Swedish and Finnish heraldry have a shared history prior to the Diet of Porvoo in 1809; these, together with Danish heraldry, were heavily influenced by German heraldry. Unlike the highly stylized and macaronic language of English blazon, Swedish heraldry is described in plain language, using (in most cases) only Swedish terminology.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{likewise}} {{identified the}} origin and ownership of documents and buildings with seals, which were typically a pointed oval called a vesica to distinguish from round seals in non-religious use. Edward I of England decreed in 1307 that all legal documents required a seal. These seals initially depicted a person, but as secular seals began to depict only a shield, clergy likewise used seals with heraldic insignia. Personal seals of bishops and abbots continued to be used after their deaths, gradually becoming an impersonal seal. Clergy tended to replace military devices with clerical devices. The shield was retained, but ecclesiastical hats often replaced <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> coronets. In some religious arms a skull replaces the helmet.|$|E

5|$|Æthelstan {{ascended the}} throne in 924 and united the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. In the {{earliest}} known depiction of an English king wearing a crown, he is shown presenting a copy of Bede's Life of St Cuthbert to the saint himself. Until his reign, kings had been portrayed on coins wearing <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> circlets, or wreath-like diadems {{in the style of}} Roman emperor, Constantine the Great. Whether or not they wore such an item is open to question. Coins are unreliable because the portraits were often generic or copied from overseas coins. Edgar the Peaceful was the first English king to be crowned with an actual crown, and a sceptre was also introduced into the ceremony for his coronation in 973.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of manpower, the US Eighth Army had three and half times the {{firepower}} of the opposing Chinese forces. The US Fifth Air Force, which {{was responsible for the}} air support, also had little opposition due to {{the lack of}} anti-aircraft weapons by the Chinese. Boosted by a Thanksgiving feast with roasted turkeys on the eve of the advance, the morale was high among the UN ranks, and home by Christmas and Germany by spring was in everyone's mind. The high morale, however, caused a degradation of troop discipline, and most of the soldiers had discarded their equipment and ammunition supply before the battle. A rifle company from the US IX Corps, for example, started its advance with most of the <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> bayonets thrown away, and there were on average less than one grenade and 50 rounds of ammunition carried per man. Because the UN planners did not foresee that the war would be dragged into a winter campaign, all elements of the Eighth Army started the offensive with a shortage of winter clothing.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel James H. Lynch's 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, {{numbered}} 535 {{men on the}} eve of its {{attack against}} Hill 314, less its rear echelons.

The North Korean soldiers on Hill 314 wore American uniforms, <b>helmets,</b> <b>and</b> combat boots. Many of them had M1 rifles and carbines. About 200 North Korean dead were on the hill. Of the other 500 estimated to have been there, most of them had been wounded or were missing. After the capture of Hill 314 on September 12, the situation north of Taegu improved. On September 14 the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, attacked and, supported by fire from Hill 314, gained part of Hill 570 from the NK 19th Regiment, 13th Division.|$|E
