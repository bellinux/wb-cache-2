5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, UBS {{settled a}} lawsuit filed against it and 17 other banks by Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the U.S. federal agency that oversees <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and Freddie Mac, with a payout of US$885 million, but without UBS having to admit any wrongdoing. At {{the time of the}} {{settlement}}, the agency already settle with two other institutions, but UBS settlement was the first where the amount paid was released to public.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} major bailouts were pursued during the {{financial}} crisis, starting on 7 September with {{the announcement that}} the U.S. Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the U.S. subprime mortgage market – <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and Freddie Mac. In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with Keynesian economic thought. Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, Politico {{reported}} that in October 2008, Bevin had signed a report for his investment fund that praised the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the government takeover of <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and Freddie Mac. During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, and that he had only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the content of the letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> also earns a {{significant}} portion of its income from guaranty fees it receives as compensation for assuming the credit risk on mortgage loans underlying its single-family <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> MBS and on the single-family mortgage loans held in its retained portfolio. Investors, or purchasers of <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> MBSs, are willing to let <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk; that is, Fannie Mae's guarantee that the scheduled principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid even if the borrower defaults.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> 2014 {{financial}} results {{enabled them to}} pay $20.6 billion in dividends to Treasury for the year, resulting in a cumulative total of $134.5 billion in dividends through December 31, 2014 – approximately $18 billion more than <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> received in support. As of March 31, 2015, <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> expects to have paid a total of $136.4 billion in payments to Treasury.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, the {{government}} also created {{the government}}-sponsored corporation <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> to create a liquid secondary market in these mortgages and thereby free up the loan originators to originate more loans, primarily by buying FHA-insured mortgages. As part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> was split into the current <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and Ginnie Mae to support the FHA-insured mortgages, as well as Veterans Administration (VA) and Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) insured mortgages, with the full faith and credit of the US government. In 1970, the federal government authorized <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> to purchase private mortgages—that is, those not insured by the FHA, VA, or FmHA, and created Freddie Mac to perform a role {{similar to that of}} <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae.</b> Ginnie Mae does not invest in private mortgages.|$|E
25|$|Concerns with {{business}} and accounting practices at <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> predate the scandal itself. On June 15, 2000, the House Banking Subcommittee On Capital Markets, Securities And Government-Sponsored Enterprises held hearings on <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae.</b>|$|E
25|$|On August 10, 2008, Secretary Paulson told NBC’s Meet the Press {{that he had}} {{no plans}} to inject any capital into <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> or Freddie Mac. On September 7, 2008, both <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and Freddie Mac went into conservatorship.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{after months}} of {{interviews}} with Lavalle, <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> executives, and a review of Fannie Mae's securitization, foreclosure, and legal practices and procedures, the independent counsel, Mark Cymrot issued Report to <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> Regarding Shareholder Complaints By Nye Lavalle, OCJ Case No. 5595.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> sued KPMG for {{malpractice}} for approving {{years of}} erroneous financial statements.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> {{issued its}} first {{mortgage}} passthrough {{and called it}} a mortgage-backed security. The <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> laws did not require the Banks to hand out subprime loans in any way. Ginnie Mae had guaranteed the first mortgage passthrough security of an approved lender in 1968 and in 1971 Freddie Mac issued its first mortgage passthrough, called a participation certificate, composed primarily of private mortgages.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Herbert M. Allison {{was appointed}} {{chief executive of}} <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae.</b> He came from TIAA-CREF.|$|E

25|$|There will be {{financing}} and investing {{relationship with the}} U.S. Treasury via three different financing facilities to provide critically needed support to Freddie Mac and <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae,</b> and also to the liquidity of the mortgage market. One of the three facilities is a secured liquidity facility, which will be not only for <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and Freddie Mac, {{but also for the}} 12 Federal Home Loan Banks that are regulated by FHFA.|$|E
25|$|FIRREA gives both Freddie Mac and <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> {{additional}} {{responsibility to}} support mortgages for low- and moderate-income families.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, {{the federal}} {{government}} authorized <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> to purchase conventional mortgages, the same year it went public on New York and Pacific Exchanges, (Residential Mortgage Loan Origination 2nd edition pg.8, J.Keith Baker 2010), i.e. those not insured by the FHA, VA, or FmHA, and created the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), colloquially known as Freddie Mac, to compete with <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and thus facilitate a more robust and efficient secondary mortgage market.|$|E
25|$|In May 2013, <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> {{announced}} {{that it is going}} to pay a dividend of $59.4 billion to the United States Treasury.|$|E
25|$|As of 2016, Urbana {{is home to}} the <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> Data Center and is {{the current}} {{headquarters}} for Legal & General America.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> {{regional}} data center {{was the first}} building constructed in the Urbana Corporate Center. Built in 2004, the facility is a 220,000 sq. ft. {{state of the art}} office and data center facility with 90,000 sq. ft. of office space, a 60,000 sq. ft. data center, and a 70,000 sq. ft. MEP facility. The <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> Data center {{was one of the first}} data centers in the country to receive LEED certification which included sediment control and stormwater management credits.|$|E

25|$|On August 10, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency asked investors {{for ideas}} on renting homes owned by <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae,</b> Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration.|$|E
25|$|CBS News {{reported}} on August 6, 2015, that <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> alone has paid {{a total of}} $142.5 billion in dividends since receiving a bailout of $116 billion in 2008.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009 Hamsher {{teamed up}} with Grover Norquist to call for the {{resignation}} of Rahm Emanuel for an alleged role {{in the collapse of}} <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and Freddie Mac.|$|E
25|$|In late 2004, <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> {{was under}} {{investigation}} for its accounting practices. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight released a report on September 20, 2004, alleging widespread accounting errors.|$|E
25|$|On Oct 21, 2010 FHFA {{estimates}} {{revealed that}} the bailout of Freddie Mac and <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> will likely cost taxpayers $224–360 billion in total, with over $150 billion already provided.|$|E
25|$|On July 11, 2008, The New York Times {{reported}} that U.S. government officials were considering {{a plan for}} the U.S. government to take over <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and/or Freddie Mac should their financial situations worsen due to the U.S. housing crisis. <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and smaller Freddie Mac owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the United States and so were especially hard hit by the slump. The government officials also stated that the government had also considered calling for explicit government guarantee through legislation of $5 trillion on debt owned or guaranteed by the two companies.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression wrought {{havoc on}} the U.S. housing market. By 1933, an {{estimated}} 20 to 25% of the nation's outstanding mortgage debt was in default. <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> was established in 1938 by amendments to the National Housing Act as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Originally chartered as the National Mortgage Association of Washington, the organization's explicit purpose was to provide local banks with federal money to finance home mortgages {{in an attempt to}} raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing. <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> created a liquid secondary mortgage market and thereby made it possible for banks and other loan originators to issue more housing loans, primarily by buying Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgages. For the first thirty years following its inception, <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> held a monopoly over the secondary mortgage market. Other considerations may have motivated the New Deal focus on the housing market: {{about a third of the}} nation's unemployed were in the building trade, and the government had a vested interest in getting them back to work by giving them homes to build.|$|E
25|$|PACE {{programs}} are currently operating in eight states, California, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New York, and Wisconsin, and are on hold in many others, pending {{resolution of the}} Freddie Mac, <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> objection.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Ben Bernanke {{suggested}} further {{increasing the}} presence of <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and Freddie Mac in the affordable housing market to help banks fulfill their CRA obligations by providing them with more opportunities to securitize CRA-related loans.|$|E
25|$|Fannie Mae's charter has {{historically}} prevented it from guaranteeing mortgages with a loan-to-values over 80% without mortgage insurance or a repurchase {{agreement with the}} lender; however, in 2006 and 2007 <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> did purchase subprime and Alt-A loans as investments.|$|E
25|$|Grayson {{has worked}} to combat federal waste, fraud, and abuse. In the September 6, 2009 edition of The New York Times, {{columnist}} Gretchen Morgenson thanked Grayson for uncovering the fact that, due to the federal bailout of mortgage finance giant <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae,</b> taxpayer money had been funding the legal defense fees for former top executives at the institution. Grayson requested information about these legal costs after a June 2009 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. Grayson's work uncovered that, between September 6, 2008 and July 21, 2009, taxpayers spent $6.3 million defending <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> executives Franklin Raines, J. Timothy Howard, and Leanne Spencer. Taxpayers paid an additional $16.8 million to cover legal expenses of workers at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, Fannie's former regulator.|$|E
