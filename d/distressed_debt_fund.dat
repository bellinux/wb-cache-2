40|$|In {{this paper}} I attempt {{to offer a}} legal {{analysis}} of recent legislations adopted in the United Kingdom and Belgium which aim to limit the possibility for sovereign debt creditors to obtain a judgment and collect on what is due to them under sovereign bonds. The paper starts with a review of various instances of holdout creditor litigation, seeking to explain the distinctive features of such litigation. The paper next turns to the various initiatives undertaken in different jurisdictions to curb the activities of so-called 'vulture funds'. The legislation adopted in Belgium and the UK is specifically examined. In a second part, the paper offers a more general analysis {{of the need for}} such specific legislation. The need to intervene at national level to restrict the activities of <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> <b>funds</b> is questioned, on the basis of recent evolutions both in the sovereign debt market (introduction of collective action clauses) and in the legal framework of such debt (among others the tightening up of the enforcement immunity granted to central bank assets). On this basis, it is submitted that creditor litigation is more a nuisance than an obstacle.

The country owes its {{creditors}} more than $1.3 billion. According to Mark Weidemaier, {{a law professor at the}} University of North Carolina, the ruling was one of [...] "the most significant litigation victories that a holdout creditor has ever achieved" [...] in the realm of sovereign debt. A July 2014 Wall Street Journal article by Georgetown Law professor Adam J. Levitin argued that the relationship between distressed securities investors and the U.S. court system should be revisited. He claimed that while these <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> investment <b>funds</b> can choose to [...] "play the game" [...] and [...] "put their head in the mouth of the Leviathan", the U.S. courts should not choose to.|$|R
40|$|Investments such as venture capital, buyouts, <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> or assimilated, {{have the}} {{peculiarity}} of being difficult to value {{due to their}} illiquid nature on the market. The lack of transparency {{is determined by the}} market value being either determined infrequently or estimated through an "appraisal" process. Both methods of evaluation lead to the "smoothing" of returns, implying that the reported performance metrics are biased: in particular, the estimated volatility is lower than the true volatility of the investment. We propose and test two multi-index methods to evaluate performance of mezzanine, <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> and hedge <b>funds,</b> aiming at overcoming the existing gaps in the current traditional portfolio analysis. The proposed models are able to capture non-linear market effects - asset class exposure and style factor model - with the advantage of remaining in the simple framework of the linear regression analysis. We discuss the results obtained and compare them with the outcomes of a traditional regression analysis. The paper is organized as follows: section 1 provides additional arguments to support the current methodology; section 2 presents the two types of methods used in the analysis and introduces the extensions to these models to incorporate market-lagged effects; section 3 describes the data used for the analysis, namely series of returns for three funds: mezzanine, <b>distressed</b> <b>debt,</b> and hedge fund; section 4 provides interpretation and comparisons of the results obtained when using different specifications of the first method based on the asset class exposure models whereas section 5 discusses the results obtained from different specifications of the style factor model.

40|$|MBA - WBSThe way banks recover <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> {{has become}} an {{important}} subject locally {{as well as on}} international level. Dedicated conferences are held annually on the benefit derived by using methods other than liquidation to recover <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> and many forums advocate that alternative methods could yield better returns than liquidation. Many first world countries around the world have adopted legislation (such as the well known chapter 11 in the United States) to provide the necessary protection and time for a business rescue plan to be developed and implemented as an alternative to liquidation. Legislation to this end in South Africa is contained in the Companies Act and is known as judicial management. However, as set out in this research report, judicial management proved to be unsuccessful as a <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> recovery method and, historically, banks used liquidation as their only alternative to recover <b>distressed</b> <b>debt.</b> Lately, however, in the wake of international developments in the area, banks in South Africa have become very innovative in the way they recover <b>distressed</b> <b>debt.</b> Banks realise that liquidation as the sole <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> recovery method does not yield acceptable returns and have been exploring other alternatives to yield better results. To this end, this research report identifies the various <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> recovery methods that are available to and used by South African banks, as well as the impact of key factors on the selection of one method above another to recover <b>distressed</b> <b>debt.</b> As such, this research report developed a framework that can be used by South African banks to identify the most appropriate <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> recovery method given the impact of these key factor...|$|R

40|$|Going for Broke: Restructuring <b>Distressed</b> <b>Debt</b> Portfolios This paper {{discusses}} how {{to restructure}} {{a portfolio of}} <b>distressed</b> <b>debt,</b> what the gains are from doing so, and attributes these gains to restructuring and portfolio effects. This is an interesting and novel problem in fixed-income portfolio management that has received scant modeling attention. We show that debt restructuring is Pareto improving and lucrative for borrowers, lenders, and investors in <b>distressed</b> <b>debt.</b> First, the methodological contribution of the paper is a parsimonious model for the pricing and optimal restructuring of <b>distressed</b> <b>debt,</b> i. e., loans that are under-collateralized and {{are at risk of}} borrower default, where willingness to pay and ability to pay are at issue. Distressed-debt investing is a unique portfolio problem in that (a) it requires optimization over all moments, not just mean and variance, and (b) with debt restructuring, the investor can endogenously alter the return distribution of the candidate securities before subjecting them to portfolio construction. Second, economically, we show that post-restructuring return distributions of <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> portfolios are attractive to fixed-income investors, with risk-adjusted certainty equivalen...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} two purposes. First, it uses <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> prices to {{estimate}} recovery rates at default. In this regard, estimates are obtained for three recovery rate models: recovery of face value, recovery of Treasury, and recovery of market value. We show that identifying the "economic" default date, {{as distinct from}} the recorded default date, is crucial to obtaining unbiased estimates. The economic default date is de…ned to be that date when the market prices the …rm’s debt {{as if it has}} defaulted. An implication is that the standard industry practice of using 30 -day post default prices to compute recovery rate yields biased estimates. Second, we construct and estimate a <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> pricing model. We use this model to implicitly estimate the parameters of the embedded recovery rate process and to price <b>distressed</b> <b>debt.</b> Our <b>distressed</b> <b>debt</b> pricing model …ts market prices well, with an average pricing error of less than one basis point. ...|$|R

40|$|Higher {{education}} {{sector has}} become a highly competitive marketplace and universities in the UK have {{to raise money to}} fund research, buildings and services to increase their competitive edge. However, due to the budget reduction in higher education sector, universities have to seek other sources of funding. Among all the possible <b>funding</b> sources, <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> is widely used in higher education sector. There are many researches that analyze the financial management in higher education institutions, but did not analyze <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> in depth. Therefore, the aim of this research is to find the current situation and problems of <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> in universities in the UK and put forward some suggestions about <b>debt</b> <b>funding.</b> The researcher interviewed a financial director and collected secondary data to analyze current <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> in universities in the UK. Universities in the UK have similar income sources and they rely heavily on tuition fees. The researcher also finds that external borrowing in higher education sector has an increasing trend {{during the past few years}} and universities’ external borrowing’s proportion of total income are different. Some universities use no <b>debt</b> <b>funding,</b> while others raise a huge amount of debt for working capital. Although <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> has many advantages, financial directors have to notice its problems. The uncertainty of long term debt to universities makes banks unwilling to borrow to universities. The difficulty of external borrowings and high costs also require universities to find other sources of funding. The researcher presents some possible method for universities to raise money. The researcher recommended that universities could use <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> in the short run, but should generate surplus and reserves to reduce vulnerability to risks and become financially self-sufficient. The high reliance on tuition fees as income might have a negative impact on cash flow when some political issues reduce the number of enrolled students. In terms of debt management, universities can cooperate with debt management companies to create a plan about how to manage debt. The researcher reviewed and summarized the current financial condition about <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> in higher education sector in the UK. Financial directors of universities can compare their use of <b>debt</b> <b>funding</b> with peers and measure the financial performance using the conclusions from this research. The recommendations might be helpful financial directors when making decisions. Key words: <b>debt</b> <b>funding,</b> external borrowings, United Kingdom universitie...|$|R
