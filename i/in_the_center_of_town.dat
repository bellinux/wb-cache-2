5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry {{the water from the}} well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E

Near the airport in town, M-76 turned back northwesterly along Washington Street, parting from F-97 in the process. The highway ran along the northeastern shore of Lake St. Helen and near Mud Lake as it continued toward Roscommon. As it entered that town, the trunkline passed the Roscommon Conservation Airport and followed Elm Street on a northwest track through the middle of the village. M-18 joined M-76 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> and the two turned parallel to the Roscommonâ€“Crawford county line on Federal Highway.

This partial interchange marked the point where I-75 resumed its course north through the state. Traffic could not directly access southbound US27 from northbound M-76 and northbound US27 could not access southbound M-76.|$|E

A short distance later, the route has a concurrency with CR542 that begins adjacent to the former Atlanticare - Kessler Memorial Hospital that closed in 2009 and passes by Hammonton Lake. US30 turns south-southwest past the CR542 concurrency before heading south. The route crosses CR561 and turns southeast again, entering Mullica Township. Here, the White Horse Pike enters more forested areas with a few buildings, running a short distance to the northeast of the Atlantic City Line. Past the intersection with CR623 in the developed community of Elwood, US30 becomes a divided highway with grass median and jughandles. This configuration continues until Egg Harbor City, when the median ends. In Egg Harbor City, US30 passes a mix of homes and businesses, intersecting Route50 and CR563 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> At this point, CR563 forms a concurrency with US30 and the two routes continue through more of the town before crossing into Galloway Township at the intersection with CR674.
