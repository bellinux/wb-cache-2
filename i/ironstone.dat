40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{origin of}} oolitic and pisolitie <b>ironstones</b> is briefly reviewed. Two {{principal}} levels of <b>ironstones,</b> separated by dominantly argillaceous beds {{occur in the}} Middle Niger Valley. The lower level sits on fluviatile sediments, and comprises mainly goethitie, pisolitic and oolitic, <b>ironstones,</b> with subsidiary kaolinitic oolites and pisolites. The distribution of facies within this level, the fauna and flora, oolitic and pisolitic texture, and the sedimentary structures suggest that the <b>ironstones</b> represent subtidal shoreline deposits laid down possibly under two freely connected, high energy, environmental conditions. The upper level is dominated by goethitlc, oolitic <b>ironstones.</b> Subsidiary sideritic, chlo-ritic(?), and kaolinitic <b>ironstones</b> are present. The distribution of the oolitic subfacies, fauna and flora, and sedimentary structures also suggest hat the deposits document subtidal shore-line sediments possibly deposited under two closely related, high energy, environmental conditions. A comparison of our reconstructed palaeo-environments with the Recent ones shows that the <b>ironstones</b> were probably laid down under some oceanographical conditions somewhat {{similar to those of}} the carbonate flats of the Trucial Coastline. The differences in the chemical states of the two environments [...] a result of contrasting climatic differences [...] seem to have given rise to contrasting mineralogical ssemblages. The evidences of petrology and field relationships of the <b>ironstones</b> suggest that the ferruginous beds were derived principally from the igneous and metamorphic basement complex of Southwestern Nigeria. Tbe combined effect of tropical climate, geomorphological maturity of coastal plains of alluviation, low submarine slopes, and the biological, chemical and physical states of the environments of deposition seem to have made possible the genesis of the oolitic and pisolitie <b>ironstones</b> of the Middle Niger Valley...|$|R

5|$|In 1842, the {{shortage}} of pig iron persuaded Bell to install its own blast furnace for smelting mill cinder; this was a key decision, enabling the firm to expand. Only two years later, in 1844, the firm installed a second furnace at Walker for Cleveland <b>Ironstone</b> from Grosmont, six years before the boom in Cleveland iron when Vaughan and Marley discovered <b>ironstone</b> in the Eston Hills in 1850. From 1849, Losh, Wilson and Bell were subcontractors on the Newcastle-Gateshead High Level Bridge, responsible for constructing the bridge approaches.|$|E
5|$|Mineral {{resources}} {{near the}} top end of the canal included <b>ironstone,</b> which was normally extracted by scouring. This caused problems for the canal, as silt was deposited in the feeders and the top pounds. The Fox family, who were based at Neath Abbey, but who were scouring <b>ironstone</b> further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 to mitigate the problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As the pounds were silting up, the company took legal action in 1811. The court found in their favour, recognising that the canal would soon be useless unless something was done.|$|E

40|$|Gold-copper-bismuth {{mineralization}} in the Tennant Creek goldfield of the Northern Territory {{occurs in}} pipe-like, ellipsoidal, or lensoidal lodes of magnetite +/- hematite <b>ironstones</b> which are hosted in turbiditic sedimentary rocks of Proterozoic age. Fluid inclusion studies have revealed four major inclusion types in quartz associated with mineralized and barren <b>ironstones</b> at Tennant Creek; (1) liquid-vapour inclusions with low liquid/vapour ratios (Type I), (2) liquid-vapour inclusions with high liquid/vapour ratios or high vapour/liquid ratios and characteristic dark bubbles (Type II), (3) liquid-vapour-halite inclusions (Type III), and (4) liquid-vapour inclusions with variable liquid/vapour ratios (Type V). Type I inclusions {{are present in}} the barren <b>ironstones</b> and the unmineralized portions of fertile <b>ironstones,</b> whereas Types II and III inclusions are recognized in fertile <b>ironstones.</b> Trails of Types II and III inclusions cut trails of Type I inclusions. Type I fluid inclusions have homogenization temperatures of 100 -degrees to 350 -degrees-C with a mode at 200 -degrees to 250 -degrees-C. Type II inclusions in mineralized <b>ironstones</b> (e. g. Juno, White Devil, Eldorado, TC 8 and Gecko K- 44 deposits) have homogenization temperatures of 250 -degrees-C to 600 -degrees-C with a mode of 350 -degrees-C. Type i fluid inclusions have a salinity range of 10 to 30 NaCl equiv. wt %. Salinity measurements on fluid inclusions in the mineralized zones gave a range of 10 to 50 NaCl equiv. wt % with a mode of 35 NaCl equiv. wt %. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that the Tennant Creek <b>ironstones</b> were formed from a relatively low temperature and moderately saline fluid, whereas gold and copper mineralization was deposited from later hydrothermal fluids of higher temperature and salinity. Gas analysis indicates the presence of N 2 and CO 2, with very minor CH 4 in Types II inclusions but no N 2 or CH 4 gases in Type I inclusions. Microprobe analysis of the fluid inclusion decrepitates indicates that the inclusions from Tennant Creek contain sodium and calcium as dominant cations and potassium in a subordinate amount. The high temperatures (greater-than-or-equal-to 350 -degrees-C), high salinities (greater-than-or-equal-to 35 NaCl equiv. wt. %) and cation composition of the Tennant Creek ore fluids suggest that the ore fluids were derived from upward migrating heated basinal brines, although contribution from a magmatic source cannot be ruled out. Close association of vapour-rich Type IIb and salt-rich Type III inclusions in the mineralized <b>ironstones</b> (e. g. Juno, White Devil, Eldorado, TC 8 and Gecko K- 44) indicates heterogeneous trapping of ore fluids. This heterogeneous trapping is interpreted to be due to unmixing (exsolution) of a gas-rich (e. g. N 2) fluid during the upward migration of the metal bearing brines and/or due to degassing caused by reaction of oxidized ore fluids and host <b>ironstones.</b> Fluid inclusion data have important implications regarding the deposition of gold in the <b>ironstones,</b> and may have application in discriminating fertile from barren <b>ironstones...</b>|$|R

40|$|Lead isotope {{analyses}} {{have been}} undertaken {{as part of}} a program to evaluate the potential of geochemical methods for use in exploration in the Tennant Creek goldfield. Earlier exploration in this area was based on magnetic geophysical methods. Economic Au, Cu and Bi mineralization usually occurs in magnetic magnetite-chlorite lenses or pods (“ironstones”) which may be only 30 m across. Several hundred <b>ironstones</b> are found in the Tennant Creek field, of which only nine have been significant producers. Despite complications arising from the low Pb and relatively elevated U contents of the ore, determination of Pb isotope ratios in drill core material allows discrimination between economic magnetic <b>ironstones</b> and “barren” <b>ironstones</b> of similar mineralogy. A target signature for the Th-derived Pb isotope ratio, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb, is specific for lode mineralization, although it does not discriminate between Au-rich and Cu-rich lodes. The target signature is commonly found not only in the central Au-rich magnetite-chlorite zone, but also in the outer “barren” talc-magnetite and carbonate zones, offering up to a two-fold increase {{in the size of the}} target. The Pb isotope signature is retained in hematite-rich surface <b>ironstones</b> (termed “gossans” here) and it appears possible, at this stage of the project, to discriminate between gossans derived from mineralized magnetite lodes and “barren” magnetite lodes. A discrimination between weakly-mineralized (either Cu or Au) and economic deposits is equivocal at this stage. The difference between target and sample 208 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios (Δ 208 / 204) ranges from − 3 to + 2 % for the economic lodes, through weakly mineralized and “barren” magnetic <b>ironstones</b> (commonly in the range − 20 to − 40 %) to the country rock magnetite shales (about − 40 to − 70 %). These data are consistent with a significant Pb component in the “barren” <b>ironstones</b> being derived locally from the magnetite shales. Hematite shales commonly associated with economic lodes may have acted as limited channelways for the ore fluids as the target signature is discernible for up to 50 m along the hematite shale bands from the outer chlorite zones of the economic lodes. Further trace element and isotopic work is necessary to elucidate the genesis of the mineralization...|$|R

40|$|The blue {{amphibole}} asbestos, crocidolite, {{which occurs}} as interbedded seams in banded <b>ironstones</b> of the Lower Griquatown {{stage of the}} Transvaal System in the Northern Cape Province, is the finely fibrous form of the soda-amphibole riebeckite. Despite the widespread occurrence of the Precambrian type of banded <b>ironstones,</b> crocidolite is a mineral of rare occurrence and is only developed to a relatively minor extent in South Africa, Western Australia and Central China. The composition, structure and properties of riebeckite {{in general and of}} crocidolite in particular are discussed and four new chemical analyses are given. Particular attention is paid to the mode of occurrence of fibrous riebeckite and it is suggested that the name "crocidolite" be reserved for the asbestiform riebeckite which occurs interbedded with banded <b>ironstones.</b> The general geology, lithology and mineralogy of Precambrian banded <b>ironstones</b> are described and their distribution in space and time is discussed. It is found that no banded <b>ironstones</b> are known to be younger than 1000 million years. This fact is related to special conditions of atmosphere, surface temperature and biological development which existed during the so-called Primitive Period of the Precambrian, a period which lasted from approximately 3000 million years to 1000 million years ago. The banded <b>ironstones</b> of the Transvaal System are described in some detail and seven new chemical analyses as well as trace element data are given. The genesis of banded <b>ironstones</b> is discussed at some length and particular attention is paid to the authigenesis of riebeckite. It is concluded that banded <b>ironstones</b> were deposited in seasonally fluctuating, typically "non-aggressive", fresh to brackish water lakes which were fed by sluggish, mature rivers. The solutions of iron and silica, alkaline earths and clay colloids carried by these rivers were derived from basic igneous rocks by chemical weathering in a tropical, monsoon-type climate. Recognisable detrital material is virtually absent from the banded <b>ironstones</b> of the Transvaal System, but it is thought that the stilpnomelane layers are aeolian deposits and that their composition gives some indication of the material which remained behind as "lateritic" soils in the source area. It is suggested that both crocidolite and riebeckite were formed by the low temperature dehydration, in situ, of an ordered precursor which could have been a clay mineral similar in structure to attapulgite, but containing ferrous and ferric ions in the octahedral layer. This clay mineral acquired sodium by cation exchange during dry periods when the depositional lakes were enriched in sodium. It is found that the actual formation of crocidolite is completely unrelated to dynamic stress. It formed only where layers of proto-riebeckite were in close contact or traversed by magnetite layers. It grew by the diffusion of proto-riebeckite through the magnetite layers, its transformation to riebeckite during its passage, and final addition to fibre growth points in contact with the magnetite layer. This process was initiated by slight temperature gradients in the magnetite layers and was propagated by a type of thermal autocatalysis. The temperature gradients in the magnetite layers resulted from their superior heat conductivity combined with differences in depth of burial of the strata. Economic deposits of crocidolite formed where a sufficient number of layers of protoriebeckite were in contact with magnetite layers which maintained or repeatedly attained the requisite temperature levels. The superimposed economic deposits of the Kuruman area, which appear to be related to folding, are due to an early period of folding, possibly even slumping during deposition, which took place prior to the formation of crocidolite and caused the thickening of the protoriebeckite layers in the crests and troughs of folds by plastic flow from the flanks. Three appendices, giving details of chemical and spectrographic analyses and of chemical experiments carried out, are attached...|$|R

The invention of the hot blast furnace process in 1828 meant that Coatbridge's <b>ironstone</b> deposits could be exploited to the maximum by the canal link and hot blast process. The new advances meant that iron could be produced with two thirds less fuel. Summerlee Iron Works was one of the first iron works to use this technology.

5|$|The kerb-stones {{around the}} tomb display some patterning; {{those on the}} {{northern}} side are mostly rectilinear, while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape.
