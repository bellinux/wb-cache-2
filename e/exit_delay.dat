40|$|Mitotic {{catastrophe}} is {{the response}} of mammalian cells to mitotic DNA damage. It produces tetraploid cells {{with a range of}} different nuclear morphologies from binucleated to multimicronucleated. In response to DNA damage, checkpoints are activated to delay cell cycle progression and to coordinate repair. Cells in different cell cycle phases use different mechanisms to arrest their cell cycle progression. It has remained unclear whether the termination of mitosis in a mitotic catastrophe is regulated by DNA damage checkpoints. Here, we report the presence of a mitotic exit DNA damage checkpoint in mammalian cells. This checkpoint delays mitotic exit and prevents cytokinesis and, thereby, is responsible for mitotic catastrophe. The DNA damage-induced mitotic <b>exit</b> <b>delay</b> correlates with the inhibition of Cdh 1 activation and the attenuated degradation of cyclin B 1.

To improve the power efficiency, DRAM technology incorporates multiple power-down modes, each with different trade-offs between achievable power savings and performance impact due to entry and <b>exit</b> <b>delay</b> requirements. Accurate modeling of these low power modes and entry and exit control is crucial to analyze the tradeoffs across controller configurations and workloads with varied memory access characteristics. To address this, we integrate the power-down modes into the DRAM controller model in the opensource simulator gem 5. This is the first publicly available full-system simulator with DRAM power-down modes, providing the research community a tool for DRAM power analysis for a breadth of use cases. We validate the power-down functionality with sweep tests, which trigger defined memory access characteristics.

40|$|A {{trade-off}} {{exists between}} efficiently utilizing {{the capacity of}} railway networks and improving the reliability and punctuality of train operations. This dissertation presents a new analytical probability model based on blocking time theory which estimates the knock-on delays of trains caused by route conflicts and late transfer connections in stations. The model estimates the propagation of train delays with a higher accuracy than existing analytical models by {{taking into account the}} interdependences of the arrival and departure times of different train lines and the dependences of the dwell times of trains on arrival delays. A detailed statistical analysis of real-world traffic data reveals that the variations of train events and process times can be well approximated by either the lognormal distribution or the Weibull distribution. Given the mean and standard deviation of input delays at the boundary of a station and those of primary delays within the area, the knock-on and <b>exit</b> <b>delay</b> distributions are estimated by means of the stochastic models. Consequently, the maximal traffic capacity utilization of complex stations and interlocking areas can be estimated according to a desired level of train punctuality.

40|$|The current {{paradigm}} {{states that}} exit from mitosis is {{triggered by the}} ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) acting in concert with an activator called CDC 20. While this has been well established {{for a number of}} systems, the evidence of a critical role of CDC 20 in somatic cells is not unequivocal. In this study, we reexamined whether mitotic exit can occur properly after CDC 20 is depleted. Using single-cell analysis, we found that CDC 20 depletion with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) significantly impaired the degradation of APC/C substrates and delayed mitotic exit in various cancer cell lines. The recruitment of cyclin B 1 to the core APC/C was defective after CDC 20 downregulation. Nevertheless, CDC 20 -depleted cells were still able to complete mitosis, albeit requiring twice the normal time. Intriguingly, a high level of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK 1) -inhibitory phosphorylation was induced during mitotic exit in CDC 20 -depleted cells. The expression of an siRNA-resistant CDC 20 rescued both the mitotic <b>exit</b> <b>delay</b> and the CDK 1 -inhibitory phos-phorylation. Moreover, the expression of a nonphosphorylatable CDK 1 mutant or the downregulation of WEE 1 and MYT 1 abolished mitotic exit in CDC 20 -depleted cells. These findings indicate that, in the absence of sufficient APC/C activity, an alternative mechanism that utilized the classic inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK 1 could mediate mitotic exit.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveActivation of the Liver X Receptor (LXR) has {{recently}} {{been identified as a}} therapeutic strategy for osteoarthritis (OA). Human OA articular cartilage explants show decreased LXR expression, and LXRβ-null mice display OA-like symptoms. LXR agonist administration to OA articular cartilage explants suppresses proteoglycan degradation and restores LXR-activated transcription. We aimed to investigate the effect of LXR activation on chondrocyte differentiation to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind its protection against OA. MethodThe specific LXR agonist, GW 3965, was used to examine the effect of LXR activation on chondrocyte differentiation. Tibia organ cultures were used to examine the effect of LXR activation on bone growth and growth plate morphology, followed by immunohistochemical analysis. In ATDC 5 and micromass cultures, chondrocyte differentiation was examined through cellular staining and proliferation assays. Various chondrogenic markers were analyzed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in micromass RNA. ResultsChondrocyte hypertrophy was suppressed by GW 3965 treatment, as shown by decreased hypertrophic zone length in the tibial growth plate, decreased alkaline phosphatase staining in ATDC 5 and micromass cultures, and down regulation of Col 10 a 1, Mmp 13 and Runx 2 expression. Increased proliferation in treated ATDC 5 cells and up-regulation of Col 2 a 1 expression in treated micromass cultures suggest hypertrophy is suppressed secondary to prolonged proliferation. Decreased p 57 levels in treated growth plates suggest this to be due to cell-cycle <b>exit</b> <b>delay.</b> ConclusionOur findings regarding LXR's role in cartilage development provide insight into how LXR activation prevents cartilage breakdown, further solidifying its potential as a therapeutic target of OA...|$|E

Therefore, if the exit from mitosis is delayed, normal cells are usually removed by apoptosis. However, how failure to complete mitosis activates apoptosis is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a phosphorylated form of the BH 3 -only protein Bid regulates apoptosis if mitotic <b>exit</b> is <b>delayed.</b> Bid is phosphorylated on serine 66 as cells enter mitosis, and this phosphorylation is lost during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable version of Bid or a BH 3 -domain mutant were resistant to mitotic-arrest-induced apoptosis.

We also show that the DNA damage signaling kinase Chk 2 is required for damage induced metaphase and anaphase arrest, and that a functional GFP-Chk 2 fusion localizes to kinetochores and centrosomes through mitosis. In addition, in the absence of Chk 2, we find that DNA damage sufficient to fragment centromere DNA does not <b>delay</b> mitotic <b>exit.</b> We conclude that DNA damage signaling through Chk 2 triggers Mad 2 -dependent delays in mitotic progression, both before or after the metaphase-anaphase transition...|$|R

40|$|Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), {{the largest}} {{hospital}} in New England {{and a national}} leader in care delivery, teaching, and research, operates ten Intensive Care Units (ICUs), including the 20 -bed Ellison 4 Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU), a versatile unit which has {{a major role in}} perioperative and emergency care. 90 % of SICU patients are eventually transferred to another unit in the hospital. Frequent and sometimes lengthy non-clinical delays in this transfer process can be primarily attributed to congestion in downstream units. Multivariable regression analysis demonstrates that additional nonclinical SICU time yields negligible downstream time savings, while consuming an average of 2. 4 SICU beds per day, or 12 % of total SICU capacity. In addition to exacerbating the delays of patients requiring admission to the SICU, these non-clinical SICU <b>exit</b> <b>delays</b> are responsible for a yearly attributable annual cost in excess of $ 2. 5 M. Possible ameliorating approaches include prioritizing SICU transfers, or modifying the care of delayed SICU patients to begin preparing for discharge from the hospital. Any such choices affecting capacity and resource allocation in the ICU environment involve high cost as well as potentially high risks related to quality of care. To evaluate the impact of potential operational changes, the SICU and its six primary downstream units are modeled in a highly detailed discrete event simulation. Patients are divided into ~ 2, 700 procedural and diagnostic types. Entries (admissions) for each patient type are characterized as inhomogeneous Poisson processes, with lengths of stay drawn from probability distributions. Transfer practices and priorities are encoded in simulation logic. A simulation of twenty replication periods, each one year long, allows for calibration and validation by detailed comparison with historical data. Simulated average hourly census values are within 1 % of historical averages and RMSE is below 4 % for each of the five modeled areas, indicating high accuracy and low bias. The validated simulation is applied to evaluate the impact of several possible operational adjustments, including changes to discharge timing, transfer priorities, and resource allocation. Two approaches prove most promising: 1) Transferring patients as soon as possible after medical clearance, eliminating the current practice of waiting to see if other patients might need downstream beds. 2) Implementing a 24 - hour rolling medical clearance process in the SICU. These interventions are predicted to lower average and peak SICU utilization by ~ 6 %, cut SICU entrance delays by - 35 %, and decrease SICU <b>exit</b> <b>delays</b> by - 50 %, with relatively little impact on downstream floors and no additional capital expenditures. These relatively simple policy changes can save -$ 1 M in non-reimbursed expenditures while reducing overcrowding. If capital expenditures are approved, the simulation indicates that adding beds to downstream units would be more beneficial to the system than adding the same number of intensive care beds (at a much higher cost). Similar results are likely to be applicable to other ICUs at MGH, multiplying the potential impact of these findings several times over. by Benjamin A. Christensen. Thesis (M. B. A.)

After bi-orientation, chromosomes experience tension from spindle forces, which {{plays a key}} role in the stabilization of correct kinetochore-microtubule attachments. However, how end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments are first stabilized in the absence of tension remains a key unanswered question. To address this, we generated Drosophila S 2 cells undergoing mitosis with unreplicated genomes (SMUGs). SMUGs retained single condensed chromatids that attached laterally to spindle microtubules. Over time, laterally attached kinetochores converted into end-on attachments and experienced intra-kinetochore stretch/structural deformation, and SMUGs eventually <b>exited</b> a <b>delayed</b> mitosis with mono-oriented chromosomes after satisfying the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC). Polar ejection forces (PEFs) generated by Chromokinesins promoted the conversion from lateral to end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments that satisfied the SAC in SMUGs.

Here we test whether such a mechanism exists in intact human cells. Loss of separase blocked centriole disengagement during mitotic <b>exit</b> and <b>delayed</b> assembly of new centrioles during the following S phase; however, most engagements were eventually dissolved. We identified Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk 1) as a parallel activator of centriole disengagement. Timed inhibition of Plk 1 mapped its critical period of action to late G 2 or early M phase, i. e., prior to securin destruction and separase activation at anaphase onset. Crucially, when cells exited mitosis after downregulation of both separase and Plk 1, centriole disengagement failed completely, and subsequent centriole duplication in interphase was also blocked. Our results indicate that Plk 1 and separase act at different times during M phase to license centrosome duplication, reminiscent of their roles in removing cohesin from chromosomes...|$|R

The delayed-exit experiment was a separate experiment conducted on a sample of 3, 315 single parents in their first month of Income Assistance receipt {{in the metropolitan area}} of Vancouver, British Columbia. This sample was randomly assigned to program and control groups, where the program group was told that they would become eligible for the SSP program if they remained on Income Assistance for 12 months. The difference between the fraction remaining on Income Assistance in the program and control groups 12 months after random assignment is estimated by Ford et al.

The model predicts a delayed-exit effect of 4.3 percentage points in British Columbia, which is within one-third of one standard error of the effect estimated by Ford et al. (2003). The model is thus able to predict the magnitude of the experimental delayed-exit effect quite well. Comparing the model predictions with the experimental impacts, we can see that the model correctly predicts both the degree of <b>delayed</b> <b>exit</b> associated with the expectation of receiving the SSP benefit in the future (the entry effect) as well as the increased transition rate into employment that becoming eligible for the SSP program induces.|$|R
