50|$|If the {{generator}} {{is connected to}} a linear strictly resistive load, it will deliver power as soon as voltage is induced in {{the generator}}. With a non-linear load the relation is not so simple. The load is not linear due to the transmission system, whose diode rectifier results in power only {{being able to be}} extracted over certain voltage levels. Consequently, the DC voltage level limits the amplitude of the <b>generator</b> <b>phase</b> voltage. With a non-linear load the <b>generator</b> <b>phase</b> voltage will reach maximum amplitude which is approximately equal to the DC voltage. When the generator’s phase voltage reaches the level of the DC voltage current starts to flow (power is extracted) from the generator to the DC side of the rectifier. Power will be delivered as long as the waves can deliver mechanical power to the buoy {{and as long as the}} translator has not reached its upper or lower end stop. The current will increase when the speed of the translator increases. This non-linear power extraction results in different shapes of the voltages and the current pulses.|$|E

Among all the renewable energy sources, wind energy is clean and plentiful compared to nonrenewable energy sources like fossil fuels and cost-effective compared to other renewable energy sources such as nuclear. Therefore, the potential for wind energy is immense. Nowadays, wind farms are increasingly employed in power systems {{in order to meet}} the growing demand of energy as well as the growing environmental awareness. Grid integration of large capacity of wind energy requires, however, new approaches for system operation, control, dynamic enhancement and protection.

Such investigation is achieved through incorporating a large DFIG-based wind farm in a study system that inspired from an actual power system.

The prediction of 1 : 1 phase locking agreed qualitatively with the experimental observations, except in three hybrid circuits in which 1 : 1 locking was predicted but not observed. Correct predictions sometimes required consideration of the second order phase resetting, which measures the change in the timing of the second burst after the perturbation. The method was robust to offsets between the initiation of bursting in the presynaptic neuron and the activation of the synaptic coupling with the postsynaptic neuron.

These generator units are namely a field assisted switched reluctance generator (SRG) and a brushless dc (BLDC) generator. No permanent magnets {{are used in}} either unit. The field assisted SR generator consists of two magnetically dependent stator and rotor sets (layers), where each stator set includes twelve salient poles with windings wrapped around them, while the rotor comprises of eight salient poles without any winding or permanent magnet. There is a stationary reel, which has the field coil wrapped around it and is placed between the two-stator sets. The BLDC generator is also made up of two magnetically dependent stator and rotor sets, but each stator set includes nine salient poles with windings wrapped around them while, the rotor comprises of six salient poles without any windings or permanent magnets. There is also a stationary reel between the two layers to produce the magnetic field through the motor assembly.

40|$|Due to its simplicity, the {{discontinuous}} conduction mode boost rectifier is potentially {{the least expensive}} active line-harmonics reducing circuit. Problem statement: The line current however, shows considerable distortion when the peak input voltage {{is close to the}} output voltage, As a result, the input power factor is poor. This study proposes a simple, low-cost method to reduce the line harmonics. Approach: A periodic voltage signal was injected in the control circuit to vary the duty cycle of the boost switch within a line cycle so that the third-order harmonic of the input current is reduced and the THD is improved. The proposed technique eliminates the additional harmonic <b>generator,</b> <b>phase</b> detecting and phase-locking circuits, which was proposed in the literature. Instead we can utilize the bridge rectifier's output voltage of the boost converter to modulate the duty cycle of the boost switch. As a result, the injected signal is naturally synchronized with line current. In addition, to obtain nearly constant harmonic content over a wide range of load variation, a modulation index m is used to update the injected signal with a fraction of duty cycle which reflects the load changes. Results: The results proved that third-order harmonic, which was the Lowest Order Harmonic (LOH), can be attenuated by adjusting the modulation index of the injected signal. Moreover, the rectifier shows a good transient performance where the converter's output voltage overshoots during load and input voltage transients is reduced. Conclusions/Recommendations: The proposed circuit {{can be used as a}} front-end converter for DC/DC or DC/AC converters in order to improve the power factor of the input current.
