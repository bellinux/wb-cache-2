This leads us to conclude that rather than FI representing a repackaging of the book to market and small firm size effects as encountered in the FF- 3 F model, the impact of these factors in the FF- 3 F model is explained by their ability to differentiate on aggregate between over- and under- priced stocks...|$|E
40|$|Using stocks {{from the}} Russell 1000 Index from 1974 to 2010, this thesis conducts three studies in {{relation}} to the indexation technique known as fundamental indexation (FI). The first study advances mispricing as an explanation for FI’s outperformance over alternative benchmark indexation techniques, namely, capitalization-weighted indexation (CWI), equally weighted indexation (EWI), and price-weighted indexation (PWI). The second study investigates the effectiveness of FI {{in relation to}} the benchmark indexation techniques as a function of portfolio size (number of stocks). The third study develops a market volatility-based rebalancing strategy. More specifically, in this study, our market volatility-based rebalancing strategy responds only when the market enters a volatile cycle, unlike rebalancing on a calendar basis. We compare returns, risk, and risk-adjusted returns both before and after consideration of transaction costs. The results of the first study reveal how FI is {{able to take advantage of}} stock mispricing to outperform the alternative benchmark indexation techniques considered in this thesis. Specifically, we find that FI outperforms the alternative benchmark portfolios (i) when the portfolio stocks are tilted toward small-cap stocks and (ii) when the market is volatile. We confirm a close linkage between <b>FI</b> <b>portfolio</b> returns and the Fama–French three-factor model. We demonstrate that FI relies on value stocks to generate higher returns and on large stocks to reduce portfolio risks. Finally, we provide evidence that book to market and small firm size effects can be attributed to mispricing. Thus, controversially, rather than argue that FI represents a repackaging of value and size factors, we argue that these factors are at least partly the outcome of stock mispricing. The results of the second study reveal how the benefits of diversification as a function of the number of stocks are differentiated across the various indexation approaches adopted. Specifically, our findings determine how significantly lower idiosyncratic risk and higher risk-adjusted returns can be achieved by increasing portfolio size. While the majority of diversification benefits are acquired 8 with fewer than 200 stocks for EWI portfolios, additional stocks are required for the alternative non-EWI portfolios. CWI, PWI, and FI portfolios require 600, 300, and 400 stocks, respectively, to extract similar diversification benefits as EWI portfolios with 200 stocks. The results of our third study reveal that a market volatility-based rebalancing strategy as developed in this thesis allows FI portfolios to continue to outperform, with significantly lower turnover and subsequently lower transaction costs. Specifically, when return, risk, and transaction costs are assessed in combination, our market volatility-based rebalancing strategy significantly outperforms alternative calendar-based rebalancing strategies, including monthly rebalancing, quarterly rebalancing, and annual rebalancing strategies. We conclude that a market volatility-based rebalancing strategy has the potential to improve portfolio performance from a practical (transaction cost) perspective. As a whole, this thesis provides new insights on how to construct and manage index tracking funds based on FI, as well as on alternative indexation techniques. The first study presents the underlying foundations for FI’s success, as well as informs the fund manager about the optimal application of FI in regard to both (i) optimal stock characteristics and (ii) optimal market conditions. The second study informs the fund manager about the optimal number of stocks in the risk–return relation. The third study provides fund managers an alternative to traditional calendar portfolio rebalancing that is effective in reducing transaction costs without compromising on returns and risks...|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{portfolio}} of technologies by risk averse firms is analyzed. Two technologies with random marginal costs are available to produce a homogeneous good. If the risks associated to the technologies are correlated firms might invest in a technology with a negative expected return or conversely might not invest in a technology with a positive expected return. If the technology with the lower expected cost is more risky than the other technology this technology can be driven out of the <b>fi</b> rms' <b>portfolio</b> if risks are highly correlated. With imperfect competition the portfolios of firms are di fferent, and diff erence in risk aversion can explain a full specialization of the industry, the less risk averse fi rms using the low cost technology and the more risk averse fi rms the other one. The framework is used {{to discuss the issue}} of investment in electricity markets...|$|R
40|$|The optimal <b>fi</b> nancial {{investment}} (<b>Portfolio)</b> {{problem was}} investigated by leading fi nancial organiza-tions and scientists. The aim {{of these works}} was to defi ne the optimal diversifi cation of the assets depending on the acceptable risk level. The aim of the paper is to evaluate different investment strategies in the real and virtual fi nancial mar-kets. This aim is the new element of the proposed simulation system since optimization is performed {{in the space of}} investment strategies; both daily and long-term. A number of different investment strategies are presented, including the ones based on the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The simulated investment procedures include different prediction methods. The methods that mini-mize the mean absolute error (MAE) are added to the traditional ones that minimize the least squares error (MSE). The results of the virtual fi nancial market are compared with historical data. The model is designed as a tool to represent the behavior of an individual investor which wants to predict how the expected profi t depends on different investment strategies using different forecasting methods of real and virtual stocks...|$|R
