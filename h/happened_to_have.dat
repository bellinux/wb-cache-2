5|$|Æthelwulf's first Rochester coinage {{may have}} begun {{when he was still}} sub-king of Kent, under Egbert. A hoard of coins {{deposited}} at the beginning of Æthelwulf's reign in about 840, found in the Middle Temple in London, contained 22 coins from Rochester and two from Canterbury of the first issue of each mint. Some numismatists argue that the high proportion of Rochester coins means that the issue must have commenced before Egbert's death, but an alternative explanation is that whoever hoarded the coins simply <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> access to more Rochester coins. No coins were issued by Æthelwulf's sons during his reign.|$|E
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was filmed in various {{locations}} in Albuquerque and Portland. Among the areas filmed included the Rio Grande, junkyards, and near Mercer's home. The clip {{was directed by}} Lance Bangs, an associate of Spike Jonze. It features the band re-enacting the cover art of other bands' albums, including Zen Arcade and New Day Rising by Hüsker Dü, Let It Be by The Replacements, Moon Pix by Cat Power, Double Nickels on the Dime by The Minutemen, Squirrel Bait's first EP, Sonic Youth's Sister and Slint's Spiderland. Shooting in just two cities created logistical problems for album covers originally photographed {{in cities such as}} Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Louisville. For the homage to Double Nickels on the Dime, the band had to track down the exact model of the car featured on the album cover (a Volkswagen Beetle), and Albuquerque <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a San Pedro Street, which is featured on a freeway sign on the original cover.|$|E

Many Zoroastrians suggested a consolidation of the calendars: no consensus could be reached, though some took this opportunity to switch to the Fasli observance. Some priests objected on the grounds that if they were to switch, the religious implements they utilised would require re-consecration, at not insignificant expense.|$|E

25|$|In 1944, Dora {{was still}} working for the Duke {{when she came in}} contact with Opus Dei. Fr.

The Mother Superior of the Domestic Service Daughters recommended Dora, who <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some days off at the time.

However, Ford wanted a car that could compete with the Corvette and they <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a brand new engine which could be used in this endeavor: the Windsor 221 in³ (3.6 L) engine – a new lightweight, thin-wall cast small-block V8. Ford provided Shelby with two engines.|$|E
25|$|As a batsman, Agarkar {{is one of}} the {{few players}} who scored a Test century at Lords against England during India's tour to England in 2002 when he scored 109 not out. Although India lost the test, his batting skills were quite noticeable. He also holds the record of the fastest fifty in ODI's for India when he scored 67 not out in 25 balls at Rajkot against Zimbabwe in 2000. However, his batting {{exploits}} have been frequently overshadowed by seven consecutive instances of no scoring against Australia, five in Australia and two at home.

Dickson approved of Blackwell's career aspirations, and allowed her to use the medical books in his library to study. During this time, Blackwell soothed her own doubts about her choice and her loneliness with deep religious contemplation. She also renewed her antislavery interests– started a slave Sunday school that was not ultimately successful.|$|E
25|$|According to guitarist Paul Leary, he {{acquired}} the eventual cover image by chance while purchasing marijuana from an acquaintance in San Antonio, Texas. The image's photographer {{was at the}} acquaintance's residence for the same reason, and <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his portfolio with him. After a session of beer drinking and impromptu guitar playing, Leary accidentally caused some of the photographer's photos to fall on the floor. One of these pictures was a group shot depicting the young girl seen on Cream Corns cover, but surrounded by six older models. Leary commented that he liked it, the photographer gave him the photo and its reproduction rights, and the girl's picture was cropped, blown up, and used on the EP's U.S. cover.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the summer term at Meadowbank School for Girls, the most prestigious prep school in England, Miss Bulstrode, the popular but aging headmistress, has {{no reason to believe that}} the {{challenges}} facing her on parent's day will be more than the occasional irate or inebriated parent. She scarcely listens when Mrs Upjohn, a parent, who just <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> worked in military intelligence, looks out of the window and notices on the school campus someone whom she recognises and whose presence at the school apparently surprises but does not alarm her. Mrs Upjohn is still talking but the crucial moment has passed.

25|$|There were {{normally}} {{no special}} signs for indicating the higher divisions of modus and maximodus. However, groups of longa rests {{at the beginning}} of a piece (which occurred frequently, as often some voices in a polyphonic composition would enter later than others) could be used as an indicator of the intended meter. If longa rests were written across three staff spaces, they were perfect; moreover, if they occurred in groups of three written together on the same staff line they indicated perfect maximodus. Occasionally, if no voice <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a sufficiently long rest {{at the beginning of}} the piece, a dummy rest symbol of one maxima's worth of longae would be written to the left of the mensuration sign; in that case it was understood as part of the time signature and not actually executed as a rest.|$|E
25|$|With {{the color}} seasons, the show {{began to take}} on the lighthearted, {{whimsical}} tone of the Superman comic books of the 1950s. The villains were often caricatured, Runyonesque gangsters played with tongue in cheek. Violence on the show was toned down further. The only gunfire that occurred was aimed at Superman, and of course the bullets bounced off. Superman was less likely to engage in fisticuffs with the villains. On occasions when Superman did use physical force, he would take crooks out in a single karate-style chop or, if he <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> two criminals in hand, banging their heads together. More often than not, the villains were likely to knock themselves out fleeing Superman. Now very popular with viewers, Jimmy was being played as the show's comic foil to Superman. Many of these plots had Jimmy and Lois being captured, only to get rescued at the last minute by Superman.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no hint of}} any {{worship of}} Zurvan {{in any of the}} texts of the Avesta, even though the texts (as they exist today) are the result of a Sassanid era redaction. Zaehner proposes that this is because the {{individual}} Sassanid monarchs were not always Zurvanite and that Mazdean Zoroastrianism just <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the upper hand during the crucial period that the canon was finally written down (Zaehner, 1955:48; Duchesne-Guillemin, 1956:108). In the texts composed prior to the Sassanid period, Zurvan appears twice, as both an abstract concept and as a minor divinity, but {{there is no evidence of}} a cult. In Yasna72.10 Zurvan is invoked in the company of Space and Air (Vata-Vayu) and in Yasht13.56, the plants grow in the manner Time has ordained according to the will of Ahura Mazda and the Amesha Spentas. Two other references to Zurvan are also present in the Vendidad, but although these are late additions to the canon, they again do not establish any evidence of a cult. Zurvan does not appear in any listing of the Yazatas (Dhalla, 1932).|$|E

25|$|In the Solar System both Jupiter and Saturn were {{probably}} crucial in perturbing comets {{into the inner}} Solar System. Here, the comets provided the inner planets with their own source of water and various other ices. In the Alpha Centauri system, Proxima Centauri may have influenced the planetary disk as the Alpha Centauri system was forming, enriching the area around Alpha Centauri A and B with volatile materials. This would be discounted if, for example, Alpha CentauriB <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gas giants orbiting Alpha CentauriA (or conversely, Alpha CentauriA for Alpha CentauriB), or if the stars B and A themselves were able to perturb comets into each other's inner system as Jupiter and Saturn presumably {{have done in the}} Solar System. Such icy bodies probably also reside in Oort clouds of other planetary systems, when they are influenced gravitationally by either the gas giants or disruptions by passing nearby stars many of these icy bodies then travel starwards. There is no direct evidence yet of the existence of such an Oort cloud around Alpha CentauriAB, and theoretically this may have been totally destroyed during the system's formation.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} five seasons, the Broncos played their matches at the 32,500 {{capacity}} Lang Park, the ground {{considered to be}} the home of rugby league in Queensland. However, following ongoing conflict with the Queensland Rugby League and Lang Park Trust due to a sponsorship conflict with the QRL having a commercial agreement with Castlemaine XXXX brewery with prominent signs around the ground, while the Broncos were sponsored by rival brewery Powers who were not permitted any permanent signs (the Broncos initially got around this by not using the change rooms at half time during games, instead sitting on the ground with a temporary protective banner surrounding them which just <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> prominent Powers logos), the team relocated to the 60,000 capacity ANZ Stadium in 1993 (ANZ had been the main stadium of the 1982 Commonwealth Games). The club's home match attendance, which had averaged 19,637 at Lang Park, increased to 43,200 at the new ground in the first season following the club's first premiership title in the previous season. However, despite the team's second premiership in 1993, crowds gradually declined and it was not until 2002 that the club again registered more than the 1996 average attendance of 23,712. ANZ Stadium, as the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre was called at the time due to sponsorship rights, was featured on an episode of The Mole in April 2002.|$|E
25|$|The {{mainstream}} Nazi anti-Semitism {{considered the}} Jewry being {{a group of}} people bound by close, so-called genetic (blood) ties, to form a unit, which one could not join or secede from. The influence of Jews was declared to have detrimental impact on Germany, to rectify the discriminations and persecutions of Jews. To be spared from that, one had to prove one's affiliation with the group of the so-called Aryan race. Paradoxical was, that never genetic tests or outward allegedly racial features in one's physiognomy determined one's affiliation, although the Nazis palavered a lot about physiognomy, but only the records of religious affiliations of one's grandparents decided. However, while the grandparents were earlier still able to choose their religion, their grandchildren in the Nazi era were compulsorily categorised as Jews, if three or four grandparents were enrolled as members of a Jewish congregation. This Nazi categorisation as Jews of course included mostly Jews of Jewish descent, but also many Gentiles of Jewish descent, such as Catholics, irreligionists, and Protestants, who <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had grandparents belonging– according to the records– to a Jewish congregation. While Jewish congregations in Germany tried– little as they were allowed– to help their persecuted members, the Protestant church bodies ignored their parishioners who were classified as Jews (according to the Nuremberg Laws), and the somewhat less persecuted Mischlinge of partially Jewish descent.|$|E
