A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> has been used in human risk assessment, but previous in vivo validation was conducted only in rats. Controlled human exposures to <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> were conducted to provide validation data for the application of the model in humans. Five volunteers were exposed to 1, 5, and 10 ppm 13 C 1, 13 C 2 <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> via inhalation. A probe inserted into the nasopharyngeal region sampled both 13 C 1, 13 C 2 <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and the major metabolite 13 C 1, 13 C 2 acetaldehyde during rest and light exercise. Nasopharyngeal air concentrations were analyzed in real time by ion trap mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Experimental concentrations of both <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and acetaldehyde were then compared to predicted concentrations calculated from the pre-viously published humanmodel. Model predictions of <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> nasal extraction compared favorably with measured values of <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> as did predictions of nasopharyngeal acetaldehyde when compared to measured acetaldehyde. The results showed that the current PBPKmodel structure and parameterization are appropri-ate for <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> These analyses were conducted from 1 to 10 ppm <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> a range relevant to workplace exposure stan-dards but which would not be expected to saturate <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> metabolism.

30|$|Ethylene–vinyl acetate {{copolymers}} (EVA) are widespread materials, with hot-melt adhesives {{and plastic}} wraps being common applications [54]. Although free-radical copolymerizations usually produce gradient or block polymers, perfectly random copolymers are {{obtained from the}} polymerization of ethylene and <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> due to similar reactivities [55]. However, undesired and random branching is inherently promoted via a back-biting process, significantly altering the characteristics and performance of the copolymers.

A number of monomers with various methylene run lengths ranging from 8 to 12 were subjected to polymerization and subsequent hydrogenation, furnishing copolymers with different <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> contents (acetate branches separated by 18 – 26 carbons).

The first technique has been widely used in order to synthesise polymers and oligomers with solvent derived endgroups. In this work polymers have been synthesised using isopropanol, 2 -isopropoxy ethanol and 3 -methyl- 2 -butanone as solvents. All of these {{have been shown to}} be active as chain transfer agents in previous studies. The second technique builds on previous work, performed in the field of enzymatic control of polymerisation reactions. Enzymes can be used to both synthesise monomers and catalyse the polymerisation of monomers. Hydroxy terminated poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> was used to control the polymerisation of 6 - caprolactone, leading to the formation of block copolymers. The third technique involves the synthesis of hyperbranched poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> and poly (n-vinyl pyrrolidinone).
