500|$|An {{aspect of}} Abbas Kiarostami's artistry that eludes those {{unfamiliar}} with Persian poetry {{and that has}} therefore remained inaccessible to many <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> turns poetic images into cinematic ones. This is most obvious in those Kiarostami films that recall specific texts of Persian poetry more or less explicitly: Where's the Friend's Home? and The Wind will Carry Us. The characters recite poems mainly from classical Persian poet Omar Khayyám or modern Persian poets Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad. One of the most poetic moments in Wind Will Carry Us is a long shot of a wheat field with rippling golden crops through which the doctor, accompanied by the filmmaker, is riding his scooter down a twisting road. In response to his comment that the other world is a better place than this one, the doctor recites this poem of Khayyam: ...|$|E
500|$|After {{news of his}} mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might {{attempt to}} escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, has him locked in the prison {{punishment}} box. After being released from the box, receiving word that his mother's burial is completed and being told to forget about her, Luke is determined to escape. Under {{the cover of a}} Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is later recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but not before one of the bloodhounds sent after him dies from strain caused by struggling through barbed-wire fences. After his capture and return, the Captain has Luke fitted with leg-irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, explaining, [...] "What we've got here is failure to communicate.

500|$|Rhys' mother, Elaine (Sancia Robinson), was {{introduced}} in November 2011. Barber revealed in his interview with Kilkelly that their backstory would be explored and stated that it would explain [...] "a lot more about why Rhys <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> is". He added {{that there would be}} [...] "a big revelation" [...] about Elaine coming up. Elaine suffers from a degenerative spinal condition and has to use a wheelchair. Rhys was forced to care for her when his father ran out on them both. Rhys tries to keep his life on Ramsay Street separate from his family, so when Elaine asks him if she can spend Easter with him, he makes up excuses as to why she cannot visit him. Barber revealed to an Inside Soap writer that Elaine realises Rhys is lying to her and she starts to wonder if he is ashamed to be seen with her. Rhys' actions when his housemates arrive appear to confirm his mother's suspicions. While they wonder who Elaine is, he makes up an excuse. Barber explained [...] "Rhys pretends he's visiting one of his patients. Elaine is really hurt and embarrassed when he comes out with that. He realises, and feels terrible." ...|$|E
500|$|A loose story arc that {{informed}} the Doctor's characterisation during the 2005 series is his feelings regarding {{the destruction of}} his own race, the Time Lords, which occurred offscreen before episode one. Eccleston felt that the episode [...] "Dalek" [...] showed the audience why his Doctor <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> is and [...] "how he feels about his past". Russell T Davies remarked that the Ninth Doctor carries a lot of survival guilt; this is why he [...] "strides through the universe wearing a dark leather jacket saying [...] "Don't touch me"". Davies felt that [...] "Dalek" [...] provided a [...] "bit of therapy" [...] and after this he [...] "starts to rebuild himself". In the episode [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] the Doctor sacrifices his ninth life to save Rose. Davies {{felt it was important}} to take the Doctor away from mythological off stage concepts such as the Time War and provide a conclusion that focused on the relationship between the character and Rose. John Barrowman, who played Captain Jack, felt that the Doctor's decision to save Rose enabled a catharsis; as he sacrifices himself to save her he is [...] "letting go of the burden of the Time Lords being destroyed".|$|E
500|$|The Smiths {{involved}} themselves {{heavily in}} local affairs. Jock chaired the village management board and commanded the Selukwe Company of the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers; he {{also became a}} founder member of the Selukwe Freemasons' Lodge and President of the town's football and rugby clubs. Agnes, who became informally known as [...] "Mrs Jock", established and ran the Selukwe Women's Institute. Both won the MBE (at different times) for their services to the community. [...] "My parents strove to instil principles and moral virtues, the {{sense of right and}} wrong, of integrity, in their children," [...] Ian Smith wrote in his memoirs. [...] "They set wonderful examples to live up to." [...] He considered his father [...] "a man of extremely strong principles"—"one of the fairest men I have ever met and that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> brought me up. He always told me that we're entitled to our half of the country and the blacks are entitled to theirs." [...] Raised on the frontier of the British Empire in the UK's youngest settler colony, Smith and his generation of white Rhodesians grew up with a reputation for being [...] "more British than the British", something in which they took great pride.|$|E

500|$|Speer {{managed to}} reach a {{relatively}} safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time. Speer stated at Nuremberg, [...] "I {{felt that it was}} my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again." [...] Speer visited the Führerbunker on April22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of Inside the Third Reich, Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, [...] "Psychologically, it is possible that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> remembered the occasion, because it was how {{he would have liked to}} behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. But the fact is that none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself." [...] Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, Rahul Dravid {{has been}} given {{a lot of credit for}} the way Rahane has matured as a player. With Dravid guiding him, Rahane has {{transformed}} from a shy, long-format specialist into a player capable of batting at any position, in any format. Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar told NDTV, [...] "What has been impressive about Rahane's career <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> has made those little changes that have helped him to get better in every format of the game. This batsman is a thinking batsman, who keeps thinking about how to get better and that is why he is such a vital cog in the Rajasthan Royals team and a vital cog in the Indian cricket team." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Pitchforks Brent DiCrescenzo panned the album's lyrics as [...] "overly melodramatic". John Aizlewood of Q {{felt that it}} is [...] "let down by Reznor's refusal to trouble himself with melody and by some embarrassing lyrics". NMEs Victoria Segal panned its music as [...] "background" [...] and accused it of [...] "chas 'crossover'", with [...] "grey rock sleet masquerading as a storm beneath a haze of 'experimental' textures." [...] Scott Seward of The Village Voice facetiously commended Reznor for [...] "once again ... pioneering the marriage of heavy guitars, moody atmospherics, electronic drones and beats, and aggressive singing. Just like Killing Joke 20 years ago." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was even less receptive, writing that [...] "Reznor delivers double-, every second remixed till it glistens like broken glass on a prison wall. <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> takes his petty pain out on the world a little, er, immature for a guy who's pushing 35? Never mind, I'm told—just immerse in the music".|$|E

2500|$|The Tony-Award-winning [...] (1988/'96) and The Green Bird (1999), {{based on}} a story by Carlo Gozzi, {{are a few of}} the composer's theatre works. In 2006, Goldenthal {{completed}} his original three-act opera with Taymor entitled Grendel an adaptation of the John Gardner novel of the same name which told the story of Beowulf from the monster Grendel's point of view. It had its world premiere in early June 2006 at the Los Angeles Opera, the role of Grendel performed by Eric Owens, with an audience that included John Williams and Emmy Rossum; the opus was added to the Los Angeles Opera's permanent repertoire and earned Goldenthal a nomination in April 2007 for the Pulitzer Prize for Music. In 2008 Goldenthal reunited with Michael Mann to score 1930s gangster movie Public Enemies and in 2009 he scored another Julie Taymor Shakespeare adaptation, The Tempest. He cites Japanese composer Tōru Takemitsu as an influence and someone he styles his own career on; Goldenthal has said that the lines between traditional concert music and orchestral film score have become more blurred which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> thinks it should be. He has also collaborated four times with Irish director Neil Jordan, scoring movies like Interview with the Vampire and In Dreams.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the persons}} who knew Escrivá best was the Bishop of Madrid, where Opus Dei was initiated, Bishop Leopoldo Eijo y Garay, for Escrivá would visit and report to him quite {{frequently}} and the two established a very strong friendship. In a 1943 report to Rome, the bishop stated: [...] "The distinctive notes of his character are his energy and his capacity for organization and government; with an ability to pass unnoticed. He has shown himself most obedient to the Church hierarchy -- one very special hallmark of his priestly work <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> fosters, in speech and in writing, in public and in private, love for Holy Mother Church and for the Roman Pontiff." [...] Bishop Eijo y Garay wrote to the Jesuit Provincial of Toledo, Carlos Gomez Martinho, S.J. during 1941: [...] "Fr. Escrivá is an exemplary priest, chosen by God for apostolic enterprises; humble, prudent, self-sacrificing in work, docile to his bishop, of outstanding intelligence and with a very solid spiritual and doctrinal formation." [...] Eijo y Garay told {{an officer of the}} Falange that [...] "o think that Fr. Josemaría Escrivá is capable of creating anything secret is absurd. He is as frank and open as a child!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Rand {{argued that}} {{the primary focus of}} man's free will is in the choice: 'to think or not to think'. [...] "Thinking is not an {{automatic}} function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free to think or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focused awareness. The act of focusing one's consciousness is volitional. Man can focus his mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he can unfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to any chance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirected sensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational connections it might happen to make." [...] According to Rand, therefore, possessing free will, human beings must choose their values: one does not automatically hold one's own life as his ultimate value. Whether in fact a person's actions promote and fulfill his own life or not is a question of fact, as it is with all other organisms, but whether a person will act to promote his well-being is up to him, not hard-wired into his physiology. [...] "Man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> has acted through most of his history." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{walked home}} with {{the air of a}} conqueror, and thought exultingly that the two {{thousand}} pounds were his. It was a deal after his own heart, and not the least satisfactory part about it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had got <b>the</b> better of Wiggett.|$|R
2500|$|During a {{televised}} joint interview {{prior to their}} second bout in 1974, Ali continued to insult Frazier, who took exception to Ali calling him [...] "ignorant" [...] and challenged him to a fight, {{which resulted in the}} two of them brawling on the studio floor. Ali {{went on to win the}} 12 round non-title affair by a decision. Ali took things further in the build-up to their last fight, The Thrilla in Manila, and called Frazier [...] "the other type of negro" [...] and [...] "ugly", [...] "dumb" [...] and a [...] "gorilla" [...] At one point he sparred with a man in a gorilla suit and pounded on a rubber gorilla doll, saying [...] "This is Joe Frazier's conscience... I keep it everywhere I go. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> looks when you hit him." [...] According to the fight's promoter Don King, this enraged Frazier, who took it as a [...] "character assassination" [...] and [...] "personal invective". One night before the fight, Ali waved around a toy pistol outside Frazier's hotel room. When Frazier came to the balcony, he pointed the gun at Frazier and yelled [...] "I am going to shoot you." [...] After the fight, Ali summoned Frazier's son Marvis into his dressing room, and told him that he had not meant what he had said about his father. When informed of this by Marvis, Frazier responded: [...] "you ain't me, son. Why isn't he apologizing to me?" ...|$|E
