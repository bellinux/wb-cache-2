5|$|NY324 {{remained}} unchanged until January 1, 1962, when the overlap with NY384 was removed. Although the overlap {{with the new}} I-190 on the North Grand Island Bridge was also removed from maps during the same period, {{and is no longer}} signed, this overlap was never officially removed from either NYSDOT's description of the route or the annual NYSDOT Traffic <b>Data</b> <b>Report.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since 2005, {{the traffic}} counts {{contained}} within the annual New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) Traffic <b>Data</b> <b>Report</b> have indicated that the northern terminus of NY101 is at an intersection with Beacon Hill Road. However, other documents produced by NYSDOT, such as their official description of routes in New York, give the highway's northern terminus as Astors Lane.|$|E

50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>reporting</b> is {{the process}} of {{collecting}} and submitting data to authorities entrusted with compiling statistics.

When <b>data</b> is not <b>reported,</b> the problem is known as underreporting; the opposite problem leads to false positives.|$|R

25|$|The {{northern}} terminus of I-787 is unclear. Appendix E of the 2008 New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) Traffic <b>Data</b> <b>Report</b> {{places the}} terminus at 8th Street in Troy, creating an overlap with NY7 across the Hudson River via the Collar City Bridge. Additionally, there are shields for I-787 on the Collar City Bridge {{east of the}} Hudson River. Other sources, including the National Highway System map of Albany published by the Federal Highway Administration and NYSDOT's official description of signed routes in New York State, identifies the terminus as the NY7/ NY787 interchange near Green Island. Contemporary maps of the Albany area also lack I-787 shields on the Collar City Bridge, signing the roadway only as NY7.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, he {{was part}} of a group that stormed the Fifth International AIDS Conference in Montreal, at the time a members-only event for doctors and HIV/AIDS researchers. They took over seats {{reserved}} for dignitaries, and released their first Treatment and <b>Data</b> <b>report</b> calling for speedier access to AIDS drugs, although coverage of the demonstration was overshadowed by the events at Tiananmen Square. The next year, Staley was a featured speaker at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS in 1990, held in San Francisco. Staley would be involved in many more demonstrations and protests, ultimately being arrested 10 times, although he does not have a criminal record due to the work of pro bono lawyers.|$|E
