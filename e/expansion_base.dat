40|$|In 1964 the Army was {{substantially}} reorganised (with the scrapping of the Pentropic organisation) and {{a selective}} form of national service was introduced. Those eligible for conscription (males turning 20 years of age) were 'balloted' {{on the basis}} of their birthdays and could elect either two years service in the Australian Regular Army (ARA) - subsequently reduced to 18 months - followed by three years in the regular reserve, or six years service in the CMF (subsequently reduced to five years). Those who opted for the alternative of CMF service had to do so before their national service 'ballot' occurred - which meant that they had to have enlisted and be serving in a CMF unit before their 'ballot' took place. It also meant that they had to continue serving for the full six (or five) year period of their original enlistment, irrespective of whether their 'number' came up for conscription when their 'ballot' was held. When Australia committed troops to Vietnam in 1965 the national service legislation was amended to make conscripts into the ARA eligible for overseas service - but CMF 'optees' were not placed under the same obligation. The government's clear policy (as reiterated by Malcolm Fraser, the then Minister of the Army, in 1966) was that the CMF existed to provide a back-up in case of defence emergency and an <b>expansion</b> <b>base</b> for major war. The Defence Act prevented the deployment of CMF troops except 'in defence of Australia' so they could not be and would not be committed to Vietnam. The CMF alternative to conscripted service in Vietnam resulted in increased enlistment and in 1968 CMF manning throughout Australia peaked at 36, 000. That, however, did little for the CMF either in effectiveness or status. Many 'optees' had no real interest in military service and, therefore, did only the minimum training required of them. Further, as well as sharing the general unpopularity of the Army both in the latter years and in the immediate aftermath of the Vietnam War, the CMF also came to be perceived as a haven for those who only wanted to avoid conscription and possible war service. Consequently, as Australia's commitment to Vietnam wound down (from 1970 to 1972) and especially when the newly-elected Whitlam government suspended national service and abolished conscription in December 1972 - and announced that serving national servicemen and CMF 'optees' could seek immediate discharge, there was a significant drop-off in CMF numbers. By early 1974 the CMF had a posted strength of fewer than 20, 000 - less than one-third of its authorised establishment of 60, 000 - the result of both post-national service discharges and a sharp decline in new recruits. ...|$|E
40|$|China {{has become}} one of the most popular foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) destinations since 1980 s, and its automotive industry always an attractive playing field for the global automakers. As there was a gap in the passenger car market in before the 1980 s, all the domestic manufacturers mainly at that time only produced trucks and buses for transportation, tractors for agriculture, and jeeps for military. Thus, the entry seems very necessary to supply this gap in the market; the early entry will help them to win the first move advantage. For European and U. S. automakers, the entry into China has become part of their global strategy. They strive to build up a business base in the Far East that will limit the dominance of Japanese firms. From a global strategy point of view, the step of entry into China seems very necessary; however, Chinas unstable institutional environment and different kinds of regulation limit the speed of entry. What the Chinese government wants to achieve through publishing the regulations to foreign funds, is to foster its own automotive industry and is not interested in turning China into an <b>expansion</b> <b>base</b> for European, American and Japanese auto industries. Simply, the government does not want to lose the control on this pillar industry while it opens to the world. Till the mid- 1990 s, the auto industry was still highly protected in China; high tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, screening, foreign equity limits and local content requirements are several common obstacles to the entry of foreigners. In the past, many researchers have studied the policies in Chinas automotive industry, but most of them mainly focus on two questions: 6 how does the protection environment in the auto industry affect the utility of domestic consumer by limiting their access to the cheaper import car?; and, how does the protected environment limit the development of the industry? Most of articles argued that the policy environment in China provides too much protection and is not good for the growth of domestic manufacturers. However, there are few studies focused on the foreign perspective; this paper would change the angle from the domestic side to foreign side. This paper looks to explore the link between policy regulations and entry model selection. In order to analyse this link, two famous joint ventures in the China automotive industry has been selected for study, the Shanghai Volkswagen and Guangzhou Peugeot. In the case, three dimensions about the entry strategy of these two companies will be analyzed. Finally, this paper is going to answer the question of whether the regulation is the main factor affect foreigners entry model selection and whether the limited availability of the entry model would be the important factor that affects the performance of joint ventures. In this paper, there are four main sections: Literature review, Methodology, Research analysis, and Conclusion. In the literature review section (Chapter 2), all the related theories and models about the entry model selection and entry strategies will be presented. The methodology (Chapter 3) will explain the research method of this research applied, the way to access the data, and the limitation of this research as well. Research analysis is a large section. All economic factors and regulations related to how foreign funds get in Chinas automotive industry will be analyzed in Chapter 4. The case studies of Shanghai Volkswagen and Guangzhou Peugeot will be shown in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 respectively; the three dimensions of entry strategy of each joint venture: partner selection, control over alliance, 7 and conflict management will be fully analyzed here. Finally, this paper is going to present some implications through the comparison of Shanghai Volkswagen and Guangzhou Peugeot cases, and end with a conclusion: Regulation and Policy, in some degree, limit the number of available entry model choices to the foreigner, but any limitation on the entry model selection should not fully be responsible to the performance of the foreign funds in this industry. By implementing and designing a right entry strategy based on the assumption of limit entry model choice, the foreign funds can still perform very well...|$|E

40|$|Tez (Yüksek Lisans) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2014 Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Akış temelde komşu akışkan parçacıklarının hareketi ile birbirlerinden uzağa ve yakına giderek uzama, birbiri üzerinden ve yakınından geçerek kesme, şeklinde iki türde gerçekleşir. Akış ve bu davranışı sergileyen akışkanı irdeleyen akışkanlar mekaniği, akışkan statiğini ve dinamiğini bütünlemesine inceleyerek hava hareketlerinin sebep olduğu iklimsel durumları, ulaşım araçlarının tasarımını, özel olarak tasarlanan yapıları, hidrolik özellikte makineleri, canlılara ait çoğu sayılamayacak sıvı ve gazlar ile ilgili mühendislik uygulamalarını kapsar. Akışkanlar mekaniği açısından bütün maddeler katı ve akışkan olmaları bakımından iki halde bulunmaktadırlar. Teknik açıdan bakıldığında bu iki hal arasındaki farklılık kesme gerilmesi veya teğetsel gerilme karşısında sergiledikleri tepkilerle belirlenebilmektedir. Katıya uygulanmakta olan kayma gerilmesi düşünüldüğünde bir nebze şekil değişimi ile karşılaşılır. Oysa akışkana bir gerilme uygulandığı takdirde harekete geçme ve şekil değişimi gözlenir. Newtonyen akışkanlar viskoziteyi oluşturan kesme gerilimi ile kesme hızı oranının doğrusal olduğu, Newtonyen olmayan akışkanlar ise sıfır ya da doğrusal olmadığı akışkan türüdür. Newtonyen olmayan durumda viskozite belirli bir sıcaklık ve basınç değerinde sabit olmazken akışkanın kesme hızı, akış geometrisi ve akışkan elemanının kinematik geçmişine bağlı olur. Maddenin akış özelliklerini inceleyen Reoloji, Newtonyen olmayan akışkanları sınıflandırmıştır. Newtonyen olmayan akışkanların davranışlarını ifade etmek üzere birçok model oluşturulmuştur. Bu modellerden biri olan ve birçok çalışmada kullanılan Newtonyen olmayan ve viskoziteyi hız değişiminin üssel bir ifadesi olarak ele alan Power-law modelidir. Power-law akış modelinde Newtonyen olmayan problemler içinde düşen film akışıyla alakalı çalışmalar da mevcuttur. İlk çalışmalar daha çok deneysel olarak ilerlerken, düşen film akış hidrodinamiği ile ilgili Power-law akış modelinde çalışmalar yapmıştır. Power-law modeline uyan tipte film akışlarıyla alakalı yer çekimi etkisindeki durumlar için {{integral}} metodu ve benzerlik çözümleri kullanılarak yapılan çalışmalar da mevcuttur. Bu çalışmada Power-law modeline uygun Newtonyen olmayan film tipi akış için süreklilik, momentum, enerji denklemleri ile sınır koşulları verilmiştir. Yeni tanımlanan benzerlik yaklaşımıyla denklemler boyutsuz hale getirilmiştir. Az grid ile kısa zamanda yeterli hassasiyette doğru sonuç verebilen yöntemler den biri olan DQ (Differential Quadrature) ile doğrusal olan ya da olmayan adi veya kısmi diferansiyel denklemlerin cebirsel denklemlere dönüştürülmesiyle daha basit şekilde çözüm arayan DT (Differential Transform) yöntemine çalışmada yer verilmiştir. Sınır şartlarına uygun olarak çözülen denklemler kaynak çalışma ile kıyaslanmış ve sonuçlar yorumlanmıştır. Basically, {{the fluid}} particles {{move away from}} each other or come closer to each other. It is called elongating. Additionally they can move above the other or pass by each other so shear occurs. The study of fluids either in motion (fluid dynamics) or at rest (fluid statics) defines fluid mechanics. Both liquid and gas are capable of flowing freely so they are fluids because they can be made to move or flow. Lots of different fields can be thought which are releated to fluid mechanics such as blood flow, swimming, pumps, fans, turbines, airplanes, ships, rivers, windmills, pipes, engines, filters, jets etc. Almost everything on this planet is a fluid or moves near or within a fluid. All matter have two states from the view of fluid mechanics as solid and fluid. The obvious difference between solid and fluid lies with their reaction to an applied tangential or shear stress. While any shear stress, no matter how small, applied to fluid a motion happens, a solid resists by a static deflection under the effect of shear stress. The fluid deformation and motion do not stop until the stress is stop. Viscous-flow theory was unexploited, since Newtonian viscous terms had been added by Navier (1785 – 1836) and Stokes (1819 – 1903) to the equations of motion successfully. For arbitrary flows the resulting Navier-Stokes equations were too difficult to analyze. In 1904, a very important paper was written by a German engineer, Ludwig Prandtl (1875 – 1953). He stated that fluid flows which have small viscosity can be divided into a thin viscous or boundary layer, near solid surfaces and interfaces, closed to the nearly inviscid outer layer, so the Euler and Bernoulli equations could be used. In modern flow analysis, boundary-layer theory, supplying better understanding about many flow phenomena, was a very important tool. Many different texts were written about boundary-layer theory. Rheology is the study of deformation and flow of fluids in response to stress. As mentioned before fluids include both gases and liquids. If the stress versus strain rate curve is linear and passes through the origin, then the fluid is Newtonian fluid. A non-Newtonian fluid is a fluid, not obeying Newton’s law of viscosity, whose flow properties differ in any way from those of Newtonian fluids. Therefore, shear stress cannot be defined as a linear function of the shear rate, or shear stress versus shear rate does not pass through the origin. The apparent viscosity, defined as shear stress divided by shear rate, depends on flow geometry shear rate, kinematics of fluid element etc. It is not constant at a given temperature and pressure. There has been an immense amount of study performed on Non-Newtonian power-law fluids. While the first studies were carried out experimentally, numerical calculation techniques for non-Newtonian fluid flow have been also studied. Hydrodynamics of falling film flow of power law fluids was reviewed. Similarity analysis and integral method approach have been applied in the theoretical studies of the hydrodynamics of gravity-driven power-law films. The accelerating film flow was divided into three regions as the boundary layer region, the fully viscous region, and the developed flow region by applying similarity transformations. In this research, the objective is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the behavior of a gravity-driven non-Newtonian Power-law film flow on an inclined plane. For this project, first, power law non-Newtonian fluids characteristics are introduced and then the equations of motion are driven. Moreover, by applying the new similarity approach, the equations are nondimensionalized. Then, the boundary conditions have been changed to solve the new equations. In order to solve these partial differential equations previous researchers have used numerical method, a standard shooting technique based on classical 4 th-order Runge–Kutta integration, in combination with a Newton iteration procedure. Also they have written the partial equations as a system of first order differential equations and solved again adopting the shooting method means of fifth-order Runge–Kutta integration which utilize variable grid spacing. After that a Newton iteration procedure has been applied to satisfy the boundary conditions. In this research, to solve the equations of the problem two different methods have been investigated. Differential quadrature method was developed to provide solutions to differential equations of any systems. Then, for boundary or initial value conditions for engineering problems DQM became an alternative approach to the standard methods like finite elements or finite difference. The main point in DQM is, the partial derivative of a function on a discrete point respect to a variable can be approximated as a weighted linear sum of unknown function values at specific region which contains all discrete points of this variable. The most important part is to define the weighted coefficients. The method varies according to the function which is chosen for calculation of weight coefficients. The function is approximated by a (n- 1) th degree polynomial in Polynomial Differential Quadrature (PDQ), a Fourier series expansion in the Fourier <b>Expansion</b> <b>Base</b> Differential Quadrature (FDQ), employing harmonic functions named the Harmonic Differential Quadrature (HDQ). DQM performance is dependent on not only the sampling grid points but also boundary conditions. Without restricting the choice of grid meshes to find simple algebraic expressions for the weighting coefficients, the Generalized Differential Quadrature Method (GDQM) has also been developed. Moreover, in the previous researches, it can be seen that proper grid points and weighting coefficients effect the results. In the problems having linear equations and homogenous boundary conditions, for solution, equal grids are adequate. Grid points through the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto method is appropriate for vibration problems. For the problem in this research a nonuniform mesh like in Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto method have been thought. But the boundary of variables are on one side so the density of grid points had to be high near only the boundary. Therefore, it has been necessary to define new grid types which dense near only the boundary conditions. For this purpose two different grid types have been formulated. The differential transform method (DTM) is an efficient technique, having a considerable accuracy and easiness, for solving differential equations. The concept of DTM was first introduced in 1980 s. It applied to electrical circuit analysis solving not only linear but also non-linear initial value problems. At a point in terms of known and unknown boundary conditions, the differential transform method gives exact values of the nth derivative of an analytical function. DTM constructs an analytical solution in a polynomial form for differential equations. Differential transform is a simulation method, depending on on Taylor Series expansion, contrary to higher order Taylor series, this method does not need the symbolic calculation of derivatives. For large orders The Taylor series method is computationally taken long time. Obtaining analytical Taylor series solutions of differential equations by iteration, desired results can be found with great accuracy. The nondimensionalized equations for the problem in tihs work are solved by using Generalized Differential Quadrature Method and results are compared with the reference work. Also Differential transform method results are obtained for the problem and compared with GDQM results. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
