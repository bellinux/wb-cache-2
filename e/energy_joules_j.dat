It is difficult to compare the cost of gasoline with other fuels if they are sold in different units. GGE solves this.

40|$|ICD) {{implantation}} is {{a common}} approach in patients {{at high risk of}} sudden cardiac death. To check for normal function, it is necessary to test the ICD. For this purpose, repetitive induction and termination of ventricular fi-brillation by direct current shocks is required. This may lead to minor myocardial damage. Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI) are specific markers for the detection of myocardial injury. Because these proteins usually are undetectable in healthy individuals, they are excellent markers for detecting minimal myocardial damage. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of defibrillation of induced ventricular fibrillation on markers of myocardial damage. Methods: This study included 14 patients who under-went ICD implantation and intraoperative testing. We measured cTnT, cTnI, creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) mass, CK activity, and myoglobin before and at definite times after intraoperative shock application. Results: Depending on the effectiveness of shocks and the energy applied, the cardiac-specific markers cTnT and cTnI, as well as CK-MB mass, showed a significant increase compared with the baseline value before test-ing and peaked for the most part 4 h after shock application. In contrast, the increases in CK activity and myoglobin were predominantly detectable in patients who received additional external shocks. Conclusions: ICD implantation and testing leads to a short release of cardiac markers into the circulation. This release seems to be of cytoplasmic origin and depends on the number and effectiveness of the shocks applied. © 2001 American Association for Clinical Chemistry The Implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibril-lator (ICD) 3 {{is a common}} approach in patients with ventricular tachycardia or who have survived cryptogenic sudden cardiac death (1).

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that biphasic shocks of “reversed” polarity (RP: anode = distal coil, cathode = proximal coil) delivered through a transvenous/subcutaneous lead system {{are more effective}} in defibrillating the porcine heart than those of “initial” polarity (IP: anode = proximal coil, cathode = distal coil). The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine whether these findings could be confirmed in human implants of cardioverter/defibrillators (ICD) and a transvenous lead system. We randomly assigned 18 pts who underwent ICD implantation (Medtronic PCD “Jewel”® 13 pts, CPI Ventak P 2 ® 4 pts, CPI Ventak PR× 2 ® 1 pt) to IP or RP. Two different lead systems were used (Endotak C® or Transvene®). Defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing was performed by stepwise reduction of defibrillation <b>energy</b> from 20 <b>Joules</b> (<b>J)</b> to 1. 5 J or the first unsuccessful shock. At this point, polarity was switched (IP → RP or RP → IP, respectively) and DFT testing continued with switched polarity starting at the previously unsuccessful energy level. ResultsIn 7 of 18 pts who RP was better than IP; DFT differed by 10 J in 3, by 6 J in 1, by 5 J in 2 and by 3 J in 1 pI. In 11 pts no difference was found. Mean DFT was 9. 2 ± 4. 3 J with RP vs. 11. 9 ± 4. 8 J with IP (p< 0. 01 in paired t test). There was no difference in shock impedance between both polarities (lP: 49. 9 ± 7. 1 Ω vs. RP: 51. 1 ± 8. 1 Ω, p=n. s.) Conclusions 1) Simple reversal of electrode polarity may result in DFTs equal or better than with IP in pts undergoing transvenous ICD implants with biphasic shock forms. Therefore RP should be tested first during ICD implantation. 2) The advantage of RP cannot be explained by differences in impedance...|$|R
