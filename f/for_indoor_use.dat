5|$|In {{addition}} to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, incense clocks {{were used in}} the Far East, and were fashioned in several different forms. Incense clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the Shōsōin, although its characters are not Chinese, but Devanagari. Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in Buddhist ceremonies, Edward H. Schafer speculated that incense clocks were invented in India. Although similar to the candle clock, incense clocks burned evenly and without a flame; therefore, they were more accurate and safer <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} antiquity, mirrors {{were made}} of solid metal (bronze, later silver) and were too expensive for widespread use by common people; they were also prone to corrosion. Due to the low reflectivity of polished metal, these mirrors also gave a darker image than modern ones, making them unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> <b>use</b> with the artificial lighting of the time (candles or lanterns).|$|E
25|$|Medium-voltage circuit {{breakers}} rated between 1 and 72 kV may be assembled into metal-enclosed switchgear line ups <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> <b>use,</b> {{or may be}} individual components installed outdoors in a substation. Air-break {{circuit breakers}} replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being replaced by vacuum circuit breakers (up to about 40.5 kV). Like the high voltage circuit breakers described below, these are also operated by current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. The characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage circuit breakers nearly always use separate current sensors and protective relays, instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic overcurrent sensors.|$|E
25|$|In 1878, Edison {{began working}} on a system of {{electrical}} illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting. He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, {{something that would be}} needed <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> <b>use.</b> Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).|$|E

2500|$|The best {{methods for}} dealing with H. axyridis in private homes involve sealing {{openings}} they may enter. Sweeping and vacuuming are considered effective methods for removing them from homes, though this should be done carefully {{so as not to}} trigger reflex bleeding. A nylon stocking placed inside the vacuum cleaner's hose, secured with a rubber band, allows the beetles to be [...] "bagged" [...] rather than collected inside the machine. A trap designed <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> <b>use</b> was developed which attracts the beetles with a light and seals them in a removable bag, though as the beetles are not strongly attracted to light, this does not work particularly well.|$|E

Resistance to pesticides has increased significantly over time, and harm to health from their use is of concern.

The fungus Beauveria bassiana is being researched [...] for its ability to control bed bugs. As bed bugs continue to adapt pesticide resistance, researchers have examined the insect's genome to see how its adaptations develop and to look for potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited in its growth and development phases.|$|E

30|$|Urea {{formaldehyde}} (UF) resins {{are widely}} used in wood industry because of their high reactivity, low cost and easy processing. Nearly all particleboards <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> <b>uses</b> are bonded with UF resins despite ongoing concerns due to the critical discussion of formaldehyde emissions from this popular adhesive [1]. Hence, there is considerable pressure towards either replacing formaldehyde-based resins completely or substantially reducing formaldehyde emissions from adhesively bonded wood products. Modifications in the chemistry of UF, e.g., reductions in the molar ratio between urea and formaldehyde used in UF synthesis, have brought significant progress in emission reduction [2, 3]. An alternative strategy consists in the incorporation of non-UF additives either as formaldehyde scavenger or as UF-replacement.|$|R
