50|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} real-life responses to NIT implementation, the US government undertook four income maintenance experiments; they transpired in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (1968-1972), rural areas of North Carolina and Iowa (1970-72), Seattle and Denver (1970-78), and Gary Indiana (1971-1974). These prospective large-scale field studies were truly remarkable due to their size {{and the fact that}} families were randomized to either an experimental arm (i.e., NIT) or control arm (usual tax practice). Three major objectives of these interventions were to measure the labour supply response of NIT recipients, understand the effect of varying the base <b>guarantee</b> <b>level</b> and tax rate, and to make a better estimate of the cost of implementing such a program.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dispute over}} deposit {{insurance}} {{is not without}} some irony. In April 2008, Landsbanki launched a scathing attack on the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) after the FSCS had implied on its website (without specifically mentioning Icesave) that depositors guaranteed under the [...] "passport system" [...] might have to wait longer for their money {{in the event of}} a bank failure than depositors with banks which were completely under the FSCS. Landsbanki went as far as accusing the FSCS of breaching European law [...] "by letting savers believe this falsehood". A second irony is that FSCS had raised its <b>guarantee</b> <b>level</b> from £35,000 to £50,000 on the very day that Landsbanki went into default, a move that does not affect the liability of the Tryggingarsjóður under the [...] "passport system" [...] but which has considerably increased the cost to British banks and building societies (independently of any action by the Icelandic authorities).|$|E

In a subsequent step, corresponding top-level safety requirements would be derived. In addition, reasonable <b>guarantee</b> <b>levels</b> need to be identified. In the given example, it is conceivable that different safety <b>guarantee</b> <b>levels</b> are required for different locations (e.g., in the midst of nothing vs. a field close to a children’s playground) or that <b>guarantee</b> <b>levels</b> are defined in interplay with application-specific parameters (e.g., acceleration or velocity levels, different degrees of automation, etc.) or with relevant conditions of the operating environment (weather, topography).|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) with a funding gap intending {{to invest in}} a project, of which the cash flow follows a double exponential jump-diffusion process. In contrast to traditional corporate finance theory, we assume the SME is unable to get a loan directly from a bank and hence it enters into a partial guarantee agreement with an insurer and a lender. Utilizing a real options approach, we develop an investment and financing model with a partial guarantee. We explicitly derive the pricing and timing of the option to invest. We find that if the funding gap rises, the option value decreases but its investment threshold first declines and then increases. The larger the <b>guarantee</b> <b>level,</b> the lower the option value and the later the investment. The optimal coupon rate decreases with project risk and a growth of the <b>guarantee</b> <b>level</b> can effectively reduce agency conflicts...|$|E

40|$|In modern taxi networks, {{large amounts}} of taxi {{occupancy}} status and location data are collected from networked in-vehicle sensors in real-time. They provide knowledge of system models on passenger demand and mobility patterns for efficient taxi dispatch and coordination strategies. Such approaches face new challenges: {{how to deal with}} uncertainties of predicted customer demand while fulfilling the system's performance requirements, including minimizing taxis' total idle mileage and maintaining service fairness across the whole city; how to formulate a computationally tractable problem. To address this problem, we develop a data-driven robust taxi dispatch framework to consider spatial-temporally correlated demand uncertainties. The robust vehicle dispatch problem we formulate is concave in the uncertain demand and convex in the decision variables. Uncertainty sets of random demand vectors are constructed from data based on theories in hypothesis testing, and provide a desired probabilistic <b>guarantee</b> <b>level</b> for the performance of robust taxi dispatch solutions. We prove equivalent computationally tractable forms of the robust dispatch problem using the minimax theorem and strong duality. Evaluations on four years of taxi trip data for New York City show that by selecting a probabilistic <b>guarantee</b> <b>level</b> at 75 %, the average demand-supply ratio error is reduced by 31. 7 %, and the average total idle driving distance is reduced by 10. 13 % or about 20 million miles annually, compared with non-robust dispatch solutions.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between the level of a return guarantee in an equity–linked pension scheme and the proportion of an investor’s contribution needed to finance this guarantee. Three types of schemes are considered: investment guarantee, contribution guarantee and participation surplus. The evaluation of each scheme involves pricing an Asian option, for which relatively tight upper and lower bounds can be calculated in a numerically efficient manner. We find a negative (and for two contract specifications also concave) relationship between the participation in the surplus return of the investment strategy and the <b>guarantee</b> <b>level</b> in terms of a minimum rate of return. Furthermore, the introduction of a possibility of early termination of the contract (e. g. due to the death of the investor) has no qualitative and very little quantitative impact on this relationship...|$|E
40|$|We {{quantify}} {{the impact of}} effective welfare programme parameters on the labour supply of single female household heads - the primary group of welfare recipients in the USA. Our panel of data {{is derived from the}} US Census Bureau's Current Population Survey for the years 1979 to 1990 inclusive. Behavioural impacts from a range of economic variables are consistent in sign with predictions made by economic theory. We find that effective welfare guarantee levels and the effective tax rate on earned income both significantly decrease labour supply. The marginal effects of these welfare programme parameters are economically small: a US 1000 increase in the expected welfare <b>guarantee</b> <b>level</b> reduces annual labour supply by about 36 hours; a 10 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate on earned income reduces annual labour supply by about 7. 5 hours...|$|E
40|$|Probabilistic {{bandwidth}} guarantees on variable bit-rate network ows offer {{significant improvements}} in throughput for only modest decreases in <b>guarantee</b> <b>level.</b> In this paper we present a probabilistic bandwidth reservation scheme for variable bit-rate flows called Resource Priority Multiplexing (RPM).

RPM also supports multiple metrics for probabilistic level of service specification. All ow tables are managed only by the edge routers enhancing scalability of the approach. Unlike existing statistical multiplexing approaches, RPM uses a time-multiplexed priority tagging algorithm which provides higher control over flows guarantee levels.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the connection between}} energy level crossings in integrable systems and their integrability, i. e. {{the existence of a}} set of non-trivial integrals of motion. In particular, we consider a general quantum Hamiltonian linear in the coupling u, H(u) = T + uV, and require that it has the maximum possible number of nontrivial commuting partners also linear in u. We demonstrate how this commutation requirement alone leads to: (1) an exact solution for the energy spectrum and (2) level crossings, which are always present in these Hamiltonians in violation of the Wigner-von Neumann non-crossing rule. Moreover, we construct these Hamiltonians explicitly by resolving the above commutation requirement and show their equivalence to a sector of Gaudin magnets (central spin Hamiltonians). In contrast, fewer than the maximum number of conservation laws does not <b>guarantee</b> <b>level</b> crossings.

40|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{investments}} available in the Canadian market today is a mutual fund with the added feature of a long term maturity guarantee. These types of investments are known as segregated funds. They are similar in many respects to variable annuity savings plans in the United States. Segregated funds have very complex option features. These contracts contain multiple embedded shout options which permit the holder to reset the <b>guarantee</b> <b>level</b> and the maturity date for which it applies many times during the life of the contract. These funds also provide mortality benefits if the investor dies prior to the maturity date.
