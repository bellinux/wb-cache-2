5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> the basil varies due to the varying types and {{quantities}} of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fragrances</b> <b>of</b> the World is {{the largest}} {{independent}} guide to fragrance classification. First published in 1984 by Michael Edwards in Sydney, Australia, the guide was originally named The Fragrance Manual before becoming <b>Fragrances</b> <b>of</b> the World in 2000. It has since been printed annually in a bilingual English-French edition. An online companion, the <b>Fragrances</b> <b>of</b> the World database, was launched in 2004 and, as of 2015, profiles over 17,000 perfumes, updated weekly. <b>Fragrances</b> <b>of</b> the World is considered a standard encyclopedic reference within the fragrance industry, colloquially termed the “Fragrance Bible” (a registered trademark since 2011).|$|R

25|$|D. ambrosioides {{is used as}} a leaf vegetable, herb, and {{herbal tea}} for its pungent flavor. Raw, it has a resinous, {{medicinal}} pungency, similar to oregano, anise, fennel, or even tarragon, but stronger. The <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> D. ambrosioides is strong but difficult to describe. A common analogy is to turpentine or creosote. It has also been compared to citrus, savory, and mint.|$|E
25|$|Sweetness, {{fragrance}} {{and complex}} flavor are favorable attributes. In plant breeding and farming, {{emphasis is placed}} on sugars, acids, and volatile compounds, which improve the taste and <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> a ripe strawberry. Esters, terpenes, and furans are chemical compounds having the strongest relationships to strawberry flavor and fragrance, with a total of 31 volatile compounds significantly correlated to favorable flavor and fragrance.|$|E
25|$|Rosemary {{leaves are}} used as a {{flavoring}} in foods such as stuffings and roast lamb, pork, chicken and turkey. Fresh or dried leaves are used in traditional Mediterranean cuisine. They have a bitter, astringent taste and a characteristic aroma which complements many cooked foods. Herbal tea {{can be made from}} the leaves. When roasted with meats or vegetables, the leaves impart a mustard-like aroma with an additional <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> charred wood compatible with barbecued foods.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—We {{investigated}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>fragrance</b> inhalation on sympathetic activity in normal adult subjects using both power spectral analysis of blood pressure fluctuations and measurement of plasma catecholamine levels. <b>Fragrance</b> inhalation <b>of</b> essential oils, such as pepper oil, estragon oil, fennel oil or grapefruit oil, resulted in 1. 5 - to 2. 5 -fold increase in relative sympathetic activity, representing low frequency amplitude of {{systolic blood pressure}} (SBP-LF amplitude), compared with inhalation of an odorless solvent, triethyl citrate (P 0. 05, each). In contrast, <b>fragrance</b> inhalation <b>of</b> rose oil or patchouli oil caused a 40 % decrease in relative sympathetic activity (P 0. 01, each). <b>Fragrance</b> inhalation <b>of</b> pepper oil induced a 1. 7 -fold increase in plasma adrenaline concentration compared with the resting state (P 0. 06), while <b>fragrance</b> inhalation <b>of</b> rose oil caused a 30 % decrease in adrenaline concentration (P 0. 01). Our results indicate that <b>fragrance</b> inhalation <b>of</b> essential oils may modulate sympathetic activity in normal adults...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} specifications <b>of</b> <b>fragrances</b> <b>of</b> plant origin, {{their origin}} and usage, methods of obtaining {{and ways of}} use them in cosmetics. <b>Fragrances</b> are mixtures <b>of</b> natural or synthetic character which give the aroma. In the nature, fragrances are produced mainly by plants. Aroma of blossom {{and other parts of}} plants is created by essential oils. From the whole number of 295 families of plants for about a third of them contains essentials oils which can be used in industry. More than 100 fragrances has been identified as allergens. Parfumed products allergies are relatively common. In connection of this problem synthetic alternatives <b>of</b> natural <b>fragrances</b> <b>of</b> plant origin are producing.

25|$|Indian rice cultivars include long-grained and {{aromatic}} Basmati (ਬਾਸਮਤੀ) (grown in the North), {{long and}} medium-grained Patna rice, and in South India (Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka) short-grained Sona Masuri (also called as Bangaru theegalu). In {{the state of}} Tamil Nadu, the most prized cultivar is ponni which is primarily grown in the delta regions of the Kaveri River. Kaveri is {{also referred to as}} ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. In the Western Indian state of Maharashtra, a short grain variety called Ambemohar is very popular. This rice has a characteristic <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> Mango blossom.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of taking}} nectar, bees can take honeydew, the sweet {{secretions}} of aphids or other plant sap-sucking insects. Honeydew honey is very dark brown in color, {{with a rich}} <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> stewed fruit or fig jam, and is not as sweet as nectar honeys. Germany's Black Forest is a well known source of honeydew-based honeys, {{as well as some}} regions in Bulgaria, Tara (mountain) in Serbia, and Northern California in the United States. In Greece, pine honey (a type of honeydew honey) constitutes 60–65% of the annual honey production. Honeydew honey is popular in some areas, but in other areas, beekeepers have difficulty selling the stronger-flavored product.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the American version's success, on January 29, 2009 Paris Hilton's British Best Friend debuted on ITV2 in England; Hilton began to film the show in October 2008. The series was successful; its first episode was watched by 428,000 viewers, and 605,000 viewers watched its finale. The second season of Paris Hilton's My New BFF premiered on June 2, 2009.

25|$|The {{story in}} the Vishnu Purana goes that Durvasa, while {{wandering}} the earth {{in a state of}} ecstasy due to a vow he was observing, came by a Vidyadhari(a nymph of the air) and demanded of her a heavenly wreath of flowers she was wearing. The nymph respectfully gave the garland to the sage, whereupon he wore it on his brow. Resuming his wanderings, the sage came across Indra riding his elephant, Airavata, attended by the gods. Durvasa, still in his state of frenzy, threw the garland at Indra, who caught it and placed it on Airavata's head. The elephant was irritated by the <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> the nectar in the flowers, so it threw the garland to the ground with its trunk. Durvasa was enraged to see his gift treated so callously and cursed Indra that he would be cast down from his position of dominion over the three worlds, just as the garland was cast down. Indra immediately begged Durvasa's forgiveness, but the sage refused to retract or even soften his curse and went on his way. Because of the curse, Indra and the devas were diminished in strength and shorn of their lustre. Seizing this opportunity, the asuras led by Bali waged war against the gods. The gods were routed and turned to Brahma for help. Brahma directed them to seek refuge with Vishnu. Vishnu in turn, advised them to call a truce with the asuras and work together with them to churn the ocean of milk and obtain the Amrita (nectar of immortality), on the pretext of sharing it with them. Vishnu promised that he would ensure only the devas drank the Nectar and obtained immortality so they could once again defeat the asuras. The devas took Vishnu's advice and called their truce with the asuras and thus did the gods and demons begin planning their great enterprise.|$|E

[...] When we are not all together at dinner, lunch, playing billiards, or walking, each of us stays in his room, reading or lounging around on a couch. Sometimes, through the window which opens on the garden, a gust of music wafts up from Chopin at work. All this mingles with the songs of nightingales and the <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> roses.|$|E
500|$|Critic Lorna Bradbury noted {{how many}} of the scenes are [...] "wonderful", each evoking further {{understanding}} of Brooke as a character. Joanna Briscoe also noted that the novel had a wonderful [...] "sense of time and place" [...] because it treats many elements unique to the period in the Britain very well, including Fabianism and class politics. The Great Lover also maintains a very vivid imagery and sensory elements related to The Orchard; as Vanessa Curtis of The Scotsman says, [...] "the <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> honey, apples and flowers suffuse the novel".|$|E

500|$|The {{wide range}} of {{descriptions}} for the odour of durian may {{have a great deal}} to do with the variability of durian odour itself. Durians from different species or clones can have significantly different aromas; for example, red durian (D. dulcis) has a deep caramel flavour with a turpentine odour while red-fleshed durian (D. graveolens) emits a <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> roasted almonds. [...] Among the varieties of D. zibethinus, Thai varieties are sweeter in flavour and less odorous than Malay ones. The degree of ripeness has an effect on the flavour as well.|$|E

Lavigne described the album as being about her life experiences {{rather than focusing on}} relationships, and its style as less pop rock than her previous material, reflecting her age. The release date for Goodbye Lullaby was delayed several times, which Lavigne said was because of her label. Goodbye Lullaby was released in March 2011, and its lead single, [...] "What the Hell", premiered in December 2010. Goodbye Lullaby sold 368,000 copies in the US and received Juno Award nominations for Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Tipu Sultan built {{a wooden}} colonnaded palace called the Dariya Daulat Palace (lit, [...] "garden {{of the wealth}} of the sea") in Srirangapatna in 1784. Built in the Indo-Saracenic style, the palace is known for its {{intricate}} woodwork consisting of ornamental arches, striped columns and floral designs, and paintings. The west wall of the palace is covered with murals depicting Tipu Sultan's victory over Colonel Baillie's army at Pollilur, near Kanchipuram in 1780. One mural shows Tipu enjoying the <b>fragrance</b> <b>of</b> a bouquet of flowers while the battle is in progress. In that painting, the French soldiers' moustaches distinguish them from the cleanshaven British soldiers. Also in Srirangapatna is the Gumbaz mausoleum, built by Tipu Sultan in 1784. It houses the graves of Tipu and Haider Ali. The granite base is capped with a dome built of brick and pilaster.|$|E
