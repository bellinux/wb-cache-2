5|$|Instead {{of going}} to his physical, Peter goes out with Brian, Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe to eat steaks. When Lois finds out, she takes him to the doctor herself. The doctor pronounces him healthy, but fat. Peter takes this badly, even smashing a picture of Lois' family. Trying to salvage it, Lois discovers another child in the picture: a boy. She {{telephones}} her father Carter, who tells her she doesn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> and quickly terminates the call, but she persists: she breaks into her parents' house. She finally learns that her brother Patrick has been shut away in a mental hospital for decades, ever since he suffered a nervous breakdown as a young child, upon walking in on his mother {{having an affair with}} Jackie Gleason.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple and}} their adult son and two adult daughters {{live in a}} fenced compound. The {{children}} {{have no knowledge of}} the outside world; their parents say they will be ready to leave once they lose a dogtooth, and that one can only leave safely by car. The children entertain themselves with endurance games, such as holding their hands under hot water. They believe they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> {{on the other side of}} the fence to whom they throw supplies. The parents reward good behaviour with stickers and bad with violence.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{changing}} the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and {{it became clear that}} Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new Act of Succession permitted female succession to the throne of Denmark, according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother.</b> Princess Margrethe therefore became heir presumptive.|$|E

5000|$|A James {{was arrested}} {{along with some}} other Christians and was {{executed}} by King Herod Agrippa in persecution of the church. [...] However, the James in [...] <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> called John. James, son of Zebedee <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> called John (...) and we are never explicitly told that James son of Alphaeus <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother.</b> Robert Eisenman [...] and Achille Camerlynck both suggest that the death of James in Acts 12:1-2 is James, son of Zebedee and not James son of Alphaeus.|$|R
500|$|It was in Socha Na Tha (2004) that Kukunoor noticed Ayesha Takia {{and until}} then he assumed {{her to be}} a glamor doll. After getting {{convinced}} about her acting skills, she was roped in for the character of Meera. Takia said that though her character emotionally drained her, it was not tough to portray and that she could learn a lot about life. She further said that, [...] "Dor was indeed an exciting challenge for the actor in me. I am happy that it was also a very exciting role, which not many actors get to portray at such a young age." [...] She said that with Dor, she was not only in the film industry for glamor, but also for her acting prowess. While filming, Kukunoor bonded so well with Takia that he requested her to be his sister. Since she did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> in real life, she got quite emotional with Kukunoor's brotherly proposal. This affection eventually solemnized {{in the form of a}} rakhi symbolically.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Niles {{was not part}} of the original concept for the show. Frasier had told his bar friends on Cheers that he was an only child. However, Sheila Guthrie, the assistant casting director on Wings brought the producers a photo of Pierce (whom she knew from his work on The Powers That Be) and noted his resemblance to Grammer when he first appeared on Cheers. She recommended him should they ever want Frasier to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother.</b> The creators were [...] "blown away" [...] both by his resemblance to Grammer and by his acting ability. They decided to ignore Frasier's statement on Cheers and created the role for Pierce. Pierce accepted the role before realizing he hadn't read a script. Once he was given a script, he was initially concerned that his character was essentially a duplicate of Frasier, thinking that it would not work.|$|E

2500|$|Philbin {{was born}} on August 25, 1931 in the Bronx, New York City. His father, Francis [...] "Frank" [...] Philbin, a U.S. Marine {{who served in the}} Pacific, was of Irish heritage. [...] His mother, Filomena [...] "Florence" [...] (née Boscia), was from an Italian {{immigrant}} family of Arbëreshë (ethnic Albanians from Italy) descent from Greci, Campania. They lived in the Van Nest section of the Bronx. Philbin was raised Roman Catholic. He was supposedly named [...] "Regis" [...] because his father wanted him to attend the prestigious Regis High School. [...] It was long believed that Philbin was an only child, but on the February 1, 2007 broadcast of Live with Regis and Kelly, Philbin announced that he did <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother,</b> Frank M. Philbin (March 1, 1951 – January 27, 2007), who had died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma several days earlier. Philbin said his brother, 20 years younger than he, had asked not to be mentioned on television or in the press.|$|E
2500|$|On November 2, 1998, Saddle Creek {{released}} Letting Off the Happiness, a ten-track {{album that}} displayed a more focused and clearer sound {{than the previous}} album. According to the Saddle Creek press release, it features members of Lullaby for the Working Class, Neutral Milk Hotel, and of Montreal. Park Ave. bandmate Neely Jenkins also contributed vocals. It was predominantly recorded in the Oberst family basement in Omaha on an analog eight track reel to reel; with some work also done at keyboardist Andy Lemaster's Athens, Georgia studio. Although {{almost all of the}} tracks feature a full band, [...] "June on the West Coast" [...] is performed with only acoustic guitar and vocals. [...] "Padraic My Prince" [...] gives a dramatic fictional account of the death of his baby brother, a story with a multitude of symbolic meanings. Oberst has referenced the song [...] "Padraic My Prince" [...] more than once in his music. The song [...] "An Attempt To Tip the Scales" [...] on the album [...] "Fevers and Mirrors" [...] has a faux interview {{near the end of the}} track (Oberst voiced by Todd Fink), who was a labelmate and had played in other bands with Oberst. The interviewer is Matt Silcock, another labelmate on Saddle Creek Records. The interview was meant to be somewhat sarcastic and most of what the Oberst impersonator said was not true. At one point the interviewer asks the question: [...] "So some of these references like babies in bathtubs are not biographical?" [...] The Oberst impersonator replies: [...] "Well I did <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> who died in a bathtub [...] [...] [...] he drowned. Well actually I had five brothers that drowned." [...] "No, I'm serious. My mother drowned one every year for five consecutive years. They were all named Padraic, and that's why they only got one song. It's kind of like walking out a door and discovering that it's a window." [...] Oberst also references the song in [...] "Cartoon Blues" [...] on the Four Winds EP.|$|E
