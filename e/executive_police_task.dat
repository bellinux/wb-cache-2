40|$|Mobile {{technologies}} are increasingly adopted by information intensive {{organisations such as}} public police corporations to support the tasks of its employees, for information management and innovation. However, because police organisations are government organisations, technology decisions are largely made by managers and politicians with budget being a key factor. Therefore, whether the technologies adopted are suitable for <b>police</b> <b>tasks,</b> and if they enhance performance, is generally not assessed. The aim {{of this research is}} to establish if mobile technologies support <b>police</b> <b>tasks,</b> and if Tablet PCs especially are suitable for specialist <b>police</b> <b>tasks</b> of the Criminal Investigators and Sexual Offence and Child Abuse Units. Guided by an interpretive paradigm and the theory of task technology fit, this research explores the use of Tablet PCs by the two police units for improved performance. Because information is critical for <b>police</b> <b>tasks,</b> data collected via focus groups establishes the impact of these technologies on case investigations, information management, and the performance of these units with the use of Tablet PCs. The contribution this study makes to mobile information systems is that if technology dimensions are suitable for information based tasks, the outcome is virtualization of processes through which improved performance is achieved due to reduced costs, transparency, teamwork, and quick and informed decisions. The findings of this research can be used by police organisations, as well as by other organisations, for effective implementation of mobile technologies...|$|R
