40|$|It was of {{importance}} {{in the evaluation of}} feedingstufrs to know its quantitative composition. A qualitative botanical indicated purity but a quantitative test was needed for the degree of purity. Natural feedstuffs always contained a certain amount of foreign material, which could be considered either as natural or chance contamination. The manufacturer had to ensure that commercial feedstuffs had a high degree of purity. Whenever there was consideration in the trade of standards for purity, it was necessary to be able to check these standards. Ezendam worked out a method of measuring impurities both quantitatively and qualitatively. It was tested on some feedstuffs and thus led the way for microscopic study <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs...</b>|$|R

Among 72 examined samples <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> there were raw plant materials, meat-and-bone meal (MBM), samples found as positive and negative after the microscopic method and samples with known levels of MBM’s. In all feed and feed material samples which contained mammalian and fish origin PAP positive results by microscopic and FeedCheck methods were obtained. It should be pointed out that although fish meal is classified as PAP, the producer of the test did not declare this material as detectable by the FeedCheck test.

40|$|Intensification of milk {{production}} {{is associated with}} {{an increase in the number}} of dairy cows and milk yielding. In order to maintain high milk yield and quality of the produced raw material it is very important to adjust the appropriately balanced dose of feeds. Production of good quality own roughage is a valuable and cheap source of food for animals, but it may be insufficient to provide high milk yielding. As a result, it is necessary to buy commercial concentrated feedingstuffs (mainly protein concentrates and concentrated compounds) which may lead to an increase of production costs. Intensification of {{milk production}} in the economic aspect is justified only in the case of a simultaneous increase in the profitability of this production, which is the relation of the production value and incurred costs. For the economic purpose of milk production the way of feeding the dairy cows should also result from economic calculation and the purchase <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuffs</b> must be economically justified. This article attempts to answer the question whether the increased consumption <b>of</b> commercial concentrated <b>feedingstuffs</b> and increased direct costs are justified by achieved economic results from milk production. The accountancy data were collected according to the methodology of the AGROKOSZTY and Polish FADN system among dairy farms. Grouping of the surveyed farms concerned a level <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuff</b> quantity which (as shown by statistical analysis) was strongly correlated with milk yielding. The designated groups (with small level and high level of usage <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuffs)</b> were analysed in terms of direct costs and labour input as well as the level of income from the activity. The economic results of the surveyed farms showed that the higher costs incurred for the purchase of commercial feedstuffs in the group with high usage <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuffs</b> (average herd in the group was 30 dairy cows with milk yielding of 6, 000 liters per cow) did not allow to achieve much better economic results than in the group with small usage of commercial feedstuffs (average herd in group was 15 cows with milk yielding of 5, 200 litres per cow) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{experiments}} {{were made with}} adult White Leghorn cockerels to study the passage of feed residues through the alimentary canal. The birds were starved for 24 hr and then force-fed known quantities <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> Excreta were collected quantitatively at 2 hr intervals during the light periods, dried, and weighed. In the first two experiments the birds received 12 hr of light daily while in the third experiment continuous light was used. Residues of oats fed at levels ranging from 6 to 30 g/bird appeared in the excreta within 2 hr and continued to be voided for 52 hr. The rate and duration of residue output were functions of residue input; this was true for, wheat, fish meal, and dehydrated alfalfa as well as oats.
