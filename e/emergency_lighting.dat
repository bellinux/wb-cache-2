5|$|The building, {{including}} the load-bearing elements, was constructed of wood. There were 10 fire extinguishers and 11 fire hoses in the hotel. Only a few escape routes had proper <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> and {{directions to the}} emergency exits, and the hotel was also not on a hotline with the emergency centre of the fire department. The building had been inspected by the fire department, first in February 1976, {{and later in the}} beginning of 1977, after which the hotel's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects. They issued a list of proposed improvements to be implemented by the hotel, such as complying with the building regulations and the regulations for residence facilities.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a day of}} Cyclone Waka's {{passage in}} Tonga, the Government of New Zealand {{deployed}} an aircraft to survey the scale of damage and reestablish contact with the Tongan Islands. This aircraft was sent {{in accordance with the}} FRANZ Agreement, enacted in 1992, which states that assests from one country would be used in relief operations. On January2, the head of Tonga's Disaster Office announced that they would likely need international assistance to recover from the storm. Due to the substantial damage to agriculture, food shortages were expected to impact the region over the following months. By January7, the Red Cross began sending supplies to Tonga. Hundreds of tents and tarpaulins were brought in by an Australian AC-130 to help with the recovery process. On January12, a New Zealand Lockheed C-130 Hercules carrying US$700,000 worth of supplies flew to the area to deliver aid. An additional US$700,000 was given in relief funds to repair damage wrought by the storm. Of this, US$500,000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and the remaining US$200,000 would be used for <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting,</b> cooking and food supply recovery.|$|E

Regulation also states that the Military as well as vehicles carrying politicians can make use of a single rotating blue light at the roof. Every other individual and/or company may use yellow lights for either warning or emergency. Special groups like Emergency Response teams and agents may also include <b>emergency</b> <b>lights</b> on their private vehicles {{in case of an}} emergency when not in active duty. All utility vehicles such as construction related, tow trucks must be equipped with a yellow-colored <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> bar on the top, clearly visible from the front and rear side.

25|$|The bomb {{instantly}} {{cut off the}} World Trade Center's main {{electrical power}} line, knocking out the <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> system. The bomb caused smoke {{to rise to the}} 93rd floor of both towers, including through the stairwells which were not pressurized, and smoke went up the damaged elevators in the World Trade Center Towers 1 & 2. With thick smoke filling the stairwells, evacuation was difficult for building occupants and led to many smoke inhalation injuries. Hundreds were trapped in elevators in the towers when the power was cut, including a group of 17 kindergartners, on their way down from the South Tower observation deck, who were trapped between the 35th and 36th floors for five hours.|$|E
25|$|But {{despite these}} repairs, by 2002 the {{memorial}} still had almost $795,000 in deferred repairs. Some {{of the larger}} and more costly projects which were needed included removal and resetting of the granite front steps, purchase and installation of emergency generators, replacement of the fresh water mains, installation of a tuned mass damper to prevent wind damage to the tower, installation of <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting,</b> and a structural survey of the memorial. In 2003, the Northern and Southern Jurisdictions of Scottish Rite of Freemasonry agreed to provide $200,000 to fund the renovation of the George Washington museum. The renovations were {{to be completed by}} August 2003. In February 2004, renovations to the exhibits in the three Shriners' rooms on the first floor were also complete. By fall of that year, the sidewalks {{on the north side of}} the memorial had also been replaced, and in 2005 retaining walls around the Masonic symbol on the east side were built. Aircraft warning lights were installed atop the memorial in early 2006, and security lighting installed in the parking lots. But while welcome, these were not the major repairs the GWMNMA said it needed to make.|$|E
500|$|The Chemical Safety Board {{released}} its report in September 2009, saying the explosion had been [...] "entirely preventable."

Specifically, internal company memorandums by managers in 1967 expressed their concern about the potential of explosions from sugar dust. Imperial Sugar had recently made construction changes that enabled the accumulation of sugar dust. It had never practiced evacuation procedures, and the lack of <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> meant that people were confined to dark hallways and tunnels {{at the time of the}} explosions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} better {{engineering}} design of an assistance kit for manual wheelchair users. The design is aimed {{to enhance the}} detection of obstacles in the travelling path of the wheelchair user at low cost. This is facilitated by microcontroller and sensor technologies. The proposed design provides the intended user with obstacle detection, light detection, a light emitting diode (LED) <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> system, and an emergency alarm system. The microcontroller is the main controller that receives input from the sensors and produces output to the light crystal display (LCD) screen, the LED <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> system, and the emergency alarm system. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the presence of obstacles directly behind the wheelchair. If any obstacle exists behind the wheelchair within a set range, the system will alert the wheelchair user through different alarm sounds. In the case of absence of <b>light,</b> the LED <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> system is activated and turns on a light source, which {{is attached to the}} wheelchair to provide a bright and clear path for the user. The distance between the obstacle and the wheelchair, and the status of the LED <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> system are displayed on the LCD screen...|$|R
500|$|The first {{terrorist}} attack on the World Trade Center occurred on February 26, 1993, at 12:17p.m., when a Ryder truck filled with [...] of explosives, planted by Ramzi Yousef, detonated in the underground garage of the North Tower. The blast resulted in a [...] hole through five sublevels. The greatest damage was on levels B1 and B2, with significant structural damage on level B3. Six people were killed, {{and more than a}} thousand were injured, as 50,000 workers and visitors were inside the tower at the time. Many people inside the North Tower were forced to walk down darkened stairwells that had no <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting,</b> and some took two hours or more to reach safety.|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the episode came from the SG-1 writers wondering for years what George Hammond, the SGC leader from seasons one through seven, does while SG-1 is away on missions. Imagined scenarios ranged from the general dealing with minor decisions like bunting and lunch buffet, to averting major emergencies and threats. The episode's working title was [...] "A Day in the Life of General O'Neill", but writer Robert C. Cooper felt [...] "Zero Hour" [...] was more appropriate, referring to the President's visit {{at the end of}} the episode. The subplot of the SGC being overrun with plant life originates in a Season 4 idea by writer and producer Brad Wright. To not interrupt the shooting process, the set was decorated with various plants and vines overnight. Some plants were plastic, but real plants were used for the torching scenes, sprayed to be flame retardant so as not to burn the whole set. Jim Menard as the director of photography was responsible for the green lighting when the <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> goes off. He achieved depth by using differently-colored lights in the control room and near the gate.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the major}} {{concerns}} was leaks; during the {{construction on the}} Romerike Tunnel, there was a one-year delay and severe cost overruns due to improper leak handling methods. Therefore, {{one of the main}} focuses in the Skaugum Tunnel project was to avoid similar leaks. The contract specified a maximum leakage of [...] per minute per [...] The contractor attempted to achieve this by extending the time used for pre-injection of concrete. However, there was still water dripping into the tunnel, which caused several types of damage. Some places the water dripped onto the track, causing rust; other places water dripped onto electrical equipment. There was also issues with water running down the walls and collecting in the cable conduit, and the water with limestone dripping on the ballast and mixing the ballast with limestone. By 2011, the <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> system had to be replaced because of the high humidity. The National Rail Administration has stated that savings made to the specifications in the water and frost methods have caused higher maintenance costs because the small leaks which are present do a lot of harm. In addition, areas with leaks suffer from icing. This has been part of a national trend where older tunnels are nearly maintenance-free, while newer tunnels have incurred high maintenance costs.|$|E
