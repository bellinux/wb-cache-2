500|$|Gaga {{announced}} [...] "You and I" [...] as {{the fourth}} single from Born This Way on July 22, 2011. Its cover, released on August 5, 2011, via TwitPic, {{was accompanied by}} the line: [...] "You will never <b>find</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are looking for in love, if you don't love yourself." [...] It features two black-and-white images of Gaga's male alter ego Jo Calderone smoking a cigarette and sporting sideburns. The Calderone character made a previous appearance in June 2011, when Gaga posed as him in London {{for a series of}} photos by photographer Nick Knight, arranged by stylist Nicola Formichetti. One shot features him wearing a blazer and white T-shirt with his head down smoking a cigarette. The other image is of Jo Calderone in silhouette exhaling a cloud of smoke.|$|E
500|$|According to Crowley, every {{individual}} has a True Will, to {{be distinguished from}} the ordinary wants and desires of the ego. The True Will is essentially one's [...] "calling" [...] or [...] "purpose" [...] in life. Some later magicians have taken this to include the goal of attaining self-realization by one's own efforts, {{without the aid of}} God or other divine authority. This brings them close to the position that Crowley held just prior to 1904. [...] Others follow later works such as Liber II, saying that one's own will in pure form is nothing other than the divine will. [...] Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law for Crowley refers not to hedonism, fulfilling everyday desires, but to acting in response to that calling. [...] The Thelemite is a mystic. [...] According to Lon Milo DuQuette, a Thelemite is anyone who bases their actions on striving to discover and accomplish their true will, when a person does their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them. [...] In order for the individual to be able to follow their True Will, the everyday self's socially-instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via deconditioning. [...] Crowley believed that in order to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the subconscious mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation. He identified the True Will of each individual with the Holy Guardian Angel, a daimon unique to each individual. [...] The spiritual quest to <b>find</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are meant to do and do it is also known in Thelema as the Great Work.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2014, the Barnes & Noble website {{announced}} the Nook Study {{had been replaced}} by Yuzu, which the company called [...] "the next-generation digital education platform from Barnes & Noble." [...] In April, NOOK Study had already been [...] "retired", and a Beta version of Yuzu was introduced for the iPad and for Internet Explorer and Safari 6.1/7 browsers. [...] Yuzu was formally rolled out that summer and made available to more browsers, and as an Android, iOS, and Windows app. However, the Nook Study site continued offering a link to the Nook Study program, explaining: [...] "We understand that as a NOOK Study user, you may have some questions. On this page we will try to direct you to the appropriate websites to <b>find</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are looking for." [...] Clicking [...] "Get NookStudy Help" [...] redirects one to the [...] "NOOK Study Knowledge Base", where they can download the Nook Study app as well as find answers to frequently asked questions. [...] Yuzu, like NOOKStudy, [...] "offers students a next-generation reading and note-taking experience in a simple app, but it also improves on NookStudy by making it easier for educators to provide course materials" [...] by integrating with BN's college-focused website Faculty Enlight, where educators can search for the textbooks and other academic material they need, assemble them into course packs, and then build a required and recommended reading list for a class. Downsides of Yuzu, however, are: [...] "Yuzu does not share the same accounts as the Nook Store or NookStudy" [...] and [...] "Yuzu is not compatible with NookStudy textbooks". Emily Price at Engadget made a similar observation: [...] "With Yuzu, 's being phased out, and sadly any pricey books you've already bought through that service are incompatible with the new app." ...|$|E
