40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of medical technology, the medical surgery requires increasingly advanced biomimetic materials. The ideal <b>joint</b> <b>prosthesis</b> should have following properties anti-corrosion, bone ingrowth, anti-infection and same mechanical properties of natural bone. In recent years, nanomaterials in orthopedic applications attracted more and more attention. Nanometer-size materials made ceramics, polyethylene, metals have been tested and verified in orthopedic implants. As the devices made by nanomaterials can mimic the dimensions of constituent components of natural bone, so it could promote adequate osteointegration and enable the prosthesis to be successful for long time. In this paper, we discussed the nanomaterials ’ ability to promote bone growth, ingrowth and anti-infection of the <b>joint</b> <b>prosthesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Advancements in wear {{analysis}} methods require accurate technology to measure surface wear in <b>joint</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> These methods offer {{insight into the}} success of implant material and design, and has potential to influence implant longevity. However, established wear {{analysis methods}} are time-intensive and costly. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was to develop a 3 D structured-light scanning wear procedure to accurately detect surface deviations and generate 3 D color maps of surface wear for polyethylene liners used in <b>joint</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> This procedure followed a three step process, where a novel approach was developed to align specimens and measure surface deviations. It was determined that the 3 D structured-light scanner could detect deviations of 20 μm or greater with reasonable error. This procedure was then applied to hip resurfacing polyethylene liners that experienced wear testing. For all liners, the average, central, and peak wear was 19 ± 7 μm, 28 ± 10 μm, and 57 ± 15 μm, respectively. This is the first study to use 3 D structured-light scanning to detect and visualize surface wear on <b>joint</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Results from this study suggest that 3 D structured-light scanning may be an appropriate alternative to established wear analysis methods with respect to accuracy, time, and cost...|$|E

40|$|The phase {{stability}} under aqueous condition {{and changes in}} the wear region after the Pin-on-Flat wear testing were evaluated using Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques and X-ray diffractometry for a newly developed zirconia toughened alumina (JMM-ZTA). This study suggests that JMM-ZTA is a highly stable material under aqueous environment in the human body and has a high wear resistance in Pin-on-Flat wear tests. This results from a transformation toughening mechanism operative in JMM-ZTA. Therefore, JMM-ZTA appears to have a possibility to improve the performance of monolithic alumina as a material for hip and knee <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Monolithic alumina and zirconia (3 Y-TZP, Mg-PSZ) ceramics have been extensively used for hip and knee <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses</b> due to their excellent wear resistance and superior biocompatibility [1].

40|$|Total hip {{replacement}} (THR) {{is one of}} the most successful orthopedic surgical procedures for replacing a broken hip joint. In THR, wear may occur at the articulating surface of the acetabular cup and the femoral head. In Indonesia, the country with the largest Muslim population in the world, most of the inhabitants do salat (praying) every day. THR users are banned from doing salat for fear it will damage the hip <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses.</b> The previous wear calculation methods on the hip <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses</b> use the gravimetric, coordinate measuring machine (CMM), profiler, and geometric method. The disadvantages of the previous methods are that the geometry of the wear patch and the wear volume are only known at the end of the experiment, so they cannot be used to calculate the specific wear rate values in real time. So far, in every modeling of the hip <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses,</b> the values of the specific wear rate are assumed to be constant. This paper reports on the design modification of a pin-on-ring tribometer that is used to measure the wear volumes in hip <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses.</b> The result shows that modifications of the femoral head holder, reciprocating motion, elastic joint, and extra displacement transducer is needed to get the specific wear rate value. The calculation method to find the delta volume that is the value of displacement less than the displacement minimum (δmin) is based on a graph, while the calculation method to find the delta volume that is the value of displacement that is more than the displacement minimum (δmin) is based on an equation.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{implantation}} of <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses,</b> {{especially for}} the hip and knee, is becoming increasingly common. This provides {{a significant reduction in}} discomfort and an immeasurable improvement in patient mobility. Reviews of the worldwide literature indicate that 1 to 5 % of these prostheses become infected, although {{it is important to remember}} that as the number of operations performed to implant these prosthesis increases, so will the number of cases of this type of infection. Gram-positive bacteria predominate in contaminations of <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses,</b> in particular Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Infections caused by gram-negative bacilli and fungi such as Candida sp have been reported with increased frequency throughout the world. Infections of <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses</b> present characteristic signs that can be divided into acute manifestations (severe pain, high fever, toxemia, heat, redness and wound secretions) and chronic manifestations (progressive pain, cutaneous fistula formation and pus drainage, without fever). The definitive diagnosis of the infection should be made through cultures to isolate the microorganism, using material collected from joint fluid puncture, surgical wound secretions, and surgical debridement. It is essential to cover for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, given the epidemiological importance of this agent in these infections. The total duration of antibiotic therapy ranges from six weeks to six months, and this treatment should be adjusted as needed, based on the results from culturing...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} 1) {{the efficacy}} of packing autologous fat grafts around temporomandibular joint (TMJ) total joint prosthetic reconstructions to prevent fibrosis and heterotopic bone formation and 2) the effects on postsurgical joint mobility and jaw function. One hundred fifteen patients (5 males and 110 females) underwent TMJ reconstruction with total <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses</b> and simultaneous fat grafts (88 bilateral and 27 unilateral) {{for a total of}} 203 joints. The abdominal fat grafts were packed around the articulating portion of the <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses</b> after the fossa and mandibular components were stabilized. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 76 joints) received Christensen total <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses,</b> and group 2 (n = 127 joints) received TMJ Concepts total <b>joint</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Clinical and radiographic assessments were performed before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at long-term follow-up. In group 1, maximal incisal opening (MIO) increased 3. 5 mm, lateral excursions (LE) decreased 0. 2 mm, and jaw function improved 1. 9 levels. In group 2, MIO increased 6. 8 mm, LE decreased 1. 4 mm, and jaw function improved 2. 4 levels. The improvement for MIO and patient perception of jaw function in both groups was statistically significant; no significant difference was found for LE. There was no radiographic or clinical evidence of heterotopic calcifications or limitation of mobility secondary to fibrosis in either group. Twenty-five Christensen prostheses (33 %) were removed because of device failure and/or metal hypersensitivity; no fibrosis or heterotopic bone formation was seen at surgical removal. Four TMJ Concepts prostheses (3 %) were removed because of metal hypersensitivity. In all instances, removal of the prostheses was unrelated to the autologous fat grafting. Ten patients (8. 7 %) developed complications involving the fat donor site: two patients (1. 8 %) developed abdominal cysts requiring surgery, and eight patients (6. 9 %) developed seroma formation requiring aspiration. Autologous fat transplantation is a useful adjunct to prosthetic TMJ reconstruction to minimize the occurrence of excessive joint fibrosis and heterotopic calcification, consequently providing improved range of motion and jaw function...|$|R
