Two exposures have to be accurately aligned on each other within 150 nm. The first exposure uses EPS lithography and defines the gate length in a negative resist.

An improved technique, statistical metrology, combines novel experimental design with statistical and physical filtering to increase resolution dramatically. It is now possible to precisely quantify the error contributions of individual steps within a complex interdependent process sequence, and to design for manufacturability (DFM). Statistical metrology {{has been applied to}} a 0. 35 -micron lithography process. Reticle, stepper, and develop track errors were extracted from electrical critical dimension (CD) measurements.

This technology uses mmolecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow the InGaAs/AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure with two pulse doping layers on 3 inch semiisolating GaAs wafers. A mix and match lithography was applied using an <b>i-line</b> <b>stepper</b> and an eledtron beam diect write process to define the mushroom shaped gates (T-gates).

40|$|Grating {{couplers}} {{are widely}} used as an efficient and versatile fiber-chip coupling structure in nanometric silicon wire waveguides. The implementation of efficient grating couplers in micrometric silicon-on-insulator (SOI) rib waveguides is, however, challenging, since the coupler waveguide region is multimode. Here we experimentally demonstrate grating couplers in 1 : 5 ?m-thick SOI rib waveguides with a coupling efficiency of ? 2 : 2 dB and a 3 dB bandwidth of 40 nm. An inverse taper is used to adiabatically transform the interconnection waveguide mode to the optimum grating coupler excitation field with negligible higher order Bloch mode excitation. Couplers are fabricated in the same etch step as the waveguides using <b>i-line</b> <b>stepper</b> lithography. The benefits of wafer-scale testing and device characterization without facet preparation are thus attained at no additional cost. 9 2011 Optical Society of America.

All lithography is performed with a 365 nm <b>i-line</b> <b>stepper,</b> facilitating low cost and high scalability. We have shown low-loss SiN waveguides, high-Q ring resonators, critically coupled ring resonators, 50 / 50 beam splitters, Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) and a process-agnostic fiber packaging scheme. We have further explored the utility of this process for applications in nonlinear optics and quantum photonics. We demonstrate spectral tailoring and octave-spanning supercontinuum generation {{as well as the}} integration of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors with MZIs and channel-dropping filters. The packaging approach is suitable for operation up to 160 C as well as below 1 K. The process is well suited for augmentation of existing foundry capabilities or as a stand-alone process.

40|$|Very {{high voltage}} {{breakdown}} pHEMTs {{have been successfully}} developed by implementing a field-plate (FP) gate structure. Devices with and without FP, in which the FP is simply connected to the gate contact, have been fabricated on the same wafer in order to compare the improvements induced by adopting the FP. As expected FP devices showed smaller drain current dispersion than standard devices under pulsed DC measurement conditions. Moreover off-state breakdown voltage improved from - 25 V, for the devices without FP, up to - 40 V for the field-plated devices.

40|$|We review our {{advances}} in diffractive and subwavelength grating coupler structures for microphotonic waveguides. We present a subwavelength grating fiber-chip edge coupler {{with a loss}} as low as 0. 9 dB and with minimal wavelength dependence over a broad wavelength range exceeding 200 nm. We also present fiber-to-chip surface grating couplers based on subwavelength effective medium. The effective medium refractive index is engineered to control {{the strength of the}} grating and thereby maximize coupling efficiency, while mitigating back reflections at the same time. We analyze the fabrication tolerances of the coupler, which are of particular relevance for large scale photonic fabrication. Furthermore, we present the first grating coupler for micrometric silicon rib waveguides, which is particularly challenging since the coupler waveguide region is multimode. We experimentally demonstrate grating couplers in 1. 5 3 ̆bcm thick silicon ridge waveguides with a coupling efficiency of 2. 2 dB and a 3 dB bandwidth of 40 nm. An inverse taper is used to match the fundamental mode of the interconnection waveguide with the optimum grating coupler excitation field, with negligible higher order mode excitation.

40|$|In the {{photolithographic}} process, {{critical dimensions}} (CD) of exposed features in photoresist {{need to be}} controlled to within a specified tolerance related to the nominal feature size. A portion of this tolerance budget is consumed by variations in CD on the photomask. At low k 1 factor, a number of parameters in the lithography system impact linearity including lens aberrations, defocus, exposure, partial coherence, and photoresist contrast. The combined effect of these parameters is that errors in the mask CDs are not transferred to the wafer {{in direct proportion to}} the optical reduction value of the lithography system. This Mask Error Factor (MEF) becomes a significant problem as it consumes a larger than anticipated portion of the CD tolerance budget. This paper will discuss experimentally evaluated MEF using a 4 X <b>i-line</b> <b>stepper</b> for a range of feature sizes from subwavelength to approximately twice the exposure wavelength. A test reticle was built with isolated lines from 200 nm to 600 nm in 12. 5 nm increments at 1 X. CD measurements on the reticle were compared to corresponding CD measurements on the wafer in order to establish both linearity and MEF curves for the lithography system. MEF values were also determined across a process window for multiple feature sizes. The MEF was observed to be less than 1. 4 for CDs greater than 330 nm (k 1 = 0. 5) throughout the process window. However, the MEF rises rapidly to over 3 for CD values smaller than 300 nm (k 1 = 0. 45) at nominal focus and exposure. Changes in exposure were not observed to have a noticeable impact on MEF while focus offsets were observed to result in significant increases in MEF. These results indicate that MEF has a much larger impact on focus latitude than on exposure latitude. As a result the process window will be compressed more in focus than in exposure...|$|E
40|$|Silicon nanowire-based metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect {{transistors}} (SiNW MOSFETs) havebeen demonstrated excellent {{sensitivity and}} stability after surface modification and functionalization ofnanowires. Chemical molecules {{have been applied}} to functionalize the surface of silicon surface. Silanecoupling agents are good candidates for forming self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) by chemicallyinteracting with silicon oxide. Those chemically modified SAMs can provide a functional surface tofurther conjugate biomolecules on SiNW MOSFETs. After functionalization, SiNW MOSFETs withtunably biocompatible surface can sustain a functional biointerface for biological tests. In this work,SiNW MOSFETs were fabricated using the standard <b>I-line</b> <b>stepper</b> of MOS semiconducting process andthen visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The n-type SiNW MOSFETs devices werefabricated after the process of trimming, the scale of nanowire was down {{to a level of}} approximate 165 nm. 3 -aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (APTMS) and 3 -mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) SAMs wereindependently used to modify the surface of SiNW MOSFETs for pH sensing in biological buffer solution. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) were appliedto characterize before and after surface modification. AFM found APTMS and MPTMS were successfullymodified on silicon substrates. The average vertical length of APTMS and MPTMS SAMs from our AFMobservation was around 2. 628 nm and 2. 698 nm, respectively. ESCA showed the specifically functionalamino (-NH 2) groups and mercapto (-SH) groups on each APTMS and MPTMS modified silicon substrates. The specific amine functional group at 399. 4 eV occurred after the modification of APTMS on siliconsubstrate in N 1 s spectra. S 2 p spectra showed the specific binding at 163. 6 eV (C-SH) and 165. 8 eV (-C-SS-C-) after the modification of MPTMS on silicon substrate. Those disulfide bonds further influenced theorganization of MPTMS-SAM on the surface; therefore, the APTMS had better SAM performance on oursilicon substrate. On the other hand, electrical measuring system was used for elucidating that the suitablesurface modification would have great impact on the sensing response and sensitivity. Varied biologicalPBS solutions at different pH values showed that unmodified SiNW MOSFETs were sensitive to theH+ ion change. When the pH level of the solution increased, the drain current of the unmodified SiNWMOSFETs decreased accordingly. In comparison with unmodified nanowires in current measurement,the changes of current of APTMS or MPTMS modified nanowires were enhanced in sensing of differentpH solutions. Our results also showed that amino and mercapto groups of APTMS and MPTMS canimprove the protonation and deprotonation reactions in different pH solutions. Both APTMS and MPTMSmodified SiNW MOSFETs in pH sensings possessed good electrical sensing response and sensitivity incontrast with unmodified one. Moreover, in consequence of lower mercaptal groups of MPTMS on NWs,the relatively minor signal responses to varied pH solutions in MPTMS modified SiNW MOSFETs. Theelectrical measurement showed that the amino groups of APTMS significantly improve the sensitivity ofSiNW MOSFET in different pH sensings. Our results showed that adequate modification could provide afunctionable surface for SiNW MOSFETs. We inferred the APTMS modified SiNW MOSFETs could be areal-time sensor for different pH levels detection and further applied in monitoring biological environmentin the future...|$|E
