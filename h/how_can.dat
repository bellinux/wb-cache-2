The paper argues that markets will often supply adequate customer protection {{without the need}} for extra public intervention. Special areas where intervention might be needed are discussed, including the need to combat deceptive marketing and the need to provide additional market transparency (about both headline prices and shrouded product attributes). A few instances are presented of how more intense competition can worsen the outcomes for (some) consumers. Situations in which poorly designed consumer policies can harm consumers are discussed, including <b>how</b> they <b>can</b> be used to protect incumbent suppliers, <b>how</b> they <b>can</b> relax competition between oligopolists, <b>how</b> they <b>can</b> reduce consumer choice, <b>how</b> they <b>can</b> focus on one aspect of market performance at the expense of others, and <b>how</b> they <b>can</b> lead consumers to take insufficient care in the market. ...|$|R
