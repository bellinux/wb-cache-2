60|$|To relieve {{my friend}} from his embarrassment, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch and urged {{that we should}} walk in the {{direction}} of the Admiralty, as the hour for my interview had nearly arrived.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> field-glass and {{directed}} it {{at a little}} speck high above our heads. It was the basket floating high in the air. I gave the glass to my wife to look, {{but she did not}} want to use it.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch, which I had {{forgotten}} to wind; and found it run down. The hands stood at twenty minutes past four. Daylight, then, could not be far off. Eighteen hours--say twenty: and Byfield had guessed our rate at one time to be thirty miles an hour. Five hundred miles---- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A nose, my father;" [...] I replied, greatly softened, [...] "has been {{variously}} {{defined by}} about a thousand different authors." [...] [Here <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch.] [...] "It is now noon or thereabouts--we shall have time enough to get through with them all before midnight. To commence then:--The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that protuberance--that bump--that excrescence--that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'O'Day,' says I, 'of the Columbia Detective Agency. And now, sir, let me {{give you}} a piece of good advice. You go back and take your {{medicine}} like a man. Hand 'em back the boodle; and maybe they'll let you off light. Go back easy, and I'll put in a word for you. I'll give you five minutes to decide.' <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch and waited.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{thank you}} so much!" [...] I cried, with heartfelt gratitude, leaning {{out of the window}} as the train was on the point of starting. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> purse, and drew timidly forth a sovereign. [...] "I've only English money," [...] I said, hesitating, for I didn't know whether he'd be {{offended}} or not at the offer of a tip--he seemed such a perfect gentleman. [...] "But if that's any use to you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said <b>I,</b> hurriedly, <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> typewritten play. [...] "She's {{no doubt}} a charming girl. Now, here's that little curtain-raiser you promised to listen to." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now I could by {{no means}} like her project; I though it looked too much like {{prompting}} him, which indeed he did not want, and I clearly saw that I should lose nothing by being backward to ask, so I took her up short. 'I can't image why he should say so to you,' said I, 'for I assure you he brought me all the money I sent him for, and here it is,' said <b>I</b> (<b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> purse with about twelve guineas in it); and added, 'I intend you shall have most of it by and by.' ...|$|R
60|$|Rho. By that I {{should be}} a very covetous person; for <b>I</b> am ever <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> money, and putting it into my pocket again.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> measure, and {{applying}} {{it to the}} prostrate carcass, found that the gorilla we had now shot was five feet eight inches in height, and proportionately large round the chest. It {{seemed to be a}} mass of sinews and hard muscles, and as I gazed at its massive limbs I could well imagine that it had strength sufficient to perform many, at least, if not all of the wonderful feats ascribed to it by the natives.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> pencil, tore a leaf from my note-book, and {{scribbled}} a hasty note to Hilda: [...] "The invalid is--whom do you think?--Sebastian! He is dangerously {{ill with}} some malignant fever. I am bringing him down into camp to nurse. Get everything ready for him." [...] Then I {{handed it over}} to a messenger, found for me by the retired gentleman, to carry to Hilda. My host himself I could not spare, as he was my only interpreter.|$|E
60|$|At first I saw nobody; but {{feeling a}} {{pressure}} against the door, I looked round it, and there, to my amazement, were Mr. Peggotty and Ham, ducking {{at me with}} their hats, and squeezing one another against the wall. I could not help laughing; but {{it was much more}} in the pleasure of seeing them, than at the appearance they made. We shook hands in a very cordial way; and I laughed and laughed, until <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> pocket-handkerchief and wiped my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} then that I thought {{it time to}} put my pipe in my pocket, for, you see, I had been havin' a puff on the sly as we was bearin' down; an' I put up my fore-finger to shove the baccy down, when one o' them stingin' little things comes along, whips <b>my</b> best cutty <b>out</b> o' <b>my</b> mouth, an' carries the finger along with it. Of coorse I warn't goin' below for such a small matter, so <b>I</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> hankerchief, an' says I to the little man that lost his hat, `Just take a round turn here, Jim,' says I, `an' I'll be ready for action again in two minutes.' Jim, he tied it up, but before he quite done it, the round shot was pitchin' into us like hail, cuttin' up the sails and riggin' most awful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello Haught," [...] was my greeting, as <b>I</b> {{dismounted}} and <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch. [...] "I'm {{four hours}} and a quarter late. Sorry. I could have made it, but didn't {{want to leave the}} wagons." ...|$|R
6000|$|That {{settled the}} question. [...] "You {{are a good}} and an honest girl," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> purse; [...] "and you came to this misfortune through trying--too eagerly--to help the young lady. A ten-pound note is not overmuch as {{compensation}} for your accident. Take it, and get well. I should be sorry to think you lost a good place through your anxiety to help us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘My dear friend,’ said I, ‘for God’s sake do not embarrass me {{with more}} alms. I loved to receive them from that hand, {{so long as}} they were needed; but they are so no more, and {{whatever}} else I may lack—and I lack everything—it is not money.’ <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> sheaf of notes and detached the top one: it was written for ten pounds, and signed by that very famous individual, Abraham Newlands. ‘Oblige me, as you would like me to oblige your brother if the parts were reversed, and take this note for the expenses. I shall need not only food, but clothes.’ ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{could not}} refrain {{contributing}} tears to this man's story, so neither could I refrain my charity for his assistance. So I called him, 'Hark thee, friend,' said I, 'come hither, for I believe thou art in health, that I may venture thee'; so <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> hand, {{which was in}} my pocket before, 'Here,' says I, 'go and call thy Rachel once more, {{and give her a}} little more comfort from me. God will never forsake a family that trust in Him as thou dost.' So I gave him four other shillings, and bid him go lay them on the stone and call his wife.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, observe, I hadn't {{given him}} my name {{at all and}} his {{question}} embarrassed me a bit. Somehow or other it didn't seem proper for me to fling his own name at him as it were. So <b>I</b> merely <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> new certificate from my pocket {{and put it into}} his hand unfolded, so that he could read Charles Powell written very plain on the parchment.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a desire}} for {{emotional}} union with the subject matter {{can be described as}} a general characteristic of Korean poetry, Chae departs radically from such a tendency to seek instead the complete obliteration of the boundary between the subject and the language in his poetry. His first volume of poetry, Ferocious Love, rejects love as an idea and an emotional state and focuses on its physicality and mortality: “like the train daggering into the dark cave of your body/ Blue blade pierces death/ This ferocious love/Burying your casket in my womb/ So I bury my casket in your womb.” Desire itself is objectified and given a physicality in The Sad Gay, in which a gay man transforms himself into another being through the mechanical process of replacing body parts: “Your two eyes on <b>my</b> palm/ <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> eyes and inserts them into the sockets./ ([...] [...])/ Plucking all my hair out/ I cover my head with your hair” ...|$|R
60|$|After a full hearing, the {{alderman}} gave it as {{his opinion}} that his neighbour was under a mistake, and that I was innocent, and the goldsmith acquiesced in it too, and his wife, and so I was dismissed; but as I was going to depart, Mr. Alderman said, 'But hold, madam, if you were designing to buy spoons, I hope you will not let my friend here lose his customer by the mistake.' I readily answered, 'No, sir, I'll buy the spoons still, if he can match my odd spoon, which I brought for a pattern'; and the goldsmith showed {{me some of the}} very same fashion. So he weighed the spoons, and they came to five-and-thirty shillings, so <b>I</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> purse to pay him, in which I had near twenty guineas, for I never went without such a sum about me, whatever might happen, and I found it of use at other times as well as now.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{get rid of}} his {{insolence}} for a while, <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> {{purse and}} handed him a shilling. It was a George II. with milled edges, not like the things I see you use now. He held it {{up and looked at}} it, and then he said again, 'Look here, you know, this isn't good. You'd better come along with me straight to the station, and not make a fuss about it. There's three charges against you, that's all. One is, that you're drunk. The second is, that you're mad. And the third is, that you've been trying to utter false coin. Any one of 'em's quite enough to justify me in takin' you into custody.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "At {{last the}} crisis came. One Saturday night I had paid the men as usual, {{and bought a}} muid of mealie meal at sixty shillings for them to fill {{themselves}} with, and then I went with my boy Harry {{and sat on the}} edge of the great hole that we had dug in the hill-side, and which we had in bitter mockery named Eldorado. There we sat in the moonlight with our feet over the edge of the claim, and were melancholy enough for anything. Presently <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> purse and emptied its contents into my hand. There was a half-sovereign, two florins, ninepence in silver, no coppers--for copper practically does not circulate in South Africa, which is one of the things that make living so dear there--in all exactly fourteen and ninepence.|$|E
500|$|... "You see, the Associated Press article announcing this prestigious award, {{written by}} one Heather Clark, had a glaring omission: me," [...] Colbert said during his show Monday.

40|$|This is {{the time}} of year I {{celebrate}} Earth Day, and <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> tattered copy of Henry David Thoreau’s Walden. In a world that’s losing its rain forests, where hundreds of species are becoming extinct every year, where our polluted oceans are losing the ability to sustain fish populations, and where glaciers are melting at unprecedented rates, it becomes all that more important for each of us to reconnect ourselves with the natural world. Prior to Earth Day, I observe Good Friday, and on that day I ponder the following distressing questions: Is humanity really walking in darkness to the extent that if God would appear to us, we would fail to recognize him? Not only would we fail to recognize him, but would we actually torture and execute God like a common criminal? Is humanity’s ignorance really that deep? These are the questions that present themselves on Good Friday, and their significance {{has nothing to do with}} whether or not we believe the story of Good Friday. It is the mythological meaning that I am asking you to ponder, and given the direction our world seems to be headed, I regrettably must answer these questions in the affirmative...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, very well,' {{answered}} the seaman; 'exceedingly well--like a tight ship in a brisk gale. Let me recollect. I remember thanking Jack, very composedly, for the interesting and agreeable communication; <b>I</b> then <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> canvas pouch, with my hoard of moidores, and taking out two pieces, I bid Jack keep the rest till I came back, as I {{was for a}} cruise about Auld Reekie. The poor devil looked anxiously, but I shook him by the hand, and ran downstairs, in such confusion of mind, that notwithstanding what I had heard, I expected to meet Jess at every turning.|$|R
6000|$|... "I vaulted {{up to the}} sill. Thank heaven, I was athletic. Not a {{soul was}} about: but I heard a noise of muffled voices in the other rooms behind. Treading cat-like across the floor, I turned {{the key in the}} lock. A chalk mark still showed the {{position}} of the pistol on the ground exactly as you flung it. The box was on the table, and I saw at a glance, the wires which connected it with the battery had never been disconnected. I was afraid of receiving a shock if I touched them with my hands, and I had no time to waste in discovering electrical attachments. So <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> knife, and you can fancy with what trembling hands I cut that wire on either side and released the box from its dangerous connections. I knew only too well the force of that current. Then I took the thing under my arm, leaped from the window once more, and ran across the shrubbery towards the spot where I'd left my bicycle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay, my lord," [...] {{said the}} youth. [...] "I {{went on in}} my dream, till, {{at the top of}} a broad green alley, I saw a noble stag which had fallen into the toils; and methought I knew that he was the very stag which the whole party were hunting, and that if the chase came up, the dogs would tear him to pieces, or the hunters would cut his throat; and I had pity on the gallant stag, and though I was of a {{different}} kind from him, and though I was somewhat afraid of him, I thought I would venture something to free so stately a creature; and <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> knife, and just as I was beginning to cut the meshes of the net, the animal started up in my face in the likeness of a tiger, much larger and fiercer than any you may have seen in the ward of the wild beasts yonder, and was just about to tear me limb from limb, when you awaked me." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I {{wondered}} how long I had to live. I tried to examine myself. I felt my pulse. I could not at first feel any pulse at all. Then, all of a sudden, it seemed to start off. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> watch and timed it. I made it a hundred and forty-seven to the minute. I tried to feel my heart. I could not feel my heart. It had stopped beating. I have since been induced {{to come to the}} opinion that it must have been there all the time, and must have been beating, but I cannot account for it. I patted myself all over my front, from what I call my waist up to my head, and I went a bit round each side, and a little way up the back. But I could not feel or hear anything. I tried to look at my tongue. I stuck it out as far as ever it would go, and I shut one eye, and tried to examine it with the other. I could only see the tip, {{and the only thing that}} I could gain from that was to feel more certain than before that I had scarlet fever.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do I find at the Dugans' but Mame all {{conspicuous}} {{in a blue}} travelling dress, {{with her}} little trunk at the door. It seems that sister Lottie Bell, who is a typewriter in Terre Haute, {{is going to be}} married next Thursday, and Mame is off for a week's visit to be an accomplice at the ceremony. Mame is waiting for a freight wagon that is going to take her to Oklahoma, but I condemns the freight wagon with promptness and scorn, and offers to deliver the goods myself. Ma Dugan sees no reason why not, as Mr. Freighter wants pay for the job; so, thirty minutes later Mame and <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> in <b>my</b> light spring wagon with white canvas cover, and head due south.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} a [...] towards rappers Eazy-E, Dre's former {{accomplice}} {{from the group}} N.W.A; Tim Dog, an East Coast rapper who slighted the whole West Coast rap scene and released an incendiary diss track towards N.W.A titled [...] "Fuck Compton"; and Luther (Luke) Campbell from 2 Live Crew, whose track [...] "Fakin' Like Gangstas" [...] from his debut solo album I Got Shit On My Mind, featuring JT Money from the group Poison Clan, was taken personally for making references {{to some of the}} popular rappers in the [...] "gangsta" [...] category (specifically referring to N.W.A). There were also some lyrics alluding to former N.W.A rapper Ice Cube, who departed acrimoniously from the group in 1989 and ridiculed Dre on the track [...] "No Vaseline", off his 1991 Death Certificate album. The lyrics: [...] "Then we gon creep to South Central, On a Street Knowledge mission, as I steps in the temple, Spot him, got him, as <b>I</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>my</b> strap, Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat, You tryin to check my homey, you best check yo self, Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself" [...] had references to Cube's production operation Street Knowledge Productions (now Lench Mob Records), the lyrics [...] "steps in the temple" [...] referring to Ice Cube's affiliation with the Nation of Islam and his hit single [...] "Check Yo Self" [...] from third album The Predator. However, by the album's release, Ice Cube was on friendlier terms with Dr. Dre, even having a cameo appearance in [...] "Let Me Ride", so unlike Eazy-E and Luke, he was not parodied in the music video.|$|R
5000|$|DiMarco's oral {{histories}} include Tower Stories: An Oral History of 9/11, which chronicles the September 11 attacks in 2001, from diversified {{perspectives on the}} destruction of the World Trade Center.
