5|$|Kirchner's health {{first became}} {{a topic of}} public concern in 2005 when Noticias {{magazine}} reported that she might suffer from bipolar disorder. Journalist Franco Lindner interviewed the psychiatrist who treated her without revealing his name. Journalist Nelson Castro investigated further and discovered that the psychiatrist was Alejandro Lagomarsino, who died in 2011. Lagomarsino was the leading specialist {{in the treatment of}} bipolar disorder in Argentina. Castro's investigation revealed that Kirchner was treated by Lagomarsino for a short period. He could not determine the length of her treatment or the medicine she received, or whether another psychiatrist continued treating her or not. Castro considers that some of her outlandish phrases or projects, and her frequent periods of hiding from public view, may be explained by the disorder's periods of mania and depression, as well as being a regular political strategy. Eduardo Duhalde said that Néstor Kirchner once confided in him that she had a bipolar disorder, while she was having a violent outburst. During the United States diplomatic cables leak it was revealed that Hillary Clinton questioned Kirchner's mental health and asked the US embassy whether she was receiving treatment or not; she later apologized to Kirchner for those leaks. Kirchner said in her book La Presidenta that it was all a misunderstanding; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> sister who suffers from bipolar disorder.|$|E
5|$|Rambles in Germany and Italy, in 1840, 1842, and 1843 is {{a travel}} {{narrative}} by the British Romantic author Mary Shelley. Issued in 1844, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> last published work. Published in two volumes, the text describes two European trips that Mary Shelley took with her son, Percy Florence Shelley, {{and several of}} his university friends. Mary Shelley had lived in Italy with her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, between 1818 and 1823. For her, Italy was associated with both joy and grief: she had written much while there but she had also lost her husband and two of her children. Thus, although she was anxious to return, the trip was tinged with sorrow. Shelley describes her journey as a pilgrimage, which will help cure her depression.|$|E

5|$|The current {{champion}} is Princesa Sugehit, who defeated Zeuxis on February 25, 2017 {{to win the}} championship. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> first reign {{with the}} title, she is the 20th champion since the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission sanctioned the championship, and the 29th documented champion overall. Martha Villalobos holds {{the record for the}} longest verified individual reign with 1,399 days while Lady Apache's two reigns combine for 1,470 days the longest verified reign of any champion. Due to the undocumented periods prior to 1986 it is possible that someone else has actually held the championship longer, but no verification of such a fact has been found. Isabel Romero has held the title three times, the most for any champion, while five women have held the championship twice since it was officially sanctioned in 1986; Lady Apache, La Sirenita, Tiffany, Martha Villalobos and Zuleyma. La Diabólica holds the record for the shortest documented title reign, with 50 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E
5|$|Traveling across Filgaia, {{the heroes}} {{make their way}} to the long-abandoned Guardian Temple to gain the {{alliance}} of the mystical guardians who maintain the forces of nature across the planet. There they are tested individually. After each of them fails their personal tests of character, the Guardians reluctantly agree to aid them. The Guardians tell Rudy and his companions that the demons have already begun to revive their leader, and have only to lift the seal on her cocoon-like prison by destroying the three scattered statues that lie across Filgaia. Utilizing ancient Elw technology in the form of teleportation devices, the group travels the world to stop the Quarter Knights from destroying the statues, but they fail in each attempt. The consequent resurrection of Mother occurs, yet the demons are informed by their leader that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> intention to eradicate Filgaia rather than subjugate it and tells her followers that their own deaths will follow soon after.|$|E

They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body.
