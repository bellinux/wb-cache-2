In 2011 the volume of water supplied by the country’s 27 desalination plants at 17 locations was 3.3 million m3/day (1.2 billion m3/year). 6 plants are located on the East Coast and 21 plants on the Red Sea Coast. 12 plants use multi-stage <b>flash</b> <b>distillation</b> (MSF) and 7 plants use multi-effect distillation (MED). Both MSF and MED plants are integrated with power plants (dual-purpose plants), using steam from the power plants {{as a source of}} energy. 8 plants are single-purpose plants that use reverse osmosis (RO) technology and power from the grid.

Consumers demand for healthier products as well as stiff environmental legislation are forcing refining industries towards changes and improvement of processes. In this context, this thesis has as main objective to investigate/improve the physical refining of vegetable oils, emphasizing the bleaching step. As first step, a HPLC methodology for simultaneous quantification of carotenes and tocols was developed and validated, and lately, it was used by our research groups. Then, bleaching step of palm oil, nowadays the most consumed oil in the world, was studied under different aspects: (1) determining kinetics, equilibrium and thermodynamic parameters of adsorptive removal of carotenes and phosphorus onto acid activated bleaching earth; (2) influence of different procedures on final color of palm oil; (3) influence of bleaching earth kind on final color of palm oil. These studies were important for a better understanding of bleaching process of palm oil, and some conclusions were obtained: adsorptive removal of carotenes and phosphorus onto acid activated bleaching earth occurs by chemisorption and it is endothermic; new procedures in the bleaching step can improve final color of palm oil when using the same amount of bleaching earth and deodorization time; a hypothesis was proposed to explain how the kind of bleaching earth can interfere in the final color of palm oil. Further studies are still necessary to optimize bleaching step and the new procedures suggested. Later, physical deacidification was studied by computer simulation and experimental data from literature. It was compared two mathematical approaches: differential and <b>flash</b> <b>distillations.</b> This last one presented better results regarding acidity and neutral oil loss profiles. In this approach, it was considered the heat transfer equations. In this way, this thesis presents an advance in refining process towards high quality products and the use of less chemicals...|$|R

30|$|Compared {{with the}} {{fractionation}} operation, blending {{is more effective}} since it is simpler and more cost-effective. Blending operation can be classified into the following two cases. One {{is to put the}} light component oil into the heavy one, and the other the opposite, putting the heavy component oil into the light one. There are a variety of indicators to evaluate the quality of refined products, such as oxidation stability, sulfur content, octane number, ash, copper corrosion, moisture, mechanical impurities, lubricity, kinematic viscosity, pour point, cold filter plugging point, <b>flash</b> point, <b>distillation</b> range, density. The quality of the original oil is no doubt affected by the blending operation. The blending capacity means that maximum volume of contaminated oil can be treated under the premise of ensuring the oil’s standard. In actual production, due to production parameters, material ratio and other differences, the same kind of oil produced at different times will also have some differences. In other words, the oil may have different blending capacities. Considering the nonlinear effects of the blending oil on the physical properties and the mixing of different kinds of oils with different physical properties in a tank, the problem is more complex.|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{global demand}} for fresh water {{is driving the}} {{development}} and implementation of a wide variety of seawater desalination technologies. Entropy generation analysis, and specifically, Second Law efficiency, is an important tool for illustrating the influence of irreversibilities within a system on the required energy input. When defining Second Law efficiency, the useful exergy output of the system must be properly defined. For desalination systems, this is the minimum least work of separation required to extract a unit of water from a feed stream of a given salinity. In order to evaluate the Second Law efficiency, entropy generation mechanisms present in a wide range of desalination processes are analyzed. In particular, entropy generated in the run down to equilibrium of discharge streams must be considered. Physical models are applied to estimate the magnitude of entropy generation by component and individual processes. These formulations are applied to calculate the total entropy generation in several desalination systems including multiple effect <b>distillation,</b> multistage <b>flash,</b> membrane <b>distillation,</b> mechanical vapor compression, reverse osmosis, and humidification-dehumidification. Within each technology, the relative importance of each source of entropy generation is discussed in order to determine which should be the target of entropy generation minimization. As given here, the correct application of Second Law efficiency shows which systems operate closest to the reversible limit and helps to indicate which systems have the greatest potential for improvement.

40|$|The {{multi-stage}} <b>flash</b> (MSF) <b>distillation</b> {{process in}} the Arab Gulf Region is superceding other conventional desalting processes. Although the MSF process was introduced {{more than forty years}} ago, the development of the process has been evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Research and development efforts were mainly directed towards the control of scale formation on heat transfer tubes by developments and dose rate optimization of scale inhibiting chemicals and adoption of on-line sponge ball cleaning. Other areas of R&D are selection of appropriate construction materials, increase of unit capacity and improvements of the quality and variety of control and instrumentation. The MSF process is an energy intensive process that is associated with high irreversibility. Although coupling the water production with power generation in a dual purpose arrangement reduces the specific fuel energy consumption for water production to around 60 kWh/m 3 which is 50 percent less than that required by single purpose water production desalting plant, it is still much larger than that required by an ideal reversible desalination process. The specific energy consumption of the MSF process can be reduced either by the use of innovative modifications in conventional power cycles and/or by reducing the irreversibility of the MSF process through the improvements in the design and operating features of the distiller. Accumulated design and operating experiences of the MSF process are effectively utilized for the quest of an improved process design and operation. MSF configuration...|$|R

Here we show that a simple reformulation allows us to handle the disappearance or reappearance of phases and thus allows us to solve a wider class of process problems. The proposed strategy uses a penalty function approach, called Penalty Simulation of Nonsmooth Algebraic Terms and Attributes (P-SONATA), to accomodate the nonsmooth nature of the system. To solve the vapor-liquid equilibrium problem, we also extend the theoretical results of the approach of Bullard and Biegler (1991) to characterize descent and convergence properties for P-SONATA. The performance of this formulation is demonstrated for process models involving phase equilibrium, such as transitions from one and two phases in <b>flash</b> and <b>distillation</b> problems, where mass and energy balances must be satisfied but the phase equilibrium expression can be relaxed. Isothermal flash problems with ideal and nonideal phase equilibrium relations are considered {{as well as a}} case which exhibits retrograde condensation behavior near the critical point. Finally, we examine limiting distillation cases including columns operating below the minimum reflux ratio (resulting in dry trays) and below the minimum reboiler heat duty (resulting in vaporless trays). Finally, we develop convergence properties for P-SONATA and discuss additional classes for nonsmooth problems. The results demonstrate that this approach is straightforward to implement, captures a wider range of phase equilibrium behavior, and otherwise performs competitively with conventional Newton-based approaches. 2 ̆...|$|R
