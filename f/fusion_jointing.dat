40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. In the {{automotive}} industry, {{there is a}} big push to improve performance, fuel efficiency and other tailor-made engineering properties of vehicles. Manufacturers are now looking at other better, lightweight materials like magnesium and aluminum to use alongside steel. Traditional joining methods like welding are not suitable for these dissimilar materials. The friction stir forming process was developed and was able to create a single-pin <b>fusion</b> <b>joint</b> between aluminum and steel. This research now focuses on the issues that stemmed from the newly developed friction stir forming process. The first part studies the corrosion that occurred due to the usage of dissimilar metals. Friction stir formed samples were deployed to three different test sites, each with different atmospheric conditions for an 8 -month period. The corrosion products were characterized and the effects of these were related to the mechanical properties of the joints. Zinc was discovered to be the first metal to be attacked, followed by aluminum, and formed corrosion products in the joint. Higher chloride concentrations proved to be a more corrosive environment. Corrosion caused significant decrease in the strength of the joints. The second part of the research aimed to change the structure and makeup of the previous single-pin <b>fusion</b> <b>joint.</b> By developing a new anvil and the usage of a different tool, a new joint called the clinch joint was produced. The optimal parameters for the friction stir clinching process were determined. The clinch joint is a mechanical interlock and its mechanical properties were compared to the previous single-pin <b>fusion</b> <b>joint.</b> The clinch joint had slightly lower shear strength but had more toughness compared to the single-pin <b>fusion</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|R
30|$|Fusion {{welding process}} uses the heat source such as arc, laser, and {{electron}} beam to heat and melt the materials to be joined. Although perpetual joint with acceptable tensile strength can be attained in some cases, fusion welding still has inherent disadvantages. Due {{to the influence}} of high temperature thermal cycle by centralized heat source during fusion welding, solidification problems, such as as-cast microstructure and weld defects are always occurred in the weld seams as reported by Kou [6], Li et al. [7] and Chen et al. [8]. This non-homogeneous microstructure combined with weld defects and residual stresses is probably harmful to the mechanical performance of <b>fusion</b> <b>joints,</b> especially to the fatigue property [8 – 10]. Thus, time-consuming and costly post-weld heat treatment has to be adopted sometimes to improve the comprehensive mechanical properties of <b>fusion</b> <b>joints</b> [11 – 13].|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has a multi-year {{program at}} the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to provide {{engineering}} studies and assessments of {{issues related to the}} use of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods for the reliable inspection of nuclear power plant components. As part of this program, there is a subtask 2 D that was set up to address an assessment of issues related to the NDE of high density polyethylene (HDPE) butt <b>fusion</b> <b>joints.</b> This work is being driven by the nuclear industry wanting to employ HDPE materials in nuclear power plant systems. This being a new material for use in nuclear applications, {{there are a number of}} issues related to its use and potential problems that may evolve. The industry is pursuing ASME Code Case N- 755 entitled “Use of Polyethylene (PE) Plastic Pipe for Section III, Division 1, Construction and Section XI Repair/Replacement Activities” that contains the requirements for nuclear power plant applications of HDPE. This Code Case requires that inspections be performed after the <b>fusion</b> <b>joint</b> is made by visually examining the bead that is formed and conducting a pressure test of the joint. These tests are only effective in general if gross through-wall flaws exist in the <b>fusion</b> <b>joint.</b> The NRC wants to know whether a volumetric inspection can be conducted on the <b>fusion</b> <b>joint</b> that will reliably detect lack-of-fusion conditions that may be produced during joint fusing. The NRC has requested that the work that PNNL is conducting be provided to assist them in resolving this inspection issue of whether effective volumetric NDE can be conducted to detect lack of fusion (LOF) in the butt HDPE joints. PNNL had 24 HDPE pipe specimens manufactured of 3408 material to contain LOF conditions that could be used to assess the effectiveness of NDE in detecting the LOF. Basic ultrasonic material properties were measured and used to guide the use of phased arrays and time-of-flight diffraction (TOFD) work that was conducted. Millimeter (mm) waves were also used to inspect these assemblies. Fluor and NDE Innovations, Inc. conducted TOFD inspections using their commercially available equipment on all 24 specimens. These NDE inspection results were reviewed and several of the specimens were selected for destructive evaluation using a microtome to slice small blocks of blank and <b>fusion</b> <b>joint</b> material. This interim report provides a status/summary of the work that has been conducted to date. In the areas selected for destructive testing where there were strong acoustic responses, LOF was verified. In areas where there were no NDE responses, no LOF was found. It needs to be noted that only a small amount of material has been destructively characterized at this point and further work is planned to determine if these trends hold up. Some of the material from three of the assemblies was sent off for mechanical testing but the results were not available to be included in this status report. The initial work shows that at least some of the LOF is providing NDE responses that have been verified through destructive testing. Thus, there is promise that a volumetric examination can be conducted on HDPE butt <b>fusion</b> <b>joints.</b> The future work will lead to quantifying what various NDE methods can detect, what they miss, and what they incorrectly characterize as defective...|$|R

Previous results obtained with strains carrying transcriptional fusions of gnd to the structural genes of the lactose operon suggested that the growth rate-dependent regulation of gnd expression is at the post-transcriptional level. To characterize the regulation further, we prepared with phage MudII a set of eight independent gnd-lac gene (protein) fusions. We showed through genetic analysis and DNA sequencing that each <b>fusion</b> <b>joint</b> was located within the 6 PGD-coding sequence {{between the first and second}} base pair of a codon, the reading frame required for production of a hybrid 6 PGD-beta-galactosidase. Strains harboring the gnd-lac fusion plasmids produced proteins whose mobility in a NaDodSO 4 /polyacrylamide gel agreed with the molecular weights predicted from the DNA sequence for the respective hybrid proteins. The level of beta-galactosidase was high and relatively growth rate-independent in the <b>fusion</b> whose <b>fusion</b> <b>joint</b> was at codon 48. The level of beta-galactosidase in the other seven fusion strains whose <b>fusion</b> <b>joints</b> were located further downstream in the 6 PGD-coding sequence showed the same dependence on growth rate as 6 PGD in a normal strain. beta-Galactosidase levels were not affected by the presence of a gnd+ gene in trans to any of the fusions. The results suggest that all sites necessary for growth rate-dependent regulation of 6 PGD level lie in gnd upstream from codon 118 and that an essential site of negative control lies within the coding sequence, between codons 48 and 118...|$|R

Four other immunoreactive OprF derivatives were created by subcloning and encoded amino acids 1 to 187, 188 to 326, 1 to 273 and 1 to 170 plus 301 to 326. On the basis of reactivity with the TnphoA-truncated derivatives and subclones of oprF, the epitopes for all 10 monoclonal antibodies were localized, in part, to specific regions of OprF. Nnie of the 10 monoclonal antibodies, 8 of which recognize surface-exposed epitopes, mapped within the carboxy-terminal region of OprF that is homologous to the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA. Thus, we concluded that parts of the carboxy terminus of OprF are exposed on the external face of the outer membrane. In addition, a clone containing only the first two cysteine residues of OprF demonstrated reactivity with monoclonal antibodies MA 4 - 4 and MA 7 - 8 that was destroyed by 2 -mercaptoethanol treatment, as was reactivity with intact OprF.

40|$|The {{standard}} method of joining plastic pipe {{in the field}} is the butt fusion process. As in any pipeline application, joint quality greatly affects overall operational safety of the system. Currently no simple, reliable, cost effective method of assessing the quality of <b>fusion</b> <b>joints</b> in the field exists. Visual examination and pressure testing are current non-destructive approaches, which do not provide any assurance about the long-term pipeline performance. This project will develop, demonstrate, and validate an in-situ non-destructive inspection method for butt <b>fusion</b> <b>joints</b> in gas distribution plastic pipelines. The inspection system will include a laser based image-recognition system that will automatically generate and interpret digital images of pipe joints and assign them a pass/fail rating, which eliminates operator bias in evaluating joint quality. A Weld Zone Inspection Method (WZIM) is being developed in which local heat is applied to the joint region to relax the residual stresses formed by the original joining operation and reveal the surface condition of the joint. In cases where the joint is not formed under optimal conditions, and the intermolecular forces between contacting surfaces are not strong enough, the relaxation of macromolecules in the surface layer causes the material to pull back, revealing a fusion line. If the joint is sound, the bond line image does not develop. To establish initial feasibility of the approach, welds were performed under standard and nonstandard conditions. These welds were subjected to the WZIM and tensile testing. There appears to be a direct correlation between the WZIM and tensile testing results. Although WZIM appears to be more sensitive than tensile testing can verify, the approach appears valid...|$|R

Even though successful commercial application of fusion bonding can already {{be found in the}} aerospace industry, a wider use requires additional developments in order to improve the predictability, reliability and robustness of <b>fusion</b> bonded <b>joints.</b> This first of all requires a better understanding of that what is perceived as ‘the load bearing capacity’, as measured by mechanical testing of <b>fusion</b> bonded <b>joints.</b> Two mechanisms that are essential for the generation of the load bearing capacity of <b>fusion</b> bonded <b>joints</b> are (i) intimate contact development, followed by (ii) the interdiffusion of polymer chains across the interface.
