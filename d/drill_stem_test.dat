At first the crew thought the well was a gas discovery, but there were signs of something more.

50|$|Shut-in {{procedures}} are usually developed and practiced for every rig activity, such as drilling, tripping, logging, running tubular, performing a <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> <b>test,</b> and so on. The {{primary purpose of}} a specific shut-in procedure is to minimize kick volume entering into a wellbore when a kick occurs, regardless of what phase of rig activity is occurring. However, a shut-in procedure is a company-specific procedure, and the policy of a company will dictate how a well should be shut-in.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Tsimiroro and Bemolanga, the company holds three exploration blocks: Manambolo, Morondava and Manandaza. On Madagascar Oil's blocks, examples include Manambolo West 1, drilled in 1987 and which flowed [...] per day on a <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> <b>test</b> {{as well as the}} Manadaza well drilled in the early 1990s that flowed 41° API light crude oil. Analysis of the data from the 2009 seismic survey defined potential reservoir structures of over [...] in size.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{on testing}} {{objectives}} and scope of work, <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> <b>testing</b> may also be performed in combination with various other exploration and completion process such as fluid loss control and well control, closed chamber tests, well stimulation, and a combination of DST and TCP.|$|R
50|$|Performed {{after the}} well is cased, cased hole <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> <b>testing</b> uses a retrievable {{production}} packer that is set above {{the zone of}} interest.

30|$|The D-exponent, shale density, rate of {{penetration}} (ROP), MWD Logs {{and qualitative}} pressure evaluation methods were applied. The most reliable detection technique is, however, the direct pressure-measuring tests which include kicks, formation interval tests (FIT), repeat formation <b>tests</b> (RFT), <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> <b>tests</b> (DST), and production tests. All these tests are costly {{and demand for}} more stringent interpretation.|$|R

50|$|Drill stem {{testing is}} an {{oil and gas}} {{exploration}} procedure to isolate, stimulate and flow a downhole formation to determine the fluids present and the rate at which they can be produced. The main objective of a DST is to evaluate the commercial viability of a zones economic potential by identifying productive capacity, pressure, permeability or extent of an oil or gas reservoir. These tests can be performed in both open and cased hole environments and provide exploration teams with valuable information {{about the nature of the}} reservoir. Drill stem testing involves deploying a series of tools known as a test bottomhole assembly (BHA). A basic <b>drill</b> <b>stem</b> <b>test</b> BHA consist of a packer or packers, which act as an expanding plug to be used to isolate sections of the well for the testing process, valves that may be opened or closed from the surface during the test, and recorders used to document pressure during the test. In addition to packers a downhole valve is used to open and close the formation to measure reservoir characteristics such as pressure and temperature which are charted on downhole recorders within the BHA. Below are two types of BHA DST, Cased Hole which can be applied after the well has been cased, and Open Hole which may be performed before casing.|$|E
