5|$|As of December 2016 {{there were}} 32 states (including Washington DC) that had adopted the Medicaid extension, while 19 states had not. Those states that {{expanded}} Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on {{average in the}} first quarter of 2016, while those that did not expand Medicaid had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64. Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, which held that states would not lose Medicaid funding if they didn't expand Medicaid under the ACA, several states rejected expanded Medicaid coverage. Over half of the national uninsured population lived in those states. In a report to Congress, the Centers <b>for</b> <b>Medicare</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> Services (CMS) estimated that the cost of expansion was $6,366 per person for 2015, about 49 percent above previous estimates. An estimated 9 million to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage, mostly low-income adults. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in October 2015 that 3.1 million additional people were not covered because of states that rejected the Medicaid expansion.|$|E
