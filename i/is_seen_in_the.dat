5|$|A convergence, {{possibly}} {{a form of}} mimicry, <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eggs of stick insects. They have an edible elaiosome-like structure and are taken into the ant nest where the young hatch.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{the ruins}} at San Gabriel Mission, ca. 1929. The ruins of an adobe brick {{foundation}} can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foreground. A small house can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right background, and clusters of trees can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance, surrounding the area.

5|$|Another {{literary}} {{reference to}} mayflies <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Epic of Gilgamesh, {{one of the}} earliest surviving great works of literature. The briefness of Gilgamesh's life is compared to that of the adult mayfly.|$|E
5|$|The fellowship's polity is {{a hybrid}} of presbyterian and congregational models. This tension between local {{independence}} and national authority <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> AG's historical reluctance to refer to itself as a denomination, preferring the terms fellowship and movement. The national headquarters are in Springfield, Missouri, where the administrative and executive offices and Gospel Publishing House are located.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E

5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Another {{influence}} of the Liao cultural tradition <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yuan dynasty's zaju (杂剧) theater, its associated orchestration, and the qu (曲) and sanqu (散曲) forms of Classical Chinese poetry. One documented way in which this influence occurred was through the incorporation of Khitan officers and men into {{the service of the}} Mongol forces during the first Mongol invasion of 1211 to 1215. This northern route of cultural transmission of the legacy of Liao culture was then returned to China during the Yuan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E

40|$|Photograph {{of a large}} tree, {{possibly}} pepper, in {{what appears}} to be a meadow, [s. d]. The foliage of a large tree can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center while the trunk seems to be hidden behind a bunch of branches that stem from a bush. Tall grasses can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foreground while a building or birdhouse can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right distance...|$|R
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high {{velocity}} in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, {{they need to be}} video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stick insects or walking sticks (Phasmatodea). A few insects have evolved to walk {{on the surface of the}} water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E
5|$|Cordova-Buckley, {{who began}} {{appearing}} on the show during the third season, {{was surprised to find}} the writers' characterization of Rodriguez in the episode to closely mirror her own life. Cordova-Buckley stated that, like how Rodriguez <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode, she dislikes nightclubs, and has found herself changing over time to be a different person from who her old friends remember; for Cordova-Buckley, this was seen in returning to Mexico after becoming an actor in the United States, which is reflected with Rodriguez's friends from Colombia from before she worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. as an Inhuman asset.|$|E
5|$|Different species use {{different}} pheromones. Scarab beetles {{such as the}} Rutelinae use pheromones derived from fatty acid synthesis, while other scarabs such as the Melolonthinae use amino acids and terpenoids. Another way beetles find mates <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fireflies (Lampyridae) which are bioluminescent, with abdominal light-producing organs. The males and females engage in a complex dialogue before mating; each species has a unique combination of flight patterns, duration, composition, and intensity of the light produced.|$|E

5|$|From the 11th century, {{architectural}} articulation included icons between pilasters, miniature towers {{supported by}} pilasters in {{the recesses of}} walls, and, on occasion, the use of wall pillars to support these towers. These miniature towers were of the southern dravida and northern bhumija and sekhari types and were mostly used to elaborate dravida types of articulation. The miniatures on single pilasters were decorated with a protective floral lintel on top, a form of decoration normally provided for depiction of gods. These elaborations are observed in the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri. These miniatures became common in the 12th century, {{and the influence of}} this northern articulation <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi and in the nearby Nannesvara Temple.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} {{included the}} repetition of Curvilinear or flame-like forms that occur in {{a great number of}} windows of around 1320, notably in the retro-choir at Wells and the nave of Exeter Cathedral. This type of tracery is often seen in combination with vaulting ribs of extreme projection and very rich moulding, as <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chapter house at Wells, and the vault at Exeter, which stretches, uninterrupted by a central tower, for 91 metres (300ft) and is the longest medieval vault in the world.|$|E
5|$|Grissom's crew {{received}} {{approval in}} June 1966 {{to design a}} mission patch with the name Apollo 1. The design's center depicts a Command/Service Module flying over the southeastern United States with Florida (the launch point) prominent. The Moon <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance, symbolic of the eventual program goal. A yellow border carries the mission and astronaut names with another border set with stars and stripes, trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by the crew, with the artwork done by North American Aviation employee Allen Stevens.|$|E

5|$|Kilmer is {{considered}} among {{the last of the}} Romantic era poets because his verse is conservative and traditional in style and does not break any of the formal rules of poetics—a style often criticized today for being too sentimental to be taken seriously. The entire corpus of Kilmer's work was produced between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry fell out of favor and Modernism took root—especially with the influence of the Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, and academic criticism grew with it to eschew the more sentimental and straightforward verse.|$|E
5|$|Located at 800 Southeast 10thAvenue, the {{building}} occupies the west {{half of the}} block between Southeast Belmont and Southeast Morrison streets. The southwest corner entry features a stylized Egyptian temple of cast stone. Italianate Renaissance influence <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground floor's large arched windows and tall narrow windows on the second. The west facade is lined with banks of large windows that helped illuminate and cool the work areas. Other important exterior features include a large garage door along Belmont Street, and a paved parking lot and water-tower pedestal on the Morrison Street side.|$|E
5|$|Tbr1 is {{expressed}} mainly in early-born postmitotic neurons {{of the developing}} cerebral cortex—in particular, the preplate and layer VI neurons. The preplate forms the architectural network of neurons that help developing neurons migrate. Successive migrations of neurons divide the preplate such that its inner cells form the cortical plate while its outer cells form the marginal zone. The cortical plate and the marginal zone eventually develop into six cortical layers, known as the neocortex, present in the mature cerebral cortex. These layers are numbered I-VI with layer VI being the deepest and forming first, while the remaining layers grow outward from it (from V to I). Layers II-VI develop from the cortical plate and layer I forms from the marginal zone. The subplate, intermediate zone, subventricular zone, and ventricular zone are found progressively deeper to these developing cortical layers. High expression of Tbr1 <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marginal zone, cortical plate, and subplate of the developing cortex whereas little expression <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subventricular zone. No Tbr1 expression has been observed in the ventricular zone.|$|E
