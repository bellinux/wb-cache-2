25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} life on Earth is biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metamorphized <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> discovered in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. A 2015 study found potentially biogenic carbon from 4.1 billion years ago in ancient rocks in Western Australia, but such findings would indicate the existence of different conditions on Earth during that period from those generally assumed today, and point to an earlier origin of life. In 2017, there was published a description of putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3.77 billion, and possibly 4.28 billion years old, in <b>ferruginous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> in Quebec, Canada.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Ferruginous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> {{associated}} with the Devonian Uzelga VHMS deposits of the southern Urals formed by cold seawater interaction (halmyrolysis) of hyaloclastic material with intercalated carbonates and sulphides. These units have been previously interpreted as either “jasperites”, “gossanites ” and “umbers”. They have been investigated using REE geochemistry in both bulk samples and laser ablation in-ductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry. In carbonate-rich hyaloclastic sediments the REE contents de-crease in the following order: hyaloclastites o partially hematitized hyaloclastites o hematite-quartz aggre-gates. The REE contents in jasperites are therefore always much lower than in primary hyaloclastites. The REE patterns in most gossanites and umbers were preserved {{with the exception of}} a pronounced negative Ce-anomalies. The REE-behaviour is dependent on the presence of anion complexes available during sea-water/rock interaction. The presence of CO...|$|R
40|$|Although it is {{not known}} when or where life on Earth began, some of the {{earliest}} habitable environments may have been submarine-hydrothermal vents. Here we describe putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3, 770 million and possibly 4, 280 million years old in <b>ferruginous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks,</b> interpreted as seafloor-hydrothermal vent-related precipitates, from the Nuvvuagittuq belt in Quebec, Canada. These structures occur as micrometre-scale haematite tubes and filaments with morphologies and mineral assemblages similar to those of filamentous microorganisms from modern hydrothermal vent precipitates and analogous microfossils in younger rocks. The Nuvvuagittuq rocks contain isotopically light carbon in carbonate and carbonaceous material, which occurs as graphitic inclusions in diagenetic carbonate rosettes, apatite blades intergrown among carbonate rosettes and magnetite–haematite granules, and is associated with carbonate in direct contact with the putative microfossils. Collectively, these observations are consistent with an oxidized biomass and provide evidence for biological activity in submarine-hydrothermal environments more than 3, 770 million years ago...|$|R
40|$|Iron-formations are <b>ferruginous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> {{which have}} their source from fumarolic {{activity}} associated with submarine volcanism, with deposition of iron as oxides, hydroxides, and hydrous oxide-silicate minerals in shallow and/or deep marine sedimentary systems. The Precambrian ironformations of southern Africa {{have a wide}} age range, but are more prominently developed before 1. SGa. These iron formations occur in greenstone belts of the Kaapvaal and Zimbabwean cratons, in the Limpopo mobile belt, in cratonic basins and in the Damara mobile belt. The Archaean-Proterozoic sedimentary basins and greenstone belts host iron ore deposits in iron-formation. Iron formations have a lengthy geological history. Most were subjected to intense, and on occasions repeated, tectonic and metamorphic episodes which also included metasomatic processes at times to produce supergene/hypogene high grade iron ores. Iron-formations may be enriched by diagenetic, and metamorphic processes to produce concentrating-grade ironformations. Uplift, weathering and denudation, have influenced the mineral association and composition of the ores, within which magnetite, haematite and goethite constitute the major ore minerals. The iron resources of the southern Africa region include the Sishen deposits, hosting to about 1200 Mt of high grade direct shipping ore, at > 63 % Fe. Deposits of Zimbabwe have more than 33 000 Mt of beneficiable iron-formation. The evaluation of an iron ore prospect involves many factors which must be individually assessed in order to arrive at {{an estimate of the}} probable profitability of the deposit. Many of these are geological and are inherent in the deposit itself. Other factors are inherent aspects of the environment in which the ore is formed. Although the geological character of the ore does not change, technological advances in the processing techniques may have a great effect on the cost of putting the ore into marketable form. Geochemical, geophysical and remote sensing methods would be used for regional exploration. Chip sampling and drilling are useful for detailed exploration. Purely geological exploration techniques are applicable on a prospect scale in the exploration of iron ore deposits. Regional exploration targeting should choose late Archaean greenstone belts containing oxide facies iron-formation or Early Proterozoic basins located at craton margins as they are both known to host high-grade haematite orebodies formed by supergene/hypogene enrichment. Most types of iron ore deposits in southern Africa are described and classified. An attempt is made to emphasize the major controls on mineralisation, in the hope that these may be applicable to exploration both in the southern African region and within analogous settings around the world. ...|$|R
