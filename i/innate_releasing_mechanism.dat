5000|$|Fixed action patterns, {{or similar}} {{behaviour}} sequences, {{are produced by}} a neural network known as the <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{in response to an}} external sensory stimulus known as a sign stimulus or releaser. A fixed action pattern {{is one of the few}} types of behaviors which was thought to be [...] "hard-wired" [...] and instinctive.|$|E
50|$|Tinbergen added {{complexity}} to this model, a model {{now known}} as Tinbergen's hierarchical model. He suggested that motivational impulses build up in nervous centres in the brain which are held in check by blocks. The blocks are removed by an <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> that allows the energy to flow to the next centre (each centre containing a block {{that needs to be}} removed) in a cascade until the behaviour is expressed. Tinbergen's model shows multiple levels of complexity and that related behaviours are grouped.|$|E
5000|$|Together with Nikolaas Tinbergen, Lorenz {{developed}} {{the idea of}} an <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> to explain instinctive behaviors (fixed action patterns). They experimented with [...] "supernormal stimuli" [...] such as giant eggs or dummy bird beaks which they found could release the fixed action patterns more powerfully than the natural objects for which the behaviors were adapted. Influenced by the ideas of William McDougall, Lorenz developed this into a [...] "psychohydraulic" [...] model of the motivation of behavior, which tended towards group selectionist ideas, which were influential in the 1960s. Another of his contributions to ethology is his work on imprinting. His influence on a younger generation of ethologists; and his popular works, were important in bringing ethology {{to the attention of the}} general public.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{all have}} some innate {{psychological}} concepts which guide their mental development. The concept of imprinting in ethology is one well-studied example, dealing most famously with the Mother constructs of newborn animals. The many predetermined scripts for animal behavior are called <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanisms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Infants between 12 and 21 days of age can imitate both facial and manual gestures; this {{behavior}} cannot {{be explained in}} terms of either conditioning or <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Such imitation implies that human neonates can equate their own unseen behaviors with gestures they see others perform.|$|R
25|$|In Biological {{theory and}} the concept of archetypes, Michael Fordham {{considered}} that <b>innate</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in animals may be applicable to humans, especially in infancy. The stimuli which produce instinctive behaviour are selected from a wide field by an innate perceptual system and the behaviour is 'released'. Fordham drew a parallel between some of Lorenz's ethological observations on the hierarchical behaviour of wolves and the functioning of archetypes in infancy.|$|R
5000|$|Many dynamic {{models of}} {{artificial}} action selection were originally inspired by research in ethology. In particular, Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen provided {{the idea of}} an <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> to explain instinctive behaviors (fixed action patterns). Influenced by the ideas of William McDougall, Lorenz developed this into a [...] "psychohydraulic" [...] model of the motivation of behavior. In ethology, these ideas were influential in the 1960s, but they are now regarded as outdated because of their use of an energy flow metaphor; the nervous system and the control of behavior are now normally treated as involving information transmission rather than energy flow. Dynamic plans and neural networks are more similar to information transmission, while spreading activation is more similar to the diffuse control of emotional / hormonal systems.|$|E
50|$|Human infant data using {{eye-tracking}} measures {{suggest that}} the mirror neuron system develops before 12 months of age, and that this system may help human infants understand other people's actions. A critical question concerns how mirror neurons acquire mirror properties. Two closely related models postulate that mirror neurons are trained through Hebbian or Associative learning (see Associative Sequence Learning). However, if premotor neurons need to be trained by action in order to acquire mirror properties, {{it is unclear how}} newborn babies are able to mimic the facial gestures of another person (imitation of unseen actions), as suggested by the work of Meltzoff and Moore. One possibility is that the sight of tongue protrusion recruits an <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> in neonates. Careful analysis suggests that 'imitation' of this single gesture may account for almost all reports of facial mimicry by new-born infants.|$|E
5000|$|While some species-typical {{behavior}} is learned from parents, it's also sometimes {{the product of}} a fixed action pattern, also known as an <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> (IRM). In these instances, a neural network is 'programmed' to create a hard-wired, instinctive behavior in response to an external stimulus. When a blind child hears news that makes her happy, she's likely to smile in response; she never had to be taught to smile, and she never learned this behavior by seeing others do it. Similarly, when kittens are shown a picture of a cat in a threatening posture, most of them arch their backs, bear their teeth, and sometimes even hiss, even though they've never seen another cat do this. Many IRMs {{can be explained by the}} theory of evolution - if an adaptive behavior helps a species survive long enough to be fruitful and multiply (such as a cat hissing in order to discourage an attack from another creature), the genes that coded for those brain circuits are more likely to be passed on. A heavily studied example of a fixed action pattern is the feeding behavior of the Helisoma trivolvis (pulmonata), a type of snail. A study has shown that the intricate connections within the buccal ganglia (see nervous system of gastropods) form a central system whereby sensory information stimulates feeding in the helisoma. More specifically, a unique system of communication between three classes of neurons in the buccal ganglia are responsible for forming the neural network that influences feeding.|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of our current}} {{research}} is {{the design of a}} robotic architecture that has the capability of adapting its behaviour to the rate of change of a dynamic environment. Taking free inspiration from some notions on biological clocks, we show a simple model to represent some characteristics typical of these clocks in terms of Schema Theory. In particular, referring to this model, we try to connect the concept of <b>Innate</b> <b>Releasing</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> (IRM) to the concept of periodical activation with the aim of taking into account the variability of the same behaviour according to the circumstances in which it is activated. We propose an architecture in which the frequency of access to the sensory system is modi¯ed in accordance to environmental changes...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-five newborn infants {{were tested}} for auditory–oral {{matching}} behavior {{when presented with}} the consonant sound /m/ and the vowel sound /a/ – a precursor behavior to vocal imitation. Auditory–oral matching behavior by the infant was operationally defined as showing the mouth movement appropriate for producing the model sound just heard (mouth opening for /a/ and mouth clutching for /m/), even when the infant produced no sound herself. With this new dependent measure, {{the current study is}} the first to show matching behavior to consonant sounds in newborns: infants showed significantly more instances of mouth opening after /a/ models than after /m/ models, and more instances of mouth clutching after /m/ models than after /a/ models. The results are discussed in the context of theories of active intermodal mapping and <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Barlow's {{idea that}} certain {{cells in the}} retina could act as [...] "feature detectors" [...] was {{influenced}} by E.D. Adrian and Nikolaas Tinbergen. E.D. Adrian, Barlow's advisor, was the discoverer of the frequency code—the observation that sensory nerves convey signal intensity though the frequency of their firing. On the other hand, during Barlow's career, Nikolaas Tinbergen was introducing {{the concept of the}} <b>innate</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> (IRM) and sign stimulus. IRMs are hard wired mechanisms that give an animal the innate ability to recognize complex stimuli. The sign stimulus is a simple, reduced stimulus including only the necessary features of the stimulus capable of evoking a behavioral response. Tinbergen's examination of the pecking behavior in herring gull chicks illustrated that the pecking response could be evoked by any bill-shaped long rod with a red spot near the end. In his own paper, Barlow later compared a sign stimulus to a password which was either accepted or rejected by a feature detector. Accepted passwords would contain the features necessary to trigger specific behavioral responses in an animal.|$|R
40|$|Cognition is {{organized}} in a structured series of attentional episodes, allowing complex {{problems to be}} addressed through solution of simpler subproblems. A "multiple-demand" (MD) system of frontal and parietal cortex is active in {{many different kinds of}} tasks, and using data from neuroimaging, electrophysiology, neuropsychology, and cognitive studies of intelligence, I propose a core role for MD regions in assembly of the attentional episode. Monkey and human data show dynamic neural coding of attended information across multiple MD regions, with rapid communication within and between regions. Neuropsychological and imaging data link MD function to fluid intelligence, explaining some but not all "executive" deficits after frontal lobe lesions. Cognitive studies link fluid intelligence to goal neglect, and the problem of dividing complex task requirements into focused parts. Like the <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of ethology, I suggest that construction of the attentional episode provides a core organizational principle for complex, adaptive cognition...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNo {{evidence}} {{had been}} provided so far of newborns' capacity {{to give a}} matching response to 2 D stimuli. We report evidence from 18 newborns who were presented with three types of stimuli on a 2 D screen. The stimuli were video-recorded displays of tongue protrusion shown by: (a) a human face, (b) a human tongue from a disembodied mouth, and (c) an artificial tongue from a robotic mouth. Compared to a baseline condition, neonates increased significantly their tongue protrusion when seeing disembodied human and artificial tongue movements, but not when seeing a 2 D full-face protruding tongue. This result was interpreted as revealing the exploration of top-heavy patterns of the 2 D face that distracted infants' attention from the tongue. Results also showed progressively more accurate matching (full tongue protrusion) throughout repeated exposure to each kind of stimulus. Such findings are not {{in line with the}} predictions of the <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> (IRM) model or of the oral exploration hypothesis. They support the active intermodal mapping (AIM) hypothesis that emphasizes not only the importance of repeated experience, as would the associative sequence learning (ASL) hypothesis, but also predicts a differential learning and progressive correction of the response adapted to each stimulus...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—We used {{computer}} image manipulation to de-velop {{a test of}} perception of subtle gradations in cuteness between infant faces. We found that young women (19 – 26 years old) were more sensitive to differences in infant cuteness than were men (19 – 26 and 53 – 60 years old). Women aged 45 to 51 years performed {{at the level of}} the young women, whereas cuteness sensitivity in women aged 53 to 60 years was not different from that of men (19 – 26 and 53 – 60 years old). Because average age at menopause is 51 years in Britain, these findings suggest the possible involvement of reproductive hormones in cuteness sensitivity. Therefore, we compared cuteness discrimina-tion in pre- and postmenopausal women matched for age and in women taking and not taking oral contraceptives (progestogen and estrogen). Premenopausal women and young women taking oral contraceptives (which raise hormone levels artificially) were more sensitive to varia-tions of cuteness than their respective comparison groups. We suggest that cuteness sensitivity is modulated by female reproductive hormones. More than half a century ago, Konrad Lorenz proposed the Kindchenschema as an <b>innate</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> for care-taking behavior and affective orientation toward infants, trig-gered by features such as protruding cheeks, a large forehead, and large eyes below the horizontal midline of the skull (Lorenz, 1943). Baby faces having these features are commonly de-scribed as cute, and although cuteness has been shown to modulate mother-infant interaction (Langlois, Ritter, Casey, & Sawin, 1995), there are only a few psychophysical studies in-vestigating responses of men and women to variations of phys-ical properties of baby faces (Alley, 1981; Brooks & Hochberg...|$|E
50|$|Ewert showed, {{by using}} spots, bars, and square stimuli of {{different}} sizes, that toads snapped at a moving bar which {{was moving in}} a direction parallel to its long axis, whereas the same bar oriented perpendicularly to the direction of movement (anti-worm configuration) was ignored as prey. Another experimental setup allowed worm or anti-worm stimuli to traverse the toad's visual field in different direction in the x-y co-ordinates, demonstrating that the worm vs anti-worm discrimination is invariant under changes {{in the direction of}} movement. He also showed that the toad would crouch and go immobile in response to a large rectangle. Using worm and anti-worm stimuli like these, Ewert identified that the prey-recognition system in the visual pathway of the toad is based on a number of <b>innate</b> <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In response to a worm-like moving stimulus, the toad exhibited the following behaviors: orienting, snapping, or mouth wiping. On the other hand, an anti-worm stimulus evoked a different set of avoidance behaviors: planting down or crouching. After determining the sensory recognition elements of each behavior with this experimental setup, Ewert and co-workers examined the neural mechanisms governing the toad's prey-recognition system and found a number of feature detectors.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this doctoral thesis is to understand the adult foraging behavior of the nocturnal hawkmoth Manduca sexta. Adult M. sexta feed from the floral nectar of certain plants, which benefit from the pollination services resulting from these feeding visits.

Results show that the effect of relevant stimuli cannot be disentangled from the context and scale in which they act. In fact, ?context? appears to be the releasing factor of particular motor patterns, suggesting that the consideration of stimuli without context is misguided.

However, until very recently the possible causes of the failures have only been postulated but never tested in a systematic way. The current study aims for {{a better understanding of}} the operational performance of lifeboat <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> with respect to normal, extreme and failure operational situations. Three twin fall davit on-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and one off-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> were tested in the experimental study. All the <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> design types are fully certified by the regulatory bodies. Of the three on-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> two were of older existing design types while the third was of a newer (next generation) design. Of the four <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> tested, two of the mechanisms were new and never used outside of this study. Also, one of the never used new mechanisms was of an older design while the other was the next generation design. The never used mechanisms had a loading capacity of 6 tonnes, while the third on-load <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> had been in operation for some time and had a capacity of 3 tonnes. The off-load mechanism had also been in use and had a capacity of 12 tonnes.
