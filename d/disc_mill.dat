40|$|ABSTRACT In {{conventional}} recycling method, {{metal chips}} are cast after pressing and melting in electric arc furnace. Material loss occurs during the recycling from liquid metal {{due to the}} several reasons. Direct recycling method which produces the aluminium powder from aluminium chips using mechanical mill can be an alternative to conventional recycling method. Thus material and energy losses, and labour cost will be reduced by direct recycling method without melting. In this study, the particle morphology of powder direct recycled from AA 6013 aluminium alloy chips with cryogenic, disc and ball type grinders is investigated. Mechanical milling resulted flaky and irregular shaped AA 6013 particles. It was ascertained that the chips did not break sufficiently in despite of the long duration milling mechanisms by ball mill. Cryogenic mill provides the energy required for milling mechanisms to act. <b>Disc</b> <b>mill</b> has the highest impact energy was determined. Consequently, efficiency of ball mill {{is lower than the}} efficiency of cryogenic and disc type mills.

In {{the first set}} of experiments, it was attempted to confirm the information presented in the literature that magnesium hydride could be produced by heating at 350 oC for 24 hours under 10 atmospheres of pressure. The results obtained in this study indicated that even a higher temperature heating at 400 oC under 10 bar hydrogen pressure was insufficient for magnesium hydride formation. Heating and grinding time were selected as the most effective parameters by which a full-factorial experimental design methodology was implemented. Statistical analysis results indicated that a combination of grinding and a 50 oC heating was most effective. Hence, grinding was identified as the most significant factor effect on the production of magnesium hydride. Two different mills were used, in this study, and it was found that <b>disc</b> <b>mill</b> was more effective than ball mill.

With {{a view to}} upgrading the micronutrient status of pearl millet-based foods, the effects of single operations and of porridge preparation scenarios on levels and in vitro solubility (IVS) of iron and zinc and mineral complexing factors (phytates: inositol phosphates and phenolic compounds) were tested. <b>Disc</b> <b>milling</b> of grain may add significant iron {{but this is not}} necessarily IVS iron. Soaking of grains results in a 25 % loss of iron, but also facilitates endogenous phytate degradation, particularly when combined with milling and cooking. Germination and lactic acid fermentation both result in partial phytate degradation. Cooking does not decompose phytates, but results in complex formation of phenolic compounds as measured by a significant reduction in reactive hydroxyl groups. Because of its different distribution in the grain, zinc is generally less affected than iron. Phytate reduction by endogenous phytases is inhibited at low pH as caused by fermentation. Kanwa (alkaline rock salt) could be a functional cooking ingredient as a source of minerals and to react with phenolic substances. The relative IVS of iron was doubled by germination of grain and increased 3 -fold by fermentation of wholemeal slurry.

This paper discusses various methods of fabrication of plain and carbon-reinforced composite powders, as well as a range of powder characterisation test methods suitable for defining powders for laser sintering. Two milling processes (based on disc blades and rotatory cutting knives) were used as methods of fabrication of powders, starting from injection moulding granule grades, for comparison with current powders obtained directly from polymerisation processes. It was found that the milling process affects the particles properties. The rotary milling produced powders with superior properties in comparison with the <b>disc</b> <b>milling</b> method. Tests including particle size distribution, angle of repose, aspect ratio, sphericity and roundness of particles were employed to compare and assess the suitability of powders for laser sintering. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller test was identified as a useful method to define surface roughness and porosity of the particles. The carbon fibre (Cf) Poly Ether Ketone (PEK) granules milled well and after an additional sieving process created a good quality powder. This is the first attempt to investigate properties of PEK powder with encapsulated Cf and follow their sintering profile through hot-stage microscopy. It is expected that this type of composite powder will create isotropic structures in comparison with the highly anisotropic properties given by the known dry mix composite powders, currently used in laser sintering. © The Author(s) 2017 Open Access This article is distributed {{under the terms of the}} Creative Commons Attribution 4. 0 International License ([URL] which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of milling methods on tensile properties of polypropylene (PP) / oil palm mesocarp fibre (OPMF) biocomposites. Two types of mills were used; Wiley mill (WM) and <b>disc</b> <b>mill</b> (DM). Ground OPMF from each milling process was examined for its particle size distribution and aspect ratio by sieve and microscopic analyses, respectively. Results showed that DM-OPMF had smaller diameter fibre with uniform particle size compared to the WM-OPMF. Surface morphology study by SEM showed that DM-OPMF had rougher surface compared to WM-OPMF. Furthermore, it was found that PP/DM-OPMF biocomposite had higher tensile strength compared to PP/WM-OPMF, with almost two-fold. Thus, it is suggested that small diameter and uniform size fibre may improve stress transfer and surface contact between the fibre and polymer matrix and cause welldispersion of filler throughout the polymer resulted in better tensile strength of PP/DM-OPMF compared to PP/WM-OPMF biocomposite. Overall, it can be concluded that disc milling could serve as a simple and effective grinding method for improving the tensile properties of biocomposite...|$|E

The gluability of the fibrillated bark adhesives was evaluated according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard for Plywood (JAS) and was found to be excellent. These bark adhesives have a number of advantages in that there is no tannin extraction, there is a total use of the bark, a low-level requirement of PF resins, no other components required and there is a high glue bond quality. Considering that very small amounts of fibrillated bark adhesives produced high-quality wood bonding, the bark components such as tannin, hemicellulose, lignin, cellulose nanofibers and other components may well be contributing to produce such a good bonding.|$|E

40|$|Palm oil {{industry}} {{is one of}} the Malaysian top commodities, producing abundant of lignocellulosic biomass as waste. Although a lot of studies have been done for these biomass, oil palm frond (OPF) has been neglected due to the current good agricultural practise, where it is required to be left in the oil palm plantation for nutrient recycling. However, a recent finding showed that the petiole parts of the OPF is rich in sugars, which can be extracted by pressing the petiole. As for the petiole biomass after pressing, it require pretreatment to allow enzymatic hydrolysis to take place smoothly. In the first chapter, a literature studies was carried out to understand the gap in the research for OPF, while trying to relate it with excessive energy of palm {{oil industry}}. OPF from the oil palm plantation involves a volume of 83 million tons in Malaysia alone. As it was suggested earlier that the petiole alone is a good source for sugars, its utilization is restricted due to the good agricultural practise. Therefore, the second chapter discuss the comparison of oil palm biomass volume to justify the reason of OPF selection. Detailed composition of the OPF components was also studied to understand which parts of the fronds actually contribute to the nutrient recycling, as well as to suggest whether it is safe or not to take the petiole out of the plantation. Amongst the four components, namely petiole, stem, rachis and leaflet, we found that the main contributor for the nutrient recycling by OPF is actually the leaflet, while the petiole has only a little effect. We also suggest that the logistic issues regarding the transportation of the OPF petiole from the plantation to the palm oil mill, can be solved by adding extra cart behind the existing truck. Therefore we do not need extra truck and driver. Third chapter is mainly about the pretreatment and cellulose hydrolysis of the petiole residue. We suggest that reuse of the oil palm steam (superheated steam, SHS) for pretreatment of petiole residue will be beneficial and profitable for the palm oil mill. The use of SHS is found to be superior as compared to a wet <b>disc</b> <b>milling</b> (WDM) in term of pretreatment duration and practicality in the palm oil mill. Upon treating the pressed petiole, we found that pretreatment of petiole at 180 °C for 10 minutes yielded the highest sugars yield amongst the range of the treatment, which was achieved by using a low 10 FPU cellulase activity. This resulted in improvement of specific biosugars yield by 79. 91...|$|R

40|$|All rights reserved. Tef grain is {{becoming}} very attractive in the Western countries {{since it is}} a gluten-free grain with appreciated nutritional advantages. However there is little information of its functional properties and starch digestibility {{and how they are}} affected by variety type and particle size distribution. This work evaluates the effect of the grain variety and the mill used on tef flour physico-chemical and functional properties, mainly derived from starch behavior. In vitro starch digestibility of the flours by Englyst method was assessed. Two types of mills were used to obtain whole flours of different granulation. Rice and wheat flours were analyzed as references. Protein molecular weight distribution and flour structure by SEM were also analyzed to justify some of the differences found among the cereals studied. Tef cultivar and mill type exhibited important effect on granulation, bulking density and starch damage, affecting the processing performance of the flours and determining the hydration and pasting properties. The color was darker although one of the white varieties had a lightness near the reference flours. Different granulation of tef flour induced different in vitro starch digestibility. The <b>disc</b> attrition <b>mill</b> led to higher starch digestibility rate index and rapidly available glucose, probably as consequence of a higher damaged starch content. The results confirm the adequacy of tef flour as ingredient in the formulation of new cereal based foods and the importance of the variety and the mill on its functional properties. The research was supported by the Spanish Institutions Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) (Projects AGL 2012 - 35088 and AGL 2011 - 22669), and Comunidad de Castilla y León (Project VA 252 A 12 - 2). W. Abebe thanks the Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional (AECID) grant and Ethiopian Institute of Agriculture for providing the tef cultivars flours. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
