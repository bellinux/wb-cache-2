5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses the communication {{methods used to}} supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by those {{with a wide range}} of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy, <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairment</b> and autism, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.|$|E

40|$|Participation in {{sporting}} events {{sanctioned by the}} International Paralympic Committee is currently not open to athletes with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments.</b> This situation will persist until a valid and reliable sport-specific system is developed that can differentiate athletes with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> from athletes without <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Such a system {{would be used to}} determine who is eligible for separate competitions, such as the Paralympics, and who should participate without special considerations in mainstream sport. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the first 30 m of the sprint event to determine if there were any differences in the kinematics when athletes with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> (n= 32) were compared to athletes without <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> (n= 14). Sprint performances were digitally recorded (50 Hz) and analysed using the DartFish ProSuite software programme. The data collected from these analyses were then compared using unpaired t-tests.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to clarify associations between motor and <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> and mobility restriction, and the impact of environmental factors on the mobility of children in residential institutions for children with motor impairments. Mobility restriction was assessed using the 1 ^st and 4 ^th qualifiers defined in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Motor and <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> were characterized by gross motor function and intelligent quotient, respectively. The relationship between mobility restriction and the two impairments was examined using Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rank correlation analysis. The 1 ^st and 4 ^th qualifiers in mobility were moderately correlated to both motor and <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments.</b> The correlation coefficient for the 1 ^st qualifier was somewhat smaller than that for the 4 ^th qualifier. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that the 1 ^st qualifier was significantly smaller than the 4 ^th qualifier in mobility (p< 0. 001). The present results suggest that mobility restriction is influenced not only by motor impairments, but also by <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments.</b> The contextual assistances are considered {{to play an important role}} in reducing the impact of motor and <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> and improving mobility...|$|R
500|$|Individuals with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> face {{challenges}} in developing communication skills, including problems with generalization (the transfer of learned skills into daily activities). They may lack communication opportunities {{in their daily}} lives, and responsive communicators who understand their communication methods. AAC intervention for this population emphasizes partner training as well as opportunities for integrated, natural communication. Studies have shown that appropriate use of AAC techniques with children and adults with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> can enhance communication skills, increase participation in activities, choice-making, and even influence the perceptions and stereotypes of communication partners.|$|R
5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairment</b> (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those {{who might be able}} to learn to speak. Individuals with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairment</b> were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device {{in the form of a}} sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: People with {{intellectual}} disability or borderline intellectual functioning may have poorer mental health than their peers. The present authors sought to (i) estimate {{the risk of}} poorer mental health among British adults with and without <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> and (ii) estimate {{the extent to which}} any between-group differences in mental health may reflect between-group differences in rates of exposure to common social determinants of poorer health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present authors undertook secondary analysis of confidentialized unit records collected in Wave 3 of Understanding Society. RESULTS: British adults with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> living in general households are at significantly increased risk of potential mental health problems than their non-disabled peers (e. g. GHQ Caseness OR = 1. 77, 95 % CI (1. 25 - 2. 52), P < 0. 001). Adjusting for between-group differences in age, gender and indicators of socio-economic position eliminated this increased risk [GHQ Caseness adjusted OR = 1. 06, 95 % CI (0. 73 - 1. 52), n. s]. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that the increased risk of poor mental health among people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> may be attributable to their poorer living conditions rather than their <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> per se. Greater attention should be given to understanding and addressing the impact of exposure to common social determinants of mental health among marginalized or vulnerable groups...|$|R

25|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{also known}} simply as Alzheimer's, is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration together with declining {{activities of daily living}} and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes. The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory (amnesia), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive (<b>intellectual)</b> <b>impairment</b> extends to the domains of language (aphasia), skilled movements (apraxia), and recognition (agnosia), and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired.|$|E

These instruments bring a degree of objectivity and consistency to the clinical assessment. More specialized psychometric testing may be carried out by a psychologist, for example using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, to detect <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairment</b> or other cognitive problems which may be contributing to the child's difficulties.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{problems}} encountered will benefit from special attention, as problems are often related more to “input and output” issues than to <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairment.</b> Problems with eye movement control {{make it difficult for}} people with A-T to read, yet most fully understand the meaning and nuances of text that is read to them. Delays in speech initiation and lack of facial expression make it seem that they do not know the answers to questions. Reduction of the skilled effort needed to answer questions, and an increase of the time available to respond, is often rewarded by real accomplishment. It {{is important to recognize that}} intellectual disability is not regularly a part of the clinical picture of A-T although school performance may be suboptimal because of the many difficulties in reading, writing, and speech. Children with A-T are often very conscious of their appearance, and strive to appear normal to their peers and teachers. Life within the ataxic body can be tiring. The enhanced effort needed to maintain appearances and increased energy expended in abnormal tone and extra movements all contribute to physical and mental fatigue. As a consequence, for some a shortened school day yields real benefits.|$|E

40|$|Background People with {{intellectual}} disability have significantly higher age-adjusted rates of mortality and morbidity (including obesity) than their non-disabled peers. They are also {{significantly less likely}} to be physically active. Methods Secondary analysis of de-identified cross-sectional data from the first two waves of Understanding Society, a new longitudinal study focusing on the life experiences of UK citizens. Interviews were undertaken with 50, 994 individuals aged 16 and over in Wave 1 and 54, 585 in Wave 2. Of these, 520 participants age 16 - 49 (1. 8 % of the unweighted age-restricted sample) were identified at either Wave 1 or Wave 2 as having self-reported <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Results British adults with self-reported <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> have higher rates of obesity, inactivity, tobacco and alcohol use and poorer nutrition than their non-disabled peers. Adjusting risk estimates for between group differences in age, gender and exposure to material hardship indicated that a significant proportion of their increased risk of obesity, tobacco use and poorer nutrition may be attributable to their poorer living conditions (rather than their self-reported <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> per se).

40|$|Adults with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> {{experience}} frequent communication {{breakdown in}} their everyday interactions. This can result from impairment of the linguistic skills required for effective communication and/or difficulties dealing with non-verbal information. Problems also exist, however, {{in the way that}} some non-impaired speakers, such as care providers, approach these communicative episodes. This thesis investigates communication in young adults with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> with three different communication partners. These were a care provider, a student and a peer with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Student partners were previously unknown to the main participants and not experienced in communicating with people with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Communication structure and process are investigated according to the number of words and turns used to complete a co-operative problem-solving task and the types of conversational acts used by speakers and listeners. Non-verbal communication is investigated through the use of one non-verbal signal, gaze, during the task dialogues. An interactionist approach is taken to communication, where outcome or success is viewed as a product of the collaborative efforts of speakers and listeners. Communication is seen as multi-modal and involving the exchange of information via the verbal and non-verbal channels. The results show that when both parties were intellectually impaired performance was poorest. More surprisingly, dyads including a student partner communicated more effectively and efficiently than where the partner was a carer. One reason for this may be that carers used more complex, open questions to introduce new information into the task, and these were distracting rather than useful. Overusing open questions may be problematic for this population and less effective at establishing shared understanding than where listeners check their own interpretation of previous messages, a strategy preferred by student partners. Non-verbal signals can help to ease constraints on communication by providing interlocutors with feedback information on the levels of mutual understanding...|$|R

500|$|Cerebral palsy {{is a term}} {{referring}} to a non-progressive developmental neuromotor disorder with an upper motor neuron lesion origin.

Fine motor planning, control and coordination are often affected. Dysarthria, a speech disorder resulting from neurological damage to the motor-speech system, occurs in an estimated 31% to 88% of those with cerebral palsy. Such individuals may require AAC support for communication. Approximately one half to one third have some degree of <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairment,</b> and visual and hearing problems are also common.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is a {{high and}} {{increasing}} prevalence of impairments among children and adolescents in the West. Many countries offer personal assistance {{in the form of}} individualised support for people living in the community by a paid assistant other than a healthcare professional for at least 20 hours per week. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents with both physical and <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments,</b> and the impacts of personal assistance on others, compared to other interventions. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Dissertation Abstracts International and a variety of specialist Swedish databases were searched from 1980 to June 2005; reference lists were checked; 345 experts, organisations, government bodies and charities were contacted in an attempt to locate relevant research. SELECTION CRITERIA: Children and adolescents with both physical and <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments</b> (0 - 18 years) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (e. g., bathing and eating) and participate in normal activities due to permanent impairments. Controlled studies of personal assistance in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Titles and abstracts were examined by two reviewers. 130 full papers were examined. None met the inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: No eligible studies were found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Research in this field is limited, though one related review provides some evidence of the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents with <b>intellectual</b> <b>impairments.</b> When implementing new programmes, recipients could be randomly assigned to different forms of assistance. While advocates may support personal assistance for myriad reasons, this review demonstrates that further studies are required to determine which models of personal assistance are most effective and efficient for particular people...|$|R
