We recorded whole cell currents in mammalian type II vestibular hair cells using an excised preparation (mouse) and action potentials (APs) in afferent neurons in vivo (chinchilla) in response to optical heat pulses applied to the crista (Δ T ≈ 0. 25 °C per pulse). Afferent spike trains evoked by heat pulse stimuli were diverse and included asynchronous inhibition, asynchronous excitation, and/or phase-locked APs synchronized to each infrared heat pulse. Thermal responses of membrane currents responsible for APs in ganglion neurons were strictly excitatory, with Q 10 ≈ 2.

In this case, an effective comparison, which considers the quality of used energy, can be performed allowing precise politics for a future more effective evaluation of the transport modes.|$|E

Since the <b>first</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> measures quantity of energy and the second measures irreversibilities, i. e. quality of energy, having a single thermodynamic indicator which is able to deal with both issues at the same time means a great advance in energy sustainability studies.

40|$|<b>First</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> {{imply that}} {{metabolic}} pathways {{are faced with}} a trade-off between the rate and yield of ATP production. Simple evolutionary models argue that this trade-off generates a fundamental social conflict in microbial populations: average fitness in a population is highest if all individuals exploit common resources efficiently, but individual reproductive rate is maximized by consuming common resources at the highest possible rate, a scenario known as the tragedy of the commons. In this paper, I review studies that have addressed two key questions: What is the evidence that the rate-yield trade-off is an evolutionary constraint on metabolic pathways? And, if so, what determines evolutionary outcome of the conflicts generated by this trade-off? Comparative studies and microbial experiments provide evidence that the rate-yield trade-off is an evolutionary constraint that is driven by thermodynamic constraints that are common to all metabolic pathways and pathway-specific constraints that reflect the evolutionary history of populations. Microbial selection experiments show that the evolutionary consequences of this trade-off depend on both kin selection and biochemical constraints. In well-mixed populations with low relatedness, genotypes with rapid and efficient metabolism can coexist as a result of negative frequency-dependent selection generated by density-dependent biochemical costs of rapid metabolism. Kin selection can promote the maintenance of efficient metabolism in structured populations with high relatedness by ensuring that genotypes with efficient metabolic pathways gain an indirect fitness benefit from their competitive restraint. I conclude by suggesting avenues for future research and by discussing the broader implications of this work for microbial social evolution...|$|R

Main objective of the research is to minimize the energy consumption associated to room climate control (CC). Specifically in this work, a model of room thermal dynamics was developed. In order to achieve a satisfactory compromise between accuracy, experimental burden and computational time, a grey-box approach was adopted. A lumped capacity description of a selected telecommunication (TLC) equipment room was performed, by applying the <b>first</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thermodynamics</b> to a control volume including: walls; TLC equipment; air filling the room; CC system, which mainly consists of free-coolers (FC) and refrigeration units (RU).

Model generalization, performed comparing simulations with real measurements, highlighted the very good accuracy guaranteed by the modeling methodology proposed in the paper. Moreover, the relative simplicity and limited number of unknown parameters suggest using the model in optimization analyses aimed at minimizing CC-related energy consumption for a variety of TLC switching plants.

We consider the karstic aquifer as an Open Thermodynamic System (OTS), which boundaries are permeable to thermal energy and water. The <b>first</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics</b> allows considering the enthalpy balance between the input and output flows.

The method, restricted to selected data allowed retrieving values of base flow, mixing of flow, intrusions of streams, and aquifer answer to drawdown. The applicability of the method has been assessed in terms of propagation of the temporal fluctuations trough the solving but also in terms of conservative assumption itself. Our results allow retrieving the main hydrological properties of the karst as observed on field (timed volumetric samplings, geochemical analyses, step pumping test and allogenic intrusion of streams).

40|$|The task of elucidating the {{mechanism}} of solubility enhancement using hydrotropes has been hampered by {{the wide variety of}} phase behaviour that hydrotropes can exhibit, encompassing near-ideal aqueous solution, self-association, micelle formation, and micro-emulsions.

We demonstrate that the application of the two key concepts can in principle be used to distinguish the different molecular scenarios at work under apparently similar solubility curves observed from experiments.

For this purpose, the law of dynamic equilibrium referred to as D’Alembert’s supplemented principle is developed, which-being a generalisation of Newton’s supplemented third law-is derived directly from experience. The necessary con-dition of the dynamic equilibrium leads to the law of translation motion of a rigid body, which is the law of motion of the mass centre, whereas the sufficient condition of the dynamic equilibrium, absolutely independent from the necessary condition, leads to the law of rotary motion of an object, which is the law of moment of momentum. In generalizing this law to any material media, the primary principles of dynamics of those media are corrected, and in complementing the <b>first</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics,</b> the dynamics of multi-atomic gases are formulated.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{long-term}} planning of electric energy systems. Such systems are defined by complex interconnections of end-uses, energy conversion devices and natural resources. The planning process is usually guided {{by a number of}} design criteria, namely, economic, social and environmental impacts as well as system reliability and efficiency. The planning challenge is to find an acceptable compromise among these often conflicting objectives. System efficiency is a critical design criterion normally measuring the ratio of the system output and input energies. In electric energy systems, efficiency is normally defined according to the <b>First</b> <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thermodynamics</b> which states that energy cannot be destroyed. In this thesis, the definition of efficiency in electric energy system planning is broadened to include interpretations according to both the First and Second Principles of Thermodynamics. The Second Principle essentially states that the "quality" of energy decreases or, at best, remains constant in any conversion process where the quality of energy (denoted here by exergy) {{is a measure of the}} ability of a form of energy to be converted into any other form. Work, hydroelectric potential and electricity are examples of high quality energy sources while low temperatures heat end-use applications are at the low end of the quality scale. Since certain types of energy conversion processes may show high levels of exergy destruction, even though energetically efficient, it is important to design energy systems such that the energy quality of an end-use is matched as much as possible to that of the energy supply thus avoiding situation where a high quality supply is used for a low quality purpose. The electric energy industry has virtually ignored exergetic considerations in system planning due, to a large extent, to a lack of familiarity with the Second Principle and its implications. Nevertheless, exergy is an attribute which must be planned and conserved with at least the same priority as energy. It is demonstrated here that the planning of energy systems will be drastically affected when both energy and exergy are considered. However, to be able to rationally use the natural resources, exergetic analysis must become an integral part of system planning. This thesis analyses the application of the Second Principle of Thermodynamics in the planning of electric energy systems through theory, examples and case studies including economic considerations. In order to achieve electric energy systems that are more exergetically efficient, a new type of electric energy tariff called type-of-use, is proposed. Analogous to the time-of-use rate that assigns different monetary values for the time of the day considered, the type-of-use tariff assigns a monetary value to the end-uses. Simulations are performed in different electric energy systems to demonstrate that type-of-use tariffs will indeed lead to more exergetically efficient systems. The benefits of exergetic analysis are supported by a number of studies presented in this thesis. These studies analyse from the points of view of energetic and exergetic efficiency and cost the following: (i) A space heating system; (ii) The impact of a major introduction of electric vehicles in Canada and (iii) The long range planning of a regional electric power system consisting of two interconnected provinces...|$|E
40|$|This {{monograph}} {{grew out}} of a series of lectures given at the XXVI Summer School of Mathematical Physics, Ravello, September 2001, organized by G. N. F. M. (gruppo Nazionale di Fisica Matematica) of I. N. d. A. M. (Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica, Roma), at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Torino in the academic years 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002, and at the Departmento of Physical Sciences of the University of Napoli, May 2003. The elements of Symplectic Geometry and Analytical Mechanics on which these lectures are based {{can be found in the}} literature of the seventies and eighties of the last century. The bibliography is of course far from complete and refers the reader to some of the important contributions. Here, we introduce only the essential notions of symplectic geometry needed for application to the geometrical theory of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and to the control theory of static systems. Most of these notions are well known, but the way they are assembled and used is new in many respects. A fundamental role in the present approach is played by the notion of generating family and by two operations: the composition of generating families of symplectic relations and the canonical lift from objects on manifolds (submanifolds, relations, mappings, vector fields, etc.) to symplectic objects on the corresponding cotangent bundles. Generating families describe special subsets of cotangent bundles which we call Lagrangian sets. A Lagrangian set is a Lagrangian submanifold (which may be immersed) if the generating family is a Morse family. However, there are physically interesting examples of Lagrangian sets which are not Lagrangian submanifolds. An advantage of considering generating families as fundamental objects is that, while the composition of two symplectic relations may not be a smooth relation, the composition of two generating families is always a smooth function. In other words, the symplectic creed as formulated by A. Weinstein in his article Symplectic geometry (1981) in the form everything is a Lagrangian submanifold, which means that one should try to express objects in symplectic geometry and mechanics in terms of Lagrangian submanifolds, is here replaced by everything has a generating family. The geometrical theory of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is closely related to Geometrical Optics. The symplectic formulation of Hamiltonian Optics presented here differs from other formulations illustrated in papers and well known reference books cited in the Bibliography and it is, in my opinion, very close to the original ideas of Hamilton. From a geometrical view-point a Hamilton-Jacobi equation is a coisotropic submanifold of a cotangent bundle. A geometrical solution is a Lagrangian set described by a generating family and contained in the coisotropic submanifold. There are two fundametal symplectic relations associated with a Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the characteristic relation and the characteristic reduction. The two corresponding generating families are the Hamilton principal function and the complete solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, respectively. By composing the latter with its transpose we get the former. Since the characteristic relation is a singular Lagrangian submanifold, the Hamilton principal function is necessarily a generating family and not a two-point function as in the classical theory. Cauchy data (or sources of systems of rays), mirror and lenses are represented by symplectic relations thus, by generating families. Then the Cauchy problem and the actions of a lens or of a mirror on a system of rays are translated into the composition of generating families. What is presented here is only a first approach to Geometrical Optics based on the notions of symplectic relation and generating family. We do not cover many important examples of optical phenomena, which can be found in standard reference books (e. g. Synge, Luneburg, Buchdahl) and which probably can be treated within this framework. Perhaps, the use of generating families and symplectic relations does not yield a revolutionary progress in Hamiltonian Optics, but we are obliged to introduce these concepts if, for example, we want to give a global meaning to the Hamilton characteristic function, as shown in Chapters 3 and 4. Symplectic relations and generating families can play an interesting role also in the control theory of static systems, including thermostatic systems. Chapter 5 is devoted to this matter. Our approach is based on the notion of control relation and on an extended version of the virtual work principle for constrained systems with non-controlled degrees of freedom (hidden variables). Several examples of singular phenomena concerning static systems and thermostatics are illustrated. In particular, it is shown how the Maxwell rule follows as a theorem from the extended virtual work principle. Thermostatics of simple and composite systems is here described in the four-dimensional state space, with global coordinates (S, V, P, T), entropy, volume, pressure, absolute temperature, endowed with the natural symplectic structure induced by the <b>first</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics.</b> An outline of the basic tools of calculus on manifolds needed in our discussion is given in Appendix A.

In a first instance irreversible port-Hamiltonian systems are extended to encompass coupled mechanical and thermodynamical systems, leading {{to the definition of}} reversible-irreversible port Hamiltonian systems. In a second instance, the formalism is used to suggest a class of passivity based controllers for thermodynamic systems based on interconnection and Casimir functions. However, the extension of the Casimir method to irreversible port-Hamiltonian systems is not so straightforward due to the "interconnection obstacle". The heat exchanger, a gas-piston system and the non-isothermal CSTR are used to illustrate the formalism...|$|R
40|$|Exergy {{analysis}} of systems is extremely rich as {{it uses the}} so-called exergy accountancy which takes into account <b>first</b> and second <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics.</b> This exergetic accountancy enables to quantitatively evaluate what is calles qualitatively the energy degradation, i. e. to calculate precisely the consequences of different phenomena of thermodynamical irreversibility, indeed to calculate correctly the thermodynamic losses in a system. Therefore the exergetic accountancy enables to define correctly a thermodynamical yield, expressing the perfection degree, i. e. the thermodynamical quality of any system. Exergy analysis {{is a way to}} estblish a true diagnosis concerning the thermodynamical health of a system of any size, any complexity, whatever phenomena may take place in it (element, apparatus, machine, plant, system). It allows to move toward a better system optimization and a more rational use of plants. Finally it is a logical and coherent stand for energy tariffing...|$|R
40|$|We study non-perturbatively {{and from}} <b>first</b> <b>principles</b> the <b>thermodynamics</b> <b>of</b> {{vortices}} in 3 d U(1) gauge+Higgs theory, or the Ginzburg-Landau model, which has frequently {{been used as}} a model for cosmological topological defect formation. We discretize the system and introduce a gauge-invariant definition of a vortex passing through a loop on the lattice. We then study with Monte Carlo simulations the total vortex density, extract the physically meaningful part thereof, and demonstrate that it has a well-defined continuum limit. The total vortex density behaves as a pseudo order parameter, having a discontinuity in the regime of first order transitions and behaving continuously in the regime of second order transitions. Finally, we discuss further gauge-invariant observables to be measured. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures. Some references added; to appear in Phys. Lett. ...|$|R
40|$|We obtain {{macroscopic}} isothermal thermodynamic transformations by space-time scalings of {{a microscopic}} Hamiltonian dynamics {{in contact with}} a heat bath. The microscopic dynamics is given by a chain of anharmonic oscillators subject to a varying tension (external force) and the contact with the heat bath is modeled by independent Langevin dynamics acting on each particle. After a diffusive space-time scaling and cross-graining, the profile of volume converges to the solution of a deterministic diffusive equation with boundary conditions given by the applied tension. This defines an irreversible thermodynamic transformation from an initial equilibrium to a new equilibrium given by the final tension applied. Quasi static reversible isothermal transformations are then obtained by a further time scaling. Heat {{is defined as the}} total flux of energy exchanged between the system and the heat bath. Then we prove that the relation between the limit heat, work, free energy and thermodynamic entropy agree with the <b>first</b> and second <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We obtain {{macroscopic}} adiabatic thermodynamic transformations by space-time scalings of {{a microscopic}} Hamiltonian dynamics subject to ran-dom collisions with the environment. The microscopic dynamics {{is given by}} a chain of oscillators subject to a varying tension (external force) and to col-lisions with external independent particles of “infinite mass”. The effect of each collision {{is to change the}} sign of the velocity without changing the mod-ulus. This way the energy is conserved by the resulting dynamics. After a diffusive space-time scaling and cross-graining, the profiles of volume and en-ergy converge to the solution of a deterministic diffusive system of equations with boundary conditions given by the applied tension. This defines an irre-versible thermodynamic transformation from an initial equilibrium to a new equilibrium given by the final tension applied. Quasi-static reversible adiabatic transformations are then obtained by a further time scaling. Then we prove that the relations between the limit work, internal energy and thermodynamic entropy agree with the <b>first</b> and second <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a thought experiment involving {{the effect of}} gravitation on an ideal scale containing a photon. If the tidal forces inherent to a gravitational field are neglected, then one is led to scenario which seems to bring about perpetual motion violating the <b>first</b> and second <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermodynamics.</b> The tidal effects of gravity must neccessarily be included {{in order to obtain}} a consistent physical theory. As a result, Albert Einstein's thought experiments according to which the physical effects of inertia in an accelerated reference frame are equivalent to the effects of gravity in a frame at rest on the surface of a massive body must be reconsidered, since linearly accelerated frames do not produce tidal effects. We argue that the equivalence between inertial effects and gravitation can be restored for rotating frames and in this context a relation with the possible nature of quantum gravity is conjectured.
