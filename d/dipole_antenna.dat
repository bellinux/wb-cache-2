40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{previously}} introduced fuzzy modeling method {{is used to}} model the input impedance of two coupled <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> in the echelon form. The initial data of two coupled <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> in the parallel and collinear form, which are required for the model, are obtained using the MoM (Method of Moments). Then, the knowledge of two coupled <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> in the echelon form is easily predicted based on the knowledge of two coupled <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> in the parallel and collinear form {{and the concept of}} spatial membership functions. Comparing the results of the proposed model with MoM shows an excellent agreement with a vanishingly short execution time comparing with MoM. 1...|$|R
40|$|Emergent {{wireless}} systems {{based on}} personal communication standards are demanding new antennas with better performance {{in order to increase}} the distance of communications, to provide wider bandwidth and, in some case, to allow multiband behavior. The use of printed <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> is highly recommended in these applications. In this paper, we report on different printed <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> for wireless communications in particular scenarios. For point-to-point communications we propose two printed Yagi-like antennas with a high gain and low cost. For broadband communications we discuss the use of log-periodic printed <b>dipoles</b> <b>antennas.</b> Finally, for multiband communication systems, dual-band printed <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> are investigated. In any case, some illustrative designs, for specific applications, are described. They are also analyzed by means of FDTD simulations and compared with standard measurements such as insertion losses and radiation patterns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—General {{expressions}} for {{the quality}} factor (Q) of antennas are minimized to obtain lower-bound formulas for the Q of electrically small, lossy or lossless, combined electric and magnetic <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> confined to an arbitrarily shaped volume. The lower-bound formulas for Q are derived for <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> with specified electric and magnetic dipole moments excited by both electric and magnetic surface currents {{as well as by}} electric surface currents alone. With either excitation, separate formulas are found for the <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> containing only lossless or “nondispersive-conductivity” material and for the <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> containing “highly dispersive lossy ” material. The formulas involve the quasi-static electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the associated perfectly conducting volume of the antenna, the ratio of the powers radiated by the specified electric and magnetic dipole moments, and the efficiency of the antenna. 1...|$|R

25|$|Cylindrical– The {{reflector}} is curved in {{only one}} direction and flat in the other. The radio waves come to a focus not at a point but along a line. The feed is sometimes a <b>dipole</b> <b>antenna</b> located along the focal line. Cylindrical parabolic antennas radiate a fan-shaped beam, narrow in the curved dimension, and wide in the uncurved dimension. The curved ends of the reflector are sometimes capped by flat plates, to prevent radiation out the ends, and {{this is called a}} pillbox antenna.|$|E
25|$|The {{feedpoint}} impedance of a <b>dipole</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is sensitive}} to its electrical length and feedpoint position. Therefore, a dipole will generally only perform optimally over a rather narrow bandwidth, beyond which its impedance will become a poor match for the transmitter or receiver (and transmission line). The real (resistive) and imaginary (reactive) components of that impedance, {{as a function of}} electrical length, are shown in the accompanying graph. The detailed calculation of these numbers are described below. Note that the value of the reactance is highly dependent on the diameter of the conductors; this plot is for conductors with a diameter of 0.001wavelengths.|$|E

500|$|The {{radar system}} for which Alvarez {{is best known}} and which has {{played a major role}} in aviation, most {{particularly}} in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Using Alvarez's <b>dipole</b> <b>antenna</b> to achieve a very high angular resolution, GCA allows ground-based radar operators watching special precision displays to guide a landing airplane to the runway by transmitting verbal commands to the pilot. The system was simple, direct, and worked well, even with previously untrained pilots. It was so successful that the military continued to use it for many years after the war, and it was still in use in some countries in the 1980s. Alvarez was awarded the National Aeronautic Association's Collier Trophy in 1945 [...] "for his conspicuous and outstanding initiative in the concept and development of the Ground Control Approach system for safe landing of aircraft under all weather and traffic conditions".|$|E

40|$|Although the {{potential}} of <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> for ultrahigh-field (UHF) MRI is largely recognized, they are still relatively unknown to the larger part of the MRI community. This article intends to provide electromagnetic insight into the general operating principles of <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> by numerical simulations. The major part focuses on a comparison study of <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> and loop coils at frequencies of 128, 298 and 400 MHz. This study shows that <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> are only efficient radiofrequency (RF) coils {{in the presence of}} a dielectric and/or conducting load. In addition, the conservative electric fields (E-fields) at the ends of a dipole are negligible in comparison with the induced E-fields in the center. Like loop coils, long <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> perform better than short dipoles for deeply located imaging targets and vice versa. When the optimal element is chosen for each depth, loop coils have higher B 1 + efficiency for shallow depths, whereas <b>dipole</b> <b>antennas</b> have higher B 1 + efficiency for large depths. The cross-over point depth decreases with increasing frequency: 11. 6, 6. 2 and 5. 0 cm for 128, 298 and 400 MHz, respectively. For single elements, loop coils demonstrate a better B 1 +/√SARmax ratio for any target depth and any frequency. However, one example study shows that, in an array setup with loop coil overlap for decoupling, this relationship is not straightforward. The overlapping loop coils may generate increased specific absorption rate (SAR) levels under the overlapping parts of the loops, depending on the drive phase settings.

2500|$|Many {{types of}} coaxial cable have a {{characteristic}} impedance of 75Ω, which would therefore {{be a good}} match for a half-wave dipole, however, without special precautions, coax transmission line easily becomes unbalanced (with one conductor at ground potential) whereas a <b>dipole</b> <b>antenna</b> presents a balanced input (both terminals have an equal but opposite voltage with respect to ground). When an antenna is unbalanced, the unbalanced currents or “common mode” currents will flow backward along the outer conductor and the coax line will radiate, {{in addition to the}} antenna itself,. An important consequence is distortion of the antenna’s designed radiation pattern, and change in the impedance seen by the line. The dipole can be properly fed, and retain its expected characteristics, by using a [...] balun in between the coaxial feedline and the antenna terminals. Connection of coax to a <b>dipole</b> <b>antenna</b> using a balun is described in greater detail below.|$|E
2500|$|In {{radio and}} {{telecommunications}} a <b>dipole</b> <b>antenna</b> or doublet is {{the simplest and}} most widely used class of antenna. [...] The dipole is any one of a class of antennas producing a radiation pattern approximating that of an elementary electric dipole with a radiating structure supporting a line current so energized that the current has only one node at each end. [...] A <b>dipole</b> <b>antenna</b> commonly consists of two identical conductive elements such as metal wires or rods, which are usually bilaterally symmetrical. [...] The driving current from the transmitter is applied, or for receiving antennas the output signal to the receiver is taken, between {{the two halves of}} the antenna. [...] Each side of the feedline to the transmitter or receiver is connected to one of the conductors. [...] This contrasts with a monopole antenna, which consists of a single rod or conductor [...] with one side of the feedline connected to it, and the other side connected to some type of ground. [...] A common example of a dipole is the [...] "rabbit ears" [...] television antenna found on broadcast television sets.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{applications}} of the <b>dipole</b> <b>antenna</b> is the rabbit ears or bunny ears television antenna, found atop broadcast television receivers. [...] It is used to receive the VHF terrestrial television bands, consisting in the US of 52 to 88nbsp&MHz (band I) and 174 to 216nbsp&MHz (band III), with wavelengths of 5.5 to 1.4 m. [...] Since this frequency range is much wider than a single fixed <b>dipole</b> <b>antenna</b> can cover, it is made with several degrees of adjustment. [...] It is constructed of two telescoping rods that can be extended out to about 1 m length (approximately one quarter wavelength at 52nbsp&MHz). [...] Instead of being fixed in opposing directions, these elements can be adjusted at an angle in a [...] "V" [...] shape. [...] The reason for the V shape is that when receiving channels {{at the top of the}} band, the antenna elements will typically resonate at their 3rd harmonic. [...] In this mode the direction of maximum gain is no longer perpendicular to the rods, but the radiation pattern will have lobes at an angle to the rods, making it advantageous to be able to adjust them to various angles.|$|E
2500|$|The quarter-wave {{monopole}} antenna is a single-element antenna fed at one end, that behaves as a <b>dipole</b> <b>antenna.</b> It is formed by a conductor [...] in length, fed {{in the lower}} end, which is near a conductive surface which works as a reflector (see effect of ground) and {{is an example of}} a Marconi antenna. The current in the reflected image has the same direction and phase as the current in the real antenna. The quarter-wave conductor and its image together form a half-wave dipole that radiates only in the upper half of space.|$|E
