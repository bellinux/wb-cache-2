25|$|The {{origin of}} kinetic {{friction}} at nanoscale {{can be explained}} by thermodynamics. Upon sliding, new surface forms at the back of a sliding true contact, and existing surface disappears at the front of it. Since all surfaces involve the thermodynamic surface energy, work must be spent in creating the new surface, and energy is released as heat in removing the surface. Thus, a force is required to move the back of the contact, and <b>frictional</b> <b>heat</b> is released at the front.|$|E
30|$|<b>Frictional</b> <b>heating</b> is {{considered}} as an indispensable mechanism to cause SAPS (Wang and Lühr 2013). <b>Frictional</b> <b>heating</b> raises the recombination rate and reduces electron density/conductivity, and then SAPS {{is generated by}} the electric field that increases in intensity because of current continuity. However, this small electric field of 7.5 – 10  mV/m cannot lead to <b>frictional</b> <b>heating.</b> In other words, <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> is not always necessary to generate SAPS {{in the framework of}} the coupled large-scale magnetosphere-ionosphere system. It {{should also be noted that}} <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> is indispensable only in the current generator model. Other models are based on other mechanisms of enhancing electric fields. For example, the voltage generator model proposes formation of greater electric fields under constant potential drop and narrower Alfven layer.|$|R

The criterion adopted in this study for the identification of ion <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> was that defined by McCrea et al., requiring an enhancement in the F-region field-parallel ion temperature exceeding 100 K over two consecutive integration periods, which was itself based on a selection criterion for <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> derived for the study of high-latitude F-region ion temperature observations from the Atmospheric Explorer-C satellite. In the present study, the diurnal distribution of ion <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> observed by EISCAT is established and, furthermore, its dependence on geomagnetic activity and the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is investigated; results are interpreted with reference to corresponding distributions of enhanced ion velocity, again derived from the extended set of EISCAT UHF common programme observations. The radar, due to its location relative to the large-scale convection pattern, observes ion <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> principally during the night, although preferentially during the post-midnight hours where there is reduced coupling between the ion and neutral populations.

40|$|Differential {{rotation}} {{between the}} neutron star crust {{and a more}} rapidly rotating interior superfluid leads to <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> that affects the star's long-term thermal evolution and resulting surface emission. Here we present the results of thermal evolution simulations based on two models of the vortex pinning forces that bracket a range of plausible pinning strengths. We include the effects of superfluidity, magnetic fields, and temperature gradients. As representative standard and accelerated neutrino emission processes {{taking place in the}} core, we consider the modified Urca process in normal baryonic matter, and the much faster quark Urca process. Comparison of our results with neutron star surface temperature data, including the recent temperature measurement of the Geminga pulsar, shows that stars with soft equations of state and modest <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> are in closest agreement with the data; stars with stronger <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> have temperatures inconsistent with the upper limit of PSR 1929 + 10. Stiffer stars undergoing standard cooling generally have temperatures lying above the Vela detection, a situation worsened by the inclusion of <b>frictional</b> <b>heating.</b> Stars undergoing accelerated cooling without <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> have temperatures that fall far below most temperature measurements; the Vela and Geminga detections being the most compelling examples. Only in stiff stars, which have thick crusts, can the inclusion of strong <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> raise the temperature at late stages in the evolution to a level consistent with the data. However, such a large amount of heating leads to a temperature at ∼ 1000 yr in excess of the Crab upper limit.

40|$|Thermoelastic {{contact is}} known to show instabilities when the heat {{transmitted}} across the interface depends on the pressure, either because of a pressure-dependent thermal contact resistance R(p) or because of <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> due to the product of friction coefficient, speed, and pressure, fVp. Recently, the combined effect of pressure-dependent thermal contact resistance and <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> has been studied {{in the context of}} simple rod models or for a more realistic elastic conducting half-plane sliding against a rigid perfect conductor "wall". Because R(p) introduces a non-linearity even in full contact, the "critical speed" for the uniform pressure solution to be unstable depends not just on material properties, and geometry, but also on the heat flux and on pressure. Here, the case of two different elastic and conducting half-planes is studied, and <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> is shown to produce significant effects on the stability boundaries with respect to the Zhang and Barber (J. Appl. Mech. 57 (1990) 365) corresponding case with no sliding. In particular, <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> makes instability possible for a larger range of prescribed temperature drop at the interface including, at sufficiently high speeds, the region of opposite sign of that giving instability in the corresponding static case. The effect of <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> is particularly relevant for one material combinations of the Zhang and Barber (J. Appl.

40|$|Ion <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> {{constitutes}} one of {{the principal}} mechanisms whereby energy, originating in the solar wind, is deposited into the Earth's ionosphere and ultimately the neutral atmosphere. Common programme observations by the EISCAT UHF radar system, spanning the years 1984 to 1995, provide the basis for a comprehensive statistical study of ion <b>frictional</b> <b>heating,</b> results of which are documented in this and a previous paper by the authors. In the present work, the authors demonstrate the solar and seasonal dependence of the universal time distribution of <b>frictional</b> <b>heating,</b> and explain these results with reference to corresponding dependences of the ion velocity. Although EISCAT observes {{a significant increase in the}} occurrence of enhanced ion velocities associated with increased solar activity, the latter characterised according to the prevailing 10. 7 cm solar flux, this is not reflected to such an extent in the occurrence of <b>frictional</b> <b>heating.</b> It is suggested that this is a consequence of the decreased neutral atmosphere response times associated with active solar conditions, resulting from the higher ionospheric plasma densities present. Seasonal effects on the diurnal distribution of ion <b>frictional</b> <b>heating</b> are well explained by corresponding variations in ionospheric convection, the latter principally a result of geometrical factors. It is noted that, over the entire dataset, the variations in the unperturbed F-region ion temperature, required to implement the identification criterion for ion heating, are highly correlated with model values of thermospheric temperature.
