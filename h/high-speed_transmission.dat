For example, in the IEEE 802.11 ad standard draft, low-density parity-check (LDPC) with a length of 672 bits can be specified in the encoding method [6]. Unfortunately, with the nonlinear PA, it is shown that even such a long LDPC code has been applied, the BER performance seems still to be less attractive to practical use (especially for the high-order modulations).|$|R
