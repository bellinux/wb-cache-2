40|$|Increasing {{industrial}} activities in Lamongan District {{is assumed to}} be followed by the increase on the amount of liters in rivers and ponds. Freshwater snails (Filopaludina javanika v. d Busch 1844) that live in rivers and ponds are always exposed to heavy metals. Based on the result of the measurement of Pb in freshwater snails in Waung river, Glagah subdistrict, Lamongan, the highest amount of Pb reached 4. 48 mg/kg. This aim of this research was to decrease the amount of Pb in freshwater snails. This research employed an experimental method using complete randomized design with 4 treatments and 3 repetitions; P 1 (6 -hour <b>flushing</b> <b>procedure),</b> P 2 (12 -hour <b>flushing</b> <b>procedure),</b> P 3 (18 -hour <b>flushing</b> <b>procedure),</b> and P 4 (24 -hour <b>flushing</b> <b>procedure)</b> with the reduction on the level of Pb in the “whole organ” of the freshwater snails. The results show that 24 -hour of flushing has reduced the amount of Pb as much as 53. 2 %, from 2. 65 ppm, leaving only 1. 24 ppm. Meanwhile, the least reduction was found in the 6 -hour <b>flushing</b> <b>procedure</b> at 7. 2 %. The results of the treatments have obtained amount of Pb under the minimum safety requirement set by BPOM (2009), Fisheries (DKP) No: Kep 17 /Men/ 2004, SK Ditjen POM No. 03725 /B/SK/VII/ 1989, in which it is stated that materials that contain heavy metals less than 1. 5 ppm are safe to consume for duck weft and for human.

This report investigates if the stomach flushing tube can be a vehicle to transmit potential pathogens from a sick penguin to a healthy penguin, and if implementation of aseptic or disinfection practice is warranted in the stomach flushing technique. A total of 19 tubes from 19 penguins were examined for bacterial presence from May until August 2007.

40|$|A dual-layer ion-exchange latex-coated {{column was}} {{prepared}} and characterised for on-capillary preconcentration of cations using an open-tubular ion-exchange CEC format. After preconcentration, the analyte cations were eluted with a transient isotachophoretic gradient and separated by CE. The latex double layer {{was established by}} first coating the negatively charged wall of the capillary {{with a layer of}} cationic quaternary ammonium anion-exchange Dionex AS 5 A latex particles (60 nm diameter), and then coating a layer of anionic sulphonated cation-exchange Dionex CS 3 latex particles (300 nm diameter) onto the underlying AS 5 A layer. The adhesion of layers is based on electrostatic attractions. Several dual-layer capillaries were characterised for their EOF and ion-exchange capacity and this showed that coatings could be prepared reproducibly by a simple <b>flushing</b> <b>procedure.</b> The dual-layer columns exhibited a moderate, pH-independent EOF (ca. 26 × 10 - 9 m 2 V- 1 s- 1) and an ion-exchange capacity of 57 µequiv. /g (or 2. 69 nequiv. /column). Using an 8 cm length of coated capillary combined with a 72 cm length of untreated capillary, a method for on-line preconcentration and separation of monovalent organic bases, alkali metal ions and alkaline earth metal ions by CE was developed. Recoveries for the preconcentration step were 48 % for 4 -methylbenzylammonium, 43 % for benzylammonium, 30 - 32 % for alkali metal ions and 71 - 75 % for alkaline earth cations. In all cases, recoveries were reproducible with RSDs being less than 6. 2 %. The influences of the ion-exchange selectivity coefficient of the analyte and the sample-loading rate on analyte recovery were also examined. The proposed method was utilised for the determination of alkaline earth cations and low µM detection limits were obtained...|$|E
40|$|Leukocytes play an {{important}} role in the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In the reperfusion phase of OLT a DIC-like situation has been described and has been held responsible for the high blood loss during this phase. We investigated the role of leukocytes in the pathogenesis of DIC in OLT by measuring the leukocytic mediators released upon activation (cathepsin B, elastase, TNF, neopterin) and the levels of thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) complexes, seen as markers of prothrombin activation. Arterial blood samples were taken at 10 different time points during and after OLT. Samples were also taken of the perfusate released from the liver graft vein during the <b>flushing</b> <b>procedure</b> before the reperfusion phase. Aprotinin was given as a continuous infusion (0. 2 - 0. 4 Mill. KlU/hr) and its plasma levels were determined. Significantly elevated levels of neopterin (15 -fold; P< 0. 01), cathepsin B (440 -fold; P< 0. 01) in the perfusate, as compared with the systemic circulation, as well as their significant increases in the early reperfusion phase suggested that they were released by the graft liver. This was paralleled by elevated levels of elastase (1. 3 -fold, P< 0. 05), TNF (1. 5 -fold, P=NS), and TAT complexes (1. 4 -fold; P< 0. 1) in the perfusate. Significant correlations could be identified between the parameters of leukocyte activation and TAT complexes, whereas no correlation was observed between any of the parameters investigated and the aprotinin levels. Our results strongly indicate a release of leukocytic mediators from the graft liver during its reperfusion which seems to be related to the parallely increased prothrombin activation. No correlation could be seen between levels of aprotinin and levels of leukocytic mediators. ...|$|E
40|$|Embryo {{transfer}} (ET) is a biotechnology {{that allows}} {{to get more}} than one foal from a single mare during a breading season and also to prevent the removal of mares from their competition careers. Nevertheless, to achieve a successful outcome, the association of many factors must be considered such as the management of donor and recipient mares, the stallions and the veterinarian´s experience. The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate (1) if some of characteristics related to the donor mares such as the breed and the reproductive status, may influence the embryo recovery; (2) if climate and different donor mares location may have impact in breeding programs; (3) the effect of some reproductive techniques and embryo transfer methodologies such as the day of uterine flushing, the type of semen, the stallion and the moment of inseminations and transfer as potential effectors of success. To achieve the objectives pointed out, one hundred and fifty six uterine flushes and eighty eight embryo transfers were performed. Obtained results showed higher embryo recovery rates at day 8 (61. 1 %) and an overall pregnancy rate of 62. 2 %. An influence of the month of the year (P= 0. 04) and of the type of semen (fresh or frozen; P= 0. 03) on the number of positive embryo collections were identified. No other significant effects upon the remaining determinants under testing were observed, although stallions were responsible for inducing 11 % of the variability within embryo recovery rates. In conclusion, the main factors that had a great influence in this embryo transfer program were the type of semen and the day and month of the uterine <b>flushing</b> <b>procedure.</b> The use of fresh semen for donor mares insemination and recovery at day 8 increased the number of embryos that were collected during this period, although lower results were obtained in July-August.

40|$|To {{assess the}} state of {{knowledge}} regarding the effectiveness of distribution system disinfectant residuals during accidental microbial intrusions, the authors reviewed laboratory-, pilot-, and full-scale experimental studies. The persistence of microorganisms in the biofilms of simulated mains at the laboratory scale was much longer than in pilot-scale settings, under the typical disinfectant residual concentrations used in distribution systems. Most of the studies reviewed used culture-based methods for the enumeration of microorganisms, which are known to underestimate the number and diversity of microorganisms. Because the distribution system is the last barrier between the treatment plant and the consumer, intrusion is of concern to utility managers. Conditions experienced during some repairs—zero- or low-flow conditions and/or delay in reinstatement of disinfection—are likely to be critical for the persistence of intruded microorganisms in the biofilm, a fact that {{underscores the importance of}} adequate chlorination and <b>flushing</b> <b>procedures.</b> For the research community, this review highlights the need for additional studies using methods (e. g. molecular tools) that allow the detection of viable but nonculturable microorganisms. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Currently, all transoceanic vessels {{entering}} the Great Lakes must perform ballast water exchange or saltwater <b>flushing,</b> <b>procedures</b> {{designed to reduce}} the risk of new biological invasions from ballast water. Vessels not in compliance with these regulations presently have limited, often costly, and/or time-consuming alternatives available. Treatment with sodium chloride brine at an initial concentration of 230 ‰ has been proposed as an emergency ballast water management option and is examined here. Six shipboard trials were conducted under operational conditions to determine the efficacy of brine ballast water treatment. Trials were conducted on three vessels with full ballast tanks and on three vessels with only residual ballast water. Brine distribution in tanks was adequate, noting that vessel movement was essential to ensure mixing into ballast water or ballast residuals. Once mixing has occurred, approximately 25. hour exposure to 45 ‰ brine or 1 hour exposure to 115 ‰ brine is required to effectively exterminate freshwater zooplankton. Brine appears to be a cost-effective and relatively safe procedure that could be implemented immediately for emergency treatment of non-compliant ballast water to reduce risk of new invasions in the Great Lakes. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|In {{the current}} study uteri from {{recently}} slaughtered mares were flushed in a seriesconnected defined pattern three times in succession. The recovered fluid was analysed for different factors. The main interest {{was to determine the}} density of uterine epithelial cells in the recovered fluid and to quantify the amount of living cells among those with the method of trypan blue staining. Both investigations haven’t been described before. Smear preparates from each <b>flushing</b> <b>procedure</b> were made with different staining methods to analyse them for their quality and various corpuscular structures in the fluid. The study demonstrates that the density of epithelial cells significantly decreased according to the sequence of flushings. In the first and second flush a significantly higher amount of cells was observed in mares during estrus compared to mares in diestrus. The amount of vital epithelial cells within all epithelial cells reached the highest value with the first of the three flushing procedures and decreased in each of the continuous two, however with no significance. The time of exitus didn’t have any significant effect on the amount of vital epithelial cells. The analysis of the smear preparates revealed the fact, that each routine testing for morphological aspects, manually done by an examiner, is always subjectively influenced. Smears from same aliquots, even though equally analysed, led to partly different results among the different staining methods. The reduction of polymorphnuclear neutrophil granulocytes according to the chronology of flushing procedures though was consistently observed with significance among PAP-Quick and Diff-Quick, noticeably, but without significance under May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining. In conclusion we can say that the average value of 3, 37 ± 4, 87 vital epithelial cells in the recovered fluid seems to be low, even though references in literature don’t exist. In studies with cuts of cattle uterus the methods generate a many times higher amount of vital cells but require the excision of the uterus or euthanizing of the patient. The current studies aim was to serve as a prestudy for further investigations in the living patient. The results, including density an vital amount of epithelial cells obtained by uterine flushing can therefore be considered as a new guideline...|$|E
40|$|The Due Hydroelectric Project is a {{proposed}} 50 MW run-of-river hydroelectric project {{being developed by}} Hidroalto SA. The project will be located on the Rio Due in Ecuador. The civil works of the intake facility will be comprised of a 133. 45 m wide diversion weir, with two overflow spillways and six gated sluice channels; a four bay intake structure with sediment excluder; and, a fish bypass facility. Northwest Hydraulic Consultants (NHC) evaluated the initial design of the Due intake and spillway facilities using a 1 : 35 Froude-scaled physical model for river discharges ranging from the intake design discharge of 57. 2 m 3 /s to the 1000 -year flood of 2, 339 m 3 /s. The testing in the physical model revealed some deficiencies {{in the performance of}} the initial design of the spillway stilling basins and some opportunities to reduce construction costs. Modifications to the initial design were proposed and evaluated in the model during the design optimization testing phase. The final recommended modifications included: adding a new stilling basin wall separating one of the overflow spillways from adjacent sluice channels; reducing the length of the stilling basin; decreasing the height and thickness of the stilling basin walls; and modifying pier noses to reduce flow disturbances. Furthermore, a sluice gate operation guideline was developed in order to maintain sufficient energy dissipation within the stilling basins for the range of river discharges covered in the study. The physical model was also utilized to evaluate the reservoir sediment <b>flushing</b> <b>procedure</b> and the performance of the intake sediment excluder. Fine sand was used in the model to simulate the reservoir deposits such that qualitative observations of the sediment flushing could be made. Accordingly, a sluice gate operating guideline was developed to maximize the sediment flushing from the reservoir. Finally, the physical model used light-weight sediments to evaluate the efficacy of the intake sediment excluder in trapping sediment to qualitatively observe the sediment load into the intake and the particle trapping process. Modifications to the intake sediment excluder were recommended to improve sediment trapping efficiency and reduce construction costs...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Isolated lung {{perfusion}} (ILuP) is {{an experimental}} technique {{for the treatment}} of pulmonary metastases. We hypothesized that part of the drug taken up by the lung during ILuP is washed out during the <b>flush</b> <b>procedure.</b> Therefore, we investigated gemcitabine uptake at different inflow concentrations, and the effect of delayed clamp release after ILuP on lung levels was studied. METHODS: Thirty rats had ILuP during 30 minutes using gemcitabine perfusate levels of 1. 3, 2. 7, 4. 0, 5. 3, and 6. 7 mg/mL. Another 37 rats underwent ILuP with gemcitabine perfusate levels of 6. 7 mg/mL during 6 minutes followed by a 5 -minute flush and 30 or 60 minutes of reperfusion, while two other groups had ILuP and delayed clamp release for 30 or 60 minutes followed by a 5 -minute flush. All effluent and lung samples were stored for later analysis. Results were evaluated using Friedmann two-way analysis and two-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: At 6 minutes, steady-state of gemcitabine uptake was achieved for all inflow concentrations and a linear relation (r = 0. 933, p < 0. 0001) between effluent and lung levels was observed. Delayed clamp release resulted in significantly higher lung levels compared with immediate restoration of blood circulation after ILuP (456 % at 30 minutes and 828 % at 60 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: Effective gemcitabine lung levels are already achieved after 6 minutes of ILuP with 6. 7 mg/mL followed by delayed clamp release during 30 minutes instead of the clinically applied 30 minutes ILuP. status: publishe...|$|R

The capacitor and rail-gap required alterations from existing designs to minimize system inductance and component count, maximize reliability, and enhance maintainability. For the capacitors, development {{has resulted in}} a plastic cased device with double ended bushings. The design of the capacitors` output electrodes, foil packs, and internal interconnect webbing results in a capacitor with improved performance. The capacitors are rated at 33. 5 uF and 60 kV and are housed in a 28 in. {times} 29 in. {times} 13 in. fiberglass case. Terminal inductance is less than 15 nH with a design discharge current greater than 650 kA. An improved ``third generation`` rail-gap will be utilized and {{is a product of the}} ACE machine developments at Maxwell Laboratories. The gap has a polyurethane body and one piece electrodes. To minimize prefires, a modified internal profile reduces the E-field and increases tracking length between the electrodes. With an individual Marx stage charged ``+`` and ``{minus}`` and a trigger rail with 50 / 50 grading (mid-plane), external trigger bias or coupling components are not required. This further reduces system component count. To further reduce gap prefires and environmental concerns, high pressure air, instead of the typical Argon/SF 6 mixture, will be used. The metallic switching by-products will form insulating oxides and the gap <b>flushing</b> <b>procedures</b> are simplified.

To improve the accuracy, we implemented continuous bladder <b>flushing</b> <b>procedures.</b> Female mice and rats were scanned using microPET/computed tomography (CT) at baseline and after induction of acute colitis by injecting 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) intrarectally. During the scans, the bladder was continuously flushed in one group, whereas in the other group, no bladder flushing was performed. As a means of in vivo and ex vivo validation of the inflammation, animals also underwent colonoscopy and were sacrificed for gamma counting (subpopulation) and to score the colonic damage both micro- and macroscopically as well as biochemically. At baseline, the microPET signal in the colon of both mice and rats was significantly higher in the nonflushed group compared to the flushed group, caused by the PVE of tracer activity in the bladder. Hence, the colonoscopy and postmortem analyses showed no significant differences at baseline between the flushed and nonflushed animals. TNBS induced significant colonic inflammation, as revealed by colonoscopic and postmortem scores, which was not detected by microPET in the mice without bladder flushing, again because of spillover of bladder activity in the colonic area. MicroPET in bladder-flushed animals did reveal {{a significant increase in}} 18 F-FDG uptake. Correlations between microPET and colonoscopy, macroscopy, microscopy, and myeloperoxidase yielded higher Spearman rho values in mice with continuously flushed bladders during imaging. Comparable, although somewhat less pronounced, results were shown in the rat.

40|$|Despite current {{management}} practices discoloured water events in both filtered and unfiltered water distribution systems {{continue to be}} a major issue for the water industry worldwide. Limited research has taken place into the formation and prediction of discoloured water events in unfiltered water distribution systems. The most widely adopted measuring techniques currently used by the majority of water companies to identify and measure discoloured water events, namely, discoloured water customer complaints and water quality grab samples, severely underestimate the extent to which discoloured water events occur. Customer complaints and grab samples also give little information as to the cause, time or magnitude of a discoloured water event. It is recommended that water companies not use discoloured water customer complaints or water quality grab samples for the prediction of areas at risk of forming discoloured water in unfiltered water distribution systems with lined or PVC pipes. This study demonstrates that monitoring sites for continuous on-line testing of turbidity and flow rate in series within the water supply network can be used effectively to investigate the operating environment of the system and understand the steady state hydraulics that cause discoloured water events in an unfiltered system. This new understanding can be used in preventative management of discoloured water events. This study investigated discoloured water formation in a 450 mm transfer main in Wantirna water quality zone of South East Water in Melbourne, Australia, as an example of an unfiltered water distribution system with few unlined ferrous pipes. The study found that the majority of discoloured water events could be explained by the erosion of cohesive layers of particles formed on the internal pipe wall when a critical shear stress was exceeded in the pipe. For the system investigated, the critical shear stress was variable and could be estimated from the maximum applied shear stress reached in a particular section of pipe in the preceding 24 hours. It is therefore recommended that operational <b>procedures,</b> particularly isolated <b>flushing</b> <b>procedures,</b> be modified to reduce the occurrence of unplanned incidences of discoloured water when the critical shear stress of a pipe is exceeded. A hydraulic model and the method for estimating the critical shear stress outlined in this thesis could be used to test scenarios of operational procedures to identify pipes with increased likelihood of producing discoloured water. The cohesive layers which contribute to discoloured water events appear to form in less than 1 week. It is therefore also recommended that the mains cleaning techniques using flushing currently employed to remove material causing discoloured water events appear to have no medium or long term benefits for the system investigated and further investigation into the effectiveness of routine flushing programs for the prevention of discoloured water events is required. When the causes of discoloured water are understood, a system can be proactively managed to prevent discoloured water events by managing those causes. This philosophy fulfils contempory water system management approaches such as the Framework for the Management of Drinking Water Quality in the 2004 Australian Drinking Water Guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{large-scale}} {{drinking water}} chemical contamination incidents in Canada and the U. S. have affected more than 1, 000, 000 people. In all cases premise plumbing has become contaminated and disparate plumbing decontamination approaches have been applied. Premise plumbing components include the service line and piping within {{the building as}} well as various appurtenances (i. e., tanks, valves, fixtures). The overall research goal was to identify techniques and technologies {{that can be used}} for premise plumbing decontamination. To achieve this goal two separate studies were conducted and are presented as two independent thesis chapters. ^ The study described in Chapter 1 was designed to understand current knowledge associated with premise plumbing contamination and create a rationale for science based water flushing protocols. Objectives were to (1) review past premise plumbing contamination incidents and the decontamination approaches applied, and (2) develop and test a mass balance water heater model. Thirty-nine drinking water contamination incidents were identified that involved a wide range of contaminants. Results showed that plumbing system design, operational conditions, contaminant properties, as well as building inhabitant safety have not been fully considered in premise plumbing flushing protocol design. Flushing could decontaminate some, but not all plumbing systems and poorly designed procedures likely caused residents to become ill during some incidents. Several water heater modeling scenarios showed that contaminant levels could exceed drinking water health limits after flushing and water saving fixtures, devices, water heater size, and flow rate affected contaminant removal efficiency. ^ The study described in Chapter 2 was conducted to examine the effectiveness of surfactants to decontaminate plastic plumbing components. Objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the impact of Alconox® detergent, Dawn® soap, and MAG IT DG 100 surfactant solutions on the strength, dimension, and mass of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), cross-linked polyethylene (PEX), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastics, and (2) determine the effectiveness of Alconox® detergent solution for decontaminating PEX-a and copper pipes exposed to crude oil contaminated water. Results showed that MAG solution constituents, at room temperature, permeated all plastics within 3 days, but EPDM was the most affected (+ 45 % weight; + 43 % volume; - 82 % tensile strength). ^ Results of these studies provide a better understanding of premise plumbing contamination as well as decontamination techniques, approaches, and technologies. In response to future drinking water contamination incidents, premise plumbing decontamination procedures should be based on water heater modeling, pilot-, and field-testing. Also recommended is that <b>flushing</b> <b>procedures</b> be developed that consider system design, operation, organic contaminant properties, and building inhabitant safety. In particular, plastic components exposed to crude oil contaminated water pose a unique challenge to returning contaminated plumbing to safe use. Additional decontamination studies are recommended that involve other plastics, contaminants, and surfactants. Studies should also examine the role of temperature and flow/mixing on decontamination effectiveness. Results from this study show that current decontamination practices can degrade plastics (e. g., mechanical strength, oxidative resistance) and can leave residual surfactant compounds in the plastics. While in-situ cleaning of plastic plumbing components is preferred, component removal and replacement should be considered. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.) ...|$|R

Biologically, it is likely that most probe sets are associated with un-expressed genes, so the measured values are simply noise due to non-specific binding; also many probe sets are associated with non-differentially-expressed (non-DE) genes. In an analysis to find DE genes, these probe sets contribute to the false discoveries, so it is desirable to filter out these probe sets prior to analysis. In the methodology proposed here, we first fit a robust linear model for probe-level Affymetrix data that accounts for probe and array effects. We then develop a novel <b>procedure</b> called <b>FLUSH</b> (Filtering Likely Uninformative Sets of Hybridizations), which excludes probe sets that have statistically small array-effects or large residual variance. This filtering procedure was evaluated on a publicly available data set from a controlled spiked-in experiment, as well as on a real experimental data set of a mouse model for retinal degeneration. In both cases, FLUSH filtering improves the sensitivity in the detection of DE genes compared to analyses using unfiltered, presence-filtered, intensity-filtered and variance-filtered data. A freely-available package called <b>FLUSH</b> implements the <b>procedures</b> and graphical displays described in the article...|$|R
40|$|In Sweden, {{there are}} more than 500 000 small and about 500 {{relatively}} large ground source heat pumps (GSHP) having a total installed capacity of about 5. 6 GW delivering approximately 15 TWh. yr- 1 of heating and cooling energy in Sweden. The operational lifetime and reliability of any GSHP depends heavily on the way the system is designed, installed and operated. In order to provide a good system performance after installation, aspects such as borehole heat exchanger (BHE) system flushing, charging and purging, among others, should be taken into consideration. The aim of this work has been to review some existing methods of system flushing, charging and purging in order and make observations that may be applicable for the GSHP industry. Two Swedish case studies have been followed up and compared to existing strategies suggested by IGSHPA. The results show that {{there is a lack of}} specific recommendations regarding the <b>flushing</b> and purging <b>procedures</b> for BHEs in Sweden. A well-defined range or adaptation of similar IGSHPA standards could help in defining the minimum flush velocity. The two case studies showed different practices, with flushing velocities being significantly higher than the minimum flushing velocity recommended by IGSHPA. Flushing flow rates based on this standard are presented in this work for some typical BHE pipe sizes used in Europe. QC 20171102 </p...|$|R

No primeiro experimento foram utilizadas 27 novilhas cruzadas (½ Nelore x ½ Simental) distribuídas em três tratamentos e nove repetições: 1, 2; 1, 6 e 2, 6 % de IMS/dia em relação ao peso vivo, respectivamente. Os animais foram submetidas à superovulação com FSH e a coleta dos embriões realizada sete dias após a inseminação artificial, através de lavagem uterina. Este procedimento foi repetido por mais duas vezes com intervalos de 45 dias. No segundo experimento foram usadas 21 vacas Nelore de três anos, distribuídas em três tratamentos: 1, 0; 1, 8 e 2, 6 % de IMS em relação ao peso vivo. Após 30 dias os animais foram sincronizados com implante {{auricular}} de norgestomet e superovulados com FSH, sendo a coleta dos embriões realizada sete dias após a inseminação artificial, através de lavagem uterina. O peso vivo final, ganho médio diário e peso de carcaça foram maiores para os animais alimentados com 2, 6 % de IMS. O nível de IMS e o período de coleta não tiveram influência sobre o número de corpos lúteos, número de estruturas totais transferíveis e degeneradas e ovócitos, tanto para novilhas como para vacas. This {{work was}} carried out to study the effect of dry matter feed intake level (DMI/% BW), weight gain, production and viability of embryos in cross-breed heifers so does production and viability of embryonic structures in Nellore cows. During the first trial, 27 cross-breed (½ Nelore x ½ Simental) heifers were used divided in 3 treatments and 9 replications: 1. 2 %; 1. 6 % and 2. 6 % of DMI/day in relation to body weight, respectively. The heifers were synchronized and after nine days these animals were superovulated using FSH. The embryos were collected seven days after the artificial insemination by uterus <b>flushing.</b> This <b>procedure</b> was repeated twice with intervals of 45 days. In the second trial, 21 Nellore cows of 3 years old were used. The cows were divided in 3 treatments: 1. 0; 1. 8 and 2. 6 % of DMI according to body weight. After 30 days, the cows were synchronized with norgestomet implant and superovulated with FSH. The embryos were collected seven days after artificial insemination by uterus flushing. The final body weight, average daily gain and carcass weight were superior for cows fed 2. 6 % of DMI. On the other hand, the DMI levels and collect period did not influence on corpus luteum number nor on total, transferable and degenerated numbers of structures and not fertilized oocites for heifers and the cows...|$|R
40|$|The Wintershall’s Maria subsea project {{consists}} of three main pipelines to be installed. The scope of this thesis is to identify and evaluate different approaches to subsea commissioning of Maria’s three pipeline systems and select a commissioning mythology for each pipeline system and identify points for optimization. The pipeline commissioning in this thesis {{is defined as the}} dynamic part of making a system ready for operation. The three pipeline systems are a gas lift, a water injection, and a production pipeline system. Gas is intended for a well-lifting purpose, injected into the well stream downhole to decrease the density of produced oil. Water is injected to maintain reservoir pressure, increase production rate and extend field operating life. The production pipeline transports hydrocarbons to the Kristin production unit for processing. The pipeline systems are presented in this order with suggested commissioning procedures. To evaluate the different commissioning procedures, chemicals used and necessary equipment is also identified. An evaluation sheet has been designed for visualization and summation of evaluated points. This was used both to evaluate commissioning procedure and to identify points of optimization. Gas lift pipeline system The main objective to the gas lift system review was to find a suitable de-watering procedure. De-watering should be as cost effective as possible while achieving the specified dryness inside the pipeline. Three options of drying technique were identified, discussed, and evaluated. It was found necessary to divide the de-watering procedure into two steps for optimization. The two steps of the de-watering procedure are pig-sweep train combined with following nitrogen drying. A calculation has been performed to optimize the volumes used in the pig-sweep train. The selected procedure will optimize the drying efficiency and maintain integrity. Water injection pipeline system The main objective related to the water injection system was to identify and evaluate a procedure to remove air trapped in the pipeline. The main criteria are time efficiency and a good result. Two options were identified, displacement by foam pigs, and direct <b>flushing.</b> Both <b>procedures</b> were found viable, but the selected method for optimization is direct flushing. The necessary flow velocity for flushing has been calculated, and pump capacity is evaluated. The calculation found that the velocity of flushing should be at least 1. 2 m/s to provide a plug flow that will flush trapped air out of the pipeline. The flow calculation shows that one of the two pumps intended for use is sufficient to achieve the plug flow criteria. For optimization, both pumps should be run together for a more effective flushing effect. Production system The main objective to the production pipeline commissioning was to identify a commissioning procedure efficient on time and still preserve the integrity of the system. The main criterion is to perform a safe start-up and cause as little influence on the Kristin process system as possible. Four methods of commissioning were identified as viable. The preferred option of commissioning is to use a 250 m³ slug of diesel between displacement pigs to displace the production line and drive out residues of water. The diesel slug and pig train are suggested to be displaced by the first production of hydrocarbons...|$|R
50|$|All Trans-Oceanic {{vessels that}} enter the Great Lakes are {{required}} to manage ballast water and ballast tank residuals with ballast water to clear out and exchange for tank <b>flushing.</b> Management and <b>procedures</b> reduce the density and richness of biota effectively in ballast waters and thus {{reduce the risk of}} transporting organisms {{from other parts of the}} world to non-native areas. Although most ships do ballast water management not all are able to clear the tanks. In an emergency when residual organisms are not able to be cleaned, vessel workers use sodium chloride brine to treat the ballast tanks. Vessels arriving in the Great Lakes, and North Sea ports, were exposed to high concentrations of sodium chloride until the mortality rate of 100% is reached. Results show that an exposure of 115% of brine is extremely effective treatment resulting in a 99.9 mortality rate of living organisms in ballast tanks regardless of the type of organism. There was a median of 0%. About 0.00-5.33 of organisms are expect to survive treatment of the sodium chloride.The Ballast Water Management Convention, adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on 13 February 2004, aims to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one region to another, by establishing standards and procedures for the management and control of ships' ballast water and sediments. This will enter into force worldwide on 8 September 2017. Under the Convention, all ships in international traffic {{are required to}} manage their ballast water and sediments to a certain standard, according to a ship-specific ballast water management plan. All ships will also have to carry a ballast water record book and an international ballast water management certificate. The ballast water management standards will be phased in over a period of time. As an intermediate solution, ships should exchange ballast water mid-ocean. However, eventually most ships will need to install an on-board ballast water treatment system.A number of guidelines have been developed to facilitate the implementation of the Convention.The Convention will require all ships to implement a Ballast Water and Sediments Management Plan. All ships will have to carry a Ballast Water Record Book and will be required to carry out ballast water management procedures to a given standard. Existing ships will be required to do the same, but after a phase-in period.|$|R
