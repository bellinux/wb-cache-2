5|$|In 1966, Whitney and Thayer {{attempted}} to organize {{what would have}} been New York's first joint operating agreement (JOA) with the Hearst-owned New York Journal American and the Scripps-owned New York World-Telegram and Sun. Under the proposed agreement, the Herald Tribune would have continued publication as the morning partner and the Journal-American and World-Telegram would merge as the World Journal, an afternoon paper. All three would publish a Sunday edition called the World Journal Tribune. The newspapers would have maintained their own editorial voices (all three of which tended to be conservative). On paper, the JOA, which would have taken effect April 25, 1966, would have led to profits of $4 million to $5 million annually, but would have also led to the loss of 1,764 out of 4,598 employees at the papers. The Newspaper Guild, concerned about the possible job losses, said the new newspaper would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> a new contract with the union; the publishers refused. The day the JOA was supposed to go into effect, the Guild struck the newly merged newspaper (the Times continued to publish).|$|E
25|$|The Nottingham Corporation Act 1902 gave powers for the Forest Road {{line and}} {{for a number of}} short lengths of tramway, principally in the Market Place, to link up {{constructed}} or authorised tramways. It also gave powers for the Corporation to operate motor omnibuses in connection with any tramway either during a period when it was impracticable to operate tramcars or as extensions. The layout in the Market Place caused much argument, and one suggestion was for a gyratory system, single line, that every car would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> when passing through the Market Place.|$|E

25|$|On {{learning}} that officer José Víctor Zavala {{had been appointed}} as Corregidor in Suchitepéquez, Carrera and his hundred jacalteco bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with jaguars to meet his former friend. Zavala not only did not capture him, he agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> with Carrera or battle on two fronts – Quetzaltenango and Jalapa. Carrera {{went back to the}} Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitepéquez as a tactical maneuver. Carrera received a visit from a cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased. When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.|$|E

This part of the road is currently of a lower standard than the sections further south. It is sandwiched between the shoreline of the loch and the mountains to the west, and it runs generally alongside the West Highland Line. The road narrows to less than [...] in places and causes significant problems for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), which <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> tight bends and the narrow carriageway width. At Pulpit rock, the road was single-track, with traffic flow controlled by traffic lights for over 30 years. The road was widened in 2015 as part of a £9 million improvement programme, including a new viaduct bringing the carriageway width to modern standards.|$|E

S3 partially disassembled the TBM, backed it out of the tunnel, and placed it in the short eastern tunnel so it could bore again. On March 28, 2011, S3, having completed its task of completing the [...] west tunnel to 65th Street, began drilling the east tunnel. The TBM drilling the east tunnel then negotiated the curve onto 63rd Street and broke through the bellmouth at the existing Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station. The portion of the west tunnel remaining to be created was then mined using conventional drill-and-blast methods, because the curve S3 construction teams would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> was too tight for the TBM.

500|$|The {{position}} where Cornwallis hid his army was well-chosen. [...] To the left, impassable swampy terrain sloped {{down toward the}} river.

[...] Both wings also included light infantry companies. [...] Cornwallis left a small company of German jägers and a few men from the Legion to give the appearance of a rear guard picket, and gave them specific orders to resist the American advance as much as possible.|$|E
500|$|More {{than two}} weeks before the 2008 NFL Draft, the Miami Dolphins, who owned the right to make the first {{selection}} in the draft determined that they wanted to negotiate with Long to be their pick and met with Tom Condon, Long's sports agent. [...] On April 22, 2008, in advance of the April 26 and 27 draft, Long agreed to a five-year, $57.75 million deal with the Miami Dolphins. The deal included $30 million in guaranteed money and made Long the first overall pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. This made him, as of that date, the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history. At Dolphins minicamp on May 2, Long was assigned number 79 and he thought he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> with Drew Mormino for the number 77 that he had worn since high school. [...] However, after he failed his physical exam, Mormino was released from the team, and before training camp Long was assigned number 77.|$|E

500|$|The Japanese convoy – {{comprising}} eight destroyers {{and eight}} troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighters – assembled and departed from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul on 28 February. During the January operation, a course was followed that hugged the south coast of New Britain. This {{had made it}} easy to provide air cover, but being close to the airfields also made it possible for the Allied Air Forces to attack both the convoy and the airfields at the same time. This time, a route was chosen along the north coast, {{in the hope that the}} Allies would be deceived into thinking that the convoy’s objective was Madang. Allied air attacks on the convoy at this point would have to fly over New Britain, allowing interdiction from Japanese air bases there, but the final leg of the voyage would be particularly dangerous, because the convoy would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> the restricted waters of the Vitiaz Strait. [...] The Japanese named the convoy [...] "Operation 81." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Mosley {{represented}} FOCA in the [...] "FISA-FOCA War", {{a conflict between}} FOCA, representing the mainly UK-based independent teams, and FISA, which {{was supported by the}} [...] "grandee" [...] constructors owned by road car manufacturers (primarily Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Renault). In 1981, FOCA announced its own World Federation of Motor Sport and ran the non-championship 1981 South African Grand Prix. The staging of this event, with worldwide television coverage, helped persuade Jean-Marie Balestre, the FISA president, that FISA would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> a settlement with FOCA. As Mosley has since commented: [...] "We were absolutely [...] If Balestre could have held the manufacturer's support for a little bit longer, the constructors would have been on their knees. The outcome would then have been very different." [...] Mosley helped draw up the Concorde Agreement, a document which resolved the dispute by essentially giving FISA control of the rules and FOCA control of commercial and television rights. The most recent version of the Concorde Agreement expired on 31 December 2007, and a new one was being discussed, as of 2008. In 1982, the year after the first Concorde Agreement was signed, Mosley left his role at FOCA, and Formula One, to work for the Conservative Party.|$|E
2500|$|More {{surprising}} was {{the unexpected}} defeat of Howard Pawley's NDP majority government in Manitoba after a disgruntled backbencher {{voted against the}} government, prompting an election in April 1988. [...] The result was a PC minority government under Gary Filmon that was tacitly supported by Gary Doer's NDP. The leader of the opposition, Liberal Sharon Carstairs, was a fervent opponent of the Accord, and was convinced some dissident PCs and NDP MLAs could be convinced to vote it down. The unstable confidence situation meant that all three leaders would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> on Manitoba's behalf.|$|E
