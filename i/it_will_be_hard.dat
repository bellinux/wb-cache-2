500|$|The episodes were {{structured}} with a five episode {{build up}} {{prior to the}} 6000th episode, a new suspect being revealed in each. UK broadcaster Channel 5 posted an official statement: [...] "With so many enemies, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to narrow down who had the motive to harm him. Who pushed P.R?". Jane Badler who plays Diana Marshall in the serial compared the storyline {{to that of the}} Who shot J.R.? storyline from American soap opera Dallas. On-screen the storyline progresses as new character Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor), tries to solve the mystery.|$|E
500|$|Litigation, {{ultimate}} {{roll call}} of damage, and {{the scope of}} final insurance recovery were all unknown , with analysts reporting that the aftermath was of unprecedented scale and complexity compared to previous disasters which themselves took many years to unfold and resolve. A July 2010 analysis by the Financial Times on the aftermath cited legal sources as saying that [...] "at some point {{the scale of the}} litigation becomes so large that it really is novel", that [...] "the situation is likely to be complicated further because the variety of probable cases means <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to aggregate them into so-called class actions" [...] and that there was [...] "no way to put this in historical context because we have never faced anything like this before". As with the Exxon Valdez disaster, litigation was being discussed in terms of a 20-year timescale.|$|E
500|$|The storyline in [...] "Future Husband" [...] {{involving}} the fictitious Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown purchasing NBC {{is based on}} the acquisition of NBC Universal by Comcast in November 2009. After winning her fourth Screen Actors Guild Award as her television character at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards in January 2010, Fey was asked whether or not 30 Rock would make reference to the Comcast acquisition to which she said that it would be dealt with. [...] "The sale of NBC to another company is integral to our show and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for Jack." [...] In April 2010, the NBC network created a website for Kabletown. When asked by a contributor from The Philadelphia Inquirer why the characters on 30 Rock refer to the network's new owner as [...] "Kabletown, with a K", co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that the reason for this was that the staff writers came up with the name [...] "Cabletown", however, they later learned that there was a real company with a similar name, so NBC's legal team department [...] "wanted to emphasize the difference, and after a while, everyone just liked the sound of it." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the real-life acquisition of NBC Universal by cable company Comcast in November 2009.

[...] "The sale of NBC to another company is integral to our show and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for Jack." [...] In the episode, Kabletown—a fictional Philadelphia company network—has taken over GE Sheinhardt NBC Universal, and Jack tries to contribute his ideas to the company. In April 2010, the NBC network created a website for the Kabletown company.

500|$|In November 2012, {{the writers}} told GameSpot that God of War will [...] "improve on films like Clash of the Titans and Immortals {{by taking a}} step in a bolder direction." [...] Melton said that Sony has [...] "encouraged" [...] them to make it {{different}} from other films in the same genre. It was confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, who are producing the Uncharted film, will be producing the movie via Atlas Entertainment. In early 2013, s Game Director, Todd Papy, {{said he did not}} know the status of the film. The writer behind the God of War video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: [...] "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words. So I think <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to get that across," [...] but she is hopeful that it can be done. As of [...] , , the movie is without a director, no actors have been confirmed, a release date has not been set, but the script has been [...] "turned in". It has a budget of $150 million USD.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do not {{suppose it}} is over yet, Rajah," [...] Harry said, through his interpreter. [...] "There are still some five times our number, and they will surely not retire without endeavouring to avenge their defeat. But I hardly think they will attack the stockade again. Possibly they will try fire, next time; and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to fight that than to keep men at bay." ...|$|R

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} premiere a {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} C+ grade for the entire setup, but the final moments received a A+. She said that the Camelot storyline [...] "is a 4,000-percent improvement over last year's Frozen plot," [...] and added that [...] "if the show goes full-on Dark Emma, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to turn away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Computer Gaming Worlds Tim Carter scored it 4 out of 5, {{praising the}} game's {{character}} and {{the complexity of the}} economic system, especially lauding the focus on economics over combat; [...] "winning or losing is rooted in economics, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to compensate for economic weakness with superior military tactics." [...] He concluded by calling the game [...] "a fun and engrossing experience that challenges your brain without getting on your nerves." ...|$|E
2500|$|An 1890 [...] {{profile of}} the Princeton {{football}} team described Warren as follows:"Ralph Herbert Warren, always called 'Pop' in college, completes the quartette of the old team. [...] He is looked upon {{as one of the}} best end rushers now playing. A sure tackler and always well down the field on a punt, he is an invaluable man. [...] He, too, however, has a disabled knee, and if he does not recover in time for the Yale game, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to fill his place. [...] When he began playing last year he was only a Freshman." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{also depends}} on the relative strengths of the team's batting and bowling. For instance in Test Cricket, a side with only fast bowlers may choose to bowl first {{to try to take}} advantage of any early moisture in the pitch, knowing that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to take wickets later in the match. Similarly a side with a weak opening batting pair may choose to bowl first in order to protect their batsmen.|$|R

[...] "This production {{was one of the}} best experiences of my professional life, The play was four and a half hours long, and I have never known that kind of response from an audience ... It was the serendipity of a beautifully cast play, with great design and direction, <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to be in anything better." [...] (In the Frame, September 2007). She played the title role in Jean Racine's Phèdre at the National in 2009, in a production directed by Nicholas Hytner.

2500|$|The {{day after}} Trump won the election, Fox wrote an {{editorial}} on the International Business Times website where he lamented Trump's victory and explored what Mexico {{could do in}} response.

Now, we ought to look out for ourselves {{and find a way to}} work with the most powerful economy in the world, which is now led by an authoritarian racistDonald Trump's promises have an expiration date. When the time comes to truly deliver to the American people, his [...] "billion dollar show" [...] will finally crumble beneath his feet," [...] Fox wrote, concluding his editorial with, [...] "I find quite sad that America, formerly the most open and cutting edge nation, has chosen to lock itself down inside concrete walls. It's tragic that fear, anger and wrath took over and pierced the hearts of their people. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to recover from this wound; but we better start working to heal as quickly as possible – and bring down the walls that blinded us in the beginning." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{campaign}} was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry. In {{the words of}} Erwan Le Corre: [...] "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or {{the benefits of a}} few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore." [...] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, [...] "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'" [...] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.|$|E
