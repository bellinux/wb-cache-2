5|$|In {{contemporary}} times, {{the shrine}} {{has become a}} controversial symbol for Japanese nationalists. While many citizens of various political persuasions visit the site to honor relatives killed in battle, whose kami (spirit) {{are said to be}} enshrined there, so too are the kami of several class-A war criminals. These criminals were enshrined in a secret ceremony in 1978, which <b>has</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> ire of Japanese pacifists and the international community.|$|E
5|$|GOI and GOLP {{continue}} to sell Gulf-branded lubricants worldwide through {{a network of}} official licensed companies, joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiary companies.

Of these wholly owned subsidiaries Gulf Oil Corporation India <b>has</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> market profile of the Gulf brand in the Middle East. GOCL have emerged as one of leading lubricants brands in India and run many marketing sponsorships targeted at the ever-growing youth sector in the country.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Żydokomuna {{continued}} to endure {{to a certain}} extent in postwar Poland (1944–1956), because Polish anti-communists saw the Soviet-controlled Communist regime as the fruition of prewar anti-Polish agitation; with it came the implication of Jewish responsibility. The Soviet appointments of Jews to positions responsible for oppressing the populace further fueled this perception. Some 37.1% of post-war management of UB employees and members of the communist authorities in Poland were of Jewish origin. They were described in intelligence reports as very loyal to the Soviets (Szwagrzyk). Some Polish historians have impugned the loyalty of Jews returning to Poland from the USSR after the Soviet takeover, which <b>has</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> specter of Żydokomuna in the minds of other scholars.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} reasons why the {{government}} may wish to increase the school leaving age, considering it <b>has</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> age numerous times over the 19th and 20th centuries, the last time being in 2015. With past age raisings, the reasons given have been focused mainly on generating more skilled labour by providing additional time for students to gain additional skills and qualifications. In recent years, {{it became apparent that}} most 16 to 18 year-olds have not been motivated to continue their education after completion of their GCSEs, thus increasing the overall unemployment rate given many are unable to find work. The British government hoped that by making education compulsory up to the age of 17 by 2013 and 18 by 2015, it could change this.|$|E
5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at Lučko {{mainline}} toll plaza can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In 2009, {{in an effort}} to address the problem, the Lučko mainline toll plaza was expanded to 15lanes, and a single additional 10-lane toll plaza was built for fast cashless toll collection in Demerje. The Demerje toll plaza is available via a motorway fork accessible to the A1 northbound traffic only. Vehicles using the Demerje toll plaza default to the original motorway route immediately past the Lučko mainline toll plaza, between the plaza and the Lučko interchange. The faster cashless system <b>has</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> nominal capacity of the road from 2,325 to 11,150 vehicles per hour. As of September 2010 northbound traffic leaving the A1 must exit the tolled motorway network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another tolled motorway. There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to be integrated into the tolled motorway network, as the ultimate solution for congestion at the Lučko toll plaza. That will require construction of a Horvati interchange south of the Lučko toll plaza.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} Ecuadorian Andes {{are divided}} into three parallel cordilleras which run in what is similar to an S-shape from north to south: the western, central (Cordillerra Real) and eastern (Cordillera Occidental) cordilleras.

25|$|Until recently, {{the people}} of Kiribati mostly lived in villages with populations between 50 and 3,000 on the outer islands. Most houses are made of {{materials}} obtained from coconut and pandanus trees. Frequent droughts and infertile soil hinder reliable large-scale agriculture, so the islanders have largely turned to the sea for livelihood and subsistence. Most are outrigger sailors and fishermen. Copra plantations serve as a second source of employment. In recent years large numbers of citizens have moved to the more urban island capital of Tarawa. Increasing urbanisation <b>has</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> population of South Tarawa to 50,182.|$|E

He was also a pioneer of surgical techniques such as scleral buckling for the repair of retinal detachments.

Australian rules football has historically not been strong in New South Wales outside the Riverina region. However, the Sydney Swans relocated from South Melbourne in 1982 and their presence and success since the late 1990s <b>has</b> <b>raised</b> <b>the</b> profile of Australian rules football, especially after their AFL premiership in 2005.
