40|$|Abstract. At long standoff, a shaped charge {{with small}} cone angle {{will produce a}} jet with a high tip {{velocity}} and a low tail velocity, causing it to stretch and break up, so its penetration ability into multilayer metal targets is very weak, while the penetration depth of <b>explosively</b> <b>formed</b> <b>projectiles</b> is too low to penetrate into multilayer metal targets. On account of this, the large cone angle shaped charge, whose internal cone angle is about 100 degree, is proposed and designed in the paper. The sensitivity of penetration effect into targets to the cone angle of the liner is investigated by experiment. The results reveal that the shaped charge penetration into multilayer metal targets with large interval is more optimistic {{than that of the}} shaped charge with small cone angle and <b>explosively</b> <b>formed</b> <b>projectiles.</b> In numerical simulation, based on interface tracking algorithm known as markers on cell line to reconstruct material interfaces, jet penetration into metal targets is simulated in a two-dimensional multi-material Eulerian code. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental ones and also indicate the interface tracking algorithm has much better resolution for moving interfaces, especially effective for large deformation. 1...|$|R

El objeto de este estudio es reproducir y entender {{el comportamiento}} de dichos artefactos explosivos improvisados capaces de generar proyectiles de alta velocidad y gran capacidad de penetración. La comprensión de su comportamiento permitirá mejorar el conocimiento sobre ellos, y por ende, combatirlos de forma más eficaz. Para ello se han realizado los ensayos correspondientes, obteniéndose las primeras caracterizaciones de proyectiles formados por explosión construidos de manera artesanal, tal y como haría un terrorista. Además, se han creado los modelos numéricos correspondientes a cada ensayo, que simulan todo el evento desde su inicio hasta el impacto en el objetivo, recorriendo todos los pasos intermedios. Se han ensayado 3 configuraciones y posteriormente se han simulado, usando el {{software}} de análisis por elementos finitos, LS-DYNA®, con una configuración 2 D axisimétrica, con mallados lagrangianos. Los resultados obtenidos por el modelo han alcanzado un alto grado de precisión con relación a los datos experimentales. A partir de aquí se puede concluir que los artefactos explosivos improvisados-proyectiles formados por explosión son una seria amenaza, y que los modelos generados permitirán conocer y ahorrar costes en la lucha contra esta amenaza, y por ende contra el terrorismo, al disponer de un enfoque holístico de la amenaza, y finalmente reducir los costes de la experimentación. AbstractWithin {{the category of}} improvised explosive devices are those that <b>form</b> <b>explosively</b> <b>formed</b> <b>projectiles</b> which penetrate armor and armored systems, such as those used by insurgents against allied forces in operational areas. The {{purpose of this study}} is to reproduce and understand the behavior of these improvised explosive devices capable of generating high-velocity, high penetration projectiles. Understanding their behavior will allow for improved knowledge about them, and thus will allow us to more effectively combat them. Thus, the corresponding tests were carried out and the results were obtained from the first characterizations of <b>explosively</b> <b>formed</b> <b>projectiles</b> built using traditional methods, just as a terrorist would have built them. Along with this, numerical models were created for each test simulating the entire event from beginning to impact on the target, including all the intermediate steps. There were three configurations tested and simulated using the software of finite element analysis, LS-DYNA®, a 2 -D asymmetric configuration with Lagrangian meshes. The results obtained by the model were compared with data obtained in the experimental tests, yielding a high precision between simulated and tested data. With the data obtained in this study it can be concluded that the improvised explosive devices -explosively <b>formed</b> <b>projectiles</b> is a serious threat. Generated models will allow us to know more about these weapons, to reduce costs in the fight against the threat of improvised explosive devices-explosively <b>formed</b> <b>projectiles</b> and therefore against terrorism with <b>explosively</b> <b>formed</b> <b>projectiles,</b> and to have a holistic approach to the threat and to reduce the cost of experimentation.

50|$|The explosively formed {{penetrator}} (EFP) is {{also known}} as the self-forging fragment (SFF), <b>explosively</b> <b>formed</b> <b>projectile</b> (EFP), self-forging projectile (SEFOP), plate charge, and Misznay-Schardin (MS) charge. An EFP uses the action of the explosive's detonation wave (and to a lesser extent the propulsive effect of its detonation products) to project and deform a plate or dish of ductile metal (such as copper, iron, or tantalum) into a compact high-velocity projectile, commonly called the slug. This slug is projected toward the target at about two kilometers per second. The chief advantage of the EFP over a conventional (e.g., conical) shaped charge is its effectiveness at very great standoffs, equal to hundreds of times the charge's diameter (perhaps a hundred meters for a practical device).|$|E

Without this stabilization the trajectory can not be accurately determined beyond 50 meters. An EFP is essentially a cylindrical shaped charge with a machined concave metal disc (often copper) in front, pointed inward.

The EO seeker cannot operate at night, so the SAL would have to be used. A third targeting mode is inertial, meaning the user can [...] "snap and shoot" [...] at a target without needing to lock on out to 200 meters.

The main objective of an <b>explosively</b> <b>formed</b> <b>projectile</b> designed for underwater applications is to disintegrate the target at longer standoff distances. In this paper we have simulated the <b>explosively</b> <b>formed</b> <b>projectile</b> from OFHC-Copper liner for 1200 conical angle. The Affect of water on the penetration of EFP is determined by simulations from Ansysis Autodyn 2 -D Hydrocode and by varying depth of water from 1 CD- 5 CD. The depth of penetration against steel target is measured experimentally. Flash X-Ray Radiography (FXR) is used to capture EFP jet formation and its penetration against target is measured by depth of penetration experiments. Simulation results are compared with experimental results. The difference in simulated and experimental results for depth of penetration is about 7 mm, which lies within favorable range of error. The jet formation captured from FXR is quite clear and jet velocity determined from Flash X-ray radiography {{is the same as the}} ones obtained by using other high explosives.

40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} a soft-recovery system is {{critical}} to a researcher's ability to analyze hypervelocity projectiles. The researcher may decide to use one method over another based on several criteria, including whether or not non-deformed projectile measurements are required. This report analyzes the forces two different soft-recovery methods impart on the projectiles collected. Method 1 utilized three polyethylene water barrels placed “end-to-end” horizontally, providing 2. 6 meters (9 feet) of water to stop the projectile. Method 2 is a modification of the soft-recovery method utilized in “Soft-Recovery of <b>Explosively</b> <b>Formed</b> Penetrators” by Lambert and Pope [1]. This method utilizes a series of several materials with an increasing density gradient, placed end-to-end over 14. 3 meters (47 feet) to stop the projectile. Despite the fact that <b>explosively</b> <b>formed</b> <b>projectiles</b> (EFPs) of the same design were fired into each recovery method, the projectiles collected using the two methods differed in shape, size, weight, {{and the number of}} pieces collected. Since the EFP designs were identical to begin with, the physical differences are most likely due to the different magnitudes of the forces exerted on the projectile during deceleration. Drag force calculations will be performed for both recovery methods in an attempt to determine the differences in the drag forces exerted on the projectile during its deceleration. The results of the calculations will assist in determining to what extent the physical deformation of the projectile is due to the material selection of each recovery method. The consistency of the shapes and weights of the recovered projectiles will also be briefly addressed to assist the researcher in choosing the most useful recovery method for a given objective...|$|R

40|$|A {{conventional}} shaped charge comprises a conical {{metal liner}} projecting a hyper velocity jet of metal that {{is able to}} penetrate to great depths into steel armour. However, misalignment problems exist in tandem with jet break up and spewing particles that greatly diminish its penetration power. An EFP, on the other hand, has a liner {{in the shape of}} a geometrical recess. The force of the blast molds the liner into a number of configurations, depending on the geometry and the explosive detonation characteristics. This paper presents comparative parametric numerical simulations of materials used as liners in the <b>explosively</b> <b>formed</b> <b>projectiles</b> EFPs. Numerical simulations are carried out using AUTODYN 2 D hydrocode to study effects of liner’s materials on the shape, velocity, traveled distance, time, pressure, internal energy, temperature, yield stress, divergence or stability, density, compression, and length to diameter (L/D) ratio of EFPs. These parameters are estimated at the instants of maximum as well as at stable velocities. The parametric study reveals that aluminum has maximum velocity in shortest time among the liner materials. From this reason, it was concluded effective standoff was greater for aluminum than more denser metals. Maximum velocity and traveled distance of Tantalum EFP is found to be minimum which may be due to low thermal softening exponent and larger hardening exponent. The simulated yield stress and pressure developed in the Fe EFP reaches at maximum. The L/D ratio for Copper is found to be maximum which supports maximum penetration. From the stability point of view, 1006 MS is found to be the most reliable liner material due to minimum divergence. Generally all liner materials hav...|$|R
