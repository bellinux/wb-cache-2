5|$|A broad {{outline of}} the Norte Chico diet has been suggested. At Caral, the edible domesticated plants noted by Shady are squash, beans, lúcuma, <b>guava,</b> pacay (Inga feuillei), and sweet potato. Haas et al. noted the same foods in their survey further north, while adding avocado and achira. In 2013, good {{evidence}} for maize was also documented by Haas et al. (see below).|$|E
5|$|Oral {{transmission}} {{is an unusual}} route of infection, but has been described. In 1991, farm workers {{in the state of}} Paraíba, Brazil, were infected by eating contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated açaí palm fruit juice and garapa. A 2007 outbreak in 103 Venezuelan school children was attributed to contaminated <b>guava</b> juice.|$|E
5|$|Gauguin {{first visited}} Tahiti in 1891, and {{attracted}} by the beauty of Tahitian women undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a <b>guava</b> wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived.|$|E
50|$|B. No equilibrium: Suppose Alice holds {{apples and}} <b>guavas</b> but wants only apples. George holds only <b>guavas</b> but wants both apples and <b>guavas.</b> The set {Alice} is self-sufficient, because Alice thinks that all goods held by George are {{worthless}}. Moreover, the set {Alice} is super-self-sufficient, because Alice holds <b>guavas</b> which are worthless to her. Indeed, a competitive equilibrium does not exist: {{regardless of the}} price, Alice {{would like to give}} all her <b>guavas</b> for apples, but George has no apples so her demand will remain unfulfilled.|$|R
50|$|Females {{penetrate}} <b>guavas</b> and {{lay their}} eggs inside the plant. In its larval form it tunnels through the <b>guavas,</b> damaging them.|$|R
50|$|When {{cultivated}} from seed, <b>guavas</b> are {{notable for}} an extremely slow growth rate for several months, before a very rapid acceleration in growth rate takes over. From seed, common <b>guavas</b> may bloom and set fruit in {{as few as}} two years or as many as eight. Cuttings and grafting are more commonly used as a propagation method in commercial groves. Highly adaptable, <b>guavas</b> can be easily grown as container plants in temperate regions, though their ability to bloom and set fruit is somewhat less predictable. In some tropical locations, <b>guavas</b> can become invasive. It {{has become a major}} problem in the Galápagos Islands.|$|R
5|$|The same {{isolation}} {{that produced}} Kohala's unique ecosystem {{also makes it}} very vulnerable to invasive species. Alien plants and feral animals are among the greatest threats to the local ecology. Plants like the kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) and the strawberry <b>guava</b> (Psidium cattleinum) displace native species. Prior to human settlement, many major organisms such as conifers and rodents never made it onto the island, so the ecosystem never developed defenses against them, leaving Hawaii vulnerable to damage by hoofed animals, rodents, and predation.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern area}} of Birbhum {{is a part}} of the rice plains of West Bengal, and the {{vegetation}} includes usual characteristics of rice fields in Bengal, such as species of Aponogeton, Utricularia, Drosera, Philcoxia, Scrophulariaceae and similar aquatic or palustrine genera. In the drier western region of the district, the characteristic shrubs and herbs include species of Wendlandia, Convolvulaceae, Stipa, Tragus, Spermacoce, Ziziphus, Capparis and similar plants that grows on laterite soil. Mango, palm, and bamboo are among common trees in Birbhum. Other common species of plants are jackfruit, arjun, sal, <b>guava,</b> kend and mahua.|$|E
5|$|Invasive {{plants such}} as Crofton weed and Formosa lily occur in {{inaccessible}} areas and probably cannot be eradicated but others are currently being managed. In 1995 the first action was taken to control the spread of introduced plants of the island, chiefly ground asparagus and bridal creeper, but also cherry <b>guava,</b> Madeira vine, Cotoneaster, Ochna and Cestrum. This has been followed by weeding tours {{and the formation of}} the Friends of Lord Howe Island group in 2000. Programs have also been started to remove weeds from private properties and revegetate some formerly cultivated areas. An Environmental Unit was created by the Board and it includes a Flora Management Officer and a permanent Weed Officer. Weeds have been mapped and an eradication program is in place, supported by improved education and quarantine procedures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guavas</b> also grow in a {{small part}} of the south of western Europe, {{specifically}} the Costa del Sol on Málaga, (Spain) where the <b>guavas</b> are commercially grown since the middle of the 20th century and they proliferate as cultivars.|$|R
50|$|<b>Guavas</b> are of {{interest}} to home growers in subtropical areas {{as one of the}} few tropical fruits that can grow to fruiting size in pots indoors. When grown from seed, <b>guavas</b> bear fruit as soon as two years and as long as 40 years.|$|R

25|$|Ybor City {{came into}} {{existence}} {{as a direct result}} of a New York City businessman's failed search for <b>guava</b> trees. Spanish émigré Gavino Gutierrez was a civil engineer by training, but was employed by a New York City fruit packing and canning firm in the mid-1880s.
