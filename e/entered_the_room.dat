5|$|On {{the night}} of September 18, 1964, Kinne left the hotel without Pugliese, either to acquire money because the couple was running low or to get {{medicine}} she required.

5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Her mother had then sent her to bed.
