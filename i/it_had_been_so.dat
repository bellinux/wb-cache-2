5|$|Sometime I {{have thought}} that {{impossible}} <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> <b>so</b> to have removed my affection {{from the realm of}} Scotland, that any realm or nation could have been equal dear to me. But God I take to record in my conscience, that the troubles present (and appearing to be) in the realm of England are double more dolorous unto my heart than ever were the troubles of Scotland.|$|E
25|$|The delays {{became so}} great that even ABC mocked the {{lateness}} with an ad campaign showing network executives waiting impatiently {{for the arrival of}} new episodes at ABC's corporate headquarters. One episode featured television critic Jeff Jarvis in an introduction, sarcastically reminding viewers {{what was going on with}} the show's plot since <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> long since the last new episode.|$|E
2500|$|... 1970 - The Isle of Wight Festival {{takes place}} at Afton Down {{attracting}} huge crowds, estimates varying from five to six hundred thousand, who witness {{what would be the}} last UK performance by Jimi Hendrix - he is to die less than three weeks later. Despite the great numbers of people the atmosphere is relaxed and with only 500 officers to police the event the Chief Constable, Sir Douglas Osmond, dons casual clothes and sits with the crowds. He reports to the subsequent public enquiry that the press seem unhappy that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> peaceful.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No;--I don't know. But I think <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so.</b> I do {{know that}} John Crumb had {{threatened}} to do this thing, and I felt sure {{that sooner or later}} he would be as good as his word. If <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so,</b> who <b>is</b> to blame him?' ...|$|R

2500|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} name {{in reference to the}} fire there appears in a 1905 work by Jivanji Jamshedji Modi, who made several allusions to the [...] "Iranshah Fire" [...] within the space of two pages. In 1920, when Shahpurshah Hodivala published his English language translation of the Qissa-i Sanjan, he assumed that this was the original name of the fire. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> called because it was consecrated to be the earthly representative of Yazdegerd III, the last Zoroastrian king of Iran, this explanation is accepted by almost all devout Parsis, and even the few skeptics among them tend to refer to the fire as the Iranshah.|$|E
2500|$|Stroheim {{was fired}} from the film, and the African storyline was scrapped. Swanson and Kennedy still wanted to salvage the European material, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> costly and time-consuming, and had {{potential}} market value. An alternate ending was shot on November 24, 1931. In this ending, directed by Swanson and photographed by Gregg Toland, Prince Wolfram is shown visiting the palace. A nun leads him to the chapel, where Kelly's body lies in state. This {{has been called the}} [...] "Swanson ending". The film was not theatrically released in the United States, but it was shown in Europe and South America with the Swanson ending tacked on. This was due to a clause in Stroheim's contract.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012, McFly played four {{shows in}} America. Two at L.A.'s famed Roxy and two at New York's legendary Gramercy Theatre. All four shows {{sold out in}} less than a minute and fans lined up hours before the shows. On the American shows, they premiered another brand new song {{entitled}} [...] "Love Is Easy". In 2012, it was announced an autobiography entitled Unsaid Things: Our Story would be due for release on Amazon Stores in October 2012 and to coincide with the autobiography, the band also announced that they would be releasing another Greatest Hits album. Fletcher announced on Twitter that their next single would be [...] "Red" [...] as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> well received on the tour but this was later changed to [...] "Love Is Easy", which was released on 11 November 2012, a week before the new Greatest Hits compilation.|$|E

60|$|THE YOUNGER MISS WETHERELL [they {{have begun}} to cry]. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> wrong and foolish of us. We have never learnt to do {{anything}} for ourselves.|$|R
6000|$|Grace laughed. [...] "About a racehorse? Gerald {{is always}} hopeful, but his {{confidence}} {{in his ability to}} spot the winner <b>is</b> dangerous. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> often misplaced." ...|$|R
2500|$|S 44(i) {{has rarely}} been invoked before. In Sykes v Cleary (1992), after finding that a {{candidate}} who had been declared elected in a by-election was ineligible under Section 44(iv) of the Constitution, the High Court ruled that both of the candidates who were likely to have elected by a countback were ineligible under s 44(i). When they had become Australian citizens, they had renounced all foreign nationality (as Australian law then required), but they had not attempted to renounce under the law of their home countries and therefore were still subjects of a foreign power. They should have taken at least [...] "reasonable steps" [...] to do that, before nominating. What would be [...] "reasonable steps" [...] for any future candidate {{would depend on the}} individual circumstances. In 1999, in Sue v Hill, the High Court found that a British citizen who had been declared elected to the Senate in 1998 was disqualified under s 44(i). [...] Although the UK had not been a [...] "foreign power" [...] in 1901, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> at least since the Australia Act 1986.|$|E
60|$|He laughed rather consciously; {{and though}} denying the sentiment, Emma was {{convinced}} that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
60|$|The flame {{disclosed}} to Jane Clayton's horrified gaze {{that the baby}} was quite dead. How long <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> she could not guess.|$|E
50|$|The parish {{church of}} the village of Saint-Wandrille-Rançon also dates from the saint's time, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> altered and {{restored}} that little of the original structure remains.|$|R
50|$|The {{school is}} still trying to improve the iGryphon plan, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> far a success; {{although}} it took much longer to fully implement than originally intended.|$|R

60|$|Poor Sam looked forlorn, indeed, when {{he entered}} the apartment. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> long since his friend's last visit that he fancied they were deserting him.|$|E
60|$|Jeff {{dropped it}} instantly. Miss Mayfield {{put it in}} the pocket of her sacque for security. Besides, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> bekissed that it seemed unpleasantly conscious.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is God?" [...] I saw {{the tide}} had turned, and strenuously {{tried to keep}} this rudderless {{lifeboat}} from slipping back into the whirlpool wherein <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> nearly lost.|$|E
60|$|DEAR MAJOR,--And <b>has</b> <b>it</b> come to {{this that}} the dead rise up and speak? For I {{supposed}} that you <b>were</b> dead, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> long since I heard your name.|$|R

6000|$|... "Certainly <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> in our family," [...] said Colin, rather hoarsely, as {{he thought}} of the four goodly {{brothers}} who had once risen in steps between him and the Master.|$|R
60|$|It tormented him {{a little}} because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> easy to care nothing for the world's adulation, {{and it was so}} hard to care as little for its censure. He felt very bitter.|$|E
60|$|Thus, by the {{intervention}} of good angels, the little paper-nautilus bark of Lillie's fortunes was prevented from going down in the great ugly maelstrom, {{on the verge of}} which <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> heedlessly sailing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} think that," [...] Mr. Thurwell said thoughtfully. [...] "They {{would not}} have kept altogether {{in the background and}} let Scotland Yard take the lead, if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so.</b> What is it, Roberts?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> {{sorry you}} <b>are</b> going. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> jolly, {{coming in here}} of a Sunday, Lady Elizabeth, and you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> good to me. I wish Scarrowby {{was at the bottom}} of the sea." ...|$|R

60|$|There was {{an acute}} pain in Albert's breast somewhere; {{he had not}} {{analyzed}} his case at all, and did not now, {{but the idea of}} going affected him strongly. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> pleasant, that daily return to a lovely girlish presence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would to God <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so,</b> my dear Lucy!"

60|$|Although the Red Eric {{was thrown}} on her beam-ends, or nearly so, by the {{excessive}} {{violence of the}} squall, the preparations to meet <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> well made that she righted again almost immediately, and now flew before the wind under bare poles with a velocity that was absolutely terrific.|$|E
