40|$|This report covers tasks 8. 1, 8. 1. 1, and 8. 2. The primary {{objective}} of Task 8. 1, Particulates Flow Deposition, is {{to characterize the}} particulate generated in an operating gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) power plant whose configuration approximates that proposed for an ATS power plant. In addition, the task is {{to evaluate the use}} of <b>full-flow</b> <b>filtering</b> to reduce the steam particulate loads. Before the start of this task, GE had already negotiated an agreement with the candidate power plant, piping and a filter unit had already been installed at the power plant site, and major elements of the data acquisition system had been purchased. The objective of Task 8. 1. 1, Coolant Purity, is to expose typical ATS gas turbine airfoil cooling channel geometries to real steam flow to determine whether there are any unexpected deposit formations. The task is a static analog of the centrifugal deposition rig trials of Task 8. 2, in which a bucket channel return bend is exposed to steam flow. Two cooling channel geometries are of primary interest in this static exposure. The {{primary objective}} of Task 8. 2, Particle Centrifugal Sedimentation, is to determine the settling characteristics of particles in a cooling stream from an operating gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) power plant when that stream is ducted through a passage experiencing the G-loads expected in a simulated bucket channel specimen representative of designs proposed for an ATS gas turbine...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringSunanda DissanayakeConstruction of by-pass lanes at rural intersections {{typically}} {{has been}} considered a low-cost safety improvement. Safety analysis utilizes two common approaches to evaluate treatment effectiveness: before-and-after study and cross-sectional study. This research performed paired sample t-test statistical analysis to estimate changes in total of crash frequency, crash rates, EPDO crash frequency, and EPDO crash rates at intersections, {{three to five years}} after adding a by-pass lane compared to identical time period before the by-pass lane was added. Crash data between 1990 and 2011 were obtained from Kansas Crash and Analysis Record System (KCARS) maintained by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT). In order to perform a cross-sectional study, intersections <b>with</b> <b>by-pass</b> lanes were compared to intersections with no countermeasures; crash data were obtained for more than 1, 100 intersections in the state of Kansas. According to before-and-after study, addition of by-pass lanes improves safety at unsignalized rural intersections; crashes and their severities are reduced after adding by-pass lanes. But, these reductions are not statistically significant under 95 % confidence level. However, when considering intersection related crashes, a statistically significant reduction in crash rates is happened after adding by-pass lanes at 3 -legged intersections. In cross-sectional study, crashes and their severities are lower at 3 -legged intersections <b>with</b> the <b>by-pass</b> lanes versus 3 -legged intersections without the by-pass lanes. However, these reductions are not statistically significant under 95 % confidence level. When considering 300 feet intersection crash box, statistically significant reductions are happened at 4 -legged intersection. In contrast, crashes and their severities increased at 4 -legged intersections <b>with</b> the <b>by-pass</b> lanes, but these changes are not statistically significant under 95 % confidence level. The Crash Modification Factors were calculated to evaluate safety effectiveness of adding by-pass lanes at unsignalized rural intersections. The calculated CMFs less than 1. 0, indicate a reduction in crashes after implementation of by-pass lanes. Finally, this study concluded that expected crashes at intersections <b>with</b> <b>by-pass</b> lanes are lower than intersections without by-pass lanes...|$|R
