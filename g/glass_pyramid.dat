5|$|After architects Mario Bellini and Rudy Ricciotti had won an {{international}} competition to create its new galleries for Islamic art, the new 3,000 sq m pavilion eventually opened in 2012, consisting of ground- and lower-ground-level interior spaces {{topped by a}} golden, undulating roof (fashioned from almost 9,000 steel tubes that form an interior web) that seems to float within the neo-Classical Visconti Courtyard {{in the middle of}} the Louvre's south wing. The galleries, which the museum had initially hoped to open by 2009, represent the first major architectural intervention at the Louvre since the addition of I.M. Pei's <b>glass</b> <b>pyramid</b> in 1989.|$|E
5|$|By 1874, the Louvre Palace had {{achieved}} {{its present form}} of an almost rectangular structure with the Sully Wing to the east containing the Cour Carrée (Square Court) and the oldest parts of the Louvre; and two wings which wrap the Cour Napoléon, the Richelieu Wing {{to the north and}} the Denon Wing, which borders the Seine to the south. In 1983, French President François Mitterrand proposed, as one of his Grands Projets, the Grand Louvre plan to renovate the building and relocate the Finance Ministry, allowing displays throughout the building. Architect I. M. Pei was awarded the project and proposed a <b>glass</b> <b>pyramid</b> to stand over a new entrance in the main court, the Cour Napoléon. The pyramid and its underground lobby were inaugurated on 15 October 1988; the pyramid was completed in 1989. The second phase of the Grand Louvre plan, La Pyramide Inversée (The Inverted Pyramid), was completed in 1993. As of 2002, attendance had doubled since completion.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{became the}} first female pop singer to perform at the I. M. Pei <b>glass</b> <b>pyramid</b> at the Louvre Museum, raising {{contributions}} {{for the restoration of}} iconic artwork. Jackson was selected to endorse fashion line Blackglama for a second year, being the first celebrity in the line's history chosen to do so. She partnered with the label to release a fifteen-piece collection of luxury products. In 2012, Jackson endorsed Nutrisystem, sponsoring their weight-loss program after struggling with weight fluctuations in the past. With the program, she donated ten million dollars in meals to the hungry. She was honored by amfAR for her contributions to AIDS research when chairing the Cinema Against AIDS gala during the Cannes Film Festival. She also participated in a public service announcement for UNICEF to help starving children. In February 2013, Jackson announced she was married to her third husband, Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana, during a private ceremony the previous year.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, the Urban Land Institute {{recommended}} redeveloping L'Enfant Promenade {{to create}} a more tourist-friendly environment as well as creating a link with the southwest waterfront. Although this concept garnered little attention at the time, it proved to be the genesis of a major plan that emerged around 2010 to radically change the nature and look of L'Enfant Plaza.

500|$|Pei's first {{proposed}} design included a large <b>glass</b> <b>pyramid</b> that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant {{to represent the}} optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the US. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. [...] "I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door {{at the end of the}} day," [...] she said. [...] "His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I.M. to see that so many people didn't want the building." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{commission}} was tardy in giving the final {{order for the}} statue to Bartlett, so late {{that it was impossible}} to have the final bronze piece ready in time; a one-third model was only completed in May. [...] According to Q.David Bowers, [...] "the French are at home in such problems." [...] The {{commission was}} able to have a full-sized plaster model ready by July 4 by sawing the scale model in pieces [...] and distributing them to various workshops, that made enlargements in plaster. Brought together, the plaster pieces fitted perfectly. [...] This assembly was ceremoniously dedicated in the Place du Carrousel on July 4, 1900. [...] Afterwards, Bartlett was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the design, and changed them. [...] His bronze statue erected there in 1908 differs considerably from the statue depicted on the coin. [...] Changes made included the elimination of Lafayette's three-cornered hat, and the position of the raised arm and sword. The statue stood there for almost eighty years, but was displaced in the 1980s during the excavations for I.M. Pei's <b>glass</b> <b>pyramid</b> at the Louvre.

2500|$|President François Mitterrand had {{fourteen}} years in power, {{enough time to}} complete more projects than any president since Napoleon III. His Grands Travaux included the Arab World Institute, a new site for the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BNF); a new opera house, the Opéra Bastille, opened in 1989 to celebrate the bicentennial of the French Revolution; a new Ministry of Finance in Bercy (the old Ministry had been housed in a wing of the Louvre), also opened in 1989. The Grande Arche in La Défense was also finished in 1989, a massive hollow cube-shaped building 112 metres high that completed the long perspective from the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel through the Place de la Concorde and the Champs Élysées. The most famous project of all, the [...] "Grand Louvre", included the expulsion of the Ministry of Finance, the reconstruction of {{large parts of the}} museum, an underground gallery, and the addition of a <b>glass</b> <b>pyramid</b> by I.M.

2500|$|JBG also {{announced}} in late 2011 that it planned a radical redevelopment of L'Enfant Plaza. First, {{the company said}} it had hired SmithGroup JJR to design a three-story glass atrium to replace the low <b>glass</b> <b>pyramid</b> {{in the center of the}} plaza. The atrium would have an elevator and stairs to permit pedestrian access from the plaza. Second, a 234-room Homewood Suites by Hilton would be constructed on the outdoor eating plaza at the corner of 9th Street SW and D Street SW. Also designed by SmithGroup, the proposed design hotel featured ground-level retail and access to the Metro as well as glass curtain walls to alleviate the blocky look of the existing nearby structures. Ground-breaking on the hotel was expected in mid-2012. Third, the company proposed a [...] office building for the small space bordered by 9th Street SW, Frontage Road SW, the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, and the HUD building. Designed by ZGF Architects LLP, the proposed office building featured a flat façade with windows set in deep, angled, grid-like frames similar to the existing L'Enfant Plaza buildings. A fourth proposed element was a new U-shaped, [...] office building to surround the new atrium. This design replaced the curving, cone-like structure previously proposed in 2010. Designed by Richard Rogers, the Modernist glass building would front on 10th Street SW. JBG said it hoped to include the Heyman Properties' South Building in its plans, but Heyman continued to press its 2010 lawsuit against JBG. Bringing the suit one step closer to resolution, a local court ordered both sides into mediation in February 2012.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, the NCPC {{convened a}} [...] "10th Street Task Force" [...] that would more radically {{redesign}} L'Enfant Promenade. The task force (which {{was charged with}} looking at L'Enfant Plaza, Banneker Park, the Maryland Avenue SW corridor, and nearby federal office buildings as a whole) proposed creating an [...] "eco-district" [...] which would be energy neutral, accommodate multimodal transportation, add residential housing, and create street-level retail aimed at tourists and residents equally. The goal was to produce a formal redevelopment plan by early 2011. The same year, the commission looking into the feasibility of establishing a National Museum of the American Latino tentatively considered Banneker Park {{as the site of}} a potential museum, but the site did not make the commission's short list of preferred locations. In November 2009, JBG [...] began renovating the eastern portion of La Promenade, and planned to renovate the western section in 2010 and 2011. The $40 million effort, designed by the SmithGroup architectural firm, added large windows overlooking the grassy terrace of the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building to the east and moves most of the fast-food operations into the eastern portion of the mall. The retail shopping area will be expanded to [...] The plaza <b>glass</b> <b>pyramid</b> will be removed, and a greatly expanded atrium and pedestrian entry way installed over the center portion of the mall. The plan is to situate restaurants under this enlarged glass atrium, to provide diners with a more pleasant experience. JBG also said it would renovate the North Building and the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, and proposed renovating the South Building (with its owner's consent) to fit the new look of the plaza.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} features two {{steel and}} <b>glass</b> <b>pyramids,</b> one 43 metres high (ground to peak), {{on top of}} a three-storey concrete structure. One pyramid provides natural light for the main atrium, the other for the council chambers. The building also features a 200-foot clock Friendship Tower topped with a 23 carillon bells. Located on {{the eastern edge of the}} financial district in Edmonton's downtown, the building is the main feature on Sir Winston Churchill Square. In the winter, the fountain is converted to a skating rink.|$|R
500|$|Finally, a new {{building}} was built between the original skyscraper and the annex, which was also designed by Philip Johnson.

5000|$|Brown was not {{the first}} writer to offer esoteric interpretations of the Inverted Pyramid. In Raphaël Aurillac's work Le guide du Paris maçonnique the author {{declares}} that the Louvre used to be a Masonic temple. To Aurillac, the various <b>glass</b> <b>pyramids</b> constructed in recent decades include Masonic symbolism. Aurillac sees the downward-pointing pyramid as expressing the Rosicrucian motto V.I.T.R.I.O.L. (Visita Interiorem Terrae Rectificandoque / Invenies Occultum Lapidem, [...] "Visit the interior of the earth and… you will find the secret stone"). Another writer on Masonic architecture, Dominique Setzepfandt, sees the two pyramids as suggesting [...] "the compass and square that together form the Seal of Solomon" [...] (quoted in Code Da Vinci: L'enquête by Marie-France Etchegoin and Frédéric Lenoir).|$|R
5000|$|The two upper {{galleries}} can use heavily filtered {{natural light}} from the <b>glass</b> <b>pyramids</b> on their flat roofs. Three concrete towers run vertically {{through the middle of}} the structure and contain the passenger lift, service lift and service duct.
