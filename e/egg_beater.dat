25|$|An <b>egg</b> <b>beater</b> is a hand-cranked {{mixing device}} for whipping, beating, and folding food ingredients. It {{typically}} {{consists of a}} handle mounted over a piston, which drives one or two beaters. The beaters are immersed in the food to be mixed. In 1856, American tinner Ralph Collier of Baltimore, Maryland, invented and patented the first rotary <b>egg</b> <b>beater</b> with rotating parts. Collier was issued U.S. patent #16,267 on December 23, 1856.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} technological items {{depicted in}} the Discworld novels are owned by Twoflower. These include a watch and the iconograph, which {{is powered by a}} tiny imp who sits inside and paints pictures of whatever it sees, on demand. In The Colour of Magic, Rincewind sees the iconograph, which is essentially the discworld equivalent of the camera, and speculates that it works by means of light falling onto specially treated paper (i.e., like a real-life camera), and is distressed when he discovers that the pictures are simply painted by a small magical being. Although imp technology initially seems completely unknown outside the Agatean Empire (Twoflower's home), by the later books iconographs have become widespread, and imps are used in a range of other technology such as razors and the Dis-Organiser. In Moving Pictures the iconograph is developed into imp and salamander-powered equivalents of the movie camera and projector, but this eventually causes a portal to open into the Dungeon Dimensions, and the technology is abandoned. Nanny Ogg's Cookbook depicts an imp-powered <b>egg</b> <b>beater.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Frederick W.: An {{only child}} of two {{university}} graduates, Frederick was born May 23, 1936 in breech position and was referred to see Kanner in 1942 {{at the age of}} six. Described as being [...] "self-sufficient," [...] Frederick was capable of entertaining himself happily and was easily absorbed by objects, demonstrating [...] "good attention and perseverance" [...] in playing with toys. In turn, he paid little attention to other people, viewing them as [...] "unwelcome intruders," [...] ignoring them as much as possible in order to maintain his attention to his playthings. Furthermore, Frederick feared mechanical objects, such as vacuum cleaners and <b>egg</b> <b>beaters,</b> even running away at the sight of or hearing the things. Similar to Donald, Frederick liked a regimented lifestyle in which everything had to have been placed and arranged in the same fashion and pattern. Frederick had limited verbal interactions, ejaculating unintelligible sounds and responding to commands in [...] "echolalia fashion," [...] but he was able to sing twenty to thirty songs, including a French lullaby. Due to a lack of cooperation during the Grace Arthur performance scale diagnostic tests, Frederick's results were difficult to evaluate. He performed the best on the Seguin form board, which consisted of inputting variously shaped objects back into their respective form holes on a board, with a best time of 58 seconds. In the mare and foal test, it appeared that he put the pieces in the appropriate places based on their configuration because it did not matter to him whether the pieces were right side up or not. During the form board tests, he was very concentrated and determined, working on them in an interested manner, but between tests, he wandered about the room examining various objects, paying no attention the people in the room.|$|R

5000|$|North Bros. key {{acquisition}} was {{the hiring}} of Zachary Furbish when it purchased the Forest City Screwdriver Co in 1897. He brought with him patents related to a spiral ratchet screw driver and considerable experience in tool design. This was their foothold into the tool manufacturing industry which would later become the core of their business. Furbish alone would eventually amass 30 patents related to hand tools produced by North Bros., despite passing away in 1906, and his designs would become the backbone of their product lines for years to come. North Bros. tool brand was called Yankee, much like how Sears tools are branded Craftsman, and every tool they sold sported this trademark. In later years the [...] Yankee name would become synonymous with the spiral ratchet screw driver invented by Furbish but it was originally seen on everything from bench vises to cutting tools. Building upon the line of tools originally made by Forest City, North Bros. soon expanded their selection of offerings. Screwdrivers were joined by push drills, breast drills, hand drills (also called <b>egg</b> <b>beater</b> drills), hand powered bench drills, bit and braces, ratcheting tap wrenches, vises, cutting tools and small tool kits.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides the}} first in-depth examination of American artist Stuart Davis’s early theoretical writings made between 1918 and 1923. These writings are seminal documents in his artistic development. They {{lay the foundation}} for the creation of some of his most important works, inlcuding his groundbreaking Tobacco paintings of 1921 to his renowned <b>Egg</b> <b>Beater</b> series of 1927 – 1928, which Davis claimed set the direction for all his subsequent artistic output. One of the key ideas in these early writings is Davis’s concept of realism. This study traces the origin of Davis’s realism to his interaction with a network of ideas arising from cubism, symbolism, New York dada, and anarchist philosophy. In doing so, this study considers how Davis’s notion of realism informed both the development of his style and his iconography in his works of the 1920 s...|$|E
30|$|The cement mixing drill {{piece was}} used to prepare both ALBC types D and E in hope of {{producing}} foam and increasing porosity {{in the same manner}} as an <b>egg</b> <b>beater</b> would. The rotational speed was 1200 rpm, almost the same as that used in the operating theater. The surface porosity measurements were directly calculated from the obtained bulk density value. This value was considered to be directly affected by the permeability of ALBC or the ease by which fluids pass through the ALBC samples, which is highly dependant on the surface porosity. The less dense the material, the higher the porosity of the material will be, enabling more fluids to get into the surface pores and cracks and hence achieve higher elution rates. In the comparison of ALBC types A and D, the latter showed a higher total antibiotic elution. In regard to the porosity, the surface porosity of type D was higher than that of type A, while there was no significant difference in the total porosity. As mentioned earlier, it is very hard to quantify how deep the pores must be within the cement spacer in order not to release any antibiotic. Consequently, had the samples been left in water for longer than a minute during density measurements it is possible that they would have soaked up more water and a difference between the surface porosity of the two groups would have not been significant as the micro-CT data indicated within total porosity measurements. This claim is supported by McLaren et al. who measured the permeability of ALBC [22]. In their report, higher permepermeability was shown in 30 -day samples than in 2 -day ones. Therefore, our immersing period might have been too short to evaluate the surface porosity. In terms of elution measurements, we also measured elution after 2 and 4 weeks but the quantities were so slight that they were excluded from this study. As also documented in other papers, the ALBC spacer does not elute a substantial amount for 30 days; therefore it may be difficult to establish the immersing period to measure the surface porosity related the elution efficacy. Nonetheless, in terms of antibiotic elution over a short period of time (1 week), the mixing drill piece is useful.|$|E
