The subjects ingested radio-opaque markers on three successive days, and on the fourth a plain abdominal roentgenogram was taken using fast film. In the healthy children, total colonic transit time (mean ± SD) was 37. 8 ± 6. 2 h, with segmental times of 10. 8 ± 3. 5 <b>h</b> for <b>the</b> right colon, 12. 2 ± 2. 7 <b>h</b> for <b>the</b> left, and 14. 7 ± 2. 1 <b>h</b> for <b>the</b> rectosigmoid; upper normal limits of 17. 8 <b>h</b> for <b>the</b> right colon, 17. 6 <b>h</b> for <b>the</b> left, 19. 1 <b>h</b> for <b>the</b> rectosigmoid, and 50. 2 <b>h</b> for <b>the</b> total colonic transit time were established. In the constipated children, the total transit time was 59. 9 ± 5. 4 h, with segmental times of 15. 9 ± 2. 3 <b>h</b> for <b>the</b> right colon, 18. 9 ± 2. 3 <b>h</b> for <b>the</b> left, and 25. 0 ± 2. 6 <b>h</b> for <b>the</b> rectosigmoid. The technique described is simple, is easy to use in clinical practice, and involves a lower radiation dose than other methods.

The former DX partners both came up short in the match, however, as Benoit won the championship. The night before this, Shawn Michaels inducted Tito Santana in the WWE Hall of Fame. At Bad Blood in June, Michaels lost to Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match. Four months later, he lost a World Heavyweight championship match against Triple H, after Edge interfered at Taboo Tuesday, when the fans voted for him ahead of Edge and Chris Benoit to face Triple H one more time. Following this, Michaels was out of action for a few months with a legit torn meniscus.|$|E

After SummerSlam, then WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar became exclusive to SmackDown!, leaving Raw without a world champion. Raw general manager Eric Bischoff then awarded Triple <b>H</b> <b>the</b> World Heavyweight Championship, represented by the Big Gold Belt (which previously {{had been used to}} represent the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and WCW World Heavyweight Championship), making him the first World Heavyweight Champion. Triple H retained his title against Rob Van Dam at Unforgiven when Ric Flair hit Van Dam with a sledgehammer.|$|E

5|$|For graphs G and <b>H,</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set of H. An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable {{an element of the}} domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E

Flair retaliated to Orton's comments, stating that individuals like Shawn Michaels and Mick Foley, who Orton had previously feuded with, were not legends, therefore Orton was not a Legend Killer. Flair also stated that he and Orton would have a match at Taboo Tuesday and the fans would {{have the opportunity to}} choose what type of match they face in.

Another attack saw Triple H hit Michaels with the steel steps, which resulted in Michaels bleeding. A spot in the match saw Michaels lay Triple H on a table, as he climbed onto a ladder that he took out from under the ring, and performed a diving elbow drop onto Triple H through the table. Afterwards, Triple H gained the advantage and performed a Pedigree on Michaels for the win. After the match, Michaels was given a standing ovation by the audience.|$|E
