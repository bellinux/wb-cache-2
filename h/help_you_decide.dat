[...] When asked if they are pro gamers, Bajo and Hex explained that in truth they aren't, as [...] "a pro gamer is someone who plays games professionally at the highest competitive levels in tournaments... so we don't really fit that description, and pro gamers around the world would scoff if we ever said we were [...] "pro"." [...] They added that their job as game critics is not to be {{the best of the best}} at any one particular game, but to [...] "be ok at all types of games so we can review and compare them to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> if you want to play them." [...] They said they review bad games along with good games as they can't know what quality the game will be until they've actually played it, and also if all the reviewed games were given highly positive reviews, they reviews would be redundant and their rating system meaningless. Also, as games are expensive, the team want to warn viewers about what games they should avoid. They have also stated they make an effort to review games on all consoles.|$|E

5000|$|Lee {{invented the}} Hyper-View Large Format Stereo Print Viewer in 1990, {{improving}} on a viewer previously used for reviewing stereo medical X-rays and aerial stereo viewers. Both aerial stereo viewers and X-ray stereo viewers {{are similar in}} concept. The difference between the Hyper-View Large Format Stereo Viewer {{and the other two}} mentioned is that the others cannot cover a very large field of view. The Hyper-View device essentially widens the effective separation of the viewer's eyes from about 2½ inches to about 11 inches, as through two horizontal periscopes. One of the most convenient models is called the 3D Scope. Other viewers, include the Wheatstone Mini-Scope and the Adjustable 3D Prism Glasses. After building several viewers, Lee subsequently provided design specifications to Steven Berezin, of Berezin Stereo Products, a manufacturer which produces the oversized hyperviewers for sale to galleries and individual customers. Berezin has a viewer selection chart to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> which viewer is right for you. One of the main uses for which Lee envisioned was for gallery exhibitions of his own stereo prints. Lee was also interested in encouraging other [...] "fine art" [...] photographers who had never seriously considered stereo photography to begin producing creative work in this medium.|$|E

It provides a useful classification tool for OR/MS practitioners, especially when tackling discrete deterministic problems. Use it to tell, in advance, whether a problem is easy or hard. Knowing this won’t solve your problem, but it will <b>help</b> <b>you</b> to <b>decide</b> what kind of solution method is appropriate. Complexity analysis <b>helps</b> <b>you</b> to understand and deal with hard problems. It can pinpoint the nasty parts of your problem, alert you to a special structure you can take advantage of, and guide you to model more effectively. You will solve your problem better when you know the borders between hard and easy. Locating the difficulty can indicate where to aggregate, decompose, or simplify. To detect and prove computational difficulty, show that a known hard problem from the literature is embedded within your problem. Fix parameters of your problem {{to arrive at the}} known hard problem, or use specialization, padding, forcing, or the more difficult gadget proofs. Study contrasting pairs of easy and hard problems to develop your intuitive ability to assess complexity. (Analysis of algorithms: computational complexity. ...|$|R

40|$|In the 2015 General Election {{campaign}} immigration {{was a key}} battleground issue. It featured {{strongly in}} each of the main parties’ manifestos and attracted a steady volume of news media coverage. Immigration was firmly on the national electioneering agenda as if this were a matter of ‘common sense’. Perhaps this should not be surprising. The increasing significance of immigration at the polls certainly seems clear according to successive IPSOS MORI opinion poll data. When asked during the 2015 campaign, ‘Looking ahead to the next General Election, which, if any, of these issues do you think will be very important to <b>you</b> in <b>helping</b> <b>you</b> to <b>decide</b> which party to vote for?’ asylum and immigration was 3 rd most cited – apparently as critical an issue as education and outranking previously stalwart areas such as law and order/crime. In the more general Issues Index poll, immigration consistently ranks in the top 5 – overtaking the NHS as the ‘most important issue facing Britain today’ in March 2015. However, this ‘common sense’ public profile of immigration is neither ‘natural’ nor guaranteed, but rather, I argue, the product of populist cultural work to which the main political parties and the press contribute...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) system has become most popular in service industries and logistics, manufacturing, as it is inexpensive and reliable device for automatic identification. Therefore, RFID system would be useful in a problem of mobile robot self-localization, if tags are distributed in the environment, and the robot {{is equipped with a}} RFID reader to communicate with the tags. In fact, there are millions of robots working for us today. There are some essential characteristics Sensing, Movement, Energy, Intelligence [1]. The robot must have and this might help to decide what is and what not a robot is. It will also <b>help</b> <b>you</b> to <b>decide</b> what features <b>you</b> will need to build into a machine before it can count as a robot. In this paper, we propose in service industries method for learning-based localization with a RFID system by using ZIGBEE communication. We also propose a method that enables a user to easily place tags in effective locations. In experiments with a mobile robot, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated.
