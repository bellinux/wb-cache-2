40|$|Few {{data are}} {{available}} on the comparative accumulation of metal(loid) s from water and food in estuarine/marine fish. Smooth toadfish (Tetractenos glaber), commonly found in estuaries in south-eastern Australia, were separately exposed to radio-labelled seawater (14 kBq L- 1 of 109 Cd and 24 kBq g- 1 75 Se) and food (ghost shrimps; Trypaea australiensis: 875 Bq g- 1 109 Cd and 1130 Bq g- 1 75 Se) for 25 days (<b>uptake</b> <b>phase),</b> followed by exposure to radionuclide-free water or food for 30 days (loss phase). Toadfish accumulated 109 Cd predominantly from water (85 %) and 75 Se predominantly from food (62 %), although the latter was lower than expected. For both the water and food exposures, 109 Cd was predominantly located in the gut lining (60 e 75 %) at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>uptake</b> <b>phase,</b> suggesting that the gut may be the primary pathway <b>of</b> 109 Cd <b>uptake.</b> This may be attributed to toadfish drinking large volumes of water to maintain osmoregulation. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the loss phase, 109 Cd had predominantly shifted to the excretory organs e the liver (81 %) in toadfish exposed to radio-labelled food, and in the liver, gills and kidney (82 %) of toadfish exposed to radio-labelled water. In contrast, 75 Se was predominantly located in the excretory organs (gills, kidneys and liver; 66 e 76 %) at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>uptake</b> <b>phase,</b> irrespective <b>of</b> the exposure pathway, with minimal change in percentage distribution (76 - 83 %) after the loss phase.

In addition, internal body Ni concentrations showed high variance.

Instead, the model with a regression-estimated point of switching to decontamination fit the data better, explaining 57. 2 - 91. 5 % of the temporal variability of mean Ni body concentrations (weighted regression) in adult beetles and 44. 1 - 62. 3 % in larvae.

The algae were exposed to filtered seawater solutions of either PNA or PNP in a static system for 24 hr (uptake period), then placed in clean water and allowed to release absorbed chemical and possible metabolites for 24 hr (depuration period). Concentrations of the chemicals were monitored spectrophotometrically, and the water at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> and depuration was extracted onto a column of Amberlite XAD- 4 resin, eluted sequentially with methylene chloride and methanol, and analyzed for metabolites by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that the algae absorb PNA but not PNP. There was no indication that they were capable of metabolizing PNA, except inconsistently, to PNP. However, half of the absorbed PNA remained unaccounted for, and may either have been metabolized to undetected metabolites or bound to tissue macromolecules...|$|R

30|$|Based on our results, and {{the fact}} that all SPCCT reconstructed images have a 100 % spatial {{registration}} [13], using multiple contrast agents with different pharmacokinetics in the same biological system simultaneously can reasonably be considered. Several applications of such methods in the vascular system can be considered. For example, different contrast agents injected sequentially within a single scan could allow the imaging <b>of</b> multiple <b>uptake</b> <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> a given tissue/organ [7, 32]. It could also be possible to simultaneously visualise the vascular lumen and wall in pathologies such as atherosclerosis by using a combination of specific and non-specific contrast agents [22]. These applications would considerably enhance the diagnostic capabilities and decrease the patients’ exposure to radiation. Finally, for the past 20 years, increasing efforts have been directed toward in vivo imaging of gene expression and enzyme activity, particularly in oncology research. It would be interesting to develop new multi-atom contrast agents that could be modified or cleaved in targeted tissues to allow cellular activity imaging [41 – 43].|$|R
40|$|In etiolated, 5 -day-old pea (Pisum sativum L.) {{seedlings}} {{a significantly}} more intensive growth of buds {{situated in the}} axil of the excised cotyledons was observed as early as 4 hours after decapitation and excision of one cotyledon of each pair. If [8 - 14 C]benzyladenine ([14 C]BA) was applied to roots of intact plants 10 hours prior to such decapitation and excision, significantly higher both total and specific 14 C activities were observed in buds situated {{on the side of}} the excised cotyledons as early as 4 hours after decapitation and excision. Although the removal of a substantial part of the root system carried out simultaneously with decapitation and excision of one cotyledon resulted in a decrease in total 14 C activity of buds, nevertheless a higher accumulation of 14 C activity was maintained in buds situated on the side of excised cotyledon. If [14 C]BA was applied to roots of seedlings after they were decapitated and deprived of one cotyledon, both total and specific 14 C activities of buds situated on the side of excised cotyledons were significantly higher as early as the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>of</b> [14 C]BA by roots, i. e. after 10 hours.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{another issue}} potentially influencing {{the accuracy of}} 15 O-water PET activation studies of the auditory system is scanning duration. Shorter as well as longer acquisition durations have been proposed. Kanno et al. [50] demonstrated an increase of signal to noise (S/N) ratio with acquisition time. In the mean, they found S/N ratio to be about 1 / 3 higher at 120  s compared to 40  s scan time. On the other hand, Volkow et al. [51] showed the largest activations in the occipital cortex due to light stimulation based on acquisitions during “uptake phase” (the initial 30 – 35  s). Moreover, they demonstrated that activations depend on the duration of stimulation. Continued stimulation after the peak <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> <b>phase</b> for further 40  s during the “washout phase” resulted into lower uptake compared to stimulation restricted to the <b>uptake</b> <b>phase.</b> The authors explained this observation and also lower activation with longer acquisitions by increased clearance of radioactivity from areas of high blood flow. In our study, {{we did not observe}} a significant difference in activation height (Tmax) dependent on the acquisition duration (60 vs. 90  s). This is particularly in contrast to a study by Silbersweig et al. [52] reporting improved significance (greater signal to noise ratio and higher Z-score) of results obtained with 90  s compared to 60  s. One reason for these conflicting results might be differences in the injection procedure—particularly with respect to the duration of the bolus injection. Silbersweig et al. [52] described a slow bolus injection (over 20  s), which is considerably slower compared to Volkow’s and our study (3 and 7  s, respectively). A slower injection might promote improved results with longer acquisition durations. Thus, a final conclusion with respect to the most favorable scan duration is not yet possible based on the presently available data. Nevertheless, future studies employing modern PET equipment with the capability of list mode acquisition enabling flexible retrospective definition of reconstructed time frames would allow to address this issue more precisely. Furthermore, due to achievements in PET technique like time of flight measurements, an enhanced signal to noise ratio for a given acquisition duration can be expected [24]. Finally, this will help to adapt the acquisition duration rather on biological/physiological grounds than on technical limitations of the scanner for improved results of PET activation studies.|$|R

The CT scan was used to ac-curately identify the location <b>of</b> 18 F-FDG <b>uptake.</b> <b>Of</b> the 20 sub-jects, 10 were randomly selected to perform a low-level muscle activity during the 1 -h 18 F-FDG <b>uptake</b> <b>phase.</b> The PET/CT im-ages were fused, and the location and intensity of metabolic ac-tivity were described for all subjects.

40|$|High density {{lipoprotein}} (HDL) and {{its main}} protein component apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) have multiple anti-atherogenic functions. Some of them are exerted within the vessel wall, so that HDL needs to pass the endothelial barrier. To elucidate their itinerary through endothelial cells (ECs), we labelled ApoA-I and HDL either fluorescently or with 1. 4 nm nanogold and investigated their cellular localization by using immunofluorescent microscopy (IFM) and electron microscopy (EM). HDL as well as ApoA-I is taken up by ECs into the same route of intracellular trafficking. Time kinetics and pulse chase experiments revealed that HDL is trafficked through different vesicles. HDL partially co-localized with LDL, albumin, and transferrin. HDL did not co-localize with clathrin and caveolin- 1. Fluorescent HDL was recovered at small proportions in early endosomes and endosome to trans-golgi network vesicles but not at all in recycling endosomes, in late endosomes or lysosomes. EM identified HDL mainly in large filled vesicles which however upon IFM did not colocalize with markers of multivesicular bodies or autophagosomes. The uptake or cellular distribution of HDL was altered upon pharmacological interference with cytochalasine D, colchicine and dynasore. Blockage <b>of</b> fluid <b>phase</b> <b>uptake</b> with Amiloride or EIPA did not reduce the <b>uptake</b> <b>of</b> HDL. Neither did we observe any co-localization of HDL with dextran as the marker <b>of</b> fluid <b>phase</b> <b>uptake.</b> In conclusion, HDL and ApoA-I are internalized and trafficked by endothelial cells through a non-classical endocytic route...|$|R

In all cultivars, 30 minutes of desorption with citric acid depleted the rapidly exchanging, putative apoplasmic compartment, although some tightly bound Al remained in that compartment. The relationship between Al remaining after desorption and time in the uptake medium was nearly linear and no distinction was observed between Al-tolerant and Al-sensitive cultivars.

Abstract We compare alternative drawdown strategies in retirement to a life annuity benchmark when retirees have access to government means-tested Age Pension. By adopting Epstein-Zin utility preferences which enables disentangling relative risk aversion (RRA) from elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), our results suggest that retirees possess RRA levels which are higher than the inverse of EIS.

IAN uptake was similar to IAA uptake. There was no polarity <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> or movement out of the segments. Movement was limited although activity in receivers increased steadily with time. It was concluded that root segments did not actively transport IAA.

Spectrophotometric quantification of LY accumulation {{was performed in}} {{the presence or absence}} of transferrin, a marker of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Internalization of LY showed a curvilinear kinetics: the high initial rate of LYuptake (575 ng LY/ mg protein /hr) decreased almost 5 -fold within 15 min, reaching plateau at 126 ng/ mg protein /hr. Transferrin induced a small increase (7. 5 %) in the fluid <b>phase</b> <b>uptake</b> rate (after 5 min) followed by a small decrease at longer incubation times. Lucifer Yellow and transferrin (visualized by streptavidin– FITC) were localized in Paramecium by 3 -D reconstruction by confocal microscopy.

Phorbol ester diminished LY accumulation by 22 % and this effect persisted up to 25 min of incubation. PKC inhibitor did not affect LY uptake. However, in the presence of transferrin, the LY uptake increased within the first 15 minutes followed by a rapid 20 % decrease in comparison to the control.

Second stage uptake was slower, pH and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or N-ethyl-maleimide.

(2010) [13] developed a reliable assay that allows quantitative assessment of the efficiency and kinetics of macropinosome biogenesis and/or maturation in cells where the function of a targeted protein has been perturbed by pharmacological inhibitors or by knock-down or knock-out approaches. In this manuscript we describe a modified quantitative protocol to measure the rate and volume <b>of</b> fluid <b>phase</b> <b>uptake</b> in adherent cells. This assay: • uses fluorescent dextran, microscopy and semi-automated image analysis; • allows quantitation of macropinosomes within large numbers of individual cells; • can be applied also to non-homogenous cell populations including transiently transfected cell monolayers. We present the background necessary to consider when customising this protocol for application to new cell types or experimental variations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMethylammonium uptake was {{studied in}} a {{glutamine}} auxotroph of the cyanobacterium Anabaena cycadeae lacking glutamine synthetase activity. The uptake pattern {{was found to}} be biphasic, consisting of an initial fast phase lasting up to 60 s followed by a slower second phase. When cells were preincubated with L-meth-ionine-DL-sulphoximine, an irreversible inhibitor of glutamine synthetase activity, the second <b>uptake</b> <b>phase</b> was abolished although the first phase was unaffected. Since the glutamine auxotroph did not have any glutamine synthetase activity the inhibition of the second phase by L-methionine-DL-sulphoximine could not have been due to the inhibition of glutamine synthetase activity. Thus, it is suggested that the two <b>uptake</b> <b>phases</b> may represent two different ammonium transport systems, the second one being sensitive to L-meth-ionine-DL-sulphoximine...|$|R

40|$|Isolated rat livers were perfused with proprano-lol {{and other}} drugs in a {{simplified}} recirculation system without plasma proteins or erythrocytes. The propranolol levels in the reservoir declined biphasically. The first phase was rapid and al-most flow-limited despite use of high perfusion flow rates. This rapid uptake generated liver/perfusate ratios greater than 25 and was not significantly diminished by lowering the tem-perature or removing oxygen from the system. It appeared to reflect one or more physical binding processes. Autoradiography showed high concentrations of propranolol in the pen-portal zones of the liver lobule. The second, slower <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> was associated with metabolism of propranolol to other compounds and was temperature, oxygen and concentra-tion dependent. A number of drugs inhibited the slow phase but {{had little effect on}} the rapid <b>uptake</b> <b>phase.</b> Several <b>of</b> these drugs were able to displace small amounts of pnopnanolol from the liver. In common with several other organic amines (Anderson et at., 1974) propranolol is extracted from the plasma and concentrated by a number of organs (Black et at., 1965; Hayes and Cooper, 1971). <b>Uptake</b> <b>of</b> propranolol by liver has been extensively studied by Shand and coworker...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundActivity-dependent bulk {{endocytosis}} (ADBE) is {{the dominant}} mode of synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis during intense neuronal activity, implicating it as {{a major contributor to}} presynaptic plasticity under these stimulation conditions. However methods to monitor this endocytosis mode have been limited to either morphological or optical observation <b>of</b> the <b>uptake</b> <b>of</b> large fluid <b>phase</b> markers. New methodWe present here a method to monitor ADBE using the genetically-encoded reporter VAMP 4 -pHluorin in primary neuronal cultures. ResultsIndividual nerve terminals expressing VAMP 4 -pHluorin display either an increase or decrease in fluorescence after stimulation terminates. The decrease in fluorescence reflects the slow acidification of large bulk endosomes to which VAMP 4 -pHluorin is selectively recruited. Use of VAMP 4 -pHluorin during sequential high frequency stimuli revealed that all nerve terminals perform ADBE, but not all do so in response to a single stimulus. VAMP 4 -pHluorin also displays a rapid activity-dependent decrease in fluorescence during high frequency stimulation, a response which is particularly prominent when expressed in hippocampal neurons. The molecular mechanism responsible for this decrease is still unclear, but is not due to loss of VAMP 4 -pHluorin from the nerve terminal. Comparison with existing methodsThis method allows the selective reporting of ADBE for the first time, when compared to previous approaches using markers <b>of</b> fluid <b>phase</b> <b>uptake.</b> ConclusionsThe development <b>of</b> VAMP 4 -pHluorin as a selective genetically-encoded reporter of ADBE increases the palette of approaches used to monitor this endocytosis mode both in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Despite being {{essential}} for animal health and fitness, Se has a relatively narrow range between deficiency and toxicity, and excess Se {{can cause a}} variety of adverse effects in aquatic organisms. Amphibians are particularly vulnerable to contaminants during larval aquatic life stage, because they can accumulate toxic ions through various routes including skin, gills, lungs and digestive tract. Few {{attempts have been made}} to understand the tissue-specific accumulation of trace elements, including the impacts of chemical speciation in developing amphibian larvae. We used radiolabelled 75 Se to explore the biokinetics and tissue distributions of the two dominant forms occurring in surface waters, selenite (SeIV) and selenate (SeVI). Tadpoles of the native Australian frog Limnodynastes peronii were exposed to Se in both forms, and live-animal gamma spectroscopy was used to track accumulation and retention over time. Tissue biodistributions were also quantified at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>uptake</b> and depuration <b>phases.</b> Results showed the bioconcentration of SeIV to be 3 times greater compared to SeVI, but rates of elimination were similar for both forms. This suggests a change of Se speciation within the organism prior to excretion. Depuration kinetics were best described by a one-phase exponential decay model, and tadpoles retained approximately 19 % of the accumulated Se after 12 [*]days of depuration in clean water. Selenium bioaccumulation was greatest in digestive and excretory organs, as well as the eye, which may directly relate to previously reported Se-induced impairments. Results demonstrate how the use of radiotracing techniques can significantly improve our understanding of trace element toxicokinetics and tissue distributions in developing amphibians. From an environmental monitoring perspective, the findings highlight the importance of considering chemical speciation as this could influence the accuracy of risk assessment.
