40|$|Issue: A {{key process}} in {{preparing}} recovered wood waste for commodity feedstock and specialty products {{is to remove}} contaminants and reduce its screening size. Each equipment type varies concerning the forms of wood waste it can effectively handle and its production quality. Best Practice: Hogging (Grinding) Equipment Types. Hogging equipment's horsepower, physical hog size, and the wood waste type it processes set the limits for its throughput capacity. Hammer Hog: A <b>hammer</b> <b>hog</b> operates by pulverizing wood with either swinging or fixed “hammers. ” It then forces material through heavy steel sizing grates. The size of the grate openings determines the resulting product size, available in interchangeable size ranges adjustable down to very small particles (fines). The fixed hammers achieve force at the cutting surface because they attach to the rotor mass. The swinging hammers, because {{of their ability to}} apply variable force, tend to have greater tolerance for large, hard contaminants. Thus, they require less maintenance, although hammers and grates require regular maintenance. Hammer hogs are available with vertical or horizontal in-feed configurations. The horizontal in-feed typically features a powered feed mechanism. Mass Rotor Hog: This machine is a newer variety of primary reduction hog. The mass rotor hog consists of a heavy shaft that has, mounted at an angle, thick solid steel plates that have replaceable wear bars. Th...|$|E
