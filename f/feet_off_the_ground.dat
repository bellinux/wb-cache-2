5|$|The barren desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{and covered in}} wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A cyclorama was painted and wrapped around the set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.|$|E
5|$|The second Avrocar had logged about 75 {{flight hours}} {{at the end of}} the flight testing. Judged by its performance, the Avrocar was an abject failure: it couldn't lift itself safely more than a few <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and its bulbous design {{limiting}} high-speed performance accompanied by unbearable heat and screaming exhaust noise, made it impractical for the military. Although considered a technical failure, its design would be prophetic: it was a rubber skirt shy of being one of the world's first hovercraft, the Saunders Roe SR.N1 also taking off in 1959. Nevertheless, company designer John Frost applied for a number of patents in Canada, the UK and the U.S. that established the pivotal role that the Avrocar and related Avro experimental vehicles made in the VTOL world.|$|E
5|$|Speaker {{guided the}} 1920 Indians {{to their first}} World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught a hard line drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped with both <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> snaring the ball before {{crashing}} into a concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3â€“0. Cleveland's 1920 season was also significant due {{to the death of}} Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, {{and he said that he}} wanted to help Speaker earn Cleveland's first World Series victory before thinking of retirement.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the crashed plane, in which Hank discovers a dead pilot and the $4.4 million in cash, was filmed on a soundstage. A second plane, designed to have frosted windows, was attached to a gimbal, about five <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> To match the interior with footage shot in Wisconsin, the art department built a set with real trees and a painted backdrop. To depict Hank being attacked by a flock of crows inside the plane, puppets were used to attack Paxton as he appeared on screen, while two live crows were used to attack an animatronic replica of the actor. A separate soundstage was used to create two sets depicting the interiors of the Mitchell home, where Hank and his wife Sarah (Fonda) reside. The first set was the main floor an exterior entrance way, and the second was created for the upstairs bedrooms. Principal photography concluded on March 13, 1998, after 55 days of filming.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} rounds in a match of Blitz, where two teams of four {{computer}} or human players score points for each energized Blitz disc thrown through their opponent's hoop, which is eight <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Players pass and travel with the disc across the arenas, {{and the game}} continues without pause between points scored. The team with the most points {{at the end of}} a match wins. Players can choose to brawl when not scoring points. Fighting depletes character health, depending on who takes the blows. Once his health is completely depleted, a character is removed from the game, and teams with all players knocked out are disqualified (though players can be substituted between rounds). If a player tends towards belligerence, the game's artificial intelligence will compensate and exact revenge for its teammates. Friendly fire, where teammates can intentionally or inadvertently hurt each other with attacks meant for their opponents, is permitted.|$|E

25|$|All {{horses were}} {{equipped}} with stirrups. This technical advantage {{made it easier}} for the Mongol archers to turn their upper body, and shoot in all directions, including backwards. Mongol warriors would time the loosing of an arrow to the moment when a galloping horse would have all four <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> thus ensuring a steady, well-aimed shot.|$|E
25|$|Broomsticks {{are treated}} as a major {{consumer}} product in the wizarding world. There are numerous manufacturers and models of brooms, including Cleansweeps and Comets, all of which vary in their capabilities. These range from expensive high-performance models to toy broomsticks for young children that fly only a few <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> to family-sized broomsticks that seat multiple people and include a luggage compartment below the seating area.|$|E
25|$|Thanks {{to another}} {{inspection}} of the camp by Dr. Clark on February 4, 1864, flooring was restored to the barracks. Clark found {{that the number of}} working hydrants for supplying water to the camp had been increased from three to twelve. By February 27, 1864, floors were laid in all barracks and the structures were raised five <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> on thick timber legs. This not only improved the sanitary condition of the barracks but helped prevent tunneling. During the move, many of the barracks and kitchens had been placed closer to the fences, which was found to encourage tunneling efforts. Upon the discovery of these escape efforts, prison officials moved the barracks further from the stockade walls, and reduced the attempts to escape by tunnels.|$|E

30|$|In {{both the}} groups, NMES {{produced}} muscle contractions that mimic normal voluntary ankle movement, lifting <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and improving gait, by applying electrical pulses {{to the common}} peroneal nerve through the skin surface. Stimulation electrodes were placed over the nerve using a textile sleeve (Figure 2), which were connected by leads to the NMES device (ODFS Pace, Odstock, UK).|$|R
50|$|Lestrimelitta limao {{are found}} in Brazil and Panama and are {{considered}} a rare and dispersed species. Their nests can be found high up, in hollow tree trunks, but have occasionally been seen a <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> or along <b>the</b> sides of walls. Lestrimellita limao colonies will strategically build their nests within 10 feet of other meliponine nests to make nest robbing more manageable.|$|R
25|$|Northrop's Chief Test Pilot Vance Breese {{flew the}} N-1M on its maiden flight, {{unexpectedly}} bouncing {{into the air}} during a planned high-speed taxi run. He reported that the aircraft could fly no higher than five <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Flight could only be sustained by maintaining a precise angle of attack, but Theodore von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n solved the problem by making adjustments to the trailing edges of the elevons. Control of the aircraft was achieved {{through the use of}} a system of elevons and wingtip rudders. The elevons served in tailless type aircraft both as elevators and ailerons, while split flaps on the downward angled wingtips took the place of a conventional rudder; they were later straightened after that angle proved unnecessary during flight testing.|$|E
25|$|Other {{attempts}} have been made, with limited success, to produce manned vehicles based on the flying saucer design. While some, such as the Avrocar and M200G Volantor have been produced in limited numbers, most fail to leave the drawing board. The Avrocar, with vertical takeoff and landing, was originally intended to replace both the Jeep and the helicopter in combat situations, but proved to be inadequate for both. In spite of a powerful turbojet, it could not rise more than four or five <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> i.e., out of ground effect. Thus, the Avrocar {{could be seen as}} a prototype for the early generations of hovercraft, lacking only a 'skirt' to make it a truly effective example of the type. Unmanned saucers have had more success; the Sikorsky Cypher is a saucer-like UAV which uses the disc-shaped shroud to protect rotor blades.|$|E
25|$|After {{the bones}} were prepared, photographed and studied, {{they were sent}} to New Jersey where work began on making the mount. This work {{consists}} of bending steel to support each bone safely and to display the entire skeleton articulated {{as it was in}} life. The real skull was not incorporated into the mount as subsequent study would be difficult with the head 13 <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Parts of the skull had been crushed and broken, and thus appeared distorted. The museum made a cast of the skull, and altered this cast to remove the distortions, thus approximating what the original undistorted skull may have looked like. The cast skull was also lighter, allowing it to be displayed on the mount without the use of a steel upright under the head. The original skull is exhibited in a case that can be opened to allow researchers access for study. When the whole skeleton was assembled it was forty two feet (twelve meters) long from nose to tail and twelve feet (four meters) tall at the hips.|$|E
50|$|The theatre had a {{capacity}} of under 400 and a stage roughly one <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> giving it an intimate feeling required for radio comedy audiences.

25|$|Free kicks {{are awarded}} for {{technical}} infringements {{that do not}} warrant a penalty. This includes indiscretions like players time wasting, charging over the 22-metre line during the oppositions drop-out, pushing in a ruck with their head lower than their hips, returning the ball to a ruck or maul, pretending to clear the ball from a ruck or maul and preventing the ball being thrown in at a quick line-out. Many infringements are penalised by free kicks during line-outs, including delaying or pretending {{to throw the ball}} in (balking), having less than two or more numbers than the opposition, leaving once the line-out has formed, failure to form a line-out, standing closer than five metres or over fifteen metres from the sideline, the receiver or opposition hooker (or equivalent player) standing in the incorrect position, not forming a straight line, not keeping a metre gap between the two lines, lifting a player below the shorts from behind or below the thighs from in front, jumping before the ball is thrown in, not lowering any lifted player, using only the outside arm to catch or deflect the ballor leaving the line-out before the ball is thrown, Free kicks are awarded at scrums are for delay in forming a scrum, incorrect or early binding of the front rows, pushing before the ball is fed, front rows <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> before the ball is fed, the scrumhalf not feeding the ball in correctly or straight, intentionally kicking the ball out of the tunnel, bringing the ball back into the scrum after it has emerged, a non-front row player hooking the ball from the tunnel or the scrum half pretending to clear the ball from the scrum.|$|E
500|$|Animation {{took place}} at 3 Mills Studios in East London. A dozen animators/puppeteers were put to work when {{production}} began, but that number had tripled {{by the end of}} production. The initial group spent time developing each puppet's unique characteristics. The puppets themselves, built by Mackinnon and Saunders, were typically about 17 inches tall and animated on sets built three to four <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> with trap doors that allowed animators access to the sets' surfaces to manipulate the puppets. The three primary charactersâ€”Victor, Victoria and Corpse Brideâ€”were fitted with heads the size of golf balls that contained special gearing to allow the animators to manipulate individual parts of the puppets' faces. The animators' work was spread over 25 to 35 individual setups/stages, each having its own Canon digital camera. A total of 32 cameras were used on the film. Each camera was outfitted with a [...] "grabber" [...] system that enabled the animators to capture frames and download them into a computer to assemble a short [...] "reel" [...] of the shot being produced to check their work.|$|E
500|$|Soring {{began in}} the 1950s with gaited horse {{trainers}} who were looking to improve their chances of winning at horse shows. To do this, they developed methods to enhance the desired high action gaits to levels greater than that produced by traditional training methods. Thus began the use of irritants, including chemicals and physical objects, or abusive shoeing and hoof-trimming practices on the front legs. Attempting to relieve the pain in its legs, a sored horse lifts its front <b>feet</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> more quickly, creating a flashier gait. By the 1960s, soring had gained popularity, as horses so treated gained an edge in competition. However, public opposition to the practice also grew, and in 1966, the American Horse Protection Association was created in part {{to address the issue}} of soring. In 1969, Senator Joseph Tydings sponsored legislation to prohibit soring, leading to the passing of the Horse Protection Act in 1970, amended in 1976. While Tennessee Walking Horses, Racking Horses and other [...] "high-stepping breeds" [...] are generally targeted by these abusive practices, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.|$|E

25|$|Chihuahuas {{are also}} known for luxating patella, a genetic {{condition}} that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways. The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause some pain. The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and <b>foot</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> until <b>the</b> quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens, after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with activity.|$|R
