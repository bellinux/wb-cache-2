500|$|Hastings {{was born}} on 17 March 1880 in London to Alfred Gardiner Hastings and Kate Comyns Carr, a painter and the sister of J. Comyns Carr. Having been born on Saint Patrick's Day Hastings was named after the saint. His father was a {{solicitor}} with [...] "somewhat seedy clients", and the family were repeatedly bankrupted. Despite financial difficulties, there was enough money in the family to send Hastings to a private preparatory school in 1890 and to Charterhouse School in 1894. Hastings disliked school, saying [...] "I hated the bell which drove us up in the morning, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> masters; above all <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> work, which never interested me in the slightest degree". He was bullied at both the preparatory school and at Charterhouse, and did not excel at either sports or his studies.|$|E
500|$|Johnny {{obtained}} {{more control}} over the musical style because the band members experienced conflict amongst themselves, specifically rooted in each member—excluding Johnny—facing issues with addiction. Both Joey and drummer Marky Ramone were dealing with alcoholism, while bassist Dee Dee Ramone was severely addicted to cocaine and was undergoing psychotherapeutic treatment. Since the Ramones' previous two releases had producers which proved disappointing to the members, they were skeptical of the upcoming producer; this would be Ritchie Cordell, with whom they also had issues. Marky relates: [...] "I hated the production, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> producer." ...|$|E
500|$|The Grove Book of Hollywood {{wrote that}} the 1978 film, The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and est because actress Diana Ross and writer Joel Schumacher were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard." [...] The film's producer Rob Cohen noted that: [...] "before I knew it, the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords about knowing {{who you are and}} sharing and all that. [...] <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> script a lot. But it was hard to argue with Diana because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars." [...] Schumacher spoke positively {{of the results of the}} est training, saying: [...] "I will be eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by the Good Witch, played by actress Lena Horne, at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes," [...] and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|Joel Schumacher's {{script for}} The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and his Erhard Seminars Training ("est") movement, as both Schumacher and Diana Ross were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard". [...] "Before I knew it," [...] said Rob Cohen, [...] "the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords about knowing {{who you are and}} sharing and all that. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> script a lot. But it was hard to argue with [...] because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars." [...] Schumacher spoke positively {{of the results of the}} est training, stating that he was [...] "eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life." [...] However, he also complained that [...] "everybody stayed exactly the way they were and went around spouting all this bull****." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by Glinda the Good Witch at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes", and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself". Although Joel Schumacher had seen the Broadway play before writing the script, none of the Broadway play's writing was incorporated into the film's.|$|E
500|$|After {{it became}} known that Billy, not Cane, fathered Chloe's {{daughter}} Delia, journalist Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps praised the storyline that involved Chloe, Lily, Billy and Cane as [...] "one of soaps all-time best quadrangle story arcs". Jeevan Brar of TV Buzz noted the popularity that Chloe and Billy (a couple that fans have named [...] "Chilly") generated, writing, [...] "A lot of fans saw that pairing end way too quickly {{to make way for}} the ill-fated Billy & Mac redux." [...] Referring to the love triangle between Chance, Chloe and Heather, Nekeeta Borden (also writing for Zap2it) said, [...] "All things considered, will Chance and Chloe survive Hurricane Heather?" [...] In another article, Borden heavily criticized the writing for Chloe's character. She wrote, [...] "Initially <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> pint-sized minx when she first planted her stilettos in Genoa City and on Lily’s face a few years back, but lately I've come to realize how much I miss the scheming, sassy Chloe of old [...] The pairing with [...] killed poor Chloe dead. She, like Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford), is not meant to be some happy housewife, married to a boy scout. Chloe needs a sparring partner and partner-in-crime. She is way too much woman to be cheated on by someone like Chance." [...] Also unfavorable of the relationship was Sara Bibel of Xfinity, who wrote that [...] "Chance and Chloe never had much chemistry. [...] She was attracted to him because she thought he was a safe, dependable guy who would not cheat on her", describing Chance as [...] "the anti-Billy" [...] in Chloe's eyes.|$|E
2500|$|R.E.M.'s {{previous}} record Around the Sun (2004) only sold 240,000 copies in the U.S. and was poorly received by critics. The band members later expressed displeasure with the album. Guitarist Peter Buck told Q, [...] "I personally hated it. [...] No, hated is too hard. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that it}} wasn't {{as good as it}} should've been." [...] Buck admitted the band felt pressure to subsequently make a better record; he told Q, [...] "Even Michael [...] was going, 'Y'know, if we make another bad record, it's over.' It's like, 'No kidding.'" ...|$|E

50|$|On {{politics}}, Latham commented in 2002: I'm a hater. Part of the tribalness {{of politics}} is to really dislike {{the other side}} with intensity. And the more I see of them <b>the</b> more <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> them. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> their negativity. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> their narrowness. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> way, for instance, John Howard tries to appeal to suburban values when I know that he hasn't got any real answers to the problems and challenges we face. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> phoniness of that.|$|R

2500|$|In 2013, Thom Yorke of Radiohead named Aphex Twin as {{his biggest}} influence, saying: [...] "He burns a heavy shadow ... Aphex opened up another world that didn't involve my fucking {{electric}} guitar ... I hated {{all the music}} that was around Radiohead at the time, it was completely fucking meaningless. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> Britpop thing and {{what was happening in}} America, but Aphex was totally beautiful, and he's kind of my age too." [...] Although he has influenced Radiohead, especially on their album Kid A, he does not wish to tour with them: [...] "I wouldn't play with them since I don't like them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Judge also {{hated the}} poster that the studio created for Office Space (which portrayed an office worker {{completely}} covered in Post-it notes). He said, [...] "People were like, 'What is this? A big bird? A mummy? A beekeeper?' And the tagline 'Work Sucks'? It {{looked like an}} Office Depot ad. I just hated it. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> trailers, too and the TV ads especially". Fox Filmed Entertainment chairman Tom Rothman conceded that the marketing campaign did not work and said, [...] "Office Space isn't like American Pie. It doesn't {{have the kind of}} jokes you put in a 15-second television spot of somebody getting hit on the head with a frying pan. It's sly. And let me tell you, sly is hard to sell".|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} lack of pressurisation, the Mk VIII {{differed}} little from the Mk VII. Some early production models had extended wingtips but the majority were fitted with the standard version; according to Supermarine's Chief Test pilot Jeffrey Quill [...] "When I am asked which mark of Spitfire I consider the best from the flying point of view, I usually reply 'The Mark VIII with standard wingtips.' <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> extended wingtips...They were of no practical value to the Mark VIII and simply reduced the aileron response and the rate of roll." [...] There were three sub-variants for low altitude (LF Mk VIII), medium altitude (F Mk VIII) and high altitude (HF Mk VIII) which were powered respectively by the Merlin 66, Merlin 63 and Merlin 70 engines.|$|E

2500|$|As a teenager, Yorke's {{favourite}} artists included Queen, Joy Division, R.E.M., Siouxsie and the Banshees and Bob Dylan. He {{wrote that}} Mark Mulcahy of Miracle Legion had affected him [...] "a great deal" [...] at this time: [...] "It {{was the voice}} of someone who was only truly happy when he was singing... it changed the way I thought about songs and singing." [...] He has cited the Pixies, Björk and PJ Harvey as artists who [...] "changed his life", and in 2006 he told Pitchfork that Radiohead had [...] "ripped off R.E.M. blind for years". He cited Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante as an influence on his guitar playing for In Rainbows. In 2013, Yorke named the electronic artist Aphex Twin as his biggest influence, saying: [...] "He burns a heavy shadow... Aphex opened up another world that didn't involve my fucking electric guitar... I hated all the music that was around Radiohead at the time, it was completely fucking meaningless. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> Britpop thing and what was happening in America, but Aphex was totally beautiful, and he's kind of my age too." ...|$|E
