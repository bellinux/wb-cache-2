500|$|American {{producers}} Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Penelope Magnet, known {{collectively as}} RedZone Entertainment, presented Spears {{with the third}} song they had written and produced, [...] "Pop Culture Whore". While her management liked the track, she rejected it, telling them the song [...] "sucked". After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City to [...] "get in her world", as Magnet explained, {{it was easier to}} [...] "actually write and know what she would and wouldn't say, to know where her real vibe is". Stewart and Magnet began working on the first version of the song; Stewart came up with the track, while Magnet developed the melody on a piano and some of the lyrics. American producer The-Dream became involved after Stewart proposed him to work together on the track for Spears. He explained, [...] "I was just getting into the business. I'm in Atlanta, driving home in a '92 Cadillac, and I get the call [...] <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> and just screamed out joyous sounds." [...] During the recording sessions, Stewart recalls that the studio's air-conditioning died for three days, but Spears [...] "didn't complain or anything, and for me that shows she's where she is for a reason." ...|$|E
2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer. He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in to tell me that I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild. It's not the Grammys — it's the Academy Awards, which is different for a musician. Before I knew it, I was performing on the awards show with Little Richard. It was the year of Dirty Dancing, and they won.|$|E
60|$|I had finished. I had {{no further}} {{observations}} to make. <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the receiver, and crawled into bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Light's heartsome," [...] quo' {{the wife}} {{when she was}} {{stealing}} sheep. You see what a lamp <b>I</b> have <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> to lighten your paths, when you are idle enough to explore the combinations and relations of my ideas. 'Tis now as plain as a pike-staff, why a twenty-four gun battery was a metaphor I could readily employ.|$|R
5000|$|Mellencamp {{also told}} Gardner about his {{favorite}} part of the song, saying: [...] "I love the last part of it where she says, 'She asked me where I'd been, and I said <b>I</b> was <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> with some beggar in the sky.' I thought that was a beautiful line. 'I was <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> with God - I was trying to find God' is what he's saying. I guess you guys figured that out, right?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Americans {{were far}} more popular in Newfoundland than Canadians, so <b>I</b> was never <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> about the United States. There's {{always seemed to be}} a hang up with the Toronto {{cultural}} literati about the US. But that's never been the feeling in Newfoundland and Atlantic Canada." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't faint or fall or scream. I didn't feel glad or surprised. I didn't feel anything. I felt numb, just as I {{did when}} I heard Walter had enlisted. <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the {{receiver}} and turned round. Mother was standing in her doorway. She wore her old rose kimono, {{and her hair was}} hanging down her back in a long thick braid, and her eyes were shining. She looked just like a young girl.|$|E
6000|$|A bear, having spread him {{a notable}} feast, [...] Invited a famishing fox to the place. [...] "I've killed me," [...] quoth he, [...] "an edible beast [...] As ever {{distended}} the girdle of priest [...] With 'spread of religion,' or 'inward grace.' [...] To my den I conveyed her, [...] I bled her and flayed her, [...] <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> her skin to dry; [...] Then laid her naked, {{to keep her}} cool, [...] On a slab of ice from the frozen pool; [...] And there we will eat her--you and I." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{we went to}} work. I put up the stove, {{which was}} not much trouble, as {{there was a place}} all ready in the deck for the stove-pipe to be run through. Euphemia was {{somewhat}} surprised at the absence of a chimney, but I assured her that boats were very seldom built with chimneys. My dear little wife bustled about and arranged the pots and kettles on nails that I drove into the kitchen walls. Then she made the bed in the bed-room and <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> a looking-glass and a few little pictures that we had brought in our trunks.|$|E
60|$|Skinning a deer was, of course, new to me. I haggled {{the flesh}} {{somewhat}} and {{cut through the}} skin often, my knife-blade being much too small for such work. Finally I {{thought it would be}} enough for me to cut out the haunches, and then I got down to one haunch. It had bothered me how I was going to sever the joint, but to my great surprise I found there {{did not seem to be}} any connection between the bones. The haunch came out easily, and <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> it <b>up</b> on a branch while making a fire.|$|R
2500|$|However, Ellis, {{releasing}} a letter Monday evening {{that he sent}} Saturday to county Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Graf, denies violating the agreement. The letter, in part, states: [...] "As for Ms. Bradley and myself, that case was amicably closed April 1 and never violated by either party. As I told Ms. Jackson, I did mistakenly dial Ms. Bradley on her cell when trying to call someone with a very close number and I dialed too quickly...after four years, {{it was an old}} habit. Nothing was said and <b>I</b> immediately <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> when <b>I</b> realized my mistake. That happened one time in a month. I have said nothing to Ms. Bradley nor seen her in or out of the county workplace." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have just}} come back now with the closing in of autumn--to the city. <b>I</b> have <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> my hoe in my study; my spade is put away behind the piano. I have with me seven pounds of Paris Green that I had over. Anybody who wants it may have it. I didn't like to bury it for fear of its {{poisoning}} the ground. I didn't like to throw it away for fear of its destroying cattle. I was afraid to leave it in my summer place for fear that it might poison the tramps who generally break in in November. I have it with me now. I move it from room to room, as I hate to turn my back upon it. Anybody who wants it, I repeat, can have it.|$|R
60|$|My {{arrival at}} the village created some excitement; but I was plainly no longer {{regarded}} as a friend {{or one of the}} family. Runi was absent, and I looked forward to his return with no little apprehension; he would doubtless decide my fate. Kua-ko was also away. The others sat or stood about the great room, staring at me in silence. I took no notice, but merely asked for food, then for my hammock, which <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> in the old place, and lying down I fell into a doze. Runi made his appearance at dusk. I rose and greeted him, but he spoke no word and, until he went to his hammock, sat in sullen silence, ignoring my presence.|$|E
6000|$|An old {{shepherd}} of Chitterne relates that a family, or gang, of gipsies used {{to turn up}} {{from time}} to time at the village; he generally saw them at lambing-time, when one of the heads of the party with whom he was friendly would come round to see what he had to give them. On one occasion his gipsy friend appeared, and after some conversation on general subjects, asked him if he had anything in his way. [...] "No, nothing this time," [...] said the shepherd. [...] "Lambing was over two or three months ago and there's nothing left--no dead lamb. <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> a few cauls on a beam in the old shed, thinking they would do for the dogs, but forgot them and they went bad and then dried up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's strange. I {{was lying}} down here asleep {{about five minutes}} ago, with the door shut {{to keep out the}} weather, when the {{brushing}} of a woman's clothes over the heath-bushes just outside woke me up (for I don't sleep heavy), {{and at the same time}} I heard a sobbing or crying from the same woman. I opened my door and held out my lantern, and just as far as the light would reach I saw a woman: she turned her head when the light sheened on her, and then hurried on downhill. <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the lantern, and was curious enough to pull on my things and dog her a few steps, but I could see nothing of her any more. That was where I had been when you came up; and when I saw you I thought you were the same one." ...|$|E
60|$|The doctor drove away, and I {{went into}} the house, not {{choosing}} to linger outside and be grinned at by Thomas Wright. <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> my coat <b>up</b> {{in the hall and}} laid my bonnet carefully on the sitting-room table, having first dusted a clean place for it with my handkerchief. I longed to fall upon that house at once and clean it up, but I had to wait until the doctor came back with my wrapper. I could not clean house in my new suit and a silk shirtwaist.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Lana Del Rey, an American singer, {{received}} widespread {{attention when}} the music video for her single [...] "Video Games" [...] became a viral internet sensation. The music video for [...] "Video Games" [...] was directed and edited by Del Rey. It featured video clips of skateboarders, cartoons and shots from old movies, as well as paparazzi footage of De La Huerta falling down while intoxicated. When asked if she was upset about the video, De La Huerta stated; [...] "No, no. <b>I</b> don't get <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> about anything really. That's insignificant. I didn't really care." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1984, Lloyd Webber {{contacted}} Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, {{to propose}} a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux's book The Phantom of the Opera as a basis. They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw {{an effective way to}} make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: [...] "I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason <b>I</b> was <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> was because <b>I</b> was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!" ...|$|R
60|$|Finding {{that blue}} tits {{were among the}} {{visitors}} at the back, <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> some lumps of suet and a cocoa-nut to the twigs of the bushes. The suet was immediately attacked, but judging from the suspicious {{way in which they}} regarded the round brown object swinging in the wind, the Bath tits had never before been treated to a cocoa-nut. But though suspicious, it was plain that the singular object greatly excited their curiosity. On the second day they made the discovery that it was a new and delightful dish invented {{for the benefit of the}} blue tits, and from that time they were at it at all hours, coming and going from morning till night. There were six of them, and occasionally they were all there at once, each one anxious to secure a place, and never able when he got one to keep it longer than three or four seconds at a time. Looking upon them from an upper window, as they perched against and flitted round and round the suspended cocoa-nut, they looked like a gathering of very large pale-blue flies flitting round and feeding on medlar.|$|E
5000|$|Monday So <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the phone. And I screamed out loud. I felt {{so alone}} ...|$|E
50|$|Well, {{first of}} all, <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on him. I {{thought it was}} a crank call. His {{secretary}} was calling and I was like, 'Yeah, right.' Click. And then he called back personally and then talked to me, and I was just freaked out. I mean, who wouldn't be freaked out? Here's this eccentric American God living in the countryside of England, and he's calling me up in Austin, Texas, and saying he wants me to do the music for his film and he wants me to be in his film and he's famous and all that. I didn't even believe it.|$|E
60|$|About the {{beginning}} of August, as I said, I had finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3d of August I found the grapes <b>I</b> had <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began to take them down from the trees, {{and it was very}} happy that I did so; for the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried most of them home to my cave, but it began to rain; and from thence, which was the 14th of August, it rained more or less every day, till the middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for several days.|$|R
5000|$|I {{had just}} {{finished}} filming Last of the Red Hot Lovers when Bob called me one day at home. [...] "Sally, {{do you want to}} be in my picture after next?" [...] he asked. [...] "Only if it's a good part," [...] <b>I</b> said. He <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on me.Bob was as stubborn and arrogant as I was at the time, but the sad thing is that I cheated myself out of working with someone I loved so much, someone who made acting both fun and easy and who trusted his actors. Bob loved actors. Stars would line up to work for nothing for Bob Altman.|$|R
5000|$|One of the interrogators {{pulled out}} a thick black cable and swiped it at me. The first blow cut through my heels with a pain I had never experienced. I was being whipped! I tried to twist my body to deflect each blow to my feet. It hurt terribly. Every few seconds I felt excruciating pain... I don’t {{remember}} how many times my feet were whipped. I didn’t even {{have the strength to}} scream. I fainted and they took me down. When I came to <b>I</b> was <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> again and the sadistic whipping continued. About ten men took turns whipping me and they were relentless. When one got tired, the next immediately took over. I did not cry, I did not moan. Somehow I resigned myself to the thought that I was going to die. I can’t explain this feeling. I thought it could get no worse. I fainted again. I heard, [...] "Collapsed, collapsed! She fainted, she fainted! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{read about}} a {{training}} program a major studio had for grooming people for 'stardom.' Being naive about the system, I {{got on the phone}} and called the man in charge and asked if he would interview me, and he told me to come around to the studio," [...] Rhodes told TV Guide in 1968. [...] "I said, 'By the way, I think I should tell you that I am a Negro.' He said, 'Don't waste your time - we don't take Negroes in this program.' <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the phone. Almost tore the cradle off the thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Her 1964 saga The Keepers of the House {{was awarded}} the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The night she was called about the Pulitzer Prize, {{she thought it was}} a {{practical}} joke from a friend whose voice she thought she recognized. [...] "“I was awfully short-tempered that morning because I’d been up all night with one of my children,” Grau said...."So, I said to the voice I mistook, ‘yeah and I’m the Queen of England too,’ and <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on him.”" [...] The Pulitzer Prize committee member didn’t give up and called her publisher Alfred A. Knopf. “The news got to me, but that was very embarrassing.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{his first}} realizations and {{interest}} {{of an audience}} outside of the Saharan region, Moctar said in late 2014: [...] "“I first met (Christopher Kirkley of Sahel Sounds) on the mobile phone as he had called me ... It was a weird conversation, as I thought my cousin was pulling a joke on me so <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up.</b> This American guy calling me, saying he {{wanted to work with}} me for my music, it just couldn’t be real. He called me again and we talked. He came to visit me in my village and also sent me a lefthanded guitar, which is very hard to find in Niger. This guitar has crossed several African countries to arrive in my hands, I have been playing it ever since!" ...|$|E

I {{have not been able to}} figure your manner of executing the Cave of despair,[111] therefore it will be at any rate a novelty and surprise to me--I trust on the right side. I shall call upon you some morning shortly, early enough to catch you before you can get out--when we will proceed to the Academy. I think you must be suited with a good painting light in your Bay window.

5000|$|The {{first time}} he called <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on him because I {{thought it was a}} friend of mine who was given to {{practical}} jokes. Then he called back and convinced me it really was him, so Mark and I took the car to his office. While we were waiting outside to meet Hughes this scruffy-looking fellow came out of the building and began looking the car over; we thought from his appearance he must have been a janitor or something. Then he looked up at a window and shouted, 'This is it!' and several heads poked out to have a look. That scruffy-looking fellow was John Hughes, and the people in the window were his staff. Turned out it was between the Modena Spyder and a Porsche Turbo, and Hughes chose the Modena.|$|E

He has been in half a dozen oil-well propositions, selling stocks and leases. One time he caught three young fellows from Chicago and sold them a lease for several thousand dollars that wasn't worth a pinch of snuff. Then he started what he called the Yellow Pansy Extension. The regular Yellow Pansy was doing very well--hitting it up for about eight hundred barrels a day--and of course lots of people, including myself, thought that the Extension belonged to the same crowd.

Known throughout the West as the Mora Gunfighter, and by {{his brothers}} as the [...] "mean one" [...] or the [...] "black sheep", Tyrel is the fastest with a gun of the three brothers. He always thinks things through, never acting prior to planning things out. Wherever Tyrel goes, he seems to attract trouble, {{and sooner or later}} someone always tries to outdraw him, but never succeeds - by his own admission: [...] "Till the day <b>I</b> <b>hung</b> em <b>up,</b> <b>I</b> was the fastest gun alive." [...] And hes left enough bodies behind him to prove it. Compassionate to a fault, his sense of morals never leave him, and stands as a steady guide on his way west. In Santa Fe he is forced to kill Tom Sunday, a close friend whod gone bad after losing what he saw as his last chance to start a new life, which affects him deeply. Naive where women are concerned, he often seems like a shy schoolboy when facing a pretty girl. He becomes involved with and marries Drusilla Alvarado, the beautiful granddaughter of a rich Spanish don. In the film adaptations he is portrayed by Jeff Osterhage.|$|R

While Innerspeaker was recorded in a very structured manner with a designated time period to record, Parker recorded Lonerism in many different places around the world whilst touring with Tame Impala. Speaking about this, Parker revealed [...] "I've got a recording thing with me at the moment, I can do vocal takes and guitar takes wherever I am, so it's getting recorded all over the world. There's a guitar take in Vienna, or a vocal take in the aeroplane from Singapore to London. I've got my studio at home, so a lot is being done in Perth." ...|$|R
