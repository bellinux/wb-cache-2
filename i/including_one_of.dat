5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic {{fit on the}} morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am four days later at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in the minds of many, <b>including</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness {{are similar to those of}} uraemia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery.|$|E
5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, <b>including</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E
5|$|Excavations of Iron Age {{sites have}} {{recovered}} horse bones from ritual pits at a temple site near Cambridge, and around twenty Iron Age chariot burials have been found, <b>including</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> a woman discovered at Wetwang Slack.

Exceptions are the Ferrybridge and Newbridge chariots, which are the only ones found to have been buried intact. The Newbridge burial has been radiocarbon dated to 520–370BC, and the Ferrybridge burial is likely to be of similar date.|$|E

5|$|Following a 31-point {{season in}} 1930–31, Jackson led the NHL in scoring with 53 points in 1931–32.

Jackson's 28 goals that season was the most he would score in his career, and he {{was named to the}} NHL's First All-Star Team for the first time of his career. He added five goals in the 1932 playoffs, <b>including</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Toronto's six in the deciding game of the 1932 Stanley Cup Final, a 6–4 victory over the New York Rangers that clinched Toronto's first Stanley Cup championship since 1922.|$|E
5|$|Her oft {{worn-out}} {{and poor}} condition contributed to her being wrecked when in June 1809 she grounded on an uncharted shoal {{in the mouth}} of the River Plate, whilst seeking shelter with the rest of her squadron from a storm. All hands and most of the ship's stores were saved, but the condition of the ship's timbers made it impossible to free the ship; her captain was cleared of responsibility for the ship's loss thanks to documents detailing her defects. Recently, the wreck of Agamemnon has been located, and several artefacts have been recovered, <b>including</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her cannons.|$|E

Honeyman, at the time an art dealer, had assisted Hunter in developing his career, and painting the portrait {{may have been a}} gesture of thanks.|$|E

Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during the}} Ramesside period, statues of Old Kingdom pharaohs <b>including</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Nyuserre Ini {{were placed in}} a cachette (a hiding place) in the temple of Ptah in Memphis, {{suggesting}} their continued use for cultic purposes until that point. Concurrently with these activities, extensive restoration works in Abusir and Saqqara were undertaken {{during the reign of}} Ramses II under the direction of prince Khaemweset.
