25|$|Msiri {{was said}} to punish his enemies and other miscreants by {{mutilation}} (cutting off ears), burial up to the neck and being left to starve, or being shut up in a hut to be eaten by a pack of starving dogs. Execution by beheading was certainly carried out, as witnessed by the heads placed on poles. Ironically the Stairs expedition meted out the same treatment to Msiri himself (and Leopold's regime in the Congo Free State hung heads and bodies of villagers on fences {{as a warning to}} others of what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who did not fulfil their rubber quota).|$|E
25|$|In March 1879, Gessi had inflicted a sharp defeat on Zobeir {{even before}} Gordon had joined him {{to pursue their}} old enemy. After several months of chasing Zobeir, Gessi and Gordon met at the village of Shaka in June 1879 when {{it was agreed that}} Gessi would {{continue}} the hunt while Gordon would return to Khartoum. On 15 July 1879, Gessi finally captured Zobeir together with 250 of his men. As Zobeir had broken his oath to the khedive by rebelling, Gordon had given Gessi orders to execute Zobeir, and so later that day Gessi had Zobeir and his men publicity beheaded as an example of what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who broke their oaths.|$|E

25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was ever said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E

500|$|Shilts {{decided to}} write And the Band Played On after {{attending}} an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: [...] "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're Haitian." [...] Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it [...] "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go {{in front of a}} journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never something that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Battle of the Trench, the Jewish {{tribe of}} Banu Qurayza who were {{located at the}} south of Medina were charged with treachery. After the retreat of the coalition, Muslims besieged Banu Qurayza, the {{remaining}} major Jewish tribe in Medina. The Banu Qurayza surrendered and all the men, apart from a few who converted to Islam, were beheaded, while all {{the women and children}} were enslaved. In dealing with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina, aside from political explanations, Arab historians and biographers have explained it as [...] "the punishment of the Medina Jews, who were invited to convert and refused, perfectly exemplify the Quran's tales of what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who rejected the prophets of old." [...] F.E. Peters, a western scholar of Islam, states that Muhammad's treatment of Jews of Medina was essentially political being prompted by what Muhammad read as treasonous and not some transgression of the law of God. Peters adds that Muhammad was possibly emboldened by his military successes and also wanted to push his advantage. Economical motivations according to Peters also existed since the poorness of the Meccan migrants was a source of concern for Muhammad. Peters argues that Muhammad's treatment of the Jews of Medina was [...] "quite extraordinary", [...] "matched by nothing in the Qur'an", and is [...] "quite at odds with Muhammad's treatment of the Jews he encountered outside Medina." [...] According to Welch, Muhammad's treatment of the three major Jewish tribes brought Muhammad closer to his goal of organizing a community strictly on a religious basis. He adds that some Jews from other families were, however, allowed to remain in Medina.|$|E

2500|$|On an April 1 show in 2008, both Dennis and Callahan {{during a}} top ten April fools prank list made mention to a prank done by Opie and Anthony that {{caused them to}} be fired from WAAF, a Boston radio station. [...] The [...] "prank" [...] which they {{referred}} to was done because Opie & Anthony hated radio April fools pranks and felt they are only done by hack radio jocks. As a result, they made five false statements and admitted 4 of them were fake except for the fifth one in which they said the mayor had died after flipping his car on a bridge, the airborne car then went over the dividing jersey barrier and landed into the oncoming traffic lane where it {{was hit by a}} tractor trailer truck. They also said there was a hooker of African American descent in the passenger seat {{at the time of the}} accident. [...] During the Dennis and Callahan segment, Dennis asked [...] "Whatever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> guys?" [...] Callahan then said that they were working at McDonald's with a pedophile. [...] At the time Opie & Anthony had taken over Howard Stern's syndicated terrestrial radio spot (which was heard in basically every major city in the US), and was also broadcasting at the same time on Satellite radio. This insulted Opie & Anthony, which caused them to play the Dennis & Callahan clip on their air. [...] This ended up bringing national attention to the Ryen Russillo voicemail situation and also caused WEEI to take very few callers during all their shows because of the massive volume of Opie & Anthony fans calling in for weeks to let the station know where Opie & Anthony currently worked. Callers would also complain about the comments and disrespect [...] Dennis and Callahan show for a national show and would pester on air talent by swearing or pranking them causing them to dump out of many calls.|$|E
