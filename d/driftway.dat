50|$|In 1807 the {{directors}} of the company brought in Richard Trevithick who agreed to take the <b>driftway</b> across the river for a success fee of £1,000. Employing Cornish miners to dig and a 30-horsepower steam engine to pump, he eventually succeeded in making the <b>driftway</b> 313 metres from the Rotherhithe shaft: he had tunnelled under the Thames, albeit only beyond the low-water mark. This {{was the first time that}} anyone had made a tunnel pass underneath the actual water of any river. However, it remained to complete the excavation under the high-water mark, and this Trevithick was unable to do, owing to breakthroughs of quicksand.|$|E
5000|$|The Point {{is home to}} the Hunter House museum, the Rumbline Restaurant, and Saint John the Evangelist Anglican-Catholic Church.http://www.projo.com/ri/newport/content/HO_thepoint040608_04-06-08_1J9HNBR_v22.28b0b96.html The old docks {{disappeared}} at the end of {{the streets}} but the <b>driftways</b> remained, allowing public access to the harbor for boaters.https://web.archive.org/web/20080709010548/http://oceandrivenewport.com:80/HarborWalk/north/HarborWalkNorth.htm ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was driven}} through mostly Millstone Grit, {{interspersed}} in places by patches of argillaceous shale and softer sandstone on a gradient of 1 in 201, rising toward the east. Wires were suspended down each shaft {{from which the}} centre line was determined {{by means of a}} theodolite. The accuracy was such that the <b>driftways</b> met with less than three inches of error.|$|R
5000|$|Amongst [...] "locally listed buildings" [...] are two estate cottages (<b>Driftways</b> and Crossways) {{near the}} Driftbridge, both built about 1890, and West Lodge, a flint-built {{gatehouse}} for Nork House on the Reigate Road. A pair of 19th-century stone gate piers standing incongruously {{at the south}} end of Ruden Way are also from an entrance to the Nork Park estate. The former Drift Bridge Hotel (see next section) is locally listed partly because the teak used in its 1931 construction came from HMS Ganges, the Royal Navy's last sail-powered flagship.|$|R
50|$|Hollow Way {{is a major}} {{arterial}} road in Oxford which leads from central Cowley to Wood Farm and Headington. It starts at the junction with Oxford Road and Garsington Road and finishes at The Slade and Horspath <b>Driftway.</b> It is often congested. Its route number is B4495.|$|E
50|$|Vignoles {{set to work}} on {{the tunnel}} {{arranging}} for it to be marked over the ridge and for the boring of a series of vertical shafts followed by a horizontal <b>driftway</b> along the line of the first bore. Enough land was purchased for two tunnels but only one would be built initially.|$|E
50|$|Vignoles {{began work}} {{as soon as}} the line {{obtained}} its Act of Incorporation in Parliament in 1837. First the line was marked over the ridge and a series of vertical shafts were bored. From the bases of these, a horizontal <b>driftway</b> was driven along the line of the first bore. Although sufficient land had been purchased for two tunnels, only one would be built initially.|$|E
2500|$|The {{definition}} of a road depends on the {{definition of}} a highway; there is no formal definition for a highway in the relevant Act. A 1984 ruling said [...] "the land over which a public right of way exists is known as a highway; and although most highways have been made up into roads, and most easements of way exist over footpaths, {{the presence or absence of}} a made road has nothing to do with the distinction. Another legal view is that while a highway historically included footpaths, bridleways, <b>driftways,</b> etc., it can now be used to mean those ways that allow the movement of motor-vehicles, and the term rights of way can be used to cover the wider usage.|$|R
5000|$|The Capt. Benjamin James House is a {{historic}} First Period house, now a museum, at 301 <b>Driftway</b> in Scituate, Massachusetts. The oldest part of this 2-1/2 story timber frame house was built c. 1700 by Captain Benjamin James. During the 18th century it was enlarged to its present five-bay saltbox configuration. After James' death in 1788, the house {{was used by the}} town as a [...] "pest house", isolating smallpox victims there.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea was}} to bore a pilot tunnel or 'driftway' {{starting}} from a shaft to be sunk in Rotherhithe (i.e. from the south bank). The <b>driftway</b> was supposed to drain the surrounding bedrock and then be enlarged into a full, brick-arched tunnel which would accommodate two-way vehicular traffic. Unfortunately the firm strata anticipated were mostly sand and gravel with pockets of quicksand. After a year Vazie had only driven a shaft 12.8 m deep and money was running out.|$|E
50|$|Londonderry {{is located}} in the northernmost part of the City of Penrith with the <b>Driftway</b> forming the {{boundary}} with the Hawkesbury City Council area. The Northern Road divides Londonderry from Berkshire Park while Cranebrook and Agnes Banks are its boundaries on its southern and western sides. Londonderry is a rural area and much of it still crown land. Because of its closeness to Richmond and distance from Penrith, the suburb has always had stronger links with Richmond than with Penrith.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the other}} {{stations}} on the line, Greenbush {{has a single}} high full-length side platform serving a single passenger track. The other four tracks at the station area are used as the layover facility for the line. There are two large parking lots cut into two by Old <b>Driftway.</b> The parking lots total 1000 spaces - twice {{the capacity of the}} other stations on the line - to accommodate commuters driving in from Hanover, Norwell, Marshfield, and Duxbury. With 527 boardings on an average weekday by a 2013 count, Greenbush is the busiest station on the line.|$|E
50|$|The Metropolitan Board of Works, {{set up in}} 1855 {{to provide}} a sewer system for London, was also {{responsible}} for improving roads and this was when the Roman Road, {{as it was called}} from the start, was built, on the <b>Driftway,</b> extending Bethnal Green Road and Green Street eastwards. It was paid for by local residents and public and private sources. In the 1870s, there were discussions about extending the Roman Road to Stratford, but this was not to be. In the 1930s, Bethnal Green's Green Street was merged into the Roman Road - and all the shop and house numbers were changed accordingly.|$|E
50|$|The North River is {{a popular}} river for kayakers {{as well as for}} small boats. There are several {{locations}} to load into the water. One at Bridge Street in Norwell, Union Street in Marshfield, Chittenden Lane in Norwell, <b>Driftway</b> Park in Scituate and upriver on the Indian Head River a tributary to the North River in Hanover off Indian Head Drive. The North and South Rivers Watershed Association has a kayak guide and map explaining more about using the rivers. Tide is a major factor in determining timing of putting in and taking out. The North and South Rivers Watershed Association has an offset tide table for different locations along the river. Public parking is available at these locations.|$|E
50|$|The modern Greenbush Line was {{originally}} built as the South Shore Railroad, which opened to Cohasset in 1849. The Old Colony-backed Duxbury and Cohasset Railroad, chartered in 1867, which opened from Cohasset to Duxbury in 1871, including {{a stop at}} North Scituate. Three other stations were, at various times, located in Scituate: Egypt station at Captain Pierce Road, Scituate (also called Scituate Harbor) at First Parish Road, and Greenbush at <b>Driftway.</b> After financial troubles in the 1870s, the Duxbury and Cohasset was joined with the South Shore under the fold of the Old Colony Railroad in 1877. The Old Colony was leased to the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad in 1893.|$|E
5000|$|In 1805 Robert Vazie, another Cornish engineer, was {{selected}} by the Thames Archway Company to drive a tunnel under the River Thames at Rotherhithe. Vazie encountered serious problems with water influx and got no further than sinking the end shafts when the directors called in Trevithick for consultation. The directors agreed to pay Trevithick £1000 (the equivalent of £ in [...] ) if he could successfully complete the tunnel, a length of 1220 ft. In August 1807 Trevithick began driving a small pilot tunnel or <b>driftway</b> 5 ft high tapering from 2 ft at the top to 3 ft at the bottom. By 23 December after it had progressed 950 ft progress was delayed after a sudden inrush of water and only one month later on 26 January 1808, at 1040 ft, a more serious inrush occurred. The tunnel was flooded and Trevithick, being the last to leave, was nearly drowned. Clay was dumped on the river bed to seal the hole and the tunnel was drained but mining was now more difficult. Progress stalled {{and a few of}} the directors attempted to discredit Trevithick but the quality of his work was eventually upheld by two colliery engineers from the North of England. Despite suggesting various building techniques to complete the project, including a submerged cast iron tube, Trevithick's links with the company ceased and the project was never actually completed.|$|E
