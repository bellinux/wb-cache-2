5|$|The 1968 presidential {{campaign}} of Richard Nixon, the 36th Vice President of the United States, began when Nixon, the Republican nominee of 1960, formally announced his candidacy following a year's preparation and five years' political reorganization following defeats in the 1960 presidential <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 1962 California gubernatorial election.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{received}} 1,481 {{votes in}} the election, over 400 more than his nearest competitor, making {{it the first time}} that Fayette County had elected a Democrat to the state House of Representatives. Between the <b>election</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> legislative session, Breckinridge formed a new law partnership with Owsley's former Secretary of State, George B. Kinkead; his previous partner having died in a cholera epidemic earlier in the year. He also co-founded the Kentucky Statesman, a semi-weekly Democratic newspaper, and visited his cousin, Mary Todd, where he met her husband, Abraham Lincoln, for the first time; despite their political differences, they became friends.|$|E

5|$|By April 2010 {{almost five}} {{years had passed since}} the {{previous}} general election (held on 5 May 2005), requiring a fresh election to take place. On 6 April 2010 Brown went to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April in preparation for a general election. In a live press conference at Downing Street, Brown announced the election would be held on 6 May. The time between the announcement of the <b>election</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dissolution of Parliament, known as wash-up, was to allow for the handling of any unfinished legislative business before the Parliamentary session's conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Claiborne and Haw {{promoted}} Jesus for President {{by going}} on a U.S. speaking tour of 30 cities. The tour {{led up to the}} 2008 United States presidential <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> book tour was suggestive of a third party candidate campaign for Jesus. The authors' speeches did not attempt to sway their audiences towards or away from any particular candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse whichever candidates supported Christian values.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{review of}} {{parliamentary}} representation in Cambridgeshire in 2005, the Boundary Commission for England made minor alterations {{to the existing}} constituencies to deal with population changes. The electoral wards used to create the modified Peterborough constituency fought at the 2010 general <b>election</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 2015 general election were: Bretton North, Bretton South, Central, Dogsthorpe, East, Eye and Thorney, Newborough, North, Park, Paston, Ravensthorpe, Walton, Werrington North, Werrington South, and West. These changes increased the electorate from 64,893 to 70,640. On the enumeration date of 17 February 2000, the electoral quota for England was 69,934 voters per constituency.|$|E

5|$|Lampugnano, {{unfortunately}} for the Guelphs, was considered a martyr for the Republic. This was made worse {{by the fact that}} the Guelphs in leadership refused to run elections in April, until in June they were forced by the populace. Ghibelline families took the reins of Milan in this <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Guelphs were defeated. However, the reprisals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had been blamed (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs. Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano was killed in the uprising, departed Milan for Crema, hoping to make peace with Sforza.|$|E

On the 31st, Ramphele stated {{that she would not}} take up DA party membership and would remain the leader of Agang South Africa, resulting in confusion. On 2 February, Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to stand as the DA's presidential candidate. Ramphele subsequently apologised for the reversal of her decision, saying that the timing was not right as the reaction to it had shown people were unable to overcome race-based party politics.|$|E

The pair discuss the presence of sexism in the 2008 United States presidential <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> differences between Palin and Clinton. Governor Palin was the Republican Party vice-presidential nominee and Senator Clinton was a contender for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. Through {{the course of the}} message, Palin tries to present herself as the candidate for the job, and Clinton gets progressively more and more disgusted at Palin's sudden rise to fame as John McCain's running mate, despite her background. It also features references to Clinton's campaign.|$|E
5|$|The reform {{legislation}} for the Legislative Council {{was not to}} take effect until the next <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> death of LCL MLC Harold Kemp necessitated a by-election for the council district of Southern on 11 August. Southern was an ultra-safe rural LCL seat, and Labor declined {{to stand in the}} by-election. It was contested by the LCL, the LM, a separate Country Party and the Australia Party. The three non-LCL parties agreed on favourable preference deals in the hope of one of them displacing the LCL. The LM gained 29 per cent of the vote, and the LCL candidate won by a 4 per cent margin once preferences had been distributed.|$|E

5|$|After Dunstan's {{resignation}} from parliament, deputy Des Corcoran {{took his}} place as party leader and Premier. At the subsequent Norwood by-election, Dunstan's seat was retained by Labor. Corcoran soon called the 1979 election. Corcoran's lack of media savvy, the Advertisers bias towards the Liberals at this <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> public's widespread dissatisfaction with the economy and bus strikes, brought about an 8.4 percent two-party swing against Labor, leaving the party with only 19 seats against the Liberals on 25 seats. The Tonkin Liberal Government came to power and began reducing {{the size of the}} public service and abandoned the Monarto project. Dunstan took a trip to Europe after being released from hospital, staying in Perugia for five months and pursuing Italian studies. He subsequently returned home and lived quietly in Adelaide for three years without finding work that appealed to him, such as that related to the shaping of public policy.|$|E
5|$|Coimbatore is a Municipal {{corporation}} {{administered by}} the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation and is the administrative headquarters of Coimbatore district] Coimbatore was established as the capital of Coimbatore district in 1804 and in 1866 it was accorded municipality status. In 1981, Coimbatore was elevated as a municipal corporation. The city is divided into five administrative zones – East, West, North, South and Central, each further subdivided into 20 wards. Each ward is represented by a councillor who is elected by direct <b>election</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mayor of Coimbatore is elected by Councillors. The executive wing of the corporation is headed by a Corporation Commissioner and maintains basic services like water supply, sewage and roads. The district itself is {{administered by the}} District collector and the district court in Coimbatore is the highest court of appeal in the district. The Coimbatore City Police is headed by a Commissioner and there are 18 police stations in the city.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey was Archdeacon of Lincoln in {{the diocese}} of Lincoln by September 1171, and {{probably}} retained that office until he was confirmed as bishop-elect in 1175. He also held a prebend, an income from land owned by a cathedral chapter, in {{the diocese of}} London, {{but there is little}} evidence that he executed the duties of either office. There are some indications that he studied canon law at a school in Northampton, and that he taught in Paris during the early 1170s. He also acted as a papal judge-delegate at that time. Pope Alexander III initially refused to confirm Geoffrey's selection as Bishop of Lincoln in about May 1173, prompting Geoffrey to travel to Rome in October 1174 to secure confirmation of this office. He was confirmed in the office of bishop by July 1175, but he was not ordained at that time, as he was under the canonical age for holding a bishopric. Geoffrey's youth was one of Alexander's objections to Geoffrey's <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pope only confirmed the office under duress. Another potential problem was Geoffrey's illegitimacy, which normally disbarred a person from holding ecclesiastical office, but that was dealt with by the granting of a papal dispensation.|$|E

5|$|In April, the General Assembly {{called a}} border states {{convention}} {{to be held}} in Frankfort in May. Slates of delegates were nominated by both the Unionists and Southern Rightists, but war broke out before the election of delegates; the Southern Rights delegates withdrew from the <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Unionist slate, including Crittenden, was chosen by default. On May 27, 1861, Crittenden was chosen chair of the convention and called it to order. With war having largely precluded any good the meeting could have accomplished, only nine of Kentucky's twelve delegates were present, along with four from Missouri (out of seven elected), and one from Tennessee (and his election was questionable); Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware sent no delegates. Ultimately, the convention accomplished little beyond calling on the southern states to reconsider their secession and on the northern states to moderate their demands.|$|E
5|$|In September 1201 one of Coutances' suffragan bishops, Lisiard, the Bishop of Sées died. King John objected {{when the}} cathedral chapter {{attempted}} to elect {{one of their}} own members as his successor. Coutances refused to recognise the result of the <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chapter divided into two parties, one favouring the elected chapter member, the other party another choice. Both parties appealed to the papacy, who eventually approved of the election of the Archdeacon of Sées, Silvester. Coutances had the right to consecrate the bishop however, and he refused to do so, arguing that the king's choice had been disregarded. Pope Innocent III then ordered another Norman archbishop to consecrate Silvester, but the king refused to allow Silvester to take possession of his see. This led Innocent to order Normandy laid under an interdict, but eventually Silvester was allowed to take possession of Sees.|$|E
5|$|In early October 2006, Baird's {{department}} reviewed a promised $200 {{million grant}} to the City of Ottawa's light-rail expansion {{project for the}} O-Train. Baird indicated {{that the government would}} keep the funding at least until the November election, but added that the Council elected in November would have the final say on the issue. He also leaked details of the city's contact with the German firm Siemens. As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome. Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project, and Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird's decision to release details of the private contract. Chiarelli was defeated in the <b>election</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.|$|E
