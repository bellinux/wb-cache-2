The extraction and separation properties of both ligands are tested by two phase liquid-liquid extraction at different acid concentrations. In contrast to nPr-BTP the bisdiazinyl ligand <b>Et-BDP</b> is prone to protonation at nitric acid concentrations of 0. 2 M and higher. A separation factor of SFAm/Eu ≈ 5 is obtained using <b>Et-BDP</b> as extracting ligand and with nPr-tetrazine a SFAm/Eu of 9. 1 is realized. Hereby 2 -bromodecanoic acid as lipophilic anion source is needed...|$|E
