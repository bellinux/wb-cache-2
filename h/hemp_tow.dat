50|$|Founded in 1824 by sailor captain Georg Gleistein {{as well as}} {{his oldest}} son Johann, Georg Gleistein & son started out with 12 workers {{converting}} natural fibers (<b>hemp,</b> <b>tow)</b> manually into ropes. Equipped were freight- and riverboats, shipping companies and farmers.|$|E
50|$|The {{general rule}} in English law {{is that if}} one party to the {{contract}} is mistaken about {{the terms of the}} contract, this is not an excuse to fail to perform, the classic case being Smith v Hughes. There has been debate about whether at any point courts do in fact have regard to the subjective intentions of the parties. In Scriven Bros & Co v Hindley & Co Scriven Bros made a bid at an auction (the auctioneer was trading as Hindley & Co) for bales of <b>hemp</b> and <b>tow.</b> The auction catalogue suggested that one of the batches contained both <b>hemp</b> and <b>tow.</b> But it only contained tow. When the auctioneer tried to enforce the high bid by Scriven Bros, Lawrence J held he could not, because the sale had been procured by the auctioneer's own negligence. Guenter Treitel has argued that the case is best explained on the basis that the court will have regard to the subjective intentions of the parties - that in fact <b>hemp</b> and <b>tow</b> was being contracted for. But Ewan McKendrick argues that this case is still explicable through taking an objective approach to the parties expressed wishes: a reasonable person in Hindley's position would not have thought there was a contract with someone misled by their negligently prepared auction catalogue.|$|R

50|$|Watts {{started work}} on Physical Energy in 1883. The {{original}} 3.5 ton gesso grosso model (made of plaster mixed with glue size and <b>hemp</b> or <b>tow)</b> {{is at the}} Watts Gallery at Compton near Guildford. He was assisted by George Thompson and Louis Deuchars. The sculpture depicts a classical naked man on a rearing horse, set on a rectangular wedge-shaped base. His left hand holds the reins, while he shades {{his eyes from the}} sun with the right as he looks to the left. It was originally intended to be dedicated to Muhammad, Attila, Tamerlane and Genghis Khan, thought by Watts to epitomise the raw energetic will to power.|$|R
5000|$|The {{workplaces}} {{to which}} the act applies are, first, [...] " [...] factories [...] " [...] and [...] " [...] workshops [...] "; secondly, laundries, docks, wharves, &c., enumerated above as introduced and regulated partially only by the act of 1895 and subsequent acts. Apart from this secondary list, and having regard to workplaces which remain undefined by the law, the act may broadly be said to apply to premises, rooms or places in which manual labour, {{with or without the}} aid of mechanical power, is exercised for gain in or incidental to the making, altering, repairing, ornamenting, washing, cleaning or finishing or adapting for sale of any article or part of any article. If steam, water or other mechanical power is used in aid of the manufacturing process, the workplace is a factory; if not, it is a workshop. There is, however, a list of eighteen classes of works (brought under the factory law for reasons of safety, etc., before workshops generally were regulated) which are defined as factories whether power is used in them or not. Factories are, again, subdivided into textile and non-textile: they are textile if the machinery is employed in preparing, manufacturing or finishing cotton, wool, hair, silk, flax, <b>hemp,</b> jute, <b>tow,</b> China grass, coconut fibre or other like material either separately or mixed together, or mixed with any other material, or any fabric made thereof; all other factories are non-textile. The distinction turns on the historical origin of factory regulation and the regulations in textile factories remain in some respects slightly more stringent than in the non-textile factories and workshops, though the general provisions are almost the same. Three special classes of workshops have for certain purposes to be distinguished from ordinary workshops, which include tenement workshops: ...|$|R
