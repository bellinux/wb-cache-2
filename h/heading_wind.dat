40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} model test {{research}} of a semisubmersible floating wind turbine. An improved method is proposed {{to correct the}} deficient thrust force in a Froude-scale experimental condition, which is able to simulate the rotor operational state more realistically by allowing the rotor to rotate freely with the wind. This approach also maintains tip speed ratio to some extent and overcomes previously reported negative effects produced by common correction ways. Reduced platform resonant motions {{in the presence of}} wind force are observed. Due to rotor rotation, resonant yaw and roll motions are induced even in <b>heading</b> <b>wind</b> and wave state. Tower vibration is found to be suppressed by the wind force. Multi-frequencies components are observed in the response of tower-top shear force, which is governed by the couplings of hydrodynamic loads, aerodynamic loads and tower vibration. It is also found that the dynamic response of the mooring line is mainly dominated by wave load and aerodynamic effect can be simplified as an extra constant force...|$|E
40|$|Human being {{can easily}} acquire {{information}} by showing the object than reading {{the description of}} it. Our brain stores images that the eyes are seeing and by the brain mapping, people can analyze information by imagination in the brain. This {{is the reason why}} visualization is important and powerful. It helps people remember the scene later. Visualization transforms the symbolic into the geometric, enabling researchers to observe their simulations and computations (Flurchick, 2001). As a consequence, many computer scientists and programmers take their time to build better visualization of the data for users. For the flight data from an aircraft, it is better to understand data in 3 D computer graphics rather than to look at mere numbers. The flight data consists of several fields such as elapsed time, latitude, longitude, altitude, ground speed, roll angle, pitch angle, <b>heading,</b> <b>wind</b> speed, and so on. With these data variables, filtering is the first process for visualization in order to gather important information. The collection of processed data is transformed to 3 D graphics form to be rendered by generating Keyhole Mark-up Language (KML) files in the system. KML is an XML grammar and file format for modeling and storing geographic features such as points, lines, images, polygons, and models for display in Google Earth or Google Maps. Like HTML, KML has a tag-based structure with names and attributes used for specific display purposes. In the present work, new approaches to visualize flight using Google Earth are developed. Because of the limitation of the Google Earth API, the Great Circle Distance calculation and trigonometric functions are implemented to handle the position, angles of roll and pitch, and a range of the camera positions to generate several points of view. Currently, visual representation of flight data depends on 2 D graphics although an aircraft flies in a 3 D space. The graphical interface allows flight analysts to create ground traces in 2 D, and flight 2 ̆ 2 ribbons 2 ̆ 2 and flight 2 ̆ 2 paths with altitude 2 ̆ 2 in 3 D. Additionally, by incorporating weather information, fog and clouds can also be generated as part of the animation effects. With 3 D stereoscopic technique, a realistic visual representation of the flights is realized...|$|E

Vibration is normally more easily excited by waves {{in ballast condition}} than in cargo condition. The converse may also be true since some ships experience more <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> and waves in ballast conditions, while other ships may experience more <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> and waves in cargo condition, thereby vibrating less overall.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of head-wind profiles and mean head-wind velocities on runway landing capacity for airplanes flying constant-airspeed and constant-groundspeed approaches. It was determined that when the wind profiles were encountered with the currently used constant airspeed approach method, the landing capacity was reduced. The severity of these reductions increased as the mean head-wind value of the profile increased. When constant-groundspeed approaches were made in the same wind profiles, there were no losses in landing capacity. In an analysis of mean <b>head</b> <b>winds,</b> it was determined that in a mean <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> of 35 knots, the landing capacity using constant-airspeed approaches was 13 % less than for the no wind condition. There were no reductions in landing capacity with constant-groundspeed approaches for mean <b>head</b> <b>winds</b> less than 35 knots. This same result was observed when the separation intervals between airplanes was reduced...|$|R

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} equations {{of motion}} with wind shear terms were {{used to analyze the}} stability and motions of a jet transport. A positive wind shear gives a decreasing <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> or changes a <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> into a tail wind. A negative wind shear gives a decreasing tail wind or changes a tail <b>wind</b> into a <b>head</b> <b>wind.</b> It was found that wind shear had very little effect on the short period mode and that negative wind shear, although it affected the phugoid, did not cause stability problems. On the other hand, it was found that positive wind shear can cause the phugoid to become aperiodic and unstable. In this case, a stability boundary for the phugoid was found that is valid for most aircraft at all flight speeds. Calculations of aircraft motions confirmed the results of the stability analysis. It was found that a flight path control automatic pilot and an airspeed control system provide good control in all types of wind shear. Appendixes give {{equations of motion}} that include the effects of downdrafts and updrafts and extend the longitudinal equations of motion for shear to six degrees of freedom...|$|R
