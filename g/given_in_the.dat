40|$|Giving {{has been}} a {{traditional}} moral act in various societies and religions. The primary purposes {{of this research is}} investigating American attitudes toward philanthropy and charity, and analyzing <b>the</b> role of <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Through the previous studies of giving by American researchers, we can realize that giving has been one of crucial elements for American society and culture. I make two main points on <b>the</b> features of <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States <b>in</b> this article. First, the influence of philanthropy and charity on constructing democratic society. Since giving is mainly conducted by individuals, givers advocate their moral values on social issues through philanthropic and charitable activities. The second point is that the religious background of American culture is closely linked to <b>the</b> development of <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The Puritan concept of becoming a leading model for the world, and Christian mission of charity, both continue to influence <b>the</b> way of <b>giving</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Hence, philanthropy and charity are key factors to sustain a democratic society and continue legacy of the ideal American image in a multicultural society...|$|R

5|$|Herbals {{contributed to}} botany by setting in train {{the science of}} plant description, classification, and botanical illustration.

These were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions <b>given</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Floras. The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine.|$|E
