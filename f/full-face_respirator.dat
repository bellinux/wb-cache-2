40|$|Respirators are {{commonly}} used to protect workers against workplace airborne contaminants, but this equipment may become a safety hazard by creating discomfort, disorientation and postural instability. Although postural stability is critical to workers, especially those working near moving objects or on surfaces where a loss of balance may become life threatening, {{little attention has been}} given to the effect of respirators on wearers’ postural stability. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of wearing a half-mask respirator, a <b>full-face</b> <b>respirator,</b> a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), and no-respirator on postural stability, using computerized dynamic posturography (CDP). The subjects’perception of comfort was also assessed. Over 60 % of the subjects reported that wearing a respirator was uncomfortable and 20 % felt that they had difficulty balancing while wearing the SCBA. The half-mask respirators, full-face respirators or SCBA did not produce any differences in postural stability over a baseline (no-respirator). However, the subjects expressed concerns with comfort...|$|E

Viral hemorrhagic fevers are important because they can readily spread within a hospital or mortuary setting, there is no effective cure or vaccine, they have a high mortality rate and they are difficult to recognize and diagnose rapidly. WHO has recommended respiratory protection for HCWs performing certain tasks such as aerosol-generating procedures, laboratory procedures, and autopsies. Particulate respirators {{are designed to help}} reduce the wearer’s exposure to certain airborne particles. The most effective way to block aerosolized particles is to use either a half-face or a <b>full-face</b> <b>respirator.</b> HCWs still need shoe covers, a full face respirator and latex or nitrile gloves to decrease the risk of Ebola virus contamination...|$|E

50|$|Since 1993, sodium ethyl {{xanthate}} {{is classified}} as a Priority Existing Chemical in Australia, meaning that its manufacture, handling, storage, use or disposal may result in adverse health or environment effects. This decision was justified by {{the widespread use of}} the chemical in industry and its decomposition to the toxic and flammable carbon disulfide gas. From two examples of sodium ethyl xanthate spillage in Australia, one resulted in evacuation of 100 people and hospitalization of 6 workers who were exposed to the fumes. In another accident, residents of the spillage area complained of headache, dizziness and nausea. Consequently, during high-risk sodium ethyl xanthate handling operations, workers are required by the Australian regulations to be equipped with protective clothing, anti-static gloves, boots and <b>full-face</b> <b>respirators</b> or self-contained breathing apparatus.|$|R
40|$|Florida International University's (FIU) Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) {{evaluated}} five saws {{for their}} effectiveness in cutting specially prepared fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. These crates were built as surrogates for crates that presently hold radioactively contaminated gloveboxes at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos facility. The Evolution 180 circular saw was assessed on August 14, 2001. During the FIU test of efficacy, {{a team from}} the Operating Engineers National Hazmat Program (OENHP) evaluated {{the occupational safety and}} health issues associated with this technology. The Evolution 180 is a portable, metal cutting circular saw with a 7 -inch diameter blade. The blade is contained within the main housing and has a retractable lower blade guard to prevent operator access to the blade during operation and shutdown. The saw is equipped with a chip collector. The maximum cutting thickness for metal is one-quarter inch and can cut steel tubing and pipe 2 inches in diameter. The unit is operated with an on/off guarded trigger switch and is supported with the hand guide mounted to the side of the saw. An adjustable lever sets the depth of the cut. The machine's circuitry will automatically shut the saw motor off if excessive overload is detected during operation. The one-half hour demonstration involved vertical and horizontal cuts and blade changes. During this process, operators experienced binding of the saw. This caused the blade to become hot, causing the sawdust collected in the chip collector to smoke. Care should be exercised to use the appropriate blade for the application, operator training, and personal protective equipment (PPE). Personal noise sampling indicated that neither worker was over the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Action Level of 85 decibels (dBA) with time-weighted averages (TWA's) of 69. 1 and 68. 8 dBA. The personal noise sample taken during the special demonstration with the stainless steel plate had a TWA of 69. 8 dBA. These data are not entirely representative as they were gathered during a simulation and not at the actual worksite. Additional sampling should be conducted on-site, but the workers should wear hearing protection until it is determined that it is no longer necessary. The total nuisance dust sample for the Evolution 180 circular saw was 3. 5 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m{sup 3 }), which is lower than the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 15 mg/m{sup 3 } and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists' (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 10 mg/m{sup 3 }. The fiber analysis yielded 1. 74 fibers per cubic centimeter (f/cc), which is above the PEL of 1 f/cc. Although the nuisance dust levels were low, fiberglass dust levels were higher than the PEL. Since fiberglass dust is known to be a strong skin irritant and a possible human carcinogen, the workers should continue to wear appropriate suits and gloves, as well as a <b>full-face</b> air-purifying <b>respirator.</b> The respirator should be equipped with a combination organic vapor and acid gas cartridge in combination with a High Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, since particulate filter, since during the demonstration, the workers complained of an odd smell, which may have been from the breakdown of the fiberglass...|$|R
40|$|Wildland fire {{suppression}} personnel {{employed by the}} CDF do not currently have the equipment {{to protect themselves from}} the short-term acute affects of smoke from wildland fires. In addition, no regulations exist that specify appropriate respiratory protection and the current air-purifying respirator technology and carbon monoxide monitoring has not been adapted to fit wildland {{fire suppression}} requirements. This three-year limited study evaluated the ability of wildland fire fighters to perform their normal job function while wearing full-face air-purifying respirators. In {{the first two years of}} this study we designed, developed and field tested a prototype ``smart`` air-purifying respirator which incorporated a real-time carbon monoxide monitor into a commercial <b>full-face</b> <b>respirator.</b> ` Data on carbon monoxide exposure while fighting wildland fires was collected. During the third year of this study we evaluated eight different commercially available full-face air-purifying respirators equipped with a variety of cartridges. Apparatus to aid the fire fighter in carrying the respirator and carbon monoxide personal monitor was designed and fabricated. A smoke exposure test method was developed and a laboratory study on the penetration of smoke through respirator cartridges was conducted...|$|E
40|$|Possible work {{decrements}} {{caused by}} respirator usage were examined. A battery of physical, cognitive and psychomotor tasks {{were used to}} investigate the effects of respirator wear on twelve subjects. A repeated measures experimental design was used to {{study the effects of}} three types of respirators: a disposable dust mask, an air purifying half-mask and a full-face airline. Performance while wearing a mask was compared to the control condition without a respirator. The psychomotor task test methods appear to be the best indicators of respiratory effects on work performance decrement. A steadiness task showed a 31 % decrement for the <b>full-face</b> <b>respirator.</b> The One-Hole Test, which includes a number of measurement variables, indicated an average movement time decrement of 16 %. The other One-Hole Test indicators also showed decrements, but were lower and not statistically significant. The results from the physical work task of bicycle riding indicated approximately a 10 % increase in oxygen consumption with the half and full face masks, supporting previous physiological findings. The results indicate that the respirators did not significantly affect the performance of cognitive tasks. In general, respirators can be shown to produce an increase in oxygen consumption for physical tasks and decrements in psychomotor performance with regard to hand movement speed and steadiness...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} a custom fit personal protective equipment (PPE) program aimed at reducing occupational exposure to pesticides. The intervention study was carried out on 15 pest control operators (PCOs) during mixing/loading and application of chlorpyrifos. Each worker was measured twice; first while the worker used PPE as normal (baseline measurement), and second after making some adjustments to the PPE (postintervention measurement). The applied intervention consisted of a tight-fitting, <b>full-face</b> <b>respirator,</b> fit-testing, long gloves, chemical-proof boots, a Tyvek® hood, and an instruction video that was shown prior to putting on the PPE. A comprehensive evaluation program was used for the within-subject comparisons, including assessment of potential dermal exposure, actual dermal exposure, inhalation exposure, and internal dose as measured by the urinary metabolite 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol (TCP). The PPE program resulted in a significant increase in fit factors from a mean of 670 to 132, 000. Actual dermal exposure levels decreased on average by fourfold after implementation of the PPE program (baseline AM = 132. 1 μg; postintervention AM = 32. 6 μg). The TCP levels in urine collected 24 - 32 hours after spray activities were lower in the postintervention data set (AM = 21. 2 μg TCP/g creatinine vs. AM = 13. 9 μg TCP/g creatinine). However, it is impossible to attribute these differences totally to the PPE program since workers had significant and varying urinary TCP levels before onset of spraying activities. Linear regression models showed that dermal exposure was only a predictive parameter for TCP levels in urine in the baseline data set. Although the results should be interpreted cautiously this study suggests a protective effect of the evaluated PPE program...|$|E
