5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton <b>daubs</b> on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E
25|$|In present-day Zoroastrian tradition, the {{offering}} is never made directly, but {{placed in the}} care of the celebrant priest who, wearing a cloth mask over the nostrils and mouth to prevent pollution from the breath, will then – using a pair of silver tongs – place {{the offering}} in the fire. The priest will use a special ladle to proffer the holy ash to the layperson, who in turn <b>daubs</b> it on his or her forehead and eyelids, and may take some home for use after a Kushti ceremony.|$|E
500|$|We paid our {{shilling}} at the gate, {{and then}} we saw for the first time, that the entrance, {{if there had been}} any magic about it at all, was now decidedly disenchanted, being, in fact, nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughly-painted boards and sawdust. We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least, we should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and <b>daubs</b> of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after night we had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (we forget even her name now), who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple! ...|$|E

500|$|A Billboard {{magazine}} review said Phantasmagoria [...] "lives up to {{the advanced}} billing" [...] and [...] "aims to unnerve and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects interspliced in trusty scare-flick fashion with <b>daubs</b> of flesh and hints of sex". USA Today writer Joe Wilson gave it three-and-a-half stars and called it well-produced, visually appealing, frighteningly realistic and [...] "a much-needed change from normal fare", although he said the plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through. Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the game was [...] "an impressive work, a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer-generated environment, coupled with a musical score that's spooky without being overwhelming". He also called the gameplay [...] "elegant in its simplicity". San Francisco Chronicle writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive, comparing it to a good mystery novel. A reviewer for Next Generation {{was pleased with the}} story, the production values of the cutscenes, and the way the game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control. However, he found that the lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced gamers, since {{they would be able to}} finish the entire game in a day or two, and recommended it strictly for gamers who were new to the adventure genre. Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote, [...] "The graphics are terrific, but don't play on a full stomach." [...] Steve La Rue of U-T San Diego found the game [...] "visually opulent and interesting" [...] with [...] "dialogue a lot better than I expected, given the trite gothic novel plot", but also said he had to adjust to the [...] "gradual, contemplative pace". Jack Warner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote: [...] "It's hackneyed, but the art is so good, the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going", although he said [...] "precious little happens" [...] in the first few discs.|$|E
2500|$|Alpert's style {{achieved}} enormous {{popularity with}} the national exposure The Clark Gum Company gave {{to one of his}} recordings in 1964, a Sol Lake number titled [...] "The Mexican Shuffle" [...] (which was retitled [...] "The Teaberry Shuffle" [...] for the television advertisements). In 1965, Alpert released two albums, Whipped Cream & Other Delights and Going Places. Whipped Cream sold over 6 million copies in the United States. The album cover featured model Dolores Erickson wearing only what appeared to be whipped cream. In reality, Erickson was wearing a white blanket over which were scattered artfully placed <b>daubs</b> of shaving cream—real whipped cream would have melted under the heat of the studio lights (although the cream on her finger was real). In concerts, when about to play the song, Alpert would tell the audience, [...] "Sorry, we can't play the cover for you." [...] The art was parodied by several groups including one-time A band Soul Asylum and by comedian Pat Cooper for his album Spaghetti Sauce and Other Delights. The singles included the title cut, [...] "Lollipops and Roses", and [...] "A Taste of Honey". The latter won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Going Places produced four more singles: [...] "Tijuana Taxi", [...] "Spanish Flea", [...] "Third Man Theme", and [...] "Zorba the Greek". [...] "Tijuana Taxi" [...] and [...] "Spanish Flea" [...] would be used in the 1966 Academy Award-winning animated short A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} known type of infill, called opus craticum by the Romans, was a wattle and <b>daub</b> type construction.

50|$|Wattle and <b>daub</b> is a {{composite}} building material used for making walls, in which a woven lattice of wooden strips called wattle is <b>daubed</b> with a sticky material usually made of some combination of wet soil, clay, sand, animal dung and straw.

50|$|An {{extension}} on {{the brush}} building idea is the wattle and <b>daub</b> {{process in which}} clay soils or dung, usually cow, are used to fill in and cover a woven brush structure.

2500|$|Reading [...] Milgrom {{noted that}} {{abundant}} attestation exists of ritual <b>daubing</b> {{in the ancient}} Near East. The incantations recited during the ritual smearing of persons, gods' statues, and buildings testify to a purificatory and apotropaic purpose – to wipe off and ward off menacing demonic forces. These ancient Near East applications always smear the vulnerable parts of bodies (extremities) and structures (corners, entrances) with magical substances. Milgrom concluded that the blood <b>daubing</b> of the altar's extremities – its horns – closely resembles the blood <b>daubing</b> of the extremities of the priests in [...] Milgrom also noted the correspondence of the dedicatory rite of Ezekiel's altar to the <b>daubing</b> of the priests, for in [...] the purificatory blood is <b>daubed</b> {{not only on the}} altar's horns but also on the corners of its two gutters, located at its middle and bottom. Milgrom argued that these points correspond to a person's earlobe, thumb, and big toe. Milgrom concluded that these two rites shared the same purpose, which in the case of Ezekiel's altar [...] made explicit: [...] "And you shall decontaminate it and thus purge it." [...] Similarly, [...] says that through it [...] "they shall purge the altar and thus purify it." [...] Therefore, Milgrom concluded that the <b>daubing</b> of the priest at points of his body and the <b>daubing</b> of comparable points on the altar possessed a similar goal of purging.|$|R
