5|$|Parachutes was {{recognised}} to have {{an alternative}} rock sound similar to English band Radiohead in their Bends era. In fact, {{it has been suggested}} that the album's commercial success was due <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> portion of Radiohead's audience being alienated by the band's experimental and more electronic-influenced Kid A album.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{lived up}} to their favored status in the first half, running up a 21-3 lead before halftime, thanks <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> well-executed pass by wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal on a trick play. Royal also performed well during punt and kick returns, putting Virginia Tech in good field position throughout the half.|$|E
5|$|After Pelacur, Sarumpaet {{began working}} on a film {{adaptation}} entitled Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). The film's production took three years, due <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lack of funding; the total budget was Rp.6.5 billion (US$800,000) Released on 30 April 2009, the film was well received both domestically and internationally. It was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, but not nominated.|$|E

50|$|In 1994, Puddicombe gave up {{his studies}} in sports science and instead {{travelled}} to Asia <b>to</b> train as <b>a</b> Buddhist monk. He has attributed this <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> effort <b>to</b> cope with the trauma of bereavement.|$|R

5|$|After {{extensive}} {{negotiations to}} implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries, on 4 October 2011, a modified escrow collateral agreement was reached. The expectation is that only Finland will utilise it, due, <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> requirement to contribute initial capital to European Stability Mechanism in one instalment instead of five instalments over time. Finland, {{as one of the}} strongest AAA countries, can raise the required capital with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public might become worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fall in sugar prices because of overproduction.|$|E
5|$|Cambodian Rocks was {{the first}} release of its kind, {{followed}} {{by a number of}} similar compilations like Cambodian Cassette Archives and other unrelated titles by the same or similar names, inspired by the original or exploiting its weak standing with regard to intellectual property.

5|$|Capital {{punishment}} is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, {{and used in}} 31 states. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision {{there have been more}} than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Cited as an {{influential}} {{title in the}} video game industry {{and one of the}} best games of all time, Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to Ico, due <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games. A remake of the game with ultra-high definition art assets is currently in development and scheduled for release on the PlayStation 4 in 2018.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} morning hours, a cold front with several {{embedded}} low pressure areas extended from east Texas northeastward into the Ohio River Valley. An upper-level disturbance that had moved across the frontal boundary the previous evening sparked an area of thunderstorms that morphed into a squall line. This line of severe thunderstorms {{would be responsible for}} tornado actitvity from late on April 26 into the late morning of April 27. Early in the morning, the squall line, packing straight-line winds and numerous embedded tornadoes, moved through Louisiana and Mississippi, then proceeded to affect North and Central Alabama and parts of Middle and East Tennessee. The line strengthened as it moved through Alabama, due <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high amount of low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and increasing wind shear.|$|E

50|$|Due <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{agreeable}} climate, Santa Monica {{became a}} famed resort town {{by the early}} 20th century. The city has experienced a boom since the late 1980s through the revitalization of its downtown core, significant job growth and increased tourism. The Santa Monica Pier remains a popular destination.|$|R
5|$|Gerry Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn {{suggest that}} Thunderbird 6 {{develops}} {{the character of}} Lady Penelope from her previous appearances in the Thunderbirds franchise. This is argued to be due, <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more mature reading of the character's lines from Sylvia Anderson, who provided Penelope's voice from the first episode of the Thunderbirds television series. Archer and Hearn also praise the work of David Graham, particularly his reading of Parker's dialogue, but note that other regular characters, such as Gordon and John, appear infrequently in the film.|$|E
5|$|Gossip {{was also}} a noted writer. His {{treatise}} The Chess-Player's Manual—A Complete Guide to Chess, a 900-page tome published in 1874 {{after several years of}} work, was harshly received by the critics, largely because he had included a number of informal skittles games that he had (atypically) won against stronger players. As a result, Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics, whom he often attacked ferociously in his books. However, his 1879 book Theory of the Chess Openings was well received. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Chess Champion, wrote that the 1888 edition of The Chess-Player's Manual {{was one of the best}} available books on the game. Thanks <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 122-page appendix by S. Lipschütz, it became one of the standard opening works of the time.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, as {{with most}} other aspects of A/S, no clear plan existed for the {{armament}} of Coastal Command's aircraft. While operational control {{was given to the}} Admiralty, the faith of both services in ASDIC proved ill-founded. It ruled out the submarine threat, and caused a refocusing on surface attacks. In addition, no A/S weapons had been developed properly in the inter-war period. Most of the munitions were left over from the First World War, due <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wish to economise and the fact no order had been given to dispose of them.|$|E

50|$|The Empire has {{the feel}} of Western Europe {{around the time of}} the Reformation, but uses magic as a {{replacement}} for most technology. Despite the Empire's vast age, its culture has been remarkably stable, evolving only slowly. This is due <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the very long lives of Dragaerans, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ingrained respect for tradition, and <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the meddling of the Dragaeran gods.|$|R
25|$|Puntland's {{population}} growth rate is quite high due <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> influx {{of people from}} southern Somalia and from neighboring Northeast African countries.

5|$|Nielsen {{television}} ratings {{indicated that}} 29.2% of televisions in the 56largest media {{markets in the}} United States were tuned to the inauguration, the largest audience since Ronald Reagan's first inauguration in 1981 and nearly double the viewership of the 2005 inauguration of George W. Bush. The Raleigh-Durham market had the largest TV audience with more than 51%of households tuned into the day's events, a number attributed <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> snowstorm that kept people inside and {{in part to the}} large African American population in that community. Of the top 10media markets in terms of viewership, four were in North Carolina, two were in Virginia and one was in Maryland, with the Washington D.C. market ranking second highest in television viewership. In addition, schools and workplaces across the country allowed viewing of the inauguration because the event occurred on a weekday.|$|E
5|$|The Browns won another {{championship}} in 1954, thanks <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strong regular-season performance from Lavelli. Lavelli {{led the team}} in receiving that year and made the Pro Bowl after the Browns beat the Lions for their second NFL title. A third NFL championship followed in 1955. In the championship game against the Rams, Lavelli caught a touchdown {{in the second quarter}} and scored a second time on a 50-yard pass just {{before the end of the}} first half. The Browns won 38–14.|$|E
5|$|The SG-1000's launch did {{not prove}} to be successful. The three launch games, {{all of which were}} ported from Sega's VIC dual-arcade board, lacked the name {{recognition}} of Famicom launch games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. However, the situation was quickly turned around. Thanks in part to the SG-1000's steadier stream of releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), and <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> recall on Famicom units necessitated by a faulty circuit, the SG-1000 chalked up 160,000 units in sales in 1983, far exceeding Sega's projection of 50,000 units.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} Smart's eclipse may be traced <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{prejudice}} of the age, one {{which was founded}} in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for madness. It was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} gained international notoriety due <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{photograph taken}} by photographer Frank Fournier {{of a young}} girl named Omayra Sánchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E
5|$|An early Italian humanist {{who came}} to Poland in the mid-15th century was Filippo Buonaccorsi. Many Italian artists came to Poland with Bona Sforza of Milan, when she married King Sigismund I the Old in 1518. This was {{supported}} by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, {{as well as by}} newly established universities. The Polish Renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the Golden Age of Polish culture. Ruled by the Jagiellon dynasty, the Kingdom of Poland (from 1569 known as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multi-national Polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> century without major wars – aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands. The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the Polish Brethren), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (szlachta) who gained dominance in the new political system of Golden Liberty. The Polish Renaissance architecture has three periods of development.|$|E
