40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{submitted}} thesis is to analyze current regulation {{of one of}} the key institutes of law - institute of representation. The institute is common for different branches of law. The core of representation is mutual for all branches, although several differences appear. Regulation of this institute can be found in substantial as well in procedural law. The thesis focuses at representation of an entrepreneur (also referred to as a businessman) in particular. Duplication of regulation in Civil and Commercial Code results in fact, that appropriate provision of both Codes must be applied for proper interpretation. Institute of representation enables that under certain circumstances a <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> (proxy or authorized representative) can act <b>for</b> other <b>legal</b> <b>person</b> and in the name of other person (principal, mandator or donor of the power).

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of co-operative law {{as well as}} the practical application of co-operative law produces much controversy regarding the openness of the membership of a co-operative to legal persons. This issue also concerns the legal construction of a co-operative of legal persons, i. e. a co-operative institution which shall only admit legal persons. This may be possible because the authors of the statutes of co-operatives formed exclusively <b>for</b> <b>legal</b> <b>persons,</b> exercising the powers provided for in the statutory rights, anticipate an important derogation from one of the basic principles of an idea of a co-operative, i. e. the principle that “one member stands for one vote”, and favour a principle that the number of votes at the AGM should depend on the number of shares brought into the co-operative. If this view is implemented, the consequent situation will be that a co-operative of legal persons would work on almost exactly the same principles as those provided for in the code of commercial companies, and in particular to those applicable to limited liability companies. Hence, one of the objectives {{of this paper is to}} discuss the real need of continuing the effort to maintain this legal situation. This paper and the interest in the subject was prompted by the draft of a new law on co-operatives developed on the initiative of the President of the Republic of Poland. Besides the issues related to the co-operatives formed by legal persons, the paper also deals with a number of proposals of individual statutory norms regulating the status of craftsmen, student, or social co-operatives. The variety of social needs justify the establishment of specific legal regulations enabling those social groups as well as others, including disabled persons or the unemployed in various forms of co-operative businesses. The evaluation of the proposed legal solutions constitutes the main theme of the second part of the work...|$|E
40|$|From {{the ancient}} times until today, {{criminal}} law has provided different criminal sanctions as measures of social control. These coercive measures are {{imposed on the}} criminal offender by the competent court and aimed at limitting the offender's rights and freedoms or depriving the offender of certain rights and freedoms. These sanctions are applied to the natural or legal persons who violate the norms of the legal order and injure or endanger other legal goods that enjoy legal protection. In order to effectively protect social values, criminal legislations in all countries predict a number of criminal sanctions. These are: 1) imprisonment, 2) precautions, 3) safety measures, 4) penalties for juveniles, and 5) sanctions <b>for</b> <b>legal</b> <b>persons.</b> Apart and instead of punishment, warning measures have {{a significant role in}} the jurisprudence. Since they emerged in the early 20 th century in the system of criminal sanctions, there has been an increase in their application to criminal offenders, especially when it comes to first-time offenders who committed a negligent or accidental criminal act. Warnings are applied in case of crimes that do not have serious consequences, and whose perpetrators are not hardened and incorrigible criminals. All contemporary criminal legislations (including the French legilation) provide a warning measure of suspended sentence. Suspended sentence is a conditional stay of execution of sentence of imprisonment for a specified time, provided that the convicted person does not commit another criminal offense and fulfills other obligations. This sanction applies if the following two conditions are fulfilled: a) forma! -which is attached to the sentence of imprisonment; and b) material -which is the court assessment that the application of this sanction is justified and necessary in a particular case. In many modern criminal legislations, there are two different types of suspended (conditional) sentence: 1) ordinary (classical) suspended sentence, and 2) a suspended sentence with supervision. If the convicted person fails to comply with a court order, the law provides for the mandatory or optional revocation of the suspended sentence...|$|E
