5|$|Globally, but {{especially}} {{in developing nations}} like India where people cook with <b>fuelwood</b> and coal over open fires, about 4billion humans suffer continuous exposure to smoke. In India, particulate concentrations in houses are reported to range from 8,300 to 15,000 μg/m3, greatly exceeding the 75 μg/m3 maximum standard for indoor particulate matter in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Charcoal, or Makala, is inefficient {{to produce}} {{but is a}} {{preferred}} source {{of energy in the}} DRC. While it is virtually free to use <b>fuelwood</b> as a source of energy, charcoal increases in popularity as an energy source due to several advantages over <b>fuelwood.</b> Charcoal has higher calorific value per unit weight (31.8 MJ per kg) compared to <b>fuelwood</b> (16 MJ per kg); and charcoal is smaller and easier to store.|$|E
25|$|Charcoal is also mostly {{smokeless}} and is {{not liable}} to deterioration by fungi or insects which attack <b>fuelwood.</b> With these benefits, charcoal is particularly popular in cities. However, even in rural areas in Goma, North Kivu for example, charcoal is also widely used. On average, each person uses 1 to 1.6 cubic meter of <b>fuelwood</b> and 80 to 95kg of charcoal annually.|$|E
25|$|Significant forest {{products}} of India include paper, plywood, sawnwood, timber, poles, pulp and matchwood, <b>fuelwood,</b> sal seeds, tendu leaves, gums and resins, cane and rattan, bamboo, grass and fodder, drugs, spices and condiments, herbs, cosmetics, tannins.|$|E
25|$|The REDD {{campaign}} aims {{to extend}} the usage of ameliorated ovens to about 5 million urban households. Another way the government plans {{to address the issue}} of deforestation due to <b>fuelwood</b> is by providing electricity over certain territories to meet 60% of the needs by 2030.|$|E
25|$|Pignut hickory {{makes up}} a small {{percentage}} of the biomass in low-quality upland hardwood stands that are prime candidates for clearcutting for chips or <b>fuelwood</b> as the first step toward rehabilitation to more productive stands. Hickory has a relatively high heating value and is used extensively as a home heating fuel.|$|E
25|$|During World War II Riding Mountain National Park {{was home}} to the Whitewater labour camp for German prisoners-of-war. Operating from 1943 to 1945, the camp {{was built on the}} {{northeast}} shore of Whitewater Lake, approximately 300 kilometres (190mi) north-west of Winnipeg. The camp consisted of fifteen buildings and housed 440 to 450 prisoners of war. The decision to have a prisoner of war labour project in Riding Mountain National Park {{was the result of a}} <b>fuelwood</b> shortage in the winter of 1942 and 1943. To free up men for the war effort it was decided that prisoners of war would be employed. Following the end of the war and the achievement of a <b>fuelwood</b> surplus, the camp closed in late 1945. In 1945 an advertisement appeared in the Tribune soliciting the sale of the government-owned buildings. The camp has since been dismantled.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{while the}} rates remain constant, wood removal (measured in cubic meters) {{continues}} to dramatically increase annually. Industrialized roundwood {{has increased from}} 3.05 million cubic meters in 1990 to 4.45 million cubic meters in 2010; <b>fuelwood</b> has increased from 44.2 million cubic meters to 75.44 million cubic meters annually in that same time.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the purposes, {{commercial}} or personal, <b>fuelwood</b> and charcoal are mostly collected {{by women and}} children in most regions in Africa. The price of charcoal increases especially in large cities, such as Kinshasa, because vast amounts of forest are deforested close to the city and the cost of transportation increases as the distance of wood sources are farther away.|$|E
25|$|Brazil's peat {{reserves}} are estimated at 25 billion tonnes, {{which is the}} most in South America. However, no production of peat for fuel has yet been developed. Brazil produces 65 million tonnes of <b>fuelwood</b> per year. The annual production of charcoal is about 6 million tonnes, which is used in the steel industry. The cogeneration potential of agricultural and livestock residues varies from 4 GW to 47 GW by 2025.|$|E
25|$|Early {{urbanization}} of Rome {{and surrounding}} areas was focused around {{the ability to}} obtain natural resources. Lowland areas and areas close to water transports were highly urbanized first, but as population increased along with trade and manufacturing, imperial expansion and colonization of conquered territories was needed. The environment underwent drastic degradation as pollution from the burning of <b>fuelwood</b> filled the air and smelters that used wood as fuel transmitted heavy metals into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The Sundarbans area {{is one of}} {{the most}} densely {{populated}} in the world, and the population is increasing. As a result, half of this ecoregion's mangrove forests have been cut down to supply <b>fuelwood</b> and other natural resources. Despite the intense and large-scale exploitation, this still {{is one of the}} largest contiguous areas of mangroves in the world. Another threat comes from deforestation and water diversion from the rivers inland, which causes far more silt to be brought to the estuary, clogging up the waterways.|$|E
25|$|Eucalyptus {{trees were}} {{introduced}} to Sri Lanka in the late 19th century by tea and coffee planters, for wind protection, shade and fuel. Forestry replanting of eucalyptus began in the 1930s in deforested mountain areas, and currently there are about 10 species present in the island. They account for 20% of major reforestation plantings. They provide railway sleepers, utility poles, sawn timber and <b>fuelwood,</b> but are controversial because of their adverse effect on biodiversity, hydrology and soil fertility. They are associated with another invasive species, the eucalyptus gall wasp, Leptocybe invasa.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, such {{socially}} responsible forestry {{was encouraged by}} state community forestry agencies. They emphasized such projects as planting wood lots on denuded communal cattle-grazing grounds to make villages self-sufficient in <b>fuelwood,</b> to supply timber needed {{for the construction of}} village houses, and to provide the wood needed for the repair of farm implements. Both individual farmers and tribal communities were also encouraged to grow trees for profit. For example, in Gujarat, one of the more aggressive states in developing programmes of socioeconomic importance, the forestry department distributed 200 million tree seedlings in 1983. The fast-growing eucalyptus is the main species being planted nationwide, followed by pine and poplar.|$|E
25|$|Artisanal {{logging in}} the DRC is {{characterized}} as logging activities without concession {{from the government}} at the national level. Unregulated artisanal and small-scale logging is estimated to represent 75% of the total timber exports from the DRC and happens {{at a rate of}} 5 to 8 times greater than industrial logging. However, this practice is still dwarfed in comparison to the total amount of wood being gathered annually for <b>fuelwood</b> and charcoal production, which happens at an amount 30 times greater than artisanal logging. There are three types of forest codes in the DRC—public institutions, private, and community forests. Artisanal logging takes place under community forest area.|$|E
25|$|The Sundarbans {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the economy of the southwestern region of Bangladesh as well as in the national economy. It is the single largest source of forest produce in the country. The forest provides raw materials for wood-based industries. In addition to traditional forest produce like timber, <b>fuelwood,</b> pulpwood etc., large-scale harvest of non-wood forest products such as thatching materials, honey, beeswax, fish, crustacean and mollusc resources of the forest takes place regularly. The vegetated tidal lands of the Sundarbans function as an essential habitat, produces nutrients and purifies water. The forest also traps nutrient and sediment, acts as a storm barrier, shore stabiliser and energy storage unit. Last but not the least, the Sunderbans provides an aesthetic attraction for local and foreign tourists.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, India {{declared}} its long-term strategy for forestry development to compose of three major objectives: to reduce soil erosion and flooding; {{to supply the}} growing needs of the domestic wood products industries; and to supply {{the needs of the}} rural population for <b>fuelwood,</b> fodder, small timber, and miscellaneous forest produce. To achieve these objectives, the National Commission on Agriculture in 1976 recommended the reorganisation of state forestry departments and advocated the concept of social forestry. The commission itself worked on the first two objectives, emphasising traditional forestry and wildlife activities; in pursuit of the third objective, the commission recommended the establishment of a new kind of unit to develop community forests. Following the leads of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, a number of other states also established community-based forestry agencies that emphasized programmes on farm forestry, timber management, extension forestry, reforestation of degraded forests, and use of forests for recreational purposes.|$|E
25|$|The role {{of forests}} in the {{national}} economy and in ecology was further emphasized in the 1988 National Forest Policy, which focused on ensuring environmental stability, restoring the ecological balance, and preserving the remaining forests. Other objectives of the policy were meeting the need for <b>fuelwood,</b> fodder, and small timber for rural and tribal people while recognising the need to actively involve local people {{in the management of}} forest resources. Also in 1988, the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 was amended to facilitate stricter conservation measures. A new target was to increase the forest cover to 33% of India's land area from the then-official estimate of 23%. In June 1990, the central government adopted resolutions that combined forest science with social forestry, that is, taking the sociocultural traditions of the local people into. The cumulative area afforested during the 1951-91 period was nearly 179,000 square kilometres. However, despite large-scale tree planting programmes, forestry is one arena in which India has actually regressed since independence. Annual fellings at about four times the growth rate are a major cause. Widespread pilfering by villagers for firewood and fodder also represents a major decrement. In addition, the 1988 National Forest Policy noted, the forested area has been shrinking as a result of land cleared for farming and development programmes.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Fuelwood</b> and {{charcoal}} {{collection has}} been {{classified as a}} key driver for deforestation as {{it is used to}} account for 95% the population’s energy needs. The population’s dependence on <b>fuelwood</b> for energy creates rings of fragmented forest around urban areas, which in turn calls for longer and longer forest excursions to supply a never ending demand for <b>fuelwood.</b> The United Nations Environment Prorgamme’s Post-conflict Environmental Assessment Synthesis for Policy Makers reported that approximately 89 heactares of forest was lost each day due to illegal <b>fuelwood</b> harvesting during the peak of the post-Second Congo War conflict. It is estimated that 72 million m3 of <b>fuelwood</b> and charcoal are “produced” [...] annually.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dramatic}} {{shortage of}} <b>fuelwood</b> in arid and semi-arid zones ...|$|E
2500|$|Lastly, private {{organizations}} such as Mercy Corps and WWF has begun to address the crisis in terms of <b>fuelwood</b> caused deforestation by introducing <b>fuelwood</b> plantations {{as well as provide}} training for rural people to build fuel efficient cooking stoves. [...] While these efforts surely will help, they are by no means a solution to the problem. [...] With citizens so dependent on <b>fuelwood</b> and charcoal for their energy basic needs (i.e. cooking) and livelihood, until the country is able to provide citizens with alternative sources of energy (i.e. electricity and alternative jobs)the situation will likely not improve.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, certain {{organizations}} {{are looking into}} biomass briquette substitution {{in order to reduce}} the demand for <b>fuelwood.</b> Sustainable <b>fuelwood</b> production techniques are also being implemented. The Eco-Makala project under the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has pledged to reforest 4500 ha by 2012 to provide the people of Goma with <b>fuelwood.</b> In the project, the trees are planted on soil belonging to local farmers, with the farmer's permission. The farmer hence becomes owner of the trees, and is able to make his own charcoal from these using a clamp. This amount of wood being planted to offset <b>fuelwood</b> collection is minimal when considering that over 300,000 ha of forest are destroyed each year alone. [...] The REDD campaign is aimed at addressing climate change as all of it projects are working towards an overall world reduction in its emissions by approximately 17 Gt CO2e by 2020 in order to arrive at the GHG atmospheric concentration target of 445 parts per million (pm) of CO2e.|$|E
2500|$|... ns Environment Programme has {{identified}} the priority {{in which the}} causes should be addressed as slash and burn agriculture first, the collection of <b>fuelwood</b> second, unregulated artisanal and logging third, and road infrastructure development fourth.|$|E
2500|$|The direct {{causes of}} {{deforestation}} within the DRC are well understood {{and have been}} identified consistently by many sources. [...] The direct causes are as follows: 1) road infrastructure development, 2) slashing and burning the forests to transform forest land into agricultural land, 3) the collection of <b>fuelwood</b> and charcoal, and lastly 4) unregulated artisanal and small-scale logging. [...] The meanny ...|$|E
2500|$|Industrial logging {{concessions}} stop {{indigenous people}} {{having access to}} their forests, which they traditionally rely on for their livelihood through NTFPs (non-timber forest products, such as food products, plants of medicinal value, <b>fuelwood</b> and fallow fields). [...] In addition to the restricted access to these resources, there are other damaging effects caused by {{the damage to the}} water courses that logging can create, which cuts fish resources and water {{that could be used for}} crop irrigation.|$|E
2500|$|Land {{mismanagement}} is {{a substantial}} problem in the DRC and contributes to soil erosion. [...] The cities in DRC have not adopted any new urban plans for decades and now many cities are facing fast urban sprawl which is a major contributor of the deforestation in these areas (via <b>fuelwood</b> and charcoal collection). The city of Kinshasa, for example, is still using the physical environment created from the colonial era but it now {{has a population of}} more than 10 million people.|$|E
2500|$|As of 1999, 87% of {{the total}} volume of wood {{harvested}} was one of five species of African mahogany. These selective logging practices yield only 8.7 cubic meters (the volume {{less than that of}} one tree) per hectare. [...] This creates a scenario where many roads are created to move very few selected trees from the forest. This creates access to previously secluded areas which expedites the rate of forest accessibility thereby allowing populations to move in to collect <b>fuelwood,</b> hunt bushmeat, and start clearing the land for agriculture.|$|E
2500|$|Wood fuel (or <b>fuelwood)</b> is a fuel, such as firewood, charcoal, chips, sheets, pellets, and sawdust. The {{particular}} form used depends upon {{factors such as}} source, quantity, quality and application. [...] In many areas, wood is the most easily available form of fuel, requiring no tools {{in the case of}} picking up dead wood, or few tools, although as in any industry, specialized tools, such as skidders and hydraulic wood splitters, have been developed to mechanize production. Sawmill waste and construction industry by-products also include various forms of lumber tailings.|$|E
2500|$|Relative to {{agricultural}} land transformation, <b>fuelwood</b> and charcoal collection, and artisanal collection logging, industrial logging has a minor {{direct impact on}} forest destruction in the DRC in recent years due {{to the collapse of}} local markets in the early 1990s. [...] However, logging has significant indirect effects as mentioned previously because of the roads constructed for it. [...] The collapse of the logging industry in the 1990s has changed the industry into one of selective logging where only very large trees of high value are being extracted for export.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{forestry}} industry contributed 1.7% to India's GDP. In 2010, {{the contribution}} to GDP dropped to 0.9%, {{largely because of}} rapid growth {{of the economy in}} other sectors and the government's decision to reform and reduce import tariffs to let imports satisfy the growing Indian demand for wood products. India produces a range of processed forest (wood and non-wood) products ranging from wood panel products and wood pulp to make bronze, rattazikistan ware and pern resin. India's paper industry produces over 3,000 metric tonnes annually from more than 400 mills. The furniture and craft industry is another consumer of wood. India's wood-based processing industries consumed about 30 million cubic metres of industrial wood in 2002. India annually consumes an additional 270 million tonnes of <b>fuelwood,</b> 2800 million tonnes of fodder, and about 102 million cubic meter of forest products - valued at about [...] a year.|$|E
2500|$|Hume {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} having experimental farms to demonstrate best practices to be set up in every district. He proposed to develop <b>fuelwood</b> plantations [...] "in every village in the drier portions of the country" [...] and thereby provide a substitute heating and cooking fuel so that manure (dried cattle dung was used as fuel by the poor) could be returned to the land. Such plantations, he wrote, were [...] "a thing that is entirely in accord with the traditions of the country [...] – [...] a thing that the people would understand, appreciate, and, with a little judicious pressure, cooperate in." [...] He wanted model farms to be established in every district. He noted that rural indebtedness was caused mainly by the use of land as security, a practice that had been introduced by the British. Hume denounced it as another of [...] "the cruel blunders into which our narrow-minded, though wholly benevolent, desire to reproduce England in India has led us." [...] Hume also wanted government-run banks, at least until cooperative banks could be established.|$|E
2500|$|Landscape ecology {{has been}} {{incorporated}} {{into a variety of}} ecological subdisciplines. For example, a recent development has been the more explicit consideration of spatial concepts and principles applied to the study of lakes, streams, and wetlands in the field of landscape limnology. In addition, landscape ecology has important links to application-oriented disciplines such as agriculture and forestry. [...] In agriculture, landscape ecology has introduced new options for the management of environmental threats brought about by the intensification of agricultural practices. [...] Agriculture has always been a strong human impact on ecosystems. [...] In forestry, from structuring stands for <b>fuelwood</b> and timber to ordering stands across landscapes to enhance aesthetics, consumer needs have affected conservation and use of forested landscapes. [...] Landscape forestry provides methods, concepts, and analytic procedures for landscape forestry. Landscape ecology has been cited as a contributor to the development of fisheries biology as a distinct biological science discipline, and is frequently incorporated in study design for wetland delineation in hydrology. It has helped shape integrated landscape management. [...] Lastly, landscape ecology has been very influential for progressing sustainability science and sustainable development planning. [...] In example, a recent study assessed sustainable urbanization across Europe using evaluation indices, country-landscapes, and landscape ecology tools and methods.|$|E
