You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
500|$|... "Girly Edition" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. It {{was named the}} fifth best episode with a sports theme of the series by Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, calling it [...] "a great episode, full of more than the normal quota of good jokes", adding, [...] "best of all is Lisa's revenge on Bart, and the mad cat-lady who goes around chucking her cats at people." [...] Ryan Keefer of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B rating and stated that he enjoyed the subplot with Mojo more than the main plot. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide commented that [...] "Girly Edition" [...] takes [...] "a clever concept and turns into something more than expected as it digs into the usual Bart/Lisa rivalry. I’m not quite sure why Bart reacts so sadly to Lisa’s comments about his stupidity when 'Lisa the Simpson' just delved into the dumbness of the male Simpsons. There’s enough to like <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the episode fun, though." ...|$|E

I am <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions." [...] On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells [...] "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions. But I can’t tell you when a fertilized egg becomes sacred. That’s not my job. That’s not a science issue. And so whatever I think about reproductive technology or choice, or whatever, is irrelevant to {{my job as a}} science adviser." [...] However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, he stated, [...] "Intelligent design is not a scientific theory.... I don't regard intelligent design as a scientific topic". Also In 2005, he told The New York Times that [...] "global warming exists, and {{we have to do something}} about it." ...|$|E

He told a Free Schools conference that [...] "no one in this room is <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> architects richer" [...] and specifically mentioned architect Richard Rogers.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Jason Ocampo scored it 6.3 out of 10, {{praising the}} {{graphics}} but finding the gameplay derivative, the voice acting very {{poor and the}} difficulty too high. Of the graphics, he wrote [...] "Sparta's 3D graphics allow for a pretty-looking ancient world, though one that looks not unlike most other 3D RTS games. There are nice little touches, such as snakes that slither across the landscape, and the larger units, such as elephants and galleys, look great." [...] However, he also wrote [...] "there's not a lot <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the game stand out from a relatively crowded field," [...] and felt Sparta [...] "delivers a fairly standard real-time strategy experience that's indistinguishable {{from the rest of}} the genre." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{working at}} the {{aircraft}} plant in Los Angeles, Lane passed the Los Angeles Rams offices on his bus ride to work. He walked into the office with a scrapbook of clippings in 1952 {{and asked for a}} tryout. He was recommended to the Rams by Gabby Sims and signed as a free agent. Lane initially tried out as a receiver, the position he had played at Fort Ord, but was switched to a defensive back by the Rams. In the Rams' first scrimmage on August 3, 1952, Lane drew praise as [...] "the outstanding player in the scrimmage by a country mile" [...] due to his [...] "ferocious" [...] approach to the game and his speed in chasing down Elroy Hirsch. After the scrimmage, Rams head coach Joe Stydahar said, [...] "Lane came out <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the ball club. Well, last night he got himself a job." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Joe Budden and Raekwon {{reportedly}} were {{sat down}} and forced to settle things {{on the final day}} of the tour, Budden released a video on his website challenging Raekwon to a one-on-one fight, and called on all his fans to help persuade Raekwon to accept, despite the fact that it wasn't Raekwon who threw the punch. Raekwon however did not accept, and explained that he is a grown man with a family, and that fighting would be childish. He also stated [...] "This has never ever been a Wu-Tang versus Slaughterhouse thing, this is about a kid who gets off on doing blogs. My thing is this, I'm a business man, I'm <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money, take care of my family and keep as many people safe and sound as possible. We not gonna take it there 'cause that's little shit, we are grown men. I will never jump out the window to sacrifice the situation with my family for something that ain't worth it". Since the incident, Budden has stated in interviews the feud was over, and Raekwon made a similar announcement during a show, stating that he [...] "had love" [...] for Joe Budden.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the show was not {{revealed}} in the Indian media until the show officially went on air on 6 May 2012. There were also no get-togethers, parties or press conferences organized to discuss the content, {{leading up to the}} premiere of the show. However, various sources reported the show to be based on [...] "the common man" [...] rather than being fictional. Also, based on its content, it was mostly referred as a talk show discussing social issues like child labour, health problems and other issues affecting the country. Khan, who is known for keeping secrecy for his movies, was quoted saying, [...] "I don`t want to talk much about how the show will be, and about its format. I want everyone to see it directly on TV." [...] However, commenting on the theme of the show, he said, [...] "The show is about meeting the common man of India, connecting with India and its people." [...] He also added, [...] "Through this show we understand the problem of the people, we are not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a change. I am no one to change anything. I don`t think I am in the position to change anything else. I feel understanding a problem and feeling it or holding one's hand or hugging is also important.

2500|$|Dixon's [...] "Trilogy of Reconstruction" [...] {{consisted}} of The Leopard's Spots, The Clansman (1905), and The Traitor (1907). In these best-selling novels, which presented highly imaginative fiction as hard historical fact, Dixon used historical romance to present Negroes as inferior to whites and to glorify the antebellum American South. While he opposed slavery, {{he believed in}} racial segregation. Throughout his Reconstruction novels, Dixon painted a picture of white South victimized by greedy Northern carpetbaggers and black freedmen who are portrayed as [...] "black beasts" [...] full of an obsessive desire to rape white women. In his trilogy, Dixon portrayed Reconstruction as a nightmarish time when black men routinely stormed into weddings to rape white women, which is almost always avenged by the KKK castrating and lynching the said [...] "black beasts". Dixon conflated the possibility of any sort of advancement for African-Americans {{with the possibility of}} miscegenation, with the thesis frequently advanced in his novels that to allow black men to vote and have social equality would mean allowing black men to marry white women, which of course was portrayed as a monstrous prospect in his novels. In The Leopard's Spots, Dixon has one of his characters, the Reverend Durham, the mentor of the hero Charles Gaston say: [...] "One drop of Negro blood makes a Negro. It kinks the hair, flattens the nose, thickens the lip, puts out the light of intellect, and lights the fires of brutal passions. The beginning of Negro equality as a vital fact {{is the beginning of the}} end of this nation's life. There is enough Negro blood <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> mulatto the whole Republic." [...] One critic, Andrew Leiter, noted that Dixon has Durham call marriage [...] "the holy of holies" [...] which needs to be protected from black men, which he noted was an [...] "intriguing term" [...] for marriage, which he suggested was a not too subtle reference to the vagina. Leiter argued that the way in Dixon always portrayed courtship and marriage as a one-way case of a man choosing a woman, the complete lack of concern about white men sleeping with black women, and the [...] "holy of holies" [...] remark suggested that Dixon's defense of white supremacy was due to his desire to maintain [...] "white male sexual proprietary rights".|$|E
