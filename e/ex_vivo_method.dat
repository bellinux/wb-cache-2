In addition to the pharmacological observations, the affected hind paws were post mortem subjected to histological and immunohistochemical evaluations. The results of both in <b>vivo</b> and <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>methods</b> revealed low antiedematous and anti-inflammatory effects of the complexes, even though the in vitro model identified them as promising anti-inflammatory acting compounds. The reason for this discrepancy lies probably in low stability of the studied complexes in biological environment, {{as demonstrated by the}} solution interaction studies with sulfur-containing biomolecules (cysteine an...|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{delivery}} of immunomodulatory genes is a promising strategy for solid tumor vaccination. A drawback {{is that it}} necessitates induction of a large effect from transgene expression in {{a small percentage of}} tumor cells. Although the B 7 family is known to be the most potent of the costimulatory molecules, gene transduction of B 7 alone has not been effective in inducing antitumor immunity in nonimmunogenic tumors by <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>methods,</b> much less in vivo. We have developed a novel approach where a gene encoding soluble B 7 - 1, a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of murine B 7 - 1 and the Fc portion of human IgG 1, is delivered to tumor cells in vivo {{in the context of an}} oncolytic replication-competent herpes simplex virus, and the gene product is secreted by tumor cells rather than expressed on the cell surface. Defective herpes simplex virus vectors containing the B 7 - 1 -immunoglobulin (B 7 - 1 -Ig) fusion transgene (dvB 7 Ig) were generated using G 207 as a helper virus and tested in th...|$|R
