25|$|Since parve food is {{reclassified}} if {{it takes}} on the flavour of meat or <b>dairy</b> <b>produce,</b> Ashkenazi Jews traditionally forbid eating parve contents of a pot {{that has been used}} within 24 hours to cook meat, if the parve contents would be eaten with <b>dairy</b> <b>produce.</b> Their tradition similarly forbids eating parve foods with meat if the cooking vessel was used to cook <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> within the previous 24 hours. According to Joseph Caro, the Sephardic tradition was more lenient about such things, but Moses Isserles argued that such leniency was unreliable.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, as improved road and rail links with other towns resulted in a rapid growth of population and economic stability, the town became a major exporting port for <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> from the Taranaki district and the administrative centre for Taranaki's petro-chemical industry.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} these issues, kashrut-observant Jews can take the {{precaution}} of maintaining two distinct sets of crockery and cutlery; one set (known in Yiddish as milchig and in Hebrew as halavi) is for food containing <b>dairy</b> <b>produce,</b> while the other (known in Yiddish as fleishig/fleishedik and in Hebrew as basari) is for food containing meat.|$|E

25|$|Though {{radiative}} cooking of {{meat with}} <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> is not listed by the classical rabbis as {{being among the}} biblically prohibited forms of cooking such mixtures, a controversy remains about using a microwave oven to cook these mixtures. Rav Moshe Feinstein argues that microwave cooking {{is a form of}} cooking that counts as melacha during a Sabbath, but Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach disagrees.|$|E
25|$|Maimonides {{argued that}} time was {{required}} between meat and <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> because meat can become stuck in the teeth, a problem he suggested would last for about six hours after eating it; this interpretation was shared by Solomon ben Aderet, a prominent pupil of his, and Asher ben Jehiel, who gained entry to the rabbinate by Solomon ben Aderet's approval, {{as well as by}} the later Shulchan Aruch. By contrast, tosafists argued that the key detail was just the avoidance of <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> appearing at the same meal as meat. Therefore, it was sufficient to just wait until a new meal—which to them simply meant clearing the table, reciting a particular blessing, and cleaning their mouths. Some later rabbinic writers, like Moses Isserles, and significant texts, like the Zohar (as noted by Vilna Gaon and Daniel Josiah Pinto), argued that a meal still did not qualify as new unless at least an hour had passed since the previous meal.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{building for}} public {{meetings in the}} town with any architectural record is the High Cross, which stood within the Bull Ring. The last known construction work was in 1703; it was demolished in 1784. It was {{also known as the}} Old Cross, to distinguish it from the Welch Cross, and was also nicknamed the Butter Cross due to farmwives selling <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> beneath its arches.|$|E

25|$|The town {{developed}} a significant industrial {{base in the}} early 20th century, based largely on its agricultural capability, with <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> and sugar beet supplying the Sugar Factory, Rowntree Macintosh, Bournes and Dairygold. Changes in the European Union sugar subsidy programme resulted in {{the closure of the}} Sugar Beet factory in mid-2006, after 75 years continual production. One of the last sugar beet plants to be closed in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Prompted by the {{depression}} in the prices of <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> and cattle in the mid-1880 as well as bad weather {{for a number of}} years, many tenant farmers unable to pay their rents were left under the threat of eviction. Healy devised a strategy to secure a reduction in rent from the landlords which became known as the Plan of Campaign, organised in 1886 amongst others by Timothy Harrington.|$|E
25|$|Rashi {{stated that}} meat leaves a fatty residue {{in the throat}} and on the palate and Maimonides noted that meat stuck between the teeth might not degrade for several hours Jonathan Eybeschutz pointed out that meat and <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> mix during digestion, and Feivel Cohen {{maintained}} that hard cheese leaves a lingering taste in the mouth. Generally, rabbinic literature considers the collective impact {{of each of these}} issues.|$|E

25|$|In 1809, {{a market}} house was {{constructed}} {{at the end}} of High Street, {{on the site of the}} market cross, for the sale of poultry, eggs, butter and <b>dairy</b> <b>produce.</b> The building was demolished in 1852 along with other buildings that had fallen into disrepair. A pig market was constructed in the town in 1815 on High Street. At its peak, the market would handle the sale of 2,000 pigs per day.|$|E
25|$|The first European {{settlers}} {{were red}} cedar cutters, who were first recorded as having visited and logged {{in the area}} in 1814. As in much of coastal New South Wales, the cleared land was used for dairy farming and cedar cutting died out, as the cedar trees disappeared. Dairy farming became the predominant primary industry and remains so to this day. Gerringong had a small boat harbour used for the export of cedar and <b>dairy</b> <b>produce.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Talmud {{reports that}} Mar Ukva, a {{respected}} rabbi, would not eat dairy after eating meat {{at the same}} meal, and had a father who would wait an entire day after eating meat before eating <b>dairy</b> <b>produce.</b> Jacob ben Meir speculated that Mar Ukva's behaviour was merely a personal choice, rather than an example he expected others to follow, but prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages argued that Mar Ukva's practice must {{be treated as a}} minimum standard of behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the severe}} {{economic}} {{depression of the}} early 1930s, the Exhibition continued to attract its strong annual August attendance. More land was acquired, including a further 2 acres 23 perches excised from Bowen Park in 1932, bringing the total Exhibition Grounds to about 40 acres. Improvements to the grounds at this period included more cattle stalls along O'Connell Terrace (architect Richard Gailey Jnr) and a new show pavilion for Foggitt Jones Pty Ltd (architects Addison & MacDonald) in 1932; and a new <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> hall (architect Richard Gailey jnr) for the RNA in 1933.|$|E
25|$|It has {{traditionally}} been considered less problematic to eat dairy products before meat, {{on the assumption that}} dairy products leave neither fatty residue in the throat, nor fragments between the teeth. Many 20th century Orthodox rabbis say that washing the mouth out between eating dairy and meat is sufficient. Some argue that there should also be recitation of a closing blessing before the meat is eaten, and others view this as unnecessary. Ashkenazi Jews following kabbalistic traditions, based on the Zohar, additionally ensure that about half an hour passes after consuming <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> before eating meat.|$|E

25|$|Around 1200, stone-faced, clay-filled jetties were {{starting}} to project into the river, an indication that trade was increasing in Newcastle. As the Roman roads continued to deteriorate, sea travel was gaining in importance. By 1275 Newcastle was the sixth largest wool exporting port in England. The principal exports at this time were wool, timber, coal, millstones, <b>dairy</b> <b>produce,</b> fish, salt and hides. Much of the developing trade was with the Baltic countries and Germany. Most of the Newcastle merchants were situated near the river, below the Castle. The earliest known charter was dated 1175 in the reign of Henry II, giving the townspeople some control over their town. In 1216 King John granted Newcastle a mayor and also allowed the formation of guilds (known as Mysteries). These were cartels formed within different trades, which restricted trade to guild members. There were initially twelve guilds. Coal was being exported from Newcastle by 1250, and by 1350 the burgesses received a royal licence to export coal. This licence to export coal was jealously guarded by the Newcastle burgesses, {{and they tried to}} prevent any one else on the Tyne from exporting coal except through Newcastle. The burgesses similarly tried to prevent fish from being sold anywhere else on the Tyne except Newcastle. This led to conflicts with Gateshead and South Shields.|$|E
500|$|The next {{significant}} {{change to the}} company's fleet came in 1878 with {{the purchase of the}} Illawarra (II). At 533 tons and 190 feet in length, she handled both passengers and cargo for the company, and proved to be [...] "most popular" [...] until being laid up in 1908 and eventually scrapped. Illawarra (II) was soon joined by Allowrie, a 504-ton vessel built in 1880 for carrying passengers and cargo, including livestock and <b>dairy</b> <b>produce.</b> (Allowrie remained in service with the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company until 1909, when, like Illawarra (II), she was laid up). The third major vessel during this period was Kameruka. A 515-ton steamer, she was built in 1880, but was then lost when wrecked on Pedro Reef off Moruya in October, 1897.|$|E
500|$|The island's {{population}} numbered a {{few dozen}} families throughout the 18th century, corresponding to a population {{of no more than}} a couple of hundred people; it was recorded as numbering 30 families in 1710, 47 in 1724, 40 in 1735 and 30 in 1760. They rented their land from two branches of the Sinclair family, the Sinclairs of Mey who owned Uppertown and the Sinclairs of Freswick who owned Nethertown. The latter acquired Nethertown in 1721 and eventually took possession of Uppertown as well by obtaining the wadset from the Kennedys, reportedly through skullduggery. According to the deathbed confession of one of the witnesses to the transaction, the laird, Sinclair of Freswick, obtained the [...] "assent" [...] of the deceased Kennedy holder of the wadset by placing a quill in the dead man's hand and moving it to make the corpse write its name on the document. The other witness committed suicide, perhaps out of guilt. The island was reasonably profitable for the Sinclairs; in 1724 the islanders paid an annual rent of 1,300 marks (equivalent to about £125 at 2011 prices), part of which was paid in surplus grain ferried by Stroma's boats to the Sinclair granaries at Staxigoe near Wick. They were self-sufficient in <b>dairy</b> <b>produce</b> and were known for the quality of their cheese-making; Daniel Defoe thought Stroma cheese was excellent.|$|E
