2500|$|John Koster, a Republican congressional {{candidate}} in Washington's 1st District, was asked after a campaign fundraiser on October 28, 2012, about exceptions from abortion prohibition for rape and incest victims. He said, [...] "Incest is so rare, I mean, it's so rare...But the rape thingyou know, I know {{a woman who}} was raped and kept the child, gave it up for adoption, and she doesn't regret it." [...] He added, [...] "On the rape thing, it's like, how does putting more violence onto a woman's body and taking the life of an innocent child that's a consequence of this crimehow <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> better? You know what I mean?" [...] His comments, including the use of the words [...] "rape thing", drew local and national criticism. Koster acknowledged that his comments may have caused him to lose the election in Washington's most competitive district.|$|E

There is no sense in which Bandler and Grinder caused or participated in a paradigm shift. [...] "What did Grinder and Bandler <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> impossible to continue doing psychology...without accepting their ideas? Nothing," [...] argues Carroll.|$|R

Oh, very likely it's quite as you say! I dare say she's stupidly content with him; that she's forgiven it and forgotten all about it.

Suppose the author lived in a heathen country, where a law would be made to call Christianity idolatrous; would that be a topic for him to prove it so by, &c.? And why do the clergy incur a pre-munire;--To frighten them--Because the law understandeth, that, if they refuse, the chosen cannot be a bishop: But, if the clergy had an order to do it otherwise than they have prescribed, they ought and would incur an hundred rather.|$|E

6000|$|Thus much {{in reply}} to Mr. Mivart's arguments. I cannot but {{think that it}} is to be regretted that he ekes them out by ascribing to the doctrines of the {{philosophers}} with whom he does not agree, logical consequences which have been over and over again proved not to flow from them: and when reason fails him, tries the effect of an injurious nickname. According to the views of Mr. Spencer, Mr. Mill, and Mr. Darwin, Mr. Mivart tells us, [...] "virtue is a mere kind of retrieving:" [...] and, that we may not miss the point of the joke, he puts it in italics. But what if it is? <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> less virtue? Suppose I say that sculpture is a [...] "mere way" [...] of stone-cutting, and painting a [...] "mere way" [...] of daubing canvas, and music a [...] "mere way" [...] of making a noise, the statements are quite true; but they only show that I see no other method of depreciating some of the noblest aspects of humanity than that of using language in an inadequate and misleading sense about them. And the peculiar inappropriateness of this particular nickname to the views in question, arises from the circumstance which Mr. Mivart would doubtless have recollected, if his wish to ridicule had not for the moment obscured his judgment--that whether the law of evolution applies to man or not, that of hereditary transmission certainly does. Mr. Mivart will hardly deny that a man owes a large share of the moral tendencies which he exhibits to his ancestors; and the man who inherits a desire to steal from a kleptomaniac, or a tendency to benevolence from a Howard, is, so far as he illustrates hereditary transmission, comparable to the dog who inherits the desire to fetch a duck out of the water from his retrieving sire. So that, evolution, or no evolution, moral qualities are comparable to a [...] "kind of retrieving;" [...] though the comparison, if meant for the purposes of casting obloquy on evolution, does not say much for the fairness of those who make it.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Adams of 411mania {{rated the}} episode with 9/10 {{saying that it}} was another great episode. [...] "Modern Family has come back from the hiatus strong, and {{hopefully}} they can keep that momentum going. I felt like this episode really showcased every character, especially the Dunphy kids. The homage that they paid to the Godfather was absolutely classic, and it's those small bits that this show <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> so great." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to a blog on the band's {{official}} MySpace page, recording {{began on}} the 25th of June. By September 5, the record was finally tracked but not fully mixed, and given the title Susquehanna, after the river near where Perry grew up (up until then, the album went under a number of working titles, including Truth & Consequences and The Good Things).

5000|$|Nottingham Forest {{opted not}} to show their respects before their Football League One match with Huddersfield Town on New Year's Day. Forest manager Colin Calderwood, himself a former Scottish {{international}} with 36 caps, explained: [...] "I didn't particularly want a tribute. Sometimes I don't think it's appropriate to have them for every tragedy that happens. The {{fact that it was}} a boy in Scotland, <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> any different to a boy in Colombia?"

The Inner Party interrogator of thought-criminals, O'Brien, says of the mathematically false statement that control over physical reality is unimportant; so long as one controls one's own perceptions to what the Party wills, then any corporeal act is possible, in accordance with the principles of doublethink ("Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once").|$|E

One fan said [...] "the video looks like it cost $2", while another fan noted [...] "All her outfits were not very flattering of her figure. This to me is her worst video". Adam Bub of MusicFix defended the video, writing [...] "What's the fuss all about? There's no twerking, boozing or gratuitous body shots like other pop stars' clips... but <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a boring watch?

Neil Marshall had a number of endings in mind when he shot the film, so he was open making a switch." [...] Marshall compared the change to the ending of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, saying, [...] "Just because she gets away, <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a happy ending?".
