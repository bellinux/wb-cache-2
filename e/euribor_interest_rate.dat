The analysis also includes the 10 -year government bond yield, the threemonth <b>EURIBOR</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and GDP. The long-run link between M 3 growth and inflation is observable in the raw data. Over the years 1980 – 2006, we find that M 3 growth and inflation are cointegrated, which means that deviations from long-term average real money growth lead to mean-reverting adjustment processes to restore the average level of real money growth. The full effect of an unexpected monetary shock thus materializes over time {{in the level of}} inflation, after a transitory period during which GDP and interest rates have been affected as well. Out-of-sample yearly conditional inflation forecasts are produced from 2001 to 2006 which are compared to Eurosystem staff projections. Qualitatively, the monetary model predicts future inflation rates which are consistent with the ECB’s assessment of future inflation prospects. M 3, monetary analysis, inflation forecasts. ...|$|E
40|$|For an {{effective}} and smooth monetary policy, {{it is important that}} interest rate expectations are in line with central bank policy intentions. The predictability of money market interest rates is, therefore, an indicator of transparency and clarity in the communication of monetary policy and of the effectiveness of monetary policy implementation. In this paper, we analyse three aspects of the predictability of money market rates in the European Monetary Union (EMU). The first is the efficiency of the three-month <b>Euribor</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> futures markets. The second aspect is the effect of ECB policy announcements on the volatility of Euribor futures rates, and the third aspect is the effect of ECB policy announcements on the prediction error contained in Euribor futures rates. We find that the new Euro money markets were able to predict short-term rates well. Our results suggest that the ECB communication of monetary policy has worked well during the first years of EMU and that the predictability of ECB policy decisions seems to have improved over The authors thank Kenneth Kuttner and the participants at the Workshop on ‘Monetary Policy and the Money Market ’ held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Casper de Vries, Erik Theissen, and an anonymous referee for helpful comments...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an empirical analysis of European credit and interest rate derivative markets. By employing various econometric methods {{it looks to}} further understand the dynamics of these markets. This empirical research is conducted using European credit default swaps both corporate and sovereign and the European interbank deposit rate Euribor and its derivatives over a 13 year sample period 2001 to 2014. The sample period {{is a very interesting}} time to look at European nancial markets. The Euro currency and <b>Euribor</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> are both relatively new markets and since their introduction European nancial markets have been characterised by both stable and crisis periods. The rst part of this thesis looks at the European credit default swap (CDS) market. It investigates the risk return relationship in the CDS market and using a four factor higher moment CAPM model it tests whether CDS returns are commensurate with the level of systematic risk. Results suggest that European corporate CDS returns are commensurate with their level of systematic risk and that the inclusion of higher moments is important in explaining returns. Using European Sovereign CDS names a tractable methodology to model and forecast sovereign CDS term structure is employed. Over the volatile sample period the CDS term structure exhibits various shapes. Our results show that the CDS curve ts the data and slows for the various shapes exhibited by the CDS data including steep, inverted and downward sloping curves. Results show that the applied methodology is successful in forecasting CDS term structure over longer time horizons. The latter half of this thesis examines the Euribor market. It rst focuses on understanding the relationship between the Euribor futures market and the underlying reference rate from both the price discovery and volatility transfer perspective. A signi cant break down in the relationship between the deposit and future market during times of crisis is identi ed. Results suggest that the deposit rate is generally the more informationally e cient market, leading the futures market in price discovery and driving future market volatility through direct volatility spillovers from the deposit market. Lastly this thesis examines the jump characteristics of the 3 month Euribor futures contract and its corresponding futures option contracts. It extracts jump parameters and implied jump parameters using historical futures rates and option prices. Using the estimated jump parameters we use regression analysis {{to examine the relationship between}} ECB monetary policy announcements and the jump behaviour of the Euribor rate. The results show conclusive evidence of both positive and negative jumps in the Euribor rate using both historical futures and forward looking option prices...|$|E

40|$|Following Shimko (1993), a {{large amount}} of {{research}} has evolved around the problem of extracting risk neutral densities from options prices by interpolating the Balck-Scholes implied volatility smile. Some of the methods recently proposed use variants of the cubic spline. Thesee methods have the property of producing non-differentiable probability densities. We argue that this is an undesirable feature and suggest circumventing the problem by fitting a smoothing spline of higher order polynomials with a relatively low number of knot points. In the estimations we opt for a measure of roughness penalty, which is more appropriate than the plain second partial derivative often used. We apply this technique to the LIFFE three-month Euribor future option proces.

40|$|There {{are many}} ways of {{modeling}} stochastic processes of short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> One way is to use one-factor models which may be {{easy to use and}} easy to calibrate. Another way is to use a three-factor model in the strive for a higher degree of congruency with real world market data. Calibrating such models may however take much more effort. One of the main questions here is which models will be better fit to the data in question. Another question is if the use of a three-factor model can result in better fitting compared to one-factor models. This is investigated by using the Efficient Method of Moments to calibrate a three-factor model with a Lévy process. This model is an extension of the Chen Model. The calibration is done with <b>Euribor</b> 6 -month <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and these rates are also used with the Vasicek and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) models.
