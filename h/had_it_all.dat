They manage to lead the Klügs away from the reception and incapacitate them, {{only to find that}} none of them has the Zephyr. Jack realizes that the Klügs have been performing a shell game: the government has been pursuing them for the Zephyr when none of them ever had it; their father (Timothy V. Murphy) <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> along. Meanwhile, the bride's father realizes he is being conned and leads Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) away at gunpoint. When Chuck and Sarah confront him, Klüg uses Morgan as a human shield, but John Casey (Adam Baldwin) takes aim at his head. However, Jack manages to talk Klüg down {{for the sake of the}} bride's happiness.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

However, Kirill died just two years after his wife. Kirill, though he had been unfaithful, still loved and missed the wife he had depended so much upon and passed his remaining years writing memoirs of their life together. [...] "There are few who in one person combine all that is best in soul, mind, and body," [...] he wrote. [...] "She <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> and more.

500|$|Further delays on the Creek Turnpike project {{appeared}} {{inevitable in}} October 1990, {{as a new}} area meeting the federal definition of a wetland was discovered {{in the path of}} the turnpike. OTA officials did not bring the area to USACE's attention because they did not believe it met the criteria to be considered a wetland. Frustration mounted after the find; rumors surfaced that OTA was considering canceling the Creek Turnpike and shifting the remaining funds to turnpike projects in the Oklahoma City area. In an interview after an OTA meeting, chairman John Kilpatrick was quoted as saying [...] "God only knows when [...] be completed," [...] describing the project as a [...] "total disaster" [...] and commenting [...] "If we <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> to do over again, we wouldn't do that project." [...] OTA was concerned about the financial impact of USACE's delay in issuing the required permits; each day after the planned opening date that the project ran late added $20,000 (approximately $ in [...] dollars) to the total cost of the project. USACE finally issued the permit on November 15, over a year after OTA applied for it.|$|E

[...] In the conclusion of his review, Iverson gave the episode an eight out of ten. Brett Love of TV Squad also gave the episode a positive review, calling the installment much better than the previous two episode's from the season, [...] "Stewie Loves Lois" [...] and [...] "Mother Tucker", but criticized the storyline's similarity to the South Park episode [...] "Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes". Love commented negatively on the portrayal of Peter working at the superstore, however, stating, [...] "it's a fine line when they go retarded with Peter.

The song, with words by Grossmith's father and music by young Grossmith, concerns a photographer who broke {{the heart of a}} young lady named Miss Jenkins; so she drank his chemicals and died. In late 1870, the younger Grossmith appeared on his own with a nightly spot at the [...] "old Polytechnic" [...] in Regent Street, where comic sketches alternated with scientific and serious lectures for the entertainment of the public. [...] Human Oddities and another sketch, The Yellow Dwarf, were successful for Grossmith, and he took the former work on tour for six months. [...] An 1871 Grossmith sketch was called He was a Careful Man. Biographer Tony Joseph notes that, except for a few early pieces, nearly all of Grossmith's material was written and composed by Grossmith himself. [...] Joseph describes the sketches as [...] "a light-hearted sending up of various aspects of contemporary life and manners. ...he was the complete performer... as a pianist (he performed for the most part sitting at a piano)... as a raconteur... as a mimic, facial expression, timing—he <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> [...] A short, dapper figure, he turned his lack of inches to positive advantage, and audiences took to him everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The Lost Tapes was {{met with}} {{widespread}} acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 12 reviews. In Entertainment Weekly, Craig Seymour said Nas' [...] "gritty, yet hopeful, reflections made Lost Tapes a real find." [...] Rolling Stone critic Jon Caramanica hailed it as [...] "the real Stillmatic", writing that it [...] "displayed Nas' gifts for tightly stitched narrative and stunningly precise detail." [...] In The A.V. Club, Nathan Rabin deemed it a masterpiece whose assorted tracks cohered {{as well as any}} of Nas' official studio albums while reaffirming his reputation as [...] "rap music's poet laureate of urban despair". Ken Capobianco from The Boston Globe said the leftover songs proved why Nas had so much promise early in his career, while Spins Chris Ryan viewed the record as a hip hop version of Bob Dylan's much-bootlegged Basement Tapes—"a raw document [...] still proves that Nas <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> along." [...] PopMatters critic Marc L. Hill called it a [...] "masterfully arranged" [...] and [...] "necessary addition to the collection of any hip-hop fan". In The Village Voice, Christgau was particularly impressed by the four autobiographical songs closing the album, preferring them to other songs he felt were nothing more than outtakes. In a less enthusiastic review, Brett Berliner from Stylus Magazine wrote that as good as the songs were, [...] "they don't make a real album ... like a superb mixtape", while Billboards Rashaun Hall believed the production on some of the songs sounded outdated.|$|E
