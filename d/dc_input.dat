25|$|Vibrating reed electrometers use a {{variable}} capacitor formed between a moving electrode (in {{the form of}} a vibrating reed) and a fixed input electrode. As the distance between the two electrodes varies, the capacitance also varies and electric charge is forced {{in and out of the}} capacitor. The alternating current signal produced by the flow of this charge is amplified and used as an analogue for the DC voltage applied to the capacitor. The <b>DC</b> <b>input</b> resistance of the electrometer is determined solely by the leakage resistance of the capacitor, and is typically extremely high, (although its AC input impedance is lower).|$|E
25|$|Mirror-image {{insertion}} protection {{means that}} a regulator is designed for use when a voltage, usually not higher than the maximum input voltage of the regulator, is applied to its output pin while its input terminal is at a low voltage, volt-free or grounded. Some regulators can continuously withstand this situation. Others might only manage it for a limited time such as 60 seconds (usually specified in the data sheet). For instance, this situation can occur when a three terminal regulator is incorrectly mounted on a PCB, with the output terminal connected to the unregulated <b>DC</b> <b>input</b> and the input connected to the load. Mirror-image insertion protection is also important when a regulator circuit is used in battery charging circuits, when external power fails or is not turned on and the output terminal remains at battery voltage.|$|E

2500|$|Often the {{observed}} signal is offset by a steady component, {{and only the}} changes are of interest. A switch (AC position) connects a capacitor in series with the input that passes only the changes (provided {{that they are not}} too slow -- [...] "slow" [...] would mean visible). However, when the signal has a fixed offset of interest, or changes quite slowly, the input is connected directly (DC switch position). Most oscilloscopes offer the <b>DC</b> <b>input</b> option.
