5|$|The {{only part}} of the region that is {{predominantly}} <b>given</b> <b>over</b> to crops is the land around the Humber estuary, where the well-drained fens result in excellent quality land. The lowland Cheshire Plain is mostly <b>given</b> <b>over</b> to dairy farming, while in the Pennines and Cheviots grazing sheep play an important role not just in agriculture but also in land management more generally. Heather moorland in the Pennine uplands is home to driven grouse shooting from 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth) until 10 December every year. In the twentieth century, numbers of red grouse and black grouse in the area fell significantly, but improved gamekeeping practices have resulted in both species making a comeback in the region.|$|E

5|$|About 78% of {{the land}} surface of Wales is <b>given</b> <b>over</b> to {{agricultural}} use.), Wales area 20,779 km2 However, very little of this is arable land; the vast majority consists of permanent grass pasture or rough grazing for herd animals such as sheep and cows. Although both beef and dairy cattle are raised widely, especially in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, Wales is more well known for its sheep farming and thus lamb is the meat traditionally associated with Welsh cooking.|$|E

5|$|The 20th century {{saw many}} {{changes in farming}} on Shapinsay. Mechanised {{implements}} came to the island, particularly after the Second World War. In common {{with the rest of}} Orkney, the amount of land <b>given</b> <b>over</b> to growing grass increased. The growing of grain (with the exception of barley) and turnips steadily declined as these were replaced as winter fodder for livestock by silage, usually harvested by mechanical forage harvesters.|$|E
5|$|The records {{also show}} {{that part of the}} parish of Navenby was {{enclosed}} in 1772. Such was the significance of Navenby at this time that a workhouse for the parish poor was erected here, although the building was later <b>given</b> <b>over</b> to other uses. A Sick Society was founded in 1811 and a Parish School was built next to St Peter's Church in 1816, paid for by subscription. Following the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act Navenby parish became part of the Lincoln Poor Law Union.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the twelfth}} century, in {{contrast}} to England, there were few parish churches in Scotland. Churches had collegiate bodies of clergy who served over a wide area, often tied together by devotion to a particular missionary saint. From this period local lay landholders, perhaps following the example of David I, began to adopt the continental practice of building churches on their property for the local population and endowing them with land and a priest. The foundation of these churches began in the south, spreading to the north-east and then the west, being almost universal by the first survey of the Scottish Church for papal taxation in 1274. The administration of these parishes was often <b>given</b> <b>over</b> to local monastic institutions in {{a process known as}} appropriation. By the time of the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century 80 per cent of Scottish parishes were appropriated.|$|E
5|$|By 1683 the College {{part of the}} {{structure}} was finished. The new building was built out of plain bricks of three storeys, with basement and attic levels in addition. The College consists of an extensive range of quadrangular buildings. Apart from the hall, a porter's lodge and a public office, {{the rest of the}} building was <b>given</b> <b>over</b> to the heralds as accommodation. To the east and south sides three terraced houses were constructed for leases, their façade in keeping with the original design. In 1699 the hall, which for some time had been used as a library, was transformed into the Earl Marshal's Court or the Court of Chivalry; it remains so to this day. In 1776 some stylistic changes were made to the exterior of the building and some details, such as pediments and cornices were removed, transforming the building to the then popular but austere Neo-Classical style.|$|E

5|$|By the 7th century Reculver {{had become}} a landed estate of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent. The site of the Roman fort was <b>given</b> <b>over</b> for the {{establishment}} of a monastery dedicated to St Mary in 669AD, and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried there in the 760s. During the Middle Ages Reculver was a thriving township with a weekly market and a yearly fair, and it was a member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich. The settlement declined as the Wantsum Channel silted up, and coastal erosion claimed many buildings constructed on the soft sandy cliffs. The village was largely abandoned in the late 18th century, and most of the church was demolished in the early 19th century. Protecting the ruins and the rest of Reculver from erosion is an ongoing challenge.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 12th century the former {{territory}} of the kingdom of the Rhinns was part of Galloway kingdom, but the area to the north was not. Strathgryfe, Kyle and Cunningham had come {{under the control of the}} Scottish king in the early 12th century, much of it <b>given</b> <b>over</b> to soldiers of French or Anglo-French origin. Strathgryfe and most of Kyle had been given to Walter fitz Alan under King David I, with Hugh de Morville taking Cunningham. Strathnith still had a Gaelic ruler (ancestor of the famous Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray), but he was not part of the kingdom of Galloway. The rest of the region—the Rhinns, Farines, Carrick, Desnes Mór and Desnes Ioan, and the sparsely settled uplands of Glenken—was probably under the control of the sons of Fergus, King of Galloway, in the years before Donnchadh's career in the region.|$|E
5|$|During {{his life}} and those of his sons, Constantine was {{presented}} as a paragon of virtue. Pagans such as Praxagoras of Athens and Libanius showered him with praise. When {{the last of his}} sons died in 361, however, his nephew (and son-in-law) Julian the Apostate wrote the satire Symposium, or the Saturnalia, which denigrated Constantine, calling him inferior to the great pagan emperors, and <b>given</b> <b>over</b> to luxury and greed. Following Julian, Eunapius began—and Zosimus continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for weakening the Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.|$|E

5|$|From 1925, Bayern {{shared the}} Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich. Until World War II, the stadium {{was owned by}} 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as Sechz'ger ("Sixties") Stadium. It was {{destroyed}} during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season. In the Bundesliga era the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000 which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period's stadiums, {{the vast majority of}} the stadium was <b>given</b> <b>over</b> to terracing. Today the second teams of both clubs play in the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Henry III granted Kenilworth in 1244 to Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, {{who later}} became {{a leader in the}} Second Barons' War (1263–67) against the king, using Kenilworth as the centre of his operations. Initially the {{conflict}} went badly for King Henry, and after the Battle of Lewes in 1264 he was forced to sign the Mise of Lewes, under which his son, Prince Edward, was <b>given</b> <b>over</b> to the rebels as a hostage. Edward was taken back to Kenilworth, where chroniclers considered he was held in unduly harsh conditions. Released in early 1265, Edward then defeated Montfort at the Battle of Evesham; the surviving rebels under the leadership of Henry de Hastings, Montfort's constable at Kenilworth, regrouped at the castle the following spring. Edward's forces proceeded to lay siege to the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Marriage most {{commonly}} involved a betrothal (engue), before the bride was <b>given</b> <b>over</b> {{to her new}} husband and kyrios (ekdosis). A less common form of marriage, practised {{in the case of}} epikleroi, required a court judgement (epidikasia). Athenian women married with a dowry, which was intended to provide their livelihood. Depending on the family, a dowry might have been as much as 25 percent of the family's wealth. Daughters of even the poorest families apparently had dowries worth ten minae. Rich families could provide much larger dowries; Demosthenes' sister, for instance, had a dowry of two talents (120 minae). Dowries usually consisted of movable goods and cash, although land was occasionally included.|$|E
