25|$|A hyeong is a systematic, {{prearranged}} {{sequence of}} martial techniques that is performed either {{with or without}} the use of a weapon. In dojangs (taekwondo training gymnasiums) hyeong are used primarily as a form of <b>interval</b> <b>training</b> that is useful in developing mushin, proper kinetics and mental and physical fortitude. Hyeong may resemble combat, but are artistically non-combative and woven together so as to be an effective conditioning tool. One's aptitude for a particular hyeong may be evaluated in competition. In such competitions, hyeong are evaluated by a panel of judges who base the score on many factors including energy, precision, speed, and control. In Western competitions, there are two general classes of hyeong: creative and standard. Creative hyeong are created by the performer and are generally acrobatic in nature and do not necessarily reflect the kinetic principles intrinsic in any martial system.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of continuous exercise <b>training</b> and <b>interval</b> exercise <b>training</b> on the OUES in patients with coronary artery disease. Thirty-five patients (59. 3 ± 1. 8 years old; 28 men, 7 women) with coronary artery disease were randomly divided into two groups: continuous exercise training (n= 18) and <b>interval</b> exercise <b>training</b> (n= 17). All patients performed graded exercise tests with respiratory gas analysis before and 3 months after the exercise-training program to determine ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT), respiratory compensation point, and peak oxygen consumption (peak VO 2). The OUES was assessed based on data from the second minute of exercise until exhaustion by calculating the slope of the linear relation between oxygen uptake and the logarithm of total ventilation. After the interventions, both groups showed increased aerobic fitness (P< 0. 05). In addition, both the continuous exercise and <b>interval</b> exercise <b>training</b> groups demonstrated an increase in OUES (P< 0. 05). Significant associations were observed in both groups: 1) continuous exercise training (OUES and peak VO 2 r= 0. 57; OUES and VO 2 VAT r= 0. 57); 2) <b>interval</b> exercise <b>training</b> (OUES and peak VO 2 r= 0. 80; OUES and VO 2 VAT r= 0. 67).

Different exercise protocols {{are required to}} promote axon regeneration in male and female animals, but the sex requirements for an effect of exercise on synaptic stripping are unknown. In male and female C 57 BL/ 6 mice, the sciatic nerve was transected in the mid-thigh. Mice were then exercised five days per week for two weeks, beginning on the third post-transection day. Half of the exercised mice were trained by walking slowly (10 M/min) on a level treadmill for one hour per day (continuous training). Other mice were interval trained; four short (two min) sprints at 20 M/min separated by five minute rest periods. A third group was untrained. The extent of synaptic contacts made by structures immunoreactive to vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 onto axotomized motoneurons was studied in confocal images of retrogradely labeled cells.
