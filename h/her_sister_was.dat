5|$|Both ships {{played a}} small role in World War I as they unsuccessfully hunted for the German East Asia Squadron in late 1914. They became {{training}} ships {{later in the}} war. Tsukuba was destroyed in an accidental magazine explosion in 1917 and subsequently scrapped. <b>Her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> disarmed in 1922 {{in accordance with the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and broken up for scrap in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Between 1891 and 1897, the {{two ships}} were heavily rebuilt as armored cruisers. They were {{significantly}} rearmed {{with a large}} number of medium and smaller caliber guns. Kaiser served in Asian waters from 1897 to 1899, while <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> on the Asia station from 1898 to 1900. Admiral Otto von Diederichs, then the commander of the East Asia Squadron, used Kaiser for his flagship. The ship was involved in the Kiautschou Bay concession seizure in November 1897 and was later deployed to protect German interests in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Alexandra {{spent the}} spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period of ill health and visiting her brother King George of Greece. During the Russo-Turkish War, Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia, where <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> married to the Tsarevitch, and she lobbied for a {{revision}} of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks. Alexandra and her two sons spent {{the next three years}} largely parted from each other's company as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education. The farewell was very tearful and, as shown by her regular letters, she missed them dreadfully. In 1881, Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to Saint Petersburg after the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, both to represent Britain and so that Alexandra could provide comfort to her sister, who was now the Tsarina.|$|E

5|$|Alice and Hugh I {{married in}} the first half of 1210, with Alice {{receiving}} the County of Jaffa as the agreed upon dowry. Alice's sister, Philippa, married Erard of Ramerupt, who laid claim to Champagne and Brie on Philippa's behalf in 1213. Blanche of Navarre soon approached the Holy See to demand an investigation into the validity of the second and third marriage of Alice's and Philippa's mother, stating that her first marriage to Humphrey IV of Toron had not been canonically annulled. The inquiry conducted by Cardinal Robert of Courçon at the pope's order concluded that both Humphrey IV and Isabella I had protested against the annulment of their marriage, which suggested that Isabella I's two subsequent marriages were unlawful. However, the Holy See did not complete the investigation and thus the legitimacy of Alice (and <b>her</b> <b>sister)</b> <b>was</b> not questioned.|$|E
5|$|Hollis {{is a young}} Federal Bureau of Investigation {{special agent}} who becomes a protégée to {{offender}} profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) when he begins working in Virginia. She struggles to understand the criminal mind, as <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> murdered by a man with no motive. She has an estranged half-sister, Tamra, who has become a heroin addict. Hollis also {{has to deal with}} her father's bout with an Alzheimer's-like illness, which has possibly been induced by the Millennium Group—a secretive organisation to which Black had previously belonged, and which he now believes to be responsible for bioterrorism. Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) uses Hollis' father's illness as leverage to coerce her into cooperating with the Millennium Group.|$|E
5|$|The deepest rift in the Pankhurst {{family came}} in November 1913 when Sylvia {{spoke at a}} meeting of socialists and trade unionists in support of labour {{organiser}} Jim Larkin. She had been working with the East London Federation of Suffragettes (ELFS), a local branch of the WSPU which had a close relationship with socialists and organised labour. The close connection to labour groups and Sylvia's appearance on stage with Frederick Pethick-Lawrence – who also addressed the crowd – convinced Christabel that <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> organising a group that might challenge the WSPU in the suffrage movement. The dispute became public, and members of groups including the WSPU, ILP, and ELFS braced themselves for a showdown.|$|E

5|$|In June 1943, {{a series}} of Allied air raids {{attacked}} La Spezia {{in an attempt to}} neutralize the three battleships. On 5 June, she was hit by two large bombs that struck her port side. She was transferred to Genoa for repairs, which were not completed before the Armistice that ended Italian participation in the war. Littorio was hit by three bombs on 19 June, a week after <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> damaged. She was renamed Italia after Benito Mussolini's regime collapsed. Roma was damaged during the 5 June attack and again in a third attack on 23 June. In September 1943, following the withdrawal of Italy from the war, all three ships and {{a significant portion of the}} Italian fleet left port to be interned in Malta. While en route, German bombers laden with Fritz-X radio-guided bombs attacked the formation. One hit Italia in the bow forward the main battery turrets, causing serious damage. Two hit Roma; one passed through the ship and exploded under her keel, and the second hit near the forward magazines. The bomb detonated the magazines, causing a massive explosion that destroyed the ship with heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November, Vizeadmiral Prince Heinrich, who had {{replaced}} Hoffmann as the I Squadron commander, raised his flag aboard Kaiser Friedrich III; the ship held the role as squadron flagship {{for the next}} three years, interrupted only during the annual fleet exercises conducted in August and September, when Admiral Hans von Koester, the Generalinspekteur der Marine (Inspector-General of the Navy), commanded the fleet from Kaiser Wilhelm II. Through November, the ships of the squadron were occupied with individual training. On 17 November 1900, Kaiser Friedrich III was steaming to Kiel after conducting training exercises. Kaiser Wilhelm II attempted to pass Kaiser Friedrich III, so the latter stopped and allowed the former to pass to port. However, the order to resume steaming was given too quickly, and the ship accidentally rammed Kaiser Wilhelm II. Kaiser Friedrich III suffered minor damage to her bow, while <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> slightly damaged in the compartment that housed the steering engines. Repairs were completed within three days, without the need for either vessel to enter drydock. On 4 December, the ships began a winter training cruise, during which they stopped in Larvik, Norway, from 10 to 12 December. The squadron returned to Germany three days later.|$|E
