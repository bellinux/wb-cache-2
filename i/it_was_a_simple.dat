5|$|In the {{so-called}} modern {{synthesis of the}} early 20th century, Ronald Fisher brought together Darwin's theory of evolution, with its insistence on natural selection, heredity, and variation, and Gregor Mendel's laws of genetics into a coherent structure for evolutionary biology. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through mutations in these genes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple,</b> clear and nearly comprehensive picture: {{but it did not}} explain embryology.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Henry's expansion, StPeter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had {{previously}} stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls {{for himself and his}} queen. It was rebuilt by EdwardI at a cost of over £300 and again by HenryVIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19thcentury. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built {{at the same time as}} the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16thcentury, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.|$|E

25|$|This {{station was}} built in 1926 for the {{residents}} of the moshav Kfar Baruch, {{to the north of the}} village. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> shack for awaiting passengers and had neither a ticket booth, nor tickets printed for the station. Therefore, the residents had to haggle with the train conductor on the train in hopes of being let in. Today, there are no remnants left of the station.|$|E
25|$|This station, {{also called}} Al Roy in English, was built {{next to the}} Kishon River (a wadi) to serve {{residents}} of moshav Elro'i, today part of Kiryat Tiv'on. Originally, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> wooden construction, similar to a bus stop. Later, it was converted into a small brick shed. The shed was later renovated by the residents of Elro'i. A small museum commemorating the Valley Railway now exists at the site.|$|E

25|$|In all {{versions}} of the story, Stephens shoots and kills a chicken on his own property. The accounts diverge as to Stephens' motives in shooting the chicken. One account states that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> misunderstanding, and that Stephens had thought the wayward chicken was his own. In his history of North Carolina, William Powell paints a picture of Stephens as a vindictive man, who killed the chicken almost purely out of spite.|$|E
25|$|In 1918 an {{opportunity}} presented itself that intrigued {{him with a}} training course offered by the Davy Tree Expert company in Kent, Ohio.

In 1835, John Polding became the first archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church in Australia. In 1851 the church was modified to the designs of Augustus Welby Pugin. Father Therry died on 25 May 1864. On 29 June 1865, the church caught fire and was destroyed.|$|E

While appealing the sentence, he returned to Tainan to run for county magistrate in November 1985. Three days after losing the election, his wife, Wu Shu-chen was hit twice by a hand tractor driven by Chang Jong-tsai as Chen and Wu were thanking their supporters. She was left paralyzed from the waist down. His supporters believed this was part of a government campaign to intimidate him, although another theory says <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> traffic accident.|$|E

He invested heavily in gold and, when he and Mallison used various couriers to plant the false information in the press the following morning, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> matter for him to sell his shares once the price had risen enough for him to make a huge profit.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish Constitution of 1921 was the {{fundamental}} law of Turkey {{for a brief}} period from 1921 to 1924. It was ratified by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in January 1921. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> document consisting of only 23 short articles. The major driving force behind the preparation of a 1921 Constitution that derived its sovereignty from the nation and not from the Sultan, the absolute monarch of the Ottoman Empire. The 1921 Constitution also served as the legal basis for the Turkish War of Independence during 1919–1923, since it would refute the principles of the Treaty of Sèvres of 1918 signed by the Ottoman Empire, by which a great majority of the Empire's territory would have to be ceded to the Entente powers that had won the First World War. In October 1923 the constitution was amended to declare Turkey to be a republic.|$|E

25|$|The {{next few}} years saw Rundgren {{recording}} under the pseudonym TR-i ("Todd Rundgren interactive") for two albums. The first of these, 1993's No World Order, consisted of hundreds of seconds-long snippets of music, that could be combined in various ways to suit the listener. Initially targeted for the Philips CD-i platform, No World Order featured interactive controls for tempo, mood, and other parameters, along with pre-programmed mixes by Rundgren himself, Bob Clearmountain, Don Was and Jerry Harrison. The disc was also released for PC and Macintosh and in two versions on standard audio CD, the continuous mix disc No World Order and, later, the more song-oriented No World Order Lite. The music itself was quite a departure from Rundgren's previous work, with a dance/techno feel and much rapping by Rundgren. The follow-up, The Individualist (1995), featured interactive video content, that could be viewed or in one case, played; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> video game along with the music, which was more rock-oriented than No World Order.|$|E
25|$|The ballot {{consisted}} of two questions; voters could vote on one or the other, or on both. The first question asked whether Gray Davis should be recalled. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> yes/no question, and if a majority voted no, then the second question would become irrelevant and Gray Davis would remain California governor. If a majority voted yes, then Davis would {{be removed from office}} once the vote was certified, and the second question would determine his successor. Voters had to choose one candidate from a long list of 135 candidates. Voters who voted against recalling Gray Davis could still vote for a candidate to replace him in case the recall vote succeeded. The candidate receiving the most votes (a plurality) would then become the next governor of California. Certification by the Secretary of State of California would require completion within 39 days of the election, and history indicated that it could require that entire time frame to certify the statewide election results. Once the results were certified, a newly elected governor would have to be sworn into office within 10 days.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{example is}} the Soviet S4M pistol, {{designed}} to be used expressly {{for the purpose of}} assassination. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> break-open, two-shot derringer, but the unique features came from its specialized ammunition, designed around a cut-down version of the 7.62mm rounds used in the Soviet AK-47. The casings of the round contained a piston-like plunger between the bullet and the powder that would move forward inside the casing when fired. The piston would push the round down the barrel and plug the end of the casing, completely sealing off any explosive gases in the casing. This, combined with the inherently low-velocity round resulted in a truly silent pistol. The nature of the gun and ammunition led to it being wildly inaccurate outside of point-blank range. To add further confusion and throw possible suspicion away from the assassin, the barrel rifling was designed to affect the bullet {{in such a way that}} ballistics experts would not only conclude that the round was fired from an AK-47, but that the round was fired from several hundred feet away. Due to the politically devastating nature inherent in this design, the S4M was kept highly secret. Information on the pistol was not known by western governments until well after the end of the Cold War.|$|E
