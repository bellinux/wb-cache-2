40|$|Changes in the {{structure}} and composition of the carabid fauna were studied in a former intertidal saltmarsh and sandflat of the Markiezaat area (The Netherlands) after this became embanked. Nine years of study revealed a rapid replacement of the original halophytic plant community and halobiontic carabid community by a mesophytic graminous plant community and associated carabid assemblage, consisting of halotolerant or <b>halophobe</b> species. Desalination and drainage explains most of the variance after Canonical Correspondance Analysis and {{are considered to be}} the main driving forces of succession. It is shown however, that a muck of the reason for change might derive from microclimatical and structural changes in vegetation.

40|$|Diatoms {{composing}} benthic microbial mats in Skarvsnes lakes, East Antarctica, {{were studied}} {{in terms of}} their taxonomy and relationship to environmental factors. Samples were collected from 13 freshwater lakes in the area. Amphora sp. (cf. veneta) was dominant in 11 of the 13 samples, while Craticula sp. (cf. molesta) and Diadesmis sp. (cf. perpusilla) were respectively dominant in the remaining 2 samples. Navicula ectoris Van de Vijver was also reported {{here for the first time}} in continental Antarctica. Mosses in the microbial mats did not have a significant effect on the diatom species composition. Redundancy analysis revealed that the main environmental gradient for diatoms was electric conductivity, despite its relatively narrow range (18 - 390 mS m^(- 1)). Our results suggest that Diadesmis sp. and Psammothidium metakryophilum are <b>halophobes,</b> whereas Amphora sp. is a halophile...|$|R
