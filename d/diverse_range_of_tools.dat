This diversification of monitoring tools also represents many potential issues, namely that smaller and less popular tools may lose developers and support if it recedes from vogue. Furthermore a <b>diverse</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> requires a significant effort to orchestrate the communication between these tools. Unless there is a shared language, protocol or format the orchestration of these tools can become a troublesome.|$|E
40|$|While the {{majority}} of macromolecular X-ray data are currently collected using highly efficient beamlines at an ever-increasing number of synchrotrons, {{there is still a}} need for high-performance reliable systems for in-house experi-ments. In addition to crystal screening and optimization of data-collection parameters before a synchrotron trip, the home system allows the collection of data as soon as the crystals are produced to obtain the solution of novel structures, especially by the molecular-replacement method, and is invaluable in achieving the quick turnover that is often required for ligand-binding studies in the pharmaceutical industry. There has been a continuous evolution of X-ray sources, detectors and software developed for in-house use in recent years and a <b>diverse</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> for structural biology laboratories are available. An overview of the main directions of these developments and examples of specific solutions available to the macromolecular crystallography community are presented in this paper, showing that data collection ‘at home ’ is still an attractive proposition complementing the use of synchrotron beamlines...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multimodal toolkit for rapid performance-driven façade design that includes both virtual and physical performance feedback. The toolkit has been user {{tested in the}} SmartGeometry 2013 event by the Thermal Reticulations workshop cluster. Although the workshop participants were predominately digital design focused, the authors observed several distinct approaches to the tool selection and workflow involving both physical and virtual simulations, with a favoring to tools that produce fast visual outcomes. The approaches to tool selection are presented here as case studies with their workflow mapped for discussion. We conclude that access to a <b>diverse</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> simulation <b>tools</b> for design evaluation is advantageous to the creativity of the design process...|$|R
40|$|During {{their final}} year {{undergraduate}} project a student may feel under-supported, stressed or isolated. In an internally funded project {{we set out}} to investigate the benefits of using a diverse blend of collaboration and communication tools alongside traditional methods of final year project supervision. We established separate formal and informal communication channels between the supervisor and their project students and a community of practice of students and supervisors was set up using twitter or a web forum. Using a wiki as a collaborative workspace and repository, student project pages were created and virtual supervision was blended with face-to-face supervision using electronic logs. At first some students were dubious about our approach and disapproved of {{at least one of the}} tools used. The supervisors were also initially sceptical of an increase in workload due to the multiplicity of tools used. In this paper we present how the staff and students benefited precisely because of the <b>diverse</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> used. The methods used resulted in transparency of students’ and supervisors’ actions, however, lessons were learnt about how to address student concerns about plagiarism in such an open environment...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - As {{part of an}} HEFCE LGM funded project, {{this paper}} {{analyses}} individual experiences of learning evaluation in UK Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and identifies areas for improvement. Design/methodology/approach - Eight focus groups were carried out in two Universities with staff in similar roles. After transcription, the data was analysed using template analysis to identify and compare key themes from across both universities. Findings - The context of UK HE is clearly important, due to the diverse job roles and on-going sectoral changes. Three key themes emerged; firstly a lack of clarity from the learners on learning evaluation. The second key theme centres on the format, method and timing of capturing evaluation data and the perception that a ‘one size fits all’ approach is not appropriate. The third finding suggests that line managers do not currently fulfil their critical roles in the process. Research limitations/implications - Small number of research participants and a focus on two Universities. In addition, participants were relying on their memories of past evaluation experiences. Practical implications - Ensuring learners understand reasons for evaluating their learning is important. HEIs should utilise a more <b>diverse</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> {{at the design stage}} to collect evaluation data. All stakeholder roles need to be clarified, and line managers require additional support. Originality/value - Firstly we address a gap in the existing sector-specific literature identified by Burgoyne et al (2009) who contend that {{there is a lack of}} research in this area. Secondly we contribute to the development of research in the journal by analysing evaluation from the perspective of the participants and thirdly we offer recommendations for practice...|$|E

However, in order to carry out these activities researchers must interact with disparate Internet bioinformatics resources either manually, utilising software libraries such as BioPerl and more recently via web services, such as BioMoby [1, 2]. More often than not, molecular biologists find that the bottleneck in analysis becomes the burden of data and information integration.

40|$|A <b>diverse</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>tools</b> and {{techniques}} {{can be used}} to observe the clinical consultation and the use of information technology. These technologies range from transcripts; to video observation with one or more cameras; to voice and pattern recognition applications. Currently, these have to be observed separately and there is limited capacity to combine them. Consequently, when multiple methods are used to analyse the consultation a significant proportion of time is spent linking events in one log file (e. g. mouse movements and keyboard use when prescribing alerts appear) with {{what was happening in the}} consultation at that time. The objective of this study was to develop an application capable of combining and comparing activity log-files and with facilities to view simultaneously all data relating to any time point or activity. Interviews, observations and design prototypes were used to develop a specification. Class diagram of the application design was used to make further development decisions. The application development used object-orientated design principles. We used open source tools; Java as the programming language and JDeveloper as the development environment. The final output is log file aggregation (LFA) tool which forms part of the wider aggregation of log files for analysis (ALFA) open source toolkit (www. biomedicalinformatics. info/alfa/). Testing was done using sample log files and reviewed the application's utility for analysis of the consultation activities. Separation of the presentation and functionality in the design stage enabled us to develop a modular and extensible application. The application is capable of converting and aggregating several log files of different formats and displays them in different presentation layouts. We used the Java Media Framework to aggregate video channels. Java extensible mark-up language (XML) package facilitated the conversion of aggregated output into XML format. Analysts can now move easily between observation tools and find all the data related to an activity. The LFA application makes new analysis tasks feasible and established tasks much more efficient. Researchers can now store multiple log file data as a single file isolate and investigate different doctor-computer-patient interaction...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{objective}}: This study’s {{objective was}} to examine the current assessment practices of SLPs working with adults with acquired cognitive communication impairments following a TBI. Methods and procedures: Two hundred and sixty-five SLPs from the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand responded to the online survey stating the areas of communication frequently assessed and the assessment tools they use. Main outcomes and results: SLPs reported that they routinely assessed functional communication (78. 8 %), whereas domains such as discourse were routinely assessed by {{less than half of the}} group (44. 3 %). Clinicians used aphasia and cognitive communication/high level language tools and tools assessing functional performance, discourse, pragmatic skills or informal assessments were used by less than 10 % of the group. The country and setting of service delivery influenced choice <b>of</b> assessment <b>tools</b> used in clinical practice. Conclusions: These findings have implications for training of SLPs in a more <b>diverse</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> assessment <b>tools</b> for this clinical group. The findings raise questions regarding the statistical validity and reliability of assessments currently used in clinical practice. It highlights the need for further research into how SLPs can be supported in translating current evidence about the use <b>of</b> assessment <b>tools</b> into clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|The World Wide Web (WWW) is a {{successful}} hypermedia information space used by millions of people, yet it su#ers from many deficiencies and problems in support for navigation around its vast information space. In this paper we identify the origins of these navigation problems, namely WWW browser design, WWW page design, and WWW page description languages. Regardless of their origins, these problems are eventually represented to the user at the browser's user interface. To help overcome these problems, many tools are being developed which allow users to visualise WWW subspaces. We identify five key issues {{in the design and}} functionality of these visualisation systems: characteristics of the visual representation, the scope of the subspace representation, the mechanisms for generating the visualisation, the degree of browser independence, and the navigation support facilities. We provide a critical review <b>of</b> the <b>diverse</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> WWW visualisation <b>tools</b> with respect to these issues...|$|R
40|$|Development {{of dynamic}} state {{estimation}} techniques and their applications in problems of identification in structural engineering {{have been taken}} up. The thrust of the study has been the identification of structural systems that exhibit nonlinear behavior, mainly {{in the form of}} constitutive and geometric nonlinearities. Methods encompassing both linearization based strategies and those involving nonlinear filtering have been explored. The applications of derivative-free locally transversal linearization (LTL) and multi-step transversal linearization (MTrL) schemes for developing newer forms of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm have been explored. Apart from the inherent advantages of these methods in avoiding gradient calculations, the study also demonstrates their superior numerical accuracy and considerably less sensitivity to the choice of step sizes. The <b>range</b> <b>of</b> numerical illustrations covers SDOF as well as MDOF oscillators with time-invariant parameters and those with discontinuous temporal variations. A new form of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) filter is developed which explores the scope of the existing SIS filters to cover nonlinear measurement equations and more general forms of noise involving multiplicative and (or) Gaussian/ non-Gaussian noises. The formulation of this method involves Ito-Taylor’s expansions of the nonlinear functions in the measurement equation and the development of the ideal ispdf while accounting for the non-Gaussian terms appearing in the governing equation. Numerical illustrations on parameter identification of a few nonlinear oscillators and a geometrically nonlinear Euler–Bernoulli beam reveal a remarkably improved performance of the proposed methods over one of the best known algorithms, i. e. the unscented particle filter. The study demonstrates the applicability <b>of</b> <b>diverse</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> mathematical <b>tools</b> including Magnus’ functional expansions, theory of SDE-s, Ito-Taylor’s expansions and simulation and characterization of the non-Gaussian random variables to the problem of nonlinear structural system identification...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} reasons why {{there is so little}} public expenditure on education in Peru {{at a time when the}} economy has been growing very rapidly. Although different possible causes have been identified, the study focuses on the role played by Peru´s rising middle class (RMC) with its increasing opting out of state services in education as a complementary hypothesis. Drawing on the multilevel explanatory scheme proposed by Bourdieu, who makes explicit the connections between system properties, the nature of habituated dispositions to act held by social members, and the effective practices they adopt (Nash 2010), the study explores how the disposition (habitus) to assume individual responsibility in the provision of education services has been formed in a sample of RMC families that have chosen private schools for their children. I argue that the structures of RMC life, specifically their historical relationship with the Peruvian state characterized by its weak and exclusionary practices, the political and economic neoliberalism that has prevailed in the last decade, has influenced the adoption of the RMC´s rejection of state education through the incorporation of a dominant „common sense‟ in relation to the withdrawal of the state as guarantor of education provision, and this social group‟s view of itself as self-enterprising citizens. The research found that the assumption of this RMC position has also been strongly influenced by the rapid transformation of this rising sector characterized by upward social mobility, where the preference for private schools strengthens their position within a highly segmented social hierarchy. A <b>diverse</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> conceptual <b>tools</b> are utilised mainly from Bourdieu´s theoretical framework, with habitus as the central explanatory concept and its interaction with the concepts of capital and field, for a better understanding of school choice and class formation processes. Likewise, the research explores the potential of the Foucauldian approach to structuring subjectivities, expressed in his concept of governmentality, to explain the effect of the prevalence of a neo-liberal discourse in the construction of habitus. The study is qualitative using discussion groups and in-depth interviews with a sample of Peruvian RMC parents in order to explore the habitus formation process. An intergenerational perspective that takes into account the narratives of educational trajectories of RMC grandparents, parents and children offers a unique opportunity for a dynamic study of the process of structuring and re-structuring of habitus for education provision that shows relative malleability throughout this group‟s trajectory. In turn, the use of a comparative approach regarding two fractions of the rising group allows us to arrive at an understanding of the field as a whole...|$|R
