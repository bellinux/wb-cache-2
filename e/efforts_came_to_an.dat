500|$|Operation Auca was {{an attempt}} by five Evangelical Christian missionaries from the United States to bring Christianity to the Huaorani people {{of the rain forest}} of Ecuador. The Huaorani, also known by the pejorative Aucas (a {{modification}} of awqa, the Quechua word for [...] "savages"), were an isolated tribe known for their violence, against both their own people and outsiders who entered their territory. With the intention of being the first Christians to evangelize the previously uncontacted Huaorani, the missionaries began making regular flights over Huaorani settlements in September 1955, dropping gifts, which were reciprocated. After several months of exchanging gifts, on January 3, 1956, the missionaries established a camp at [...] "Palm Beach", a sandbar along the Curaray River, a few kilometers from Huaorani settlements. Their <b>efforts</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end on January 8, 1956, when all five—Jim Elliot, Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youderian—were attacked and speared by a group of Huaorani warriors. The news of their deaths was broadcast around the world, and Life magazine covered the event with a photo essay.|$|E
60|$|The {{close time}} for {{impersonation}} <b>efforts</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{end with the}} final withdrawal of Moritz and Augusta from the piano. Blanche Boveal retired early, leaving the room {{in a series of}} laboured leaps that she hoped might be recognised as a tolerable imitation of Pavlova. Vera Durmot, the sixteen-year-old flapper, expressed her confident opinion that the performance was intended to typify Mark Twain’s famous jumping frog, and her diagnosis of the case found general acceptance. Another guest to set an example of early bed-going was Waldo Plubley, who conducted his life on a minutely regulated system of time-tables and hygienic routine. Waldo was a plump, indolent young man of seven-and-twenty, whose mother had early in his life decided for him that he was unusually delicate, and by dint of much coddling and home-keeping had succeeded in making him physically soft and mentally peevish. Nine hours’ unbroken sleep, preceded by elaborate breathing exercises and other hygienic ritual, was among the indispensable regulations which Waldo imposed on himself, and there were innumerable small observances which he exacted from those who were in any way obliged to minister to his requirements; a special teapot for the decoction of his early tea was always solemnly handed over to the bedroom staff of any house in which he happened to be staying. No one had ever quite mastered the mechanism of this precious vessel, but Bertie van Tahn was responsible for the legend that its spout had to be kept facing north during the process of infusion.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II, food {{supplies}} became increasingly scarce in the Netherlands. After the landing of the Allied Forces on D-Day, conditions grew increasingly worse in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands. The Allies were able to liberate {{the southern part of}} the country, but their liberation <b>efforts</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> abrupt halt when Operation Market Garden, their attempt to gain control of the bridge across the Rhine at Arnhem, failed. The seizure of the approaches to the port of Antwerp (the Battle of the Scheldt) was delayed due to Montgomery's preoccupation with Market Garden.|$|E

50|$|The son of Patrick Walsh, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, Nicholas Walsh was consecrated {{a priest}} in 1567. He {{introduced}} prayer-books and catechisms printed in Irish. He was appointed Chancellor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, in 1571 and Bishop of Ossory in 1578. Starting in 1573, Walsh worked on translating the New Testament into Irish. Walsh's <b>efforts</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end when he was stabbed to death in his house in Kilkenny by a disaffected member of his flock on 14 December 1585. He was succeeded in his translation effort by his assistant John Kearney and by Nehemiah Donnellan and William Daniel (Uilliam Ó Domhnaill), successive Archbishops of Tuam.|$|E
50|$|Production {{suffered}} multiple interruptions {{for several}} reasons. It began in December 1962 after Ball's abortive {{attempt at a}} career on the Broadway stage. In 1963, production was halted after the box-office failure of her comedy effort Critic's Choice (with Bob Hope). Later, she had a falling-out with Madelyn Pugh (then known as Madelyn Pugh Martin) and Bob Carroll, precisely because their script overly resembled an I Love Lucy television episode, and commissioned another writer (Leonard Spigelgass) to rewrite the script. Mr. Spigelgass {{does not seem to}} have succeeded in breaking free of Lucy's television work, so producer Robert Blumofe hired yet two more writers (Mickey Rudin and Bernie Weitzman) to make an attempt. When this failed, Blumofe hired Melville Shavelson, who eventually directed. All further rewrite <b>efforts</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> abrupt end at the insistence of United Artists, the film's eventual distributor.|$|E
50|$|The government's {{funding of}} the Telidon <b>efforts</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{official}} end on 31 March 1985, at which point $69 million had been spent not counting the revenue expended by Infomart who had made national and international sales in excess of $20M. It was estimated that another $200 million had been invested by various industry partners, $100 million of that by Bell Canada. Most of the early test systems had ended their runs by 1982, while the commercial systems persevered {{for a few years}} longer; NBC's system ended in January 1985, followed by NABU in 1985/6, and then ExtraVision, Viewtron and Gateway in March 1986. In spite of these services finding some level of consumer demand, none were able to find a pricing structure that paid for their operation while still being interesting to their consumer base.|$|E
50|$|After gaining {{independence}} from France in 1956, the Moroccan government restricted Jewish emigration {{out of the}} country. In response, the Israeli government tasked Mossad with facilitating such emigration, using clandestine means. The Mossad initially organized illegal departures by boats, but that <b>effort</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halt in 1961 after the Egoz disaster, in which a ship carrying 44 immigrants capsized, drowning all passengers.|$|R

5000|$|Faidherbe's successors were {{content to}} {{maintain}} his gains and did not embark on further military ventures. French colonial policy at this time can best be characterized by the warning given by the Colonial Ministry to the governor of Senegal in the late 1870s: [...] "Let us not hear from you." [...] With France's virtual abandonment of Senegal, the relative calm created in the Chemama and southern Mauritania through Faidherbe's <b>efforts</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end. The Maures resumed their traditional practices of [...] warfare and pillaging villages in the Chemama. In virtual control of the colonial administration, the commercial companies of Saint-Louis sold arms to the Maures, {{while at the same}} time outfitting French punitive missions. Scientific expeditions into Mauritania became increasingly subject to attack, and their European leaders were killed or held for ransom. The obvious weakness of the French and their distraction with events elsewhere in the region emboldened the amirs to demand and secure the reinstatement of the coutume.|$|E

50|$|In 1751, Charles Calvert died. His son, Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore, did {{not wish}} to be bound by any {{agreements}} his father had made.

But by 1760, Calvert relented, and he entered into an agreement on July 4 which matched the 1732 agreement and the Chancellor's Decree of 1750. In November of that year, the Commissioners met in New Castle, agreed to the Transpeninsular Survey results, and placed the Middle Point marker. The southernmost boundary was finally completed.|$|R

Whilst conventional wisdom says that PLS always converges in practice, there is no formal proof for path models with more than two blocks of manifest variables. This paper presents six cases of non-convergence of the PLS path modeling algorithm. These cases were estimated using Mode A combined with the factorial scheme or the path weighting scheme, which are two popular options of the algorithm. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> conclusion, <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> proof of convergence under these schemes can be abandoned, and users of PLS should triangulate their estimation results...|$|R
