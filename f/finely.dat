5|$|Israeli {{salad is}} {{typically}} made with <b>finely</b> chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Variations include {{the addition of}} diced red or green bell peppers, grated carrot, <b>finely</b> shredded cabbage or lettuce, sliced radish, fennel, spring onions and chives, chopped parsley, or other herbs and spices such as mint, za'atar and sumac. Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with <b>finely</b> chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely <b>finely</b> and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>finely</b> {{textured}} beef {{is produced}} and sold by BPI, Cargill and Tyson Foods.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh {{also created}} a dish called Llymru, <b>finely</b> ground oatmeal soaked in water {{for a long time}} before boiling until it solidified. This blancmange styled dish became so popular outside Wales that it got a new name, flummery, as the English couldn't {{pronounce}} the original. A similar dish, sucan, was made with less <b>finely</b> ground oatmeal, making a coarser product.|$|E
5|$|<b>Finely</b> divided {{neptunium}} metal {{presents a}} fire hazard because neptunium is pyrophoric; small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|In the US, the {{additive}} is not {{for direct}} consumer sale. Lean <b>finely</b> textured beef can constitute up to 15% of ground beef without additional labeling, {{and it can be}} added to other meat products such as beef-based processed meats.|$|E
5|$|Interlaced wood in earthen walls reduces quake damage if wood is not {{damaged by}} dry rot or insects. Timberlacing {{includes}} <b>finely</b> webbed Dhajji, and other types.|$|E
5|$|Nickel and its alloys are {{frequently}} used as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. Raney nickel, a <b>finely</b> divided nickel-aluminium alloy, is one common form, though related catalysts are also used, including Raney-type catalysts.|$|E
5|$|The {{church of}} Maribojoc resembled a cross or {{cruciform}} with a low, four-sided pyramidical roof and octagonal cupola. Walls were consistently divided into {{thick and thin}} portions designed with <b>finely</b> cut coral stones on the sides.|$|E
5|$|The rare Pacific Northwest morel Morchella hotsonii, {{known only}} from its type collection, is quite similar in {{appearance}} to M.importuna. The former species is distinguished by its <b>finely</b> velvety surface.|$|E
5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, {{especially when}} <b>finely</b> divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air. The melting point of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E
5|$|Bulk lead {{exposed to}} moist air forms a {{protective}} layer of varying composition. Lead carbonate {{is a common}} constituent; the sulfate or chloride may also be present in urban or maritime settings. This layer makes bulk lead effectively chemically inert in the air. <b>Finely</b> powdered lead, as with many metals, is pyrophoric, and burns with a bluish-white flame.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} advent of printing, the visual {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem. In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, the visual presentation of <b>finely</b> calligraphed poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.|$|E
5|$|<b>Finely</b> divided {{metallic}} osmium is pyrophoric and {{reacts with}} oxygen at room temperature, forming volatile osmium tetroxide. Some osmium compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present. This makes osmium tetroxide {{the main source}} of contact with the environment.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, 70% {{of ground}} beef in the U.S. {{contained}} lean <b>finely</b> textured beef, {{and a year}} later in March 2013 the amount was estimated by meat industry officials to be at approximately 5%. This significant reduction {{is due in part to}} the extensive media coverage that began in March 2012 about the additive. Kroger Co. and Supervalu Inc. have stopped using the additive.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals Real faced Soviet champions Spartak Moscow. A 0–0 at the Dynamo Lenin Stadium in the Soviet Union {{left the}} tie <b>finely</b> {{balanced}} {{heading into the}} second leg in Spain. Two goals from Isidro {{in the second half}} secured a 2–0 victory in the match and over aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Iridium in bulk {{metallic}} form is not biologically {{important or}} hazardous to health {{due to its}} lack of reactivity with tissues; {{there are only about}} 20parts per trillion of iridium in human tissue. Like most metals, <b>finely</b> divided iridium powder can be hazardous to handle, as it is an irritant and may ignite in air.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{reactive}} element in its group; it is pyrophoric when <b>finely</b> divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids, giving Fe2+. However, it does not react with concentrated nitric acid and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer, which can nevertheless react with hydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Its façade {{was simply}} {{decorated}} by narrow pilasters and niches of saints. A bas relief of the church's secondary patron, San Vicente Ferrer, was prominently {{located on the}} center of the facade. A string of <b>finely</b> cut coral stones, molded into flowers, could be seen on the lower cornice of the facade. Beside the façade was an extension of a bulky belfry.|$|E
5|$|Kubba is a dish made of rice/semolina/burghul (cracked wheat), minced {{onions and}} <b>finely</b> ground lean beef, lamb or chicken. The best-known variety is a torpedo-shaped fried croquette stuffed with minced beef, chicken or lamb. It {{was brought to}} Israel by Jews of Iraqi, Kurdish and Syrian origin.|$|E
5|$|Onion powder is a {{seasoning}} {{widely used}} when the fresh ingredient is not available. It {{is made from}} <b>finely</b> ground, dehydrated onions, mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions, and has a strong odour. Being dehydrated, it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties: yellow, red, and white.|$|E
5|$|Platform A8 is to {{the east}} of Pyramid A1, on {{the eastern side of the}} Group A plaza. It faces {{northwest}} towards the pyramid and had two access stairways. Behind the platform was a <b>finely</b> paved terrace extending along the edge of the retaining wall.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{literature}} {{focuses on}} the dining habits of the upper classes, for whom the evening meal (cena) had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a <b>finely</b> decorated dining room (triclinium), often {{with a view of}} the peristyle garden. Diners lounged on couches, leaning on the left elbow. By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men.|$|E
5|$|Shakespear has, {{as it were}} by design, {{drawn off}} from Caliban the {{elements}} of whatever is ethereal and refined, to compound them in the unearthly mould of Ariel. Nothing was ever more <b>finely</b> conceived than this contrast between the material and the spiritual, the gross and delicate.|$|E
5|$|Tabbouleh is a Levantine vegan dish (sometimes {{considered}} a salad) traditionally made of tomatoes, <b>finely</b> chopped parsley, mint, bulgur and onion, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt. Some Israeli {{variations of the}} salad use pomegranate seeds instead of tomatoes.|$|E
5|$|The {{dearth of}} {{artefacts}} recovered from Buckton Castle, {{and the lack}} of <b>finely</b> finished stonework, might indicate that the site was never finished, however the re-cutting of the ditch suggests either an extended period of occupancy of abandonment followed by repairs to the fortifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{thick-walled}} spores {{are roughly}} spherical, rusty-brown, <b>finely</b> and densely warted, and have diameters of 5–6.5µm. Elaters are 50–80 by 4–6µm, and have ring-like or spiral thickenings. The endoperidium consists of densely interwoven hyphae that are 3–9µm {{in diameter and}} walls less than 1µm thick; they are septate, branched, pale yellow, with clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|There is {{an ornate}} {{semi-circular}} wooden ceiling with smaller panels along the ridge, moulded ribs and carved bosses, and brattished cornice each side above {{a row of}} little fan-vaults separating seven half-round panels with shield-bearing angels. The ceiling is <b>finely</b> finished with bosses {{at the intersection of}} the moulded principals and purlins. It was inserted in 1882–84.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Th and atomic number 90. Thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black {{when it is}} exposed to air, forming the dioxide; it is moderately hard, malleable, and has a high melting point. Thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry {{is dominated by the}} +4 oxidation state; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when <b>finely</b> divided.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium metal tarnishes {{slowly in}} air. <b>Finely</b> {{dispersed}} ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald-green flame. Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non-stoichiometric hydrides. Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, but quickly in acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|A meze {{of fresh}} and cooked {{vegetable}} salads, pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, hummus, ful, tahini and amba dips, labneh cheese with olive oil, and ikra is served at festive meals and in restaurants. Salads include Turkish salad (a piquant salad of <b>finely</b> chopped onions, tomatoes, herbs and spices), tabbouleh, carrot salad, marinated roasted {{red and green}} peppers, deep fried cauliflower florets, matbucha, torshi (pickled vegetables) and various eggplant salads.|$|E
5|$|A typical 100-g parsnip {{contains}} 75 Calories (230 kJ) of energy. Most parsnip cultivars {{consist of}} about 80% water, 5% sugar, 1% protein, 0.3% fat, and 5% dietary fiber. The parsnip {{is rich in}} vitamins and minerals, and is particularly rich in potassium with 375mg per 100g. Several of the B-group vitamins are present, but levels of vitamin C are reduced in cooking. Since most of the vitamins and minerals are found close to the skin, many will be lost unless the root is <b>finely</b> peeled or cooked whole. During frosty weather, part of the starch is converted to sugar and the root tastes sweeter.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was found}} {{shattered}} into thousands of pieces and is now heavily corroded, the helmet still bears evidence of its original <b>finely</b> decorated design. It was plated with silver-gilt and decorated with images of goddesses and equestrian scenes. It would {{have been used by}} a Roman auxiliary cavalryman for displays and possibly in battle. The identity of the owner is not known but the helmet was discovered on a native British ceremonial site, buried alongside thousands of Iron Age British and Roman coins. It is possible that the helmet was owned by a Briton who fought alongside the Romans during the conquest of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, <b>finely</b> grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It also may be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E
5|$|At 5ft 4in (1.62m), Burnham was slight, but he {{was also}} muscular and bronzed, with a <b>finely</b> formed square jaw. He had a boyish {{appearance}} which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.|$|E
5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is a savory butter {{prepared}} by mixing softened butter with very <b>finely</b> minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of butter may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper {{has also been}} used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in parchment paper or plastic wrap and chilled to harden.|$|E
