40|$|This thesis {{essentially}} {{presents the}} experimental {{investigation of the}} fundamental phenomena of electric fuse element disintegration and its causation and influence on the subsequent fragmentation of the fuse elements when subjected to excessive fault currents. The basis of the study involved experimental observation of disintegration of fuse elements and {{the analysis of the}} dynamic responses of current-carrying conductors, which precipitate disintegration. The experimental techniques employed utilised commercially available video cameras to capture images of element disruptions during disintegration of fuse elements subjected to low short-circuit and high overload currents. Specialist experimental image capturing techniques and hardware implementations were developed to enable investigation of element disintegration caused by high short-circuit fault currents. <b>Disintegration</b> <b>phenomena</b> of fuse elements for all fault cases were compared within different time domains, which included specialist techniques to investigate disintegration of elements in sand and against glass substrates. <b>Disintegration</b> <b>phenomena</b> of elements in unconfined media such as air and water also constituted the studies. The studies diverged, finally, into experimental observations of the temporal development of arc initiation and extinction phenomena of fault current limiting of HBC fuses using spectroscopic analysis of the arc light radiation. The range of studies covered have led to new understandings of fundamental current limiting behaviour of HBC and open type fuses which contribute, in a small way, to the knowledge base of the subject and hopefully will be an aid to improved designs and development of new types of electric fuse...|$|E

According to the physical and mechanical properties of the prototype, the cementitious material with good elastic-plastic for iron crystal sand (ISBM) was chosen as the similar material for the research on failure mechanism of surrounding rock under the environment of excavation and high geo-stress in deep tunnel. Three mixing proportions that matched with similar conditions were got from more than 300 groups of matching test. Relying on the specific indoor test data, and the main physical and mechanical parameters of the original rock were taken as the evaluation index system, the improved fuzzy optimization mathematical model of similar material was established. It might help you make your decision in cases where several solutions seem to be able to fit the bill.

40|$|Questions of cometary lifetimes and {{disintegration}} {{rates are}} important to current theories concerning the origin of comets. Data from recent objective observations are not sufficient for a statistically meaningful discussion of <b>disintegration</b> <b>phenomena.</b> It is necessary {{to make use of}} older visual observations, which are often rather vague and subject to personal biases. In spite of the difficulties involved in such a study, it is possible to retrieve useful information from these observations. It has been my goal in this paper to thoroughly utilize the observational material relevant to a meaningful discussion of cometary origins. First, the sources and techniques of the study are described. A discussion of the various sorts of activity is included. Persistence, significance, and conditions of occurrence are discussed. Next, theories of cometary origin are summarized. Important parts of the Oort theory are outlined, with emphasis on points relating to cometary disintegration and the observable characteristics. The calculations of cometary parameters by Oort and Whipple are reviewed, and the important consequences are discussed. Lyttleton's attack on the Oort cloud hypothesis is briefly described and criticized. If the Oort theory is correct, "new" comets on their first close approach to the sun from the comet cloud should show a high disintegration rate or appreciable fading. An attempt is made to correlate activity and disintegration with cometary "age," using reciprocal (original) semi -major axes (1 /a) and spectral continuum strength as indicators of "age. " No correlation of any sort is apparent. It appears that activity and disintegration- related phenomena are not correlated with these age criteria. Since outright division and related catastrophic <b>disintegration</b> <b>phenomena</b> apparently do not account for the excessive loss rate among young comets, as required by the Oort theory, fading may be called into play. The mechanisms of brightness variation and the results of previous studies are summarized. Everhart's study of discovery probability functions is described, and {{the results of this study}} are utilized to determine the amount of fading required to render "new" comets (on their first passage through the observability region in the inner solar system) undiscoverable on the second and subsequent perihelion passages. A total fading of one magnitude is needed to cause 55 % of the "new" comets to disappear (become undiscoverable) at the next perihelion passage. This figure is approximate, and is based on some uncertain assumptions concerning the average brightnesses and other characteristics of various groups of comets. Using two different methods, I have attempted to uncover observational evidence of fading among "new" comets. First, absolute magnitudes are correlated with age, again using 1 /a as the criterion. No correlation is found. Next, a number of long -period comets are investigated to determine the exact period over which they were observed. The mean absolute magnitude of the comets observed only before perihelion passage is compared with the mean absolute magnitude of those observed only after, with the expectation of demonstrating fading after perihelion. The opposite effect is found. Some mechanism of residual activity apparently causes these objects to become brighter after perihelion passage. This result is not in very good agreement with some previous studies. We must conclude that there is no direct observational evidence of appreciable fading among new comets. The data obtained in this study have been applied to several subsidiary investigations. An attempt is made to correlate cometary activity and disintegration with sunspot numbers. No significant correlation is found. An investigation is made into some results predicted by Harwit on the basis of his theory of cometary splitting due to collisions in the ecliptic plane. According to Harwit, the incidence of splitting should be higher for retrograde comets than for objects in direct orbits. I find no pronounced correlation of splitting with orbital inclination among long -period comets. Finally, a brief study is made of the absolute magnitudes of split comets. The results verify Whipple and Stefanik's contention that split comets tend to be bright, but I would attribute this, effect to observational selection. The data on splitting among faint comets are probably very incomplete...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} social {{status of the}} elderly in Libya {{and how it is}} coconstructed in the way elderly fathers {{interact}} and communicate with younger sons, elderly peers, and healthcare providers. In the Libyan society in Sebha (a city in the Southern part of Libya, Arab, Muslim and Bedouin) the elderly occupies significant familial and societal roles and posts. The research sample consists of 13 elderly fathers and 16 younger sons who were employed in structured interviews. Another group of 6 elderly fathers and their 6 younger sons participated in semi-structured interviews. Naturally occurring conversations were tape-recorded between each elderly father and his younger son. The third group contains 3 groups of elderly peers whose conversations were taperecorded. Moreover, a group of 3 elderly patients and 3 younger physicians was interviewed and tape-recorded conversing separately with each other. The Conversation Analysis method (CA) supplemented by the social constructionist approach was adopted as a method of data analysis in this study. The findings reveal that elderly fathers are perceived by their younger sons as the family backbone, leader, advisor and decision maker. In contrast, elderly fathers perceive their younger sons as always independent, regardless of their (fathers and sons) health, wealth, and literacy. The findings also show that the large size of Libyan families provides a better chance for elderly fathers to live in extended families, and hence have more familial integration, interaction, and activation. The analyses of the elderly father/younger son conversations unveiled that elderly fathers talk more (timespan) than their younger sons. They also use considerable overlap and interruption to I seize their turns. Elderly fathers address their younger sons with the least preferable repair strategy (other-initiated other-repair), and adopt bald and unmitigated utterances when producing their refusals. They prefer to produce their requests to their younger sons in `order' and/or `order then explain' styles. In comparison, younger sons very rarely overlap, interrupt, or raise their voices when conversing with their elderly fathers. Furthermore, they do not produce verbal rejections to their elderly fathers' demands. Interestingly, sexual and romantic issues could not be raised between elderly fathers and their younger sons. In contrast, elderly - elderly conversations may include romantic issues and poetry. Elderly interactants freely perform overlap, interruption, quarrels, and raising voices when interacting with each other. Finally, elderly patients as well as their younger physicians tend to socialise their institutional settings by avoiding producing medical or colloquial terms that may relate to sex, i. e. sexual organs. Moreover, they summon each other with social labels (hajji/son) rather than institutional labels (sir/doctor). The thesis concludes that the elderly in Libya interact and communicate in accordance to their social status and perception. Elderly fathers, younger sons, elderly peers and healthcare providers coconstruct the elderly status in their everyday talk-in-interaction settings. This research throws new light on the language and discourse of the elderly when they are perceptually and interactionally integrated in their families and societies. This research can be regarded as a pioneer in exploring interaction and discourse of the elderly in society. The research contributes to a variety of different disciplines. Sociolinguists and psycholinguists can be interested in this research as it provides data and analysis purely relevant to their area of study. Sociologists and policy makers can also benefit from this research and see what they should do with the elderly mistreatment and <b>disintegration</b> <b>phenomena</b> prevalent in many societies.

40|$|Metal dusting is a <b>disintegration</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{of metals}} and alloys into fine, dust-like particles. Metal dusting {{can be found in}} {{different}} reforming units in the petrochemical industry. As well as in reforming units, it can be found at high-temperature fuel cells. The metal dusting corrosion phenomenon is initiated by unwanted carbon formation on the inner surface of process equipment. It occurs under a synthesis gaseous atmosphere (carbon activity >> 1) at high temperature with low oxygen/steam partial pressure. Since the gas contains carbon monoxide and hydrogen at high temperature, carbon is formed by CO reduction reaction and Boudouard reaction. Carbon formation is kinetically controlled which means it is influenced by the catalytic properties and the local conditions like temperature and partial pressure. An oxide layer formed on the surface of alloys is protecting the alloy matrix from corrosion. Thickness of this oxide layer should be moderate. If the oxide layer is too thick, the metal alloys will have problems with thermal expansion and heat transfer. If it is too thin, however, the metal alloys cannot be protected from the corrosion. To find the effects of oxidation temperature, CO exposure temperature and CO exposure time on carbon formation, oxidation treatments and CO exposure treatments were conducted. Samples were oxidized with 10 % steam-Ar gas for 6 h at 540 °C or 760 °C. Subsequently, samples were exposed to 10 % CO-Ar gas at 1 bar at 650 °C or 750 °C. Length of exposure time was different for each sample from 1 h to 20 h. After the experiments, surface of metal alloys was characterized by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. As a result of all experiments, the effect of CO exposure time can be summarized as follows. Regardless of sample exposure conditions, all samples have more carbon when they are exposed to CO gas for longer time. The effect of pre-treatment temperature is that lower temperature forms more carbon filaments. Finally, the effect of CO exposure treatment temperature is that lower temperature (650 °C) forms more carbon filaments than higher temperature (750 °C) ...|$|R

40|$|The Somali {{conflict}} combines some of {{the risk}} factors commonly associated with state failure, state collapse and state <b>disintegration</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> This study commences with {{an exploration of the}} failure of the peace process in Somalia by investigating the creation of the Somali state in 1960 using literature on state formation and functions, state failure and state disintegration. The main argument is that the Somali state was created on flawed colonial state model and its concomitant shortcomings. Although poor leadership was a factor that led to the weakening of the early Somali state formation, state structural weaknesses were the major factors which facilitated poor leadership that characterised post-independent Somalia, further compounded by the period of military rule under General Siad Barre. Furthermore, the post-Siad Barre conflict was fundamental in swinging the pendulum in favour of the disintegration of the Somali state. The historical legacy of high social fragmentation in Somalia, reflected in the clan political divisions is a factor that is used by instrumentalists in the perpetuation of the conflict in that country. Similarly, clan political structures are used by civil militia groups, defined in this study as third generation civil militia groups who continue to plunder what remained of the Somali state. The third generation civil militia groups function outside the Westphalian state norms and regulations that are based on the social contract between the state and its citizens. The study then outlines an alternative approach to analysis of conflicts where the state has been decimated and civil militia groups have assumed power without the checks and balances that come with such responsibilities. Failure of the peace process in Somalia is attributed to the absence of the basic principles of mediation and negotiations during the five main peace processes, and it is concluded that the application of coercive mediation has also contributed to the failure of international diplomacy in this regard. The failure of the peace process has facilitated the transformation of Somalia into a militia state, balkanised along clan militia fiefdoms based on parochial clan political interests in which civil militia leaders are the main beneficiaries of the disintegrated Somali state. Therefore, new approaches to resolve the conflict where civil militia have established governance without government requires further research, as a similar phenomenon is gaining momentum in countries such as Iraq, Libya, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and the Central African Republic. The study concludes that the current political developments in Somalia cannot be sustainable {{as long as they are}} introduced under conditions of coercive force by the international community and the African Union (AU) in particular. Under these circumstances, the conflict will continue to experience some episodic periods of abeyance, and only to resurface at a later stage with high levels of ferocity and intensity.

Meteorites bombardment has accompanied by shock-explosive <b>phenomena,</b> <b>disintegration</b> and mix of the lunar soil in depth and on area simultaneously. As a consequence, the lunar soil has undergone melting, physical and chemical transformations. Recently we have the some reemergence for interest of Moon investigation. The prospects in current century declare USA, China, India, and European Union. In Russia also prepare two missions: Luna-Glob and Luna-Resource. Not last part of investigation of Moon surface is reviewing the dust condition near the ground of landers. Studying the properties of lunar dust is important both for scientific purposes to investigation the lunar exosphere component and for the technical safety of lunar robotic and manned missions. The absence of an atmosphere on the Moon's surface is leading to greater compaction and sintering. Properties of regolith and dust particles (density, temperature, composition, etc.) as well as near-surface lunar exosphere depend on solar activity, lunar local time and position of the Moon relative to the Earth's magneto tail. Upper layers of regolith are an insulator, which is charging as a result of solar UV radiation and the constant bombardment of charged particles, creates a charge distribution {{on the surface of the}} moon: positive on the illuminated side and negative on the night side. Charge distribution depends on the local lunar time, latitude and the electrical properties of the regolith (the presence of water in the regolith can influence the local distribution of charge). On light side of Moon near surface layer there exists possibility formation dusty plasma system. Altitude of levitation is depending from size of dust particle and Moon latitude. The distribution dust particle by size and altitude has estimated with taking into account photoelectrons, electrons and ions of solar wind, solar emission. Dust analyzer instrument PmL for future Russian lender missons intends for investigation the dynamics of dusty plasma near lunar surface. PmL consist of three blocks: Impact Sensor and two Electric Field Sensors. Dust Experiment goals are: 1) Impact sensor to investigate the dynamics of dust particles near the lunar surface (speed, charge, mass, vectors of a fluxes) a) high speed micrometeorites b) secondary particles after micrometeorites soil bombardment c) levitating dust particles due to electrostatic fields PmL instrument will measure dust particle impulses. In laboratory tests we used -min impulse so as 7 • 10 - 11 N•c, by SiO 2 dust particles, 20 - 40 µm with velocity about 0, 5 - 2, 5 m/c, dispersion 0. 3, and -max impulse was 10 - 6 N•c with possibility increased it by particles Pb-Sn 0, 7 mm with velocity 1 m/c, dispersion ± 0. 3. Also Impact Sensor will measure the charge of dust particle as far as 10 - 15 C (1000 electrons). In case the charge and impulse of a dust particle are measured we can obtain velocity and mass of them. 2) Electric field Sensor will measure the value and dynamics of the electric fields the lunar surface. Two Electric Field Sensors both are measured the concentration and temperature of charged particles (electrons, ions, dust particles). Uncertainty of measurements is 10 %. Electric Field Sensors contain of Lengmure probe. Using Lengmure probe to dark and light Moon surface we can obtain the energy spectra photoelectrons in different period of time. PmL instrument is developing, working out and manufacturing in IKI. Simultaneously with the PmL dust instrument to study lunar dust it would be very important to use an onboard TV system adjusted for imaging physical properties of dust on the lunar surface (adhesion, albedo, porosity, etc), and to collect dust particles samples from the lunar surface to return these samples to the Earth for measure a number of physic-chemical properties of the lunar dust, e. g. a quantum yield of photoemission, what is very important for modeling physical processes in the lunar exosphere...|$|R
40|$|Whenever {{there is}} a {{decrease}} of the sensory function, whether due to a disease, trauma or to the normal aging process, a change occurs {{at the same time}} in the motor control, in body and emotions perception, in cognitive processing, in the functional activities and in the interpersonal relationships. The feeling that is generated is of loss of identity, of threat, and Self <b>disintegration.</b> This <b>phenomenon</b> of consciousness and identity is called the Self. There are many concepts of the Self but some more recent theories claim that there is only one Self. The human being is a whole and the greater this perception of the personal unit the greater physical, cognitive and emotional functionality can be reached. The Self may change when exposed to various health conditions but also due to sensory and relational experiences or due to the lack of stimulation. The stimulation we get through all sensory modalities helps build the representation we make of ourselves. However unisensory stimulation does not seem to be sufficient to promote perception of the Self as a whole. Multisensory stimulation, that it comprises meaningful and Self-referential stimuli, seems to trigger a more global consciousness of the Self. Self-referential stimuli are stimuli that are experienced as strongly related to one’s own person. The physiotherapist is a professional who distinguishes himself by the use of sensorial stimulation strategies, considered Self-referential stimulation, i. e., auditory-verbal stimulation liked to body parts and direct and prolonged manual contact with the patient´s body. But these approaches are rarely used in neurological Physiotherapy, for sensory and perceptual competences improvement and they are never used simultaneously. In reference to touch there is no concern to assess the perception that clients have about touch. Different meanings can be attributed to physical contact during therapeutic and social interactions and they may generate bonding or avoidant behaviours. If the loss of sensory function, namely the tactile sense, may lead to the disintegration of the Self, the study of this problem becomes more relevant in the elderly because it is proven that in this stage of life {{there is a}}n important tactile sensory loss with implications in the motor function, in the activities of daily living and in interpersonal relationships. In this sense this thesis has as general objectives (1) to increase scientific evidence about the clinical practice of Physiotherapy; (2) to contribute to a reflection of clinical practice in Physiotherapy as it regards to the importance of sensory stimulation for the construction of the Self; (3) to allow for further understanding of the healthy aging process related to the functional and interpersonal relationships implications of tactile sensory decrease; (4) to make recommendations for enhancing the quality of provision of Physiotherapy services, specifically with regard to sensory assessment and sensory stimulation strategies. To achieve these objectives three studies were developed: (1) “Multisensory Self-referential stimulation of the lower limb – an fMRI study on healthy subjects”; (2) “Tactile Discrimination, Social Touch and Frailty criteria in elderly people”; (3) “Reliability and Validity of the European Portuguese version of the Social Touch Questionnaire”. The results and conclusions of the studies are: (1) unisensorial auditory-verbal and tactile-manual Self-referential stimulation and multisensory Self-referential stimulation elicits bilateral activations of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), of the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1), of the primary motor cortex (M 1) -BA 4 and of the premotor cortex (BA 6). These sensorimotor areas were located in the lower-limb sensorimotor representation; Self-referential multisensory stimulation related to the body, more than unisensory one, produce a brain activation map in regions that are responsible for multisensory Self-processing. This process may represent the Core-Self. This brain map is composed of cortical and subcortical midline structures - BA 7 (precuneus), left BA 9 (medial prefrontal cortex), left BA 30 (posterior cingulated), left thalamus, bilateral superior colliculum and left posterior cerebellum) and posterior lateral cortex (such as bilateral TPJ, bilateral posterior BA 13 (insula), left BA 19 and left BA 37). Regarding all these structures, bilateral TPJ is the one that showed the biggest activation volume; (2) the decline of sensorial tactile discrimination of the hand is related to increasing age, to the decrease in grip strength and to higher avoidance behaviours and attitudes towards social touch. Sensorial tactile discrimination of the hand also explains frailty levels in the sample evaluated in the current study, i. e. frail elders have greater loss of sensorial discrimination then pre-frail elders. According to these results hand tactile discrimination should be used in assessment and intervention protocols in pre-frail and frail elders; (3) we produced an European Portuguese version of the Social Touch Questionnaire and is a reliable, valid and comprehensive measurement tool. It is an instrument that evaluates a range of behaviours and attitudes towards the touch and can be used by different health professionals, in clinical practice and for research purposes. Regarding the general conclusions of the studies supported by scientific evidence collected, such as: (1) brain areas activated by the multisensory stimulation performed in this study (auditory-verbal + tactile-manual) are those related to the Self processing; (2) decreased tactile sensitivity of the hand in the elderly has implications in the hand strength and in behaviour and attitudes towards social touch and can lead to difficulties in functional activities, decrease in interpersonal relations and the disorganization of the Self; (3) in case of elderly people, despite the deterioration of the sensory systems there is evidence of stabilization or increase of the multisensory integration processing; we recommend to contemplate multisensory Self-referential stimulation composed of unisensory auditory-verbal stimulus requesting to feel specific body parts and unisensory tactile-manual stimulation of the same body parts, when planning intervention strategies for healthy aging with the aim of maintaining the integrity of the elderly Self. According to the conclusions obtained in the developed studies some recommendations are presented for a more appropriate and comprehensive clinical reasoning that can lead to a more effective clinical practice in Physiotherapy. Sempre que ocorre uma alteração da função sensitiva, quer seja devida a uma doença, a um trauma ou ao processo normal de envelhecimento, surge simultaneamente uma alteração no controlo motor, na perceção do corpo e das emoções, na cognição, nas atividades da vida diária e na participação do individuo enquanto “ser” social. O sentimento que é gerado é de perda de identidade, de ameaça e de desintegração da perceção do indivíduo como um todo. Este fenómeno de consciência pessoal é designado por Self. Na literatura são relatados vários conceitos do Self mas algumas teorias mais recentes afirmam que existe um único Self. O ser humano é um todo e quanto maior for a perceção de unidade pessoal maior funcionalidade física, cognitiva e emocional poderá ser alcançada. O Self pode alterar-se de acordo com a exposição a diferentes condições de saúde mas também devido a experiências sensoriais e relacionais que sejam relevantes para o indivíduo, ou ainda devido à falta de estimulação. A estimulação que recebemos através de todas as modalidades sensoriais ajuda a construir a representação que fazemos de nós próprios. No entanto a estimulação unisensorial parece não ser suficiente para promover a perceção do Self como um todo, sendo que, a estimulação multissensorial, desde que seja composta por estímulos significativos para o indivíduo e referenciados ao Self, parece desencadear uma consciência mais global do Self. Os estímulos referenciados ao Self são estímulos que estão relacionados fortemente com a própria pessoa, sobretudo com a perceção do seu corpo. O fisioterapeuta é um profissional que se diferencia pela utilização de estratégias de estimulação sensorial que podem ser consideradas referenciadas ao Self, tais como a estimulação verbal apelando para sentir partes do corpo e o contacto direto e prolongado das suas mãos com o corpo do utente. No entanto estas estratégias raramente são usadas na Fisioterapia com o objetivo de melhoria das competências sensoriais e percetivas e quando são aplicadas nunca são usadas em simultâneo. No que se refere a estratégias de avaliação e de intervenção que utilizam o toque, verifica-se também que não existe um cuidado sistemático em avaliar a perceção que os utentes fazem do contacto físico que é estabelecido. No entanto, diferentes significados poderão ser atribuídos a esse contacto físico durante as interações terapêuticas, podendo gerar atitudes e comportamentos de evitamento ao toque. Isto pode inviabilizar a relação terapêutica e afetar os resultados esperados. Se a perda de função sensorial, nomeadamente a função sensorial tátil pode conduzir a uma desintegração do Self, o estudo deste problema torna-se mais relevante nos idosos pois a evidência aponta para a existência de uma perda sensorial importante nesta etapa de vida, com implicações na função motora, nas atividades do dia-a-dia e nas relações interpessoais. Face ao exposto esta tese possuiu como objetivos gerais (1) aumentar a evidência científica acerca da prática clínica da Fisioterapia; (2) contribuir para uma reflexão acerca da prática clínica da Fisioterapia no que se refere à importância da estimulação sensorial na construção do Self; (3) permitir uma melhor compreensão do processo de envelhecimento saudável relacionado com as implicações do declínio da sensibilidade tátil na funcionalidade e nas relações interpessoais; (4) efetuar um conjunto de recomendações para o aumento da qualidade da prestação de serviços prestados pela Fisioterapia, especificamente relacionados com a avaliação da função sensorial e com as estratégias de estimulação sensorial. Para alcançar estes objetivos foram realizados três estudos: (1) “Multisensory Self-referential stimulation of the lower limb – an fMRI study on healthy subjects”; (2) “Tactile Discrimination, Social Touch and Frailty criteria in elderly people”; (3) “Reliability and Validity of the European Portuguese version of the Social Touch Questionnaire”. Os principais resultados e conclusões dos estudos são: (1) a estimulação unisensorial auditiva-verbal e tátil-manual referenciada ao Self, assim como a estimulação multisensorial (auditiva-verbal + tátil-manual) referenciada ao Self promovem ativações bilaterais da Junção Temporo Parietal (JTP), do córtex somatosensorial primário (S 1), do córtex motor primário (M 1) -BA 4 e do córtex prémotor-BA 6. Estas áreas sensoriomotoras foram localizadas na representação sensoriomotora dos membros inferiores; a estimulação multisensorial referenciada ao Self, comparada com a estimulação unisensorial, produz um mapa de ativação cerebral constituído por regiões que, segundo a literatura, são responsáveis pelo processamento multisensorial do Self. Este processo poderá representar o Core-Self (também designado por Eu nuclear). O mapa cerebral encontrado é composto por estruturas corticais e subcorticais da linha média do cérebro - BA 7 (precuneo), BA 9 esquerda (córtex pré-frontal medial), BA 30 esquerda (cíngulo posterior), tálamo esquerdo, colículo superior bilateral e cerebelo posterior esquerdo, assim como pelo córtex lateral posterior - JTP bilateral, BA 13 (insula posterior bilateral), BA 19 esquerda e BA 37 esquerda. Em relação a todas estas estruturas, a JTP bilateral foi a que mostrou maior volume de ativação; (2) o declínio da sensibilidade discriminativa da mão está relacionado com o aumento da idade, com a diminuição da força de preensão e com maior quantidade de comportamentos e atitudes de evitamento relacionados com o toque. A sensibilidade discriminativa da mão também constitui uma variável explicativa dos níveis de fragilidade da amostra de idosos selecionada para o estudo, ou seja, os idosos frágeis possuem maior perda da sensibilidade discriminativa da mão do que os idosos pré frágeis. De acordo com estes resultados recomendamos que a sensibilidade discriminativa da mão seja usada nos protocolos de avaliação e de intervenção em idosos frágeis ou em risco de se tornar frágeis; (3) produzimos uma versão Portuguesa-Europeia do “Social Touch Questionnaire” e demonstrámos que é um instrumento de medida confiável, válido e de fácil compreensão. É um instrumento que avalia uma variedade de comportamentos e atitudes relacionados com o toque social e que poderá ser utilizado por diferentes profissionais de saúde, tanto na prática clínica como na investigação. Tendo em conta as conclusões gerais dos estudos e tomando como suporte a evidência científica recolhida, tais como: (1) as áreas cerebrais ativadas com a estimulação multisensorial realizada neste trabalho (auditiva-verbal + tátil-manual) são as relacionadas com o processamento do Self, (2) a diminuição da sensibilidade tátil da mão no idoso tem implicações na força da mão e nos comportamentos e atitudes face a toque podendo conduzir a dificuldades nas atividades funcionais, a uma diminuição nas relações interpessoais e à desorganização do Self; (3) no caso dos idosos, apesar do declínio dos sistemas sensoriais, existe evidência que o processamento multisensorial cerebral estabiliza ou pode mesmo aumentar; propomos que no planeamento da intervenção para um envelhecimento saudável, cujos objetivos sejam a manutenção ou o aumento da funcionalidade e a manutenção da integridade do Self, seja contemplada a estratégia de estimulação multisensorial referenciada ao Self proposta nesta tese. De acordo com as conclusões obtidas nos estudos desenvolvidos são feitas algumas recomendações para um raciocínio clínico mais adequado e abrangente que possa conduzir a uma prática clínica em Fisioterapia mais eficaz...|$|R
