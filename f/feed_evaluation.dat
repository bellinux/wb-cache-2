40|$|In my bachelor's thesis we have {{collected}} materials about the systems of energy evaluation in cattle feed. The equations for <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{come from the}} Czech Republic (NELCZ), Finland (FUF), Denmark (FUD), Great Britain (MEMAFF, MEARC), Sweden (MESW), the Netherlands and Norway (NELNL), France (NELFR), the United States of America (NELUS) and Rostock (NEFRO). The first part describes general rules of <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> including {{the most commonly used}} abbreviations, feed analysis, division of energy and energetic requirements of cattle. The second part deals with the description of systems of cattle <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> used in Europe and the USA and their differences. The next part addresses a more detailed description of American, Czech and Slovakian systems, their equations, calculations and process of evaluating feeds. Finally we have calculated a feeding dosage according to the norms used in the Czech Republic for a milk cow weighing 550 kilograms, producing 36 litres of milk {{with the use of the}} figures of NEL according to the Czech and Dutch systems of <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> of corn silage and barley. While comparing the feed dosage according to our system and the system used in the Netherlands we have found differences in the need of nutrients coverage.

40|$|Organically {{produced}} cereals, legumes, {{oil seed}} products, forages, silages and new protein feedstuffs were analysed for nutrient composition. In this report, new high quality, protein rich feedstuffs included microalgae, insects and mussel meal. Protein feedstuffs also contained samples from less known plant feed materials for pigs and poultry, such as sainfoin seeds with hulls or dehulled, grass pea seeds and soybean by-product okara. Feed samples were analysed for dry matter, ash, crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre, neutral and acid detergent fibre, lignin, starch, sugars, amino acids, minerals, phytic acid, phytase activity and in vitro digestibilities according to Boisen and Fernàndez (1995, 1997) {{to predict the}} standardised ileal digestibility of amino acids (Boisen 2007). MTT, Agrifood Research Finland, analysed all the feed ingredients {{that were used in}} the feeding experiments throughout the ICOPP project. By having all samples analysed in the same place, and using the same methodology, it is possible to compare feed ingredients and transfer the results from country to country. Furthermore, there is often lack of information concerning analysed nutrient composition of organically produced feed materials. Information in this report can be used in feed optimisation for pigs and poultry on farms and by feed manufactures. Feedstuff names have been compiled based on EU feed catalogue (EU 575 / 2011). The calculation of feed energy values for pigs and poultry differs between European countries. In this report, the nutrient contents are translated into the feeding values according to <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> systems used in different European countries.

40|$|Aim. This {{paper is}} a report of an {{assessment}} of the construct validity of the Chinese version of the Edinburgh <b>Feeding</b> <b>Evaluation</b> in Dementia scale. Background. The Edinburgh <b>Feeding</b> <b>Evaluation</b> in Dementia scale has previously been translated and back-translated and to determine the equality of the Chinese and English versions. However, the construct validity of the Chinese version has not been investigated. Methods. Participants (n = 477) were selected from residents with dementia in licensed long-term care facilities in Taiwan in 2006 - 2007. Data collectors received training before observing feeding for 2 days during lunch and dinner. Data were analysed using principal component analysis, Mokken scaling and correlation. Findings. A two-factor structure was demonstrated for the 11 items of the Chinese version of the scale and six items conformed to a Mokken scale. The Chinese version of the scale correlated with external constructs such as weight and body mass index, as predicted by the unmet needs model. Conclusion. A confirmatory factor analysis is needed to confirm that the Chinese version measures the same qualities, in the same proportions, and with the same factor structure as the original Edinburgh <b>Feeding</b> <b>Evaluation</b> in Dementia scale. ...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveLaryngopharyngeal {{dysfunction}} contributes {{significantly to}} morbidity, length of stay, and increased resource utilization after aortic arch interventions in infants. Previous {{studies have focused}} on postoperative evaluation of selected symptomatic patients with vocal fold palsy (VFP). A prospective evaluation of laryngopharyngeal function was undertaken to assess and determine its importance in perioperative management. Patients and methodsA routine preoperative and postoperative assessment was done by flexible fiber optic laryngoscopy, oral <b>feeding</b> <b>evaluation</b> (OFE), and modified barium swallow (mBS) on 101 infants undergoing 113 procedures on the aortic arch (2003 to 2011). The primary outcome was the ability to take full nutrition orally at discharge. ResultsPreoperative OFE was abnormal in 33. 3 % of patients. VFP occurred in 39. 3 %, 30 of 57 patients had an abnormal OFE. Factors predictive of abnormal postoperative <b>feeding</b> <b>evaluation</b> included genetic syndromes (odds ratio [OR], 5. 1; confidence interval [CI], 1. 1 - 23. 2) and preoperative mechanical ventilation (OR, 24. 1; 95 % CI, 2. 5 - 226. 6). An abnormal postoperative OFE was highly predictive (OR, 7. 0; 95 % CI,  1. 8 - 27. 1) of an abnormal postoperative mBS. There was a trend toward decreased long-term survival among patients who were intubated or had an abnormal preoperative <b>feeding</b> <b>evaluation</b> (P = . 07). ConclusionsPostoperative laryngopharyngeal dysfunction is common among infants undergoing aortic arch interventions, and is largely independent of vocal fold function. Preoperative evaluation demonstrates significant intrinsic abnormalities in sensory and motor function. Routine, comprehensive, multimodality preoperative and postoperative evaluation is required to identify at-risk children and reduce morbidity and resource utilization...|$|R
40|$|Aims. To {{demonstrate}} {{the principles and}} application of Mokken scaling. Background. The history and development of Mokken scaling is described, some examples of applications are given, and some recent development of the method are summarised. Design. Secondary analysis of data obtained by cross-sectional survey methods, including self-report and observation. Methods. Data from the Edinburgh <b>Feeding</b> <b>Evaluation</b> in Dementia scale and the Townsend Functional Ability Scale were analysed using the Mokken scaling procedure within the R statistical package. Specifically, invariant item ordering (the {{extent to which the}} order of the items in terms of difficulty was the same for all respondents whatever their total scale score) was studied. Results. The Edinburgh <b>Feeding</b> <b>Evaluation</b> in Dementia scale and the Townsend Functional Ability Scale showed no violations of invariant item ordering, although only the Townsend Functional Ability Scale showed a medium accuracy. Conclusion. Mokken scaling is an established method for item response theory analysis with wide application in the social sciences. It provides psychometricians with an additional tool in the development of questionnaires and in the study of individuals and their responses to latent traits. Specifically, with regard to the analyses conducted in this study, the Edinburgh <b>Feeding</b> <b>Evaluation</b> in Dementia scale requires further development and study across different levels of severity of dementia and feeding difficulty. Relevance to clinical practice. Good scales are required for assessment in clinical practice and the present paper shows how a relatively recently developed method for analysing Mokken scales can contribute to this. The two scales used as examples for analysis are highly clinically relevant...|$|R

40|$|Background Oropharyngeal {{aspiration}} (OPA) {{can lead}} to recurrent respiratory illnesses and chronic lung disease in children. Current clinical <b>feeding</b> <b>evaluations</b> performed by speech pathologists have poor reliability in detecting OPA when compared to radiological procedures such as the modified barium swallow (MBS). Improved ability to diagnose OPA accurately via clinical evaluation potentially reduces reliance on expensive, less readily available radiological procedures. Our study investigates the utility of adding cervical auscultation (CA), a technique of listening to swallowing sounds, in improving the diagnostic accuracy of a clinical evaluation {{for the detection of}} OPA. Methods We plan an open, unblinded, randomised controlled trial at a paediatric tertiary teaching hospital. Two hundred and sixteen children fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomised to one of the two clinical assessment techniques for the clinical detection of OPA: (1) clinical <b>feeding</b> <b>evaluation</b> only (CFE) group or (2) clinical <b>feeding</b> <b>evaluation</b> with cervical auscultation (CFE + CA) group. All children will then undergo an MBS to determine radiologically assessed OPA. The primary outcome is {{the presence or absence of}} OPA, as determined on MBS using the Penetration-Aspiration Scale. Our main objective is to determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of ‘CFE + CA’ versus ‘CFE’ only compared to MBS-identified OPA. Discussion Early detection and appropriate management of OPA is important to prevent chronic pulmonary disease and poor growth in children. As the reliability of CFE to detect OPA is low, a technique that can improve the diagnostic accuracy of the CFE will help minimise consequences to the paediatric respiratory system.

40|$|Current <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{systems for}} {{ruminants}} are too imprecise to describe diets {{in terms of}} their acidosis risk. The dynamic mechanistic model described herein arises from the integration of a lactic acid (La) metabolism module into an extant model of whole-rumen function. The model was evaluated using published data from cows and sheep fed a range of diets or infused with various doses of La. The model performed well in simulating peak rumen La concentrations (coefficient of determination = 0. 96; root mean square prediction error = 16. 96 % of observed mean), although frequency of sampling for the published data prevented a comprehensive comparison of prediction of time to peak La accumulation. The model showed a tendency for increased La accumulation following feeding of diets rich in nonstructural carbohydrates, although less-soluble starch sources such as corn tended to limit rumen La concentration. Simulated La absorption from the rumen remained low throughout the feeding cycle. The competition between bacteria and protozoa for rumen La suggests a variable contribution of protozoa to total La utilization. However, the model was unable to simulate the effects of defaunation on rumen La metabolism, indicating a need for a more detailed description of protozoal metabolism. The model could form the basis of a <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> system with regard to rumen La metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: {{fractional}} passage rate, grass, silage, 13 C-isotope, internal markers, {{dairy cows}} The main {{aim of this}} thesis was to acquire knowledge on the feed specific fractional passage rates of feedstuffs and feed components through different compartments of the gastro-intestinal tract of dairy cows. Fractional passage rates form, next to fractional degradation rates, the determining factors to quantify the escape part of feed components from the rumen. Current <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> systems use feed specific fractional degradation rates, but adopt fixed fractional passage rates. It is increasingly realised that also passage rates vary, amongst others {{with the level of}} feed intake, diet quality and diet composition. Besides, international developments in <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> move towards so-called "nutrient based" <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> systems that are more dynamic in nature. Knowledge on feed specific fractional passage rates is essential to further develop such dynamic systems. To meet our main aim, several animal trials were conducted in which the passage behaviour of feed particles originating from grass and grass silages were studied and compared with the traditionally used external markers Cr-NDF and Co-EDTA, using rumen and ileum cannulated animals. The roughages were labelled with the stable isotope of carbon (13 C), thus allowing to follow the passage behaviour of the dry matter, the cell wall and the non cell wall fractions. In all cases, 13 C gave slower ruminal passage rates compared to the external markers, and with respect to the labelled fractions the 13 C-labelled cell wall fractions gave the slowest fractional passage rates. A reduction in the level of feed intake of 40 % gave decreased marker passage rates with the highest impact on the rumen residence times for the cell wall fractions. The effect of roughage quality on ruminal marker passage was more pronounced for the internal markers compared to the external markers. In combination with in situ degradation characteristics our data indicates that 13 C seems to be a useful tool to quantify the relations between passage and degradation. Based on our findings it was concluded that the fixed fractional passage rates currently adopted in the Dutch protein evaluation system overestimate the in vivo situation. Besides, our data suggests the possibilities to introduce feed component specific fractional passage rates as a function of animal and dietary characteristics...|$|E

Background: Eating difficulties among patients with dementia have been identified in western society and typically progress as dementia advances. Findings from previous studies reflect that low food intake or weight loss might not be a consequence of people with dementia being unable or unwilling to eat independently. Design: The study consisted of observers' training and mealtime observations. Each data collector received two days of didactic and clinical training. Observation was done for two days during lunch and dinner. Methods: Four hundred seventy-seven participants were selected from residents with dementia at nine dementia special care units in licensed long-term care facilities in northern and central Taiwan. Data were collected using the Barthel index, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Edinburgh <b>Feeding</b> <b>Evaluation</b> in Dementia (EdFED) scale. Results: The prevalence of low food intake at meals in residents with dementia in LTCF's was 30 center dot 7...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} summarises {{the development}} of a ruminant livestock component for the Farm System Simulator (FSSIM). This includes treatments of energy and protein transactions in ruminant livestock that have been used as a basis for the biophysical simulations that will generate the input production parameters for FSSIM. The treatments are derived principally from the “French” <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> and rationing system for protein and energy. Currently, we have constructed routines that are capable of simulating input-output relationships for energy and protein in the following representative systems; dairy cattle; suckler cows; growing and finishing cattle; sheep and goats. The calculations of energy and protein requirements for these classes of livestock are described in detail in this documen...|$|E
40|$|The {{first edition}} of this book, {{published}} in 1993, provides {{a comprehensive review of}} the digestion and metabolism of ruminant animals. Since its publication, much new research has been conducted in the subject and knowledge has increased. This is incorporated in this second edition through the addition of five new chapters. These cover; the gas production technique in feed evaluation; calorimetry; the relationship between pasture characteristics and animal performance; feed processing; and the integration of data in <b>feed</b> <b>evaluation</b> systems. Other chapters have been expanded and updated as appropriate and Dr Dijkstra has also been enrolled as the lead editor. This book brings together quantitative approaches used in the study of mechanisms of ruminant digestion and metabolism...|$|E

40|$|Fermentation {{characteristics}} {{of grass and}} grass silage at different maturities were studied using in situ and in vitro gas production methods. In situ data determined difference between grass and silage. Degradable fraction decreased as grass matured while the undegradable fraction increased. Rate of degradation (kd) was slower for silage than fresh grass. Gas production method (GP) data showed that fermentation of degradable fraction was different between stage of maturity in both grass and silage. Other data did not show any difference with the exception for the rate of GP of soluble and undegradable fraction. The in situ degradation characteristics were estimated from GP characteristics. The degradable and undegradable fractions could be estimated by multiple relationships. Using the three-phases model for gas production kd and fermentable organic matter could be estimated from the same parameters. The only in situ parameter {{that could not be}} estimated with GP parameters was the soluble fraction. The GP method and the three phases model provided to be an alternative to the in situ method for animal <b>feed</b> <b>evaluations...</b>|$|R
