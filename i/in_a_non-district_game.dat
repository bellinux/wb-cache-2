50|$|In the movie, {{the top-ranked}} Permian Panthers {{defeated}} the hapless Marshall Bulldogs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-district</b> <b>game.</b> In real life, the third-ranked Marshall Mavericks (whose colors are red and white, not purple and gold) defeated fourth-ranked Permian 13-12. In the movie, {{the game was}} the season opener and played on a Friday night in Odessa. In real life, it was Permian's second game of the season, and played at Maverick Stadium in Marshall on a Saturday afternoon. Permian's football team chartered a jet for the 500+ mile trip from Odessa to Marshall, spawning controversy {{on the cost of}} the trip. Played before a crowd of more than 12,000 fans at Maverick Stadium, the game was on a searing September afternoon where the temperature topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 °C). The footage shown in the movie was from a game against the Midland High Bulldogs, who weren't mentioned in the movie. Permian defeated the Dawgs 42-0 in district play, but the two teams ended up in a three-way tie along with Midland Lee for the district title.|$|E

50|$|The {{lake was}} shallow, and {{frequent}} storms made the navigation complicated. Only special boats (belozerkas, белозерка) could navigate on the lake. The boats were constructed {{to provide for}} enhanced stability and durability. The ship manufacturers from Krokhino and Belozersk, who were also boat owners, were gaining big revenues on their monopoly. The town dwellers were employed as pilots and skippers, loaded merchandise or made and sold shipping appliances. Due to this stable source of revenue, Krokhino was growing fast. On November 4, 1777, Krokhinskaya Pristan was renamed into Posad (trading quarter). The Krokhino residents were exempt from their peasant duties and got {{the same rights as}} city dwellers. On May 23, 1792 the Town Hall was founded and Krokhino became <b>in</b> fact <b>a</b> <b>non-district</b> (non-uyezd) town.|$|R

50|$|Schooling in Waterford {{has had a}} {{long journey}} to get to where it is today. The {{transformation}} consisted of the construction of many new school buildings, additions to existing buildings, and many new students moving to the area every year. The first school that opened was the yellow-bricked Clark Lane School in 1953. The construction of this school marked a step towards all-town independence. Clark Lane School was <b>a</b> single-story <b>non-district</b> elementary school that had the town's first gymnasium and kindergarten classrooms with heated flooring. Additionally, the school housed the first purpose-built library. Later on, the library was replaced with a small cafeteria that was subsequently replaced in 1973 by one that was fourteen times larger. The school's first principal was Harold Goldberg, who served from 1964 to 1992. Students in kindergarten through sixth grade were brought from the four district schools to attend Clark Lane School.|$|R

These two new schools gave the Blue Ridge District eleven members that year except in football, where Cave Spring remained in AAA and Hidden Valley played <b>a</b> limited, solely <b>non-district</b> schedule.
