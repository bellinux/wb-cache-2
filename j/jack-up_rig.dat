A full suite of modern log and pressure data was acquired and the well was successfully tested.|$|E
40|$|Cantilever is {{the most}} {{important}} structure of the <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig.</b> Jack-up usually has three working conditions: drilling condition, storm condition, preloading condition. The fulcrums of the cantilever in the drilling condition are less than the other two. So the distribution of the cantilever force in the storm and preloading conditions becomes extremely complicated with the increase of fulcrums. In order to facilitate the evaluation of <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig</b> strength, a simplified analytical method and a finite element method (FEM) are presented to distribute the cantilever force on a <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig</b> during the storm and preloading conditions. For the simplified analytical method, the fulcrum force is obtained from the distance between the fulcrum and the position of the cantilever resultant force. For the FEM, the cantilever is assumed to be perfect rigid body without any strain. The fulcrum force is calculated according to the balance of the fulcrum forces. Both results of fulcrum force are analyzed and compared. It is shown that they are in good agreement. Thus both methods can be applied in distributing the cantilever force to evaluate the strength of <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig...</b>|$|E

40|$|The authors {{examine the}} {{production}} processes. The disadvantage of a <b>Jack-up</b> <b>rig</b> and method of its installation {{is the high}} constructive complexity of the devices supporting its float ability. This leads to large labour costs for installation and removal of jack-up floating drilling rig. A constraining factor {{in the development of}} projects on the shelf of the seas is the lack of technical means and technologies for the development of oil and gas fields, taking into account different climatic conditions, particularly in the Arctic seas...|$|E
40|$|Underwater {{noise was}} {{recorded}} from the Wavestar wave energy converter; a full-scale hydraulic point absorber, {{placed on a}} <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig</b> on the Danish North Sea coast. Noise was recorded 25 m from the converter with an autonomous recording unit (10 Hz to 20 kHz bandwidth). Median sound pressure levels (Leq) in third-octave bands during operation of the converter were 106 - 109 dB re. 1 μPa in the range 125 - 250 Hz, 1 - 2 dB above ambient noise levels (statistically significant). Outside the range 125 - 250 Hz the noise from the converter was undetectable above the ambient noise. During start and stop of the converter a more powerful tone at 150 Hz (sound pressure level (Leq) 121 - 125 dB re 1 μPa) was easily detectable. This tone likely originated from the hydraulic pump which was used to lower the absorbers {{into the water and}} lift them out of the water at shutdown. Noise levels from the operating wave converter were so low that they would barely be audible to marine mammals and the likelihood of negative impact from the noise appears minimal. A likely explanation for the low noise emissions is the construction of the converter where all moving parts, except for the absorbers themselves, are placed above water on a <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig.</b> The results may thus not be directly transferable to other wave converter designs but do demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} harness wave energy without noise pollution to the marine environment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, the {{hydrodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} various types of jack-up legs for a wind turbine installation vessel were analyzed. Using the modified Morison equation, the wave and current excitation forces on the jack-up legs were calculated. A modal analysis was performed to predict the dynamic responses for various types of jack-up legs. The Newmark-beta time integration scheme was used to solve the equation of motion in waves in the time domain. The maximum displacement and maximum bending stress were computed for four different types of legs, and their results were compared to select an optimum leg type. Finally, a six-leg <b>jack-up</b> <b>rig</b> with the selected optimal legs was modeled, and its natura...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Jack-Up</b> Rigs- <b>Jack-up</b> <b>rigs</b> are mobile {{platforms}} {{that are}} used for more shallow or non-permanent oil deposits. This platform can be moved around, and the legs are then lowered to the sea floor and lock into place. The legs rise above the water, meaning the platform is raised {{up out of the}} water. That makes this type of rig safer to work on, because weather and waves are not an issue.|$|R
