5|$|This {{incident}} and Phan's response are {{often cited as}} {{one of the reasons why}} he was so admired by the populace and among future generations of Vietnamese anti-colonialists: he adhered to the highest personal standards of patriotism.

5|$|Chrysostom and Leontius both {{lived in}} Antioch, {{the site of}} Philip's alleged humiliation and repentance, and wrote in the mid-4th century, one hundred years after the event took place. Shahîd takes this, along {{with the fact that}} Babylas is not named in Eusebius' account, as {{evidence}} of an independent local tradition. This tradition would have been perhaps partially oral in nature, and <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> written accounts in Eusebius' library at Caesarea. Many other historians trace Chrysostom and Leontius' accounts back to Eusebius: Hans Pohlsander counts Chrysostom and Leontius' accounts as later accretions to Eusebius original account, dependent on his Historia for their legendary core; John Gregg holds that this dependent relationship is most probable; and Stein claims all three Greeks as contributors to the same gerüchte.|$|E

5|$|Historian Ron Chernow is of {{the opinion}} that his frustrations in dealing with {{government}} officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency that could get results; other historians tend to ascribe Washington's position on government to his later American Revolutionary War service. He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars. On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of at most 1,000 men and came only in remote frontier conditions that were <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> urban situations that he faced during the Revolution at Boston, New York, Trenton, and Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Nara period Buddhism was {{dominated}} by six state-controlled sects. They were introduced from the mainland and centred around the ancient capitals in Asuka and Nara. These schools were generally academic in nature, closely connected with the court and represented a doctrine that was <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> daily life of the people. In 804, two Japanese monks Kūkai and Saichō travelled to China; on their return they established Tendai and Shingon Buddhism respectively. Unlike their predecessors both esoteric schools took into account {{the needs of the}} common people. Though their origins lay in China, with time they acquired local Japanese traits. Generally the 9th century was a time when Chinese learning thrived in Japan. Authors produced a wide variety of works in Chinese language, including commentaries and treatises on a variety of subjects.|$|E
5|$|The war to {{the south}} {{influenced}} British policy in Canada, where between 40,000 and 100,000 defeated Loyalists had migrated from the new United States following independence. The 14,000 Loyalists {{who went to the}} Saint John and Saint Croix river valleys, then part of Nova Scotia, felt too <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> provincial government in Halifax, so London split off New Brunswick as a separate colony in 1784. The Constitutional Act of 1791 created the provinces of Upper Canada (mainly English-speaking) and Lower Canada (mainly French-speaking) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Gabrielle {{was located in}} an area of cooler air to its north, dry air to its south and west, southerly wind shear, and cooler water temperatures along its path. Despite these unfavorable conditions, a curved convective band developed in its northern and western quadrants, and the circulation became better defined. Subsequently, the rainbands in its northeastern quadrant dissipated, leaving the well-defined center <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> convection. By later that day, the circulation began to become more involved with the remaining convection. Based on evidence of a weak warm-core, the system was re-designated as Tropical Storm Gabrielle late on September 8 about 185miles (300km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Upon making landfall, the {{tropical}} storm produced strong winds {{over a wide}} area. The strongest winds were reported by a station in San Antonio, Texas, which reported 40mph (65km/h) winds, <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm's center; these strong winds were likely due to squalls. Heavy rainfall was also reported, though the rains mainly occurred {{to the east of}} the passing tropical cyclone. Precipitation peaked at 10in (254mm) in Ville Platte, Louisiana. The tropical storm produced three tornadoes over the Southern United States which collecitvely caused $39,000in damage and caused two fatalities. Two of the tornadoes formed in Mississippi while one formed in Louisiana. Several other people were also injured by the tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Architectural styles evolve {{and change}} {{to suit the}} {{requirements}} of each individual client. When in 1746 the Duke of Bedford decided to rebuild Woburn Abbey, he chose the Palladian style for the design, as this was now the most fashionable of the era. He selected architect Henry Flitcroft, a protege of Burlington. Flitcroft's designs, while Palladian in nature, would not be recognised by Palladio himself. The central block is small, only three bays, the temple-like portico is merely suggested, and it is closed. Two great flanking wings containing a vast suite of state rooms replace the walls or colonnades which should have connected to the farm buildings; the farm buildings terminating the structure are elevated in height to match the central block, and given Palladian windows, to ensure they are seen as of Palladian design. This development of the style was to be repeated in countless houses, and town halls in Britain over one hundred years. Falling from favour during the Victorian era, it was revived by Sir Aston Webb for his refacing of Buckingham Palace in 1913. Often the terminating blocks would have blind porticos and pilasters themselves, competing for attention with, or complementing the central block. This was all very <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> designs of Palladio two hundred years earlier.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} {{represented a}} watershed {{in the campaign}} for the Australians, and while they had deployed outside Phuoc Tuy Province previously, they now faced regular North Vietnamese formations and Viet Cong Main Force units operating in battalion and regimental strength, rather than southern Viet Cong guerrillas. With 1 ATF deploying astride the communist lines of communication the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong {{had been forced to}} respond, resulting in a set-piece battle <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> counter-insurgency doctrine the Australians normally espoused. Yet while the battle ended in victory for 1 ATF, they had come close to suffering defeat {{at the hands of the}} North Vietnamese. Inexperienced at large air-mobile operations, poor reconnaissance and inadequate operational planning had caused delays and confusion during the fly-in to FSB Coral, leaving the Australian force exposed to attack on the first night. The North Vietnamese had fought in greater numbers, with heavier firepower and greater intensity than previously experienced by the Australians in Vietnam, forcing them to refine their tactics. Later, the Australian use of platoon patrols to search an area and conduct ambushes was challenged by the constant movement of North Vietnamese forces operating in superior strength, which threatened to quickly overwhelm an isolated patrol.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the virtues}} of {{heterodyne}} detection is that the difference frequency is generally <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> spectrally <b>from</b> <b>the</b> potential noises radiated {{during the process of}} generating either the signal or the LO signal, thus the spectral region near the difference frequency may be relatively quiet. Hence, narrow electronic filtering near the difference frequency is highly effective at removing the remaining, generally broadband, noise sources.|$|R
