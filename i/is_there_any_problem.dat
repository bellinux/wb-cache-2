In fact,in a Lay judges in Japan, during the trial before the judges and citizen judges, they have been removed"handcuffs / leash". This is because "handcuffs / leash" may ffaect the free conviction of general citizens. Then, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> with the current system using "handcuffs / leash" for criminal cases other　than the cases by lay judges?

As a result, {{it turned out that the}} "handcuffs / leash" measures violate the provisions of International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights. Also, this measure is proved to be problematic even from the perspective of domestic laws. In addition, this paper is based on my speech at a symposium "Handcuffs in the court · leash are allowed?~ Moral rights of criminal defendants / right to be guilty -", hosted by the Osaka Bar Association held on January 16, 2008. 起訴後の刑事被告人がいわゆる手錠・腰縄を身につけ捕縛された状態で公判廷に入る取扱いについては、かねてより無罪推定の原則を侵し得るとの指摘がなされてきた。実際に、市民が職業裁判官とともに合議体を形成する裁判員裁判においては、一般市民である裁判員の心証に影響し得るとの理由に基づき、裁判官および裁判員の入廷前にこれらを外せる運用が行われている。それでは、それ以外の刑事事件につき手錠・腰縄をなす現措置には問題があるか。国際法・国際人権法の観点から一考察をなした。その結果、該措置は日本が批准する国際人権規約等の規定に違反する可能性があり、また国内法解釈においても問題があることがわかった。 　なお本稿は、「法廷内の手錠・腰縄は許されるのか？～刑事被告人の人格権・無罪推定を受け る権利」と題して平成 28 年 1 月 16 日に催された大阪弁護士会主催シンポジウムで講演した内容を 基に加筆修正したものである...|$|E

The study was conducted at SMP N 2 Kendal. In this research, data relates learning assessment based on the 2013 curriculum in ELT class at VII and VIII grade of SMP N 2 Kendal. The sources of data are document related to the 2013 curriculum and learning assessment, English teacher and vice principal concerning with curriculum. So, this is a descriptive qualitative research. The techniques of data collection was used by the writer are interview, observation and documentation. And the final result of this research is the implementation of learning assessment based on the 2013 curriculum in ELT class at VII and VIII grade of SMP N 2 Kendal is suitable with the procedure. But there are some problems on the implementation of learning assessment based on the 2013 curriculum such as cost of assessment. Besides that conversion change and journal assessment also makes the teacher difficult in making assessment. It is because the teachers’ understanding about new curriculum still minimum, but they are always effort to implement the 2013 curriculum maximally by follow the training organized from government, MGMP, and IHT. In addition, in the sidelines of the break, the teacher did not hesitate to ask about 2013 curriculum to other teachers when they feel confused...|$|E

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{benefits}} Cue: While agroforestry, as a science, is quite new, in fact farmers have been enjoying the benefits of having trees on their farms for generations. Some trees, for example, produce nutrient-rich leaves which, when they fall on the soil, act as a natural fertilizer. In the lakeshore areas of Malawi, Faidherbia albida trees, known locally as msangu, are often left by farmers, who recognise the fertility benefit they give. But agroforestry {{is about more than}} just increasing soil fertility. Carefully chosen trees and shrubs, if planted on farms, can provide a huge range of benefits, from building materials to insecticides. Excello Zidana recently spoke to Dr Henry Phombeya, Project Co-ordinator for Malawi?s Land Resource Centre, about the many advantages of having trees on farms. IN:		?There are several and normally I like dividing them. ? OUT:		?. agroforestry really can help to boast crop yields. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 29 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Henry Phombeya of Malawi?s Land Resource Centre, talking to Excello Zidana. Transcript Phombeya	There are several and normally I like dividing them in two categories. We?ve got some technologies that are dealing with soil fertility improvement and for these we use shrubs like Tephrosia vogelii, Sesbania sesban, and trees like Faidherbia albida locally known as msangu or mtete. And then there are some technologies that are to do more with afforestation. And here we have trees like the Sennas, Senna spectabilis, Senna siamea. Zidana		What are the other forms of agroforestry that you have been using or that you know? Phombeya	There are other forms yes of agroforestry technologies. For example we can talk of biomass transfer. These are instances where you?ve got trees that are planted say as boundaries around your farm. You can at times prune the branches, take the biomass that you realise from there and apply it to your field. That {{has proved to be a}} very important technology and crops have improved under such systems. And then when you get the leaves like that you have the branches and of course the tree you can use for fuel wood. So you have got two benefits here. Not even two, three. You are improving soil fertility, you have the trees that are demarcating your boundaries to avoid conflict with your neighbours and then you?ve got the fuel wood which is a very important factor now that there is rampant deforestation. Zidana	When we look around in the villages in Malawi we have discovered that a number of farmers have taken up the technology of using Tephrosia vogelii. What are the specific advantages regarding this shrub? Phombeya	Tephrosia it?s a very important shrub in that first and foremost it has got a very good biomass that when we incorporate in the soil it helps to build up organic matter. And at the same time it?s a legume, it fixes nitrogen. That?s contributing to soil fertility. But up and above that Tephrosia vogelii has got some insecticidal properties. If you crush the leaves of Tephrosia vogelii and you?ve got maize stalk borer, you put it in the maize funnel the maize stalk borer goes away. So it has got that insecticidal property that is a very important component. Zidana	You also talked about the tree which is locally known as msangu in Malawi. Phombeya	Faidherbia albida, that is the scientific name. Zidana	Faidherbia albida. Now if we talk about the lake shore areas, these trees are numerous, they are all over. Do the farmers realise the importance of retaining or keeping these trees? Phombeya	Yes I did research on Faidherbia albida specifically. And in the survey that we conducted it showed that people value these trees and they deliberately leave them on their farms. And asking them about why they leave them there their answers were, if you plant maize underneath a Faidherbia albida tree it does very well and you?ve got a variety of crops that can be grown underneath it. So in a way they know it?s an important tree. Zidana	So they are convinced that if you are using these trees definitely the fertility of the soil may be improved in one way or the other? Phombeya	Yes, they are aware of that, only that they don?t know exactly what happens for that fertility to come about and that?s the work of the scientist. Zidana	You have been talking about the trees like Leucaena but now we haven?t seen you doing much on the Leucaena. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>problem?</b> Phombeya	Yes Leucaena leucocephala was a very important tree in those old days when agroforestry just came into the picture. But as we were working with it a terrible pest attacked it. That pest is called psyllid; it?s a pest that attacks the leaves, the tender leaves of Leucaena and it devastates the whole tree. A very dangerous pest. Zidana	But the animals enjoyed consuming or eating the leaves from the Leucaena tree? Phombeya	It was a very good fodder, highly nutritive. But all is not lost because breeders are looking at other species of Leucaena, like Leucaena pallida, Leucaena esculenta. They are looking at Leucaena that have resistance to psyllid attack. Zidana		How do you look at farming if many people adopted this concept? Phombeya	If people adopted agroforestry, like others have already done, productivity of their farms will be very high. We compared fields where we had just maize growing on its own and a plot where we had maize and then the agroforestry species and a bit of chemical fertiliser. The differences in yields were just too high, over 200 %. So agroforestry really can help to boost crop yields. End of track.

This was done due to the criticality of the system caused by growing number of users as the Linux Terminal Service Project system expands. Although many of the supporting tasks can be done via Secure Shell connection, testing graphical programs or desktop behaviour in such a way is impossible. At first basic technologies behind the NX Remote Desktop were studied, and after that started the testing of two possible programs, FreeNX and NoMachine NX server. Testing the functionality and bandwidth demands were first done in a closed local area network, and results were studied. The better candidate was then installed in a virtual server simulating actual Linux Terminal Service Project server at Finnish Meteorological Institute and connection from Internet was tested to see <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>problems</b> with firewalls and security policies. The results are reported in this study. Studying and testing the two different candidates of NX Remote Desktop showed, that NoMachine NX Server provides better customer support and documentation. Security aspects of the Finnish Meteorological Institute had also to be considered, and since updates along with the new developing tools are announced in next version of the program, this version was the choice. Studies also show that even NoMachine promises a swift connection over an average of 20 Kbit/s bandwidth, at least double of that is needed. This project gives an overview of available remote desktop products along their benefits. NX Remote Desktop technology is studied, and installation instructions are included. Testing is done in both, closed and the actual environment and problems and suggestions are studied and analyzed.
