50|$|Unified Framework is {{a general}} {{formulation}} which yields nth - order expressions giving mode shapes and natural frequencies for damaged elastic structures such as rods, beams, plates, and shells. The formulation is applicable to structures with any shape of damage or those having more than one area of damage. The formulation uses the geometric definition of the discontinuity at the damage location and perturbation to modes and natural frequencies of the undamaged structure to determine the mode shapes and natural frequencies of the damaged structure. The <b>geometric</b> <b>discontinuity</b> at the damage location manifests itself in terms of discontinuities in the cross-sectional properties, such as {{the depth of the}} structure, the cross-sectional area or the area moment of inertia. The change in cross-sectional properties in turn affects the stiffness and mass distribution. Considering the <b>geometric</b> <b>discontinuity</b> along with the perturbation of modes and natural frequencies, the initial homogeneous differential equation with nonconstant coefficients is changed to a series of non-homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients. Solutions of this series of differential equations is obtained in this framework.|$|E

This analysis necessarily involves determining the parameters of the asymptotic uniqueness constraints. These parameters are the stress intensity factor, the tensor and standardized the order of singularity. This last parameter that indicates the severity of the singularity. It is directly connected to the geometric aspect, and incompatible materials present in the structure.
