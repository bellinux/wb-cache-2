C Battery redeployed in August 2009 and was returned to its organic Battalion. In 2011 Charlie Battery was deactivated, while 4th 133rd was reorganized into a HIMARS Battalion.|$|E
50|$|In January 1968, a new crisis, {{the seizure}} of the American ship USS Pueblo by North Korean forces, and again the 113th was called to active duty. The wing was {{activated}} to federal service, and its personnel were assigned to Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina as a <b>filler</b> <b>unit</b> while the base's permanent unit, the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing was deployed to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea. At Myrtle Beach AFB, the federalized NJ ANG 119th Tactical Fighter Squadron joined the 121st TFS on active duty. However, not all wing personnel were sent to Myrtle Beach, as personnel were spread throughout the United States, Taiwan, Korea, and South Vietnam.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA novel tin-based FOSS analogue, butylstannoxane dodecamer, was {{incorporated}} into epoxy networks with strongly different mesh sizes {{in comparison to the}} nanofiller dimensions. The stannoxane cage is especially attractive due to its anti-oxidative effect, which is based on oxidative crosslinking reactions. It can also cause additional reinforcement via nanofiller units' oligomerization. The strongest mechanical reinforcement was observed in nanocomposites with a network mesh width close, but somewhat larger, than was the stannoxane cage size. In the narrow-mesh-matrix, the large rigid nanofiller causes a plastification, due to sterical impossibility of formation of some crosslinks around the <b>filler</b> <b>units.</b> The strongest anti-oxidative effect of the stannoxane was observed in the matrix with the widest mesh, which had the longest polypropylene oxide chains, and hence the largest number of sites potentially reacting with the stannoxane in oxidative crosslinking reactions. The homogeneity of the prepared nanocomposites was evaluated by TEM...|$|R

40|$|Background: Because of {{its role}} in the {{incidence}} of serious microbial infections, the contamination of dental unit water lines is concerned. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the bacterial contamination of dental unit water lines to gram-positive cocci at Kerman. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Environmental Health Engineering Research Center of Kerman University of Medical Sciences (KUMS) during 2015. Randomly 4 units among each of the departments of Dental School of KUMS (Pediatrics, Orthodontics, Oral surgery, Maxillofacial and Oral medicine) were selected. Samples were transported to the laboratory in sterile containers. Results: No contamination to gram-positive cocci in drinking water samples were reported. Among the water samples taken from Dental School the highest bacterial count was for the Oral medicine department (the cup <b>filler</b> <b>unit</b> 26 / 25 cfu/mL and 32 / 18 cfu/mL and the lowest bacterial count was for Oral surgery, Maxillofacial departments [parts exposed to the weather unit 23 / 25 (cfu/mL) and 24 / 43 (cfu/mL) ]. Conclusion: The prevalence of gram positive cocci in dental units of the departments was high.

40|$|Abstract. Monte Carlo simulations, {{utilizing}} embedded atom method (EAM) potentials, {{are employed}} to inves-tigate in detail solute-atom segregation behavior at high-angle symmetrical (002) twist boundaries, at T = 850 K, in Pt- 3 at. % Ni and Ni- 3 at. % Pt alloys. Solute enhancement i those alloys occurs {{on both sides}} of the phase diagram, although it is considerably higher on the Ni-rich side. The distributions of solute concentrations within the first and the second planes are very inhomogeneous, with the sites highly enhanced in solute being in the minority. The remaining sites exhibit little or no enhancement. The highest level of solute concentrations at individual sites continues to increase with the value of the rotation angle, 0, until saturation occurs at about he E = 5 misorienta-tion. The large differences in concentrations between different types of sites suggest the possibility of an ordered grain-boundary phase. The correlation between the structure and solute species concentrations i most cases follows the trends observed for low-angle boundaries: Pt as a solute prefers the structural units of the perfect crystal type, while Ni as a solute tends to segregate at the <b>filler</b> <b>units</b> associated with the cores of the primary grain boundary dislocations. A strong correlation is observed between the position of a site in the first or second (002) plane and the plane of the interface. Rigid-body translations are detected for two boundaries on the Pt-rich side of the phase diagram. Roughening and possible structural multiplicity occur in the ~ = 5 boundary on the Ni-rich side. The same boundary on the Pt-rich side of the phase diagram exhibits a considerable amount of structural and chemical disorder...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} high {{surface area}} sp 2 carbon allotropes as important tools {{to design and}} prepare lightweight materials. Composites were prepared based on either carbon black (CB) or carbon nanotubes (CNT) or hybrid CB/CNT filler systems, with either poly(1, 4 -cis-isoprene) or poly(styrene-co-butadiene) as the polymer matrix. A correlation was established between the specific interfacial area (i. a.), i. e. the surface made available by the <b>filler</b> per <b>unit</b> volume of composite, and the initial modulus of the composite (G′γmin), determined through dynamic mechanical shear tests. Experimental points could be fitted with a common line, a sort of master curve, up to about 30. 2 and 9. 8 mass% as CB and CNT content, respectively. The equation of such master curve allowed to correlate modulus and density of the composite. Thanks to the master curve, composites with the same modulus and lower density could be designed by substituting part of CB with lower amount of the carbon allotrope with larger surface area, CNT. This work establishes a quantitative correlation {{as a tool to}} design lightweight materials and paves the way for large scale application in polymer matrices of innovative sp 2 carbon allotropes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. BCM (Biology Cilium Magnetic) {{technology}} {{is a kind of}} municipal wastewater advanced treatment technology. By using high elastic cilia filler in the oxygen unit, the volume loading of oxygen unit has been greatly increased, and more solubility pollutants could be removed in the oxygen unit.

The effect of BCM {{technology is}} that all pollutants indexes could reach to the first level A standard of GB 18918 - 2002. BCM technology is suitable for AA/O, oxidation ditch and SBR process which needs to be upgraded from the first level B to the first level A standard. The high elastic cilia <b>filler</b> in oxygen <b>unit</b> doesn’t require extra land and extra air. The magnetic separation coagulation system only needs very small land.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} and cross-link density of model composites being solution styrene-butadiene rubbers filled with different amounts of nanosized silica particles or mixtures of nanosized silica particles and micrometer-sized borosilicate glass particles are studied. The cross-link {{density of the}} rubber matrix is measured based on a double-quantum NMR pectroscopy method. Shear data show that reinforcement and dissipation G '' in the rubber plateau range depend systematically on the total surface area of the <b>filler</b> per <b>unit</b> composite. Different contributions to reinforcement due to hydrodynamic effects, "filler network", glassy polymer layer, and "occluded rubber" are quantified based on a comparison of linear response measurements with strain sweeps performed at different temperatures. The results show a percolation threshold at silica volume fractions of about 0. 15. The load-carrying capacity of the "filler network" decreases significantly with temperature. This may indicate {{the existence of a}} glassy polymer layer {{on the surface of the}} filler particles which softens several ten degrees above the bulk T-g of the rubber matrix. Two regimes are found in the dissipation above T-g which both depend systematically on the surface area of the filler system: A strongly frequency-dependent dissipation regime with power-law behavior is observed in G ''(omega) at temperatures up to 70 K above the bulk T-g, and a nearly frequency-independent G '' regime dominates at higher temperatures. The molecular nature and importance of this finding for tire applications are discussed...|$|R
