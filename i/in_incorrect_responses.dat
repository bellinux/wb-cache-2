40|$|Abstract Five {{experiments}} {{tested the}} idea that instruct-ing a witness to close their eyes during retrieval might increase retrieval success. In Experiment 1 participants watched a video, before a cued-recall test {{for which they were}} either instructed to close their eyes, or received no-instructions. Eye-closure led to an increase in correct cued-recall, with no increase <b>in</b> <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses.</b> Experiments 2 – 5 sought to test the generality of this effect over varia-tions in study material (video or live interaction), test format (cued- or free-recall) and information modality (visual or auditory details recalled). Overall, eye-closure increased recall of both visual detail and auditory details, with no accompanying increase in recall of false details. Collectively, these data convincingly demonstrate the benefits of eye-closure as an aid to retrieval, and offe...|$|E

Recognizing changes in shape, especially in a visually-dominant organism, can assist in dealing with these reef structure changes and prey availability loss. I examined the ability of two stomatopod species: Haptosquilla trispinosa and Pseudosquilla ciliata to learn to distinguish between a circle and a square, using simple food conditioning techniques for 30 days and 15 days, respectively, including a priming period of 10 days per group. Both H. trispinosa and P. ciliata groups were conditioned to the circle. Each group had four individuals. H. trispinosa’s total number of responses decreased over time, {{with an increase in}} correct responses and decrease <b>in</b> <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses.</b> This trend indicates the presence of shape discrimination learning as well as test learning. P. ciliata had a higher percentage of correct responses across all time blocks in comparison to H. trispinosa due to their differing predator tactics. P. ciliata are spearers, ambush predators that rely on quick information intake to surprise prey, while H. trispinosa are smashers, foraging predators that depend on repetitive impacting motions to stun/ kill prey. More behavioral studies need to be conducted to assess the stomatopod’s ability to cope with current environmental conditions, but there is clear visual discriminatory learning capability in this organism that can assist in flexible adaptations...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} report that {{introduces}} appropriate behavioral tasks for monkeys for investigations of working memory for temporal and nontemporal events. Using several behavioral tests, the study also shows how temporal information is coded during retention intervals in the tasks. Each of three monkeys was trained with two working memory tasks: delayed matching-to-sample of stimulus duration (DMS-D) and delayed matching-to-sample of stimulus color (DMS-C). The two tasks employed an identical apparatus and responses and differed only in the temporal and nontemporal attribute of the stimuli to be retained for correct performance. When a retention interval between the sample and comparison stimuli was prolonged, the monkeys made more incorrect responses to short samples in the DMS-C task, suggesting “trace decay ” of memory for short stimuli. However, the same monkeys showed no such increase <b>in</b> <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses</b> to short samples in the DMS-D task, suggesting active coding of temporal information, that is, the length of stimulus duration, during the retention interval. When variable lengths of samples were presented with a fixed retention interval, the monkeys made more incorrect responses when length differences between short and long samples were small in the DMS-D task, {{but not in the}} DMS-C task. This suggests that the codes of working memory retained in the DMS-D task were not absolute (analogical) but rather were relative (categorical) and related to differences in the duration of the samples...|$|E

40|$|Studies {{revealed}} {{that patients with}} paranoid schizophrenia display overconfidence in errors for memory and social cognition tasks. The present investigation examined whether this pattern holds true for visual perception tasks. Nonclinical participants were recruited via an online panel. Individuals {{were asked to complete}} a questionnaire that included the Paranoia Checklist and were then presented with 24 blurry pictures; half contained a hidden object while the other half showed snowy (visual) noise. Participants were asked to state whether the visual items contained an object and how confident they were in their judgment. Data from 1966 individuals were included following a conservative selection process. Participants high on core paranoid symptoms showed a poor calibration of confidence for correct versus incorrect responses. In particular, participants high on paranoia displayed overconfidence <b>in</b> <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses</b> and demonstrated a 20 % error rate for responses made with high confidence compared to a 12 % error rate in participants with low paranoia scores. Interestingly, paranoia scores declined after performance of the task. For the first time, overconfidence in errors was demonstrated among individuals with high levels of paranoia using a visual perception task, tentatively suggesting it is a ubiquitous phenomenon. In view of the significant decline in paranoia across time, bias modification programs may incorporate items such as the one employed here to teach patients with clinical paranoia the fallibility of human cognition, which may foster subsequent symptom improvement...|$|E
40|$|Most {{cognitive}} theories {{assume that}} confidence and choice happen simultaneously and {{are based on}} the same information. The 3 studies presented in this article instead show that confidence judgments can arise, at least in part, from a postdecisional evidence accumulation process. As a result of this process, increasing the time between making a choice and confidence judgment improves confidence resolution. This finding contradicts the notion that confidence judgments are biased by decision makers seeking confirmatory evidence. Further analysis reveals that the improved resolution is due to a reduction in confidence <b>in</b> <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses,</b> while confidence in correct responses remains relatively constant. These results are modeled with a sequential sampling process that allows evidence accumulation to continue after a choice is made and maps the amount of accumulated evidence onto a confidence rating. The cognitive modeling analysis reveals that the rate of evidence accumulation following a choice does slow relative to the rate preceding choice. The analysis also shows that the asymmetry between confidence in correct and incorrect choices is compatible with state-dependent decay in the accumulated evidence: Evidence consistent with the current state results in a deceleration of accumulated evidence and consequently evidence appears to have a decreasing impact on observed confidence. In contrast, evidence inconsistent with the current state results in an acceleration of accumulated evidence toward the opposite direction and consequently evidence appears to have an increasing impact on confidence. Taken together, this process-level understanding of confidence suggests a simple strategy for improving confidence accuracy: take a bit more time to make confidence judgments...|$|E
40|$|Background. In {{previous}} studies we suggested that liberal acceptance (LA) represents a fundamental cognitive bias in schizophrenia and {{may explain why}} patients {{are more willing to}} accept weak response alternatives and display overconfidence <b>in</b> <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses.</b> The aim {{of the present study was}} to test a central assumption of the LA account: false alarms in schizophrenia should be particularly increased when the distractor–target resemblance is weak relative to a control group. Method. Sixty-eight schizophrenia patients were compared to 25 healthy controls on a visual memory task. At encoding, participants studied eight complex displays, each consisting of a unique pairing of four stimulus attributes: symbol, shape, position and colour. At recognition, studied items were presented along with distractors that resembled the targets to varying degrees (i. e. the match between distractors and targets ranged from one to three attributes). Participants were required to make old/new judgements graded for confidence. Results. The hypotheses were confirmed: false recognition was increased for patients compared to controls for weakly and moderately related distractors only, whereas strong lure items induced similar levels of false recognition for both groups. In accordance with prior research, patients displayed a significantly reduced confidence gap and enhanced knowledge corruption compared to controls. Finally, higher neuroleptic dosage was related to a decreased number of high-confident ratings. Conclusions. These data assert that LA is a core mechanism contributing to both enhanced acceptance of weakly supported response alternatives and metamemory deficits, and this may be linked to the emergence of positive symptomatology...|$|E

The effects of a single four hour exposure to toluene on signalled bar press shock avoidance in rats were tested. Rats exposed to 125, 250, and 500 ppm toluene showed a decline in conditioned avoidance responses at 20 minutes exposure compared with the pre-exposure baseline, although they recovered to almost the same level of performance as that before exposure. Exposure to 1000 ppm toluene for about four hours and 2000 ppm for two hours produced a concentration related increase <b>in</b> <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses,</b> acceleration of the reaction time, and decreases in the effective avoidance response rate. Beginning at 4000 ppm toluene exposure, the response rate increased; thereafter, it gradually decreased and finally slight ataxia was observed.

From analysis of the temporal courses of the blood and brain toluene concentrations during and after each exposure, excitative performance decrements were noticed in rats with blood and brain concentrations about 27 micrograms/ml blood and 32 micrograms/g respectively. Anaesthetic performance decrements were seen when the blood toluene concentration increased to 120 micrograms/ml and that of the brain reached about 160 micrograms/g.

Methods: This was an exploratory, cross-sectional study conducted using a convenience sample of 104 Year 3 dental students completing 20 MCQs on implant dentistry. Students were asked to select the most correct response and to indicate their confidence in it for each question. Identifying both correctness and confidence allowed the designation of uninformed (incorrect and not confident) or misinformed (incorrect but confident) responses. In addition to recording correct/incorrect responses and student confidence, faculty staff designated incorrect responses as benign, inappropriate or potentially harmful if applied to clinical care. Question type was identified as factual or complex. Logistic regression was used to evaluate relationships between student confidence, and question type and gender. Results: Students were misinformed more often than uninformed (22 % versus 8 %), and misinformed responses were more common with complex than factual questions (p < 0. 05). Students {{were significantly more likely to}} be confident of correct than incorrect benign, incorrect inappropriate or incorrect harmful answers (p < 0. 001), but, contrary to expectations, confidence did not decrease as answers became more harmful. Conclusions: Recording student confidence was helpful in identifying uninformed versus misinformed responses, which may allow for targeted remediation strategies. Making errors of calibration (confidence and accuracy) more visible may be relevant in feedback for professional development.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{frequency}} of misconceptions amongst dental students resulting from assessments in different subject areas using different types of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). We {{wanted to know whether}} misconceptions, or strongly held incorrect beliefs, differed by subject area or question type. A total of 104 students completed two assessments that included 20 MCQs on endodontics and 20 MCQs on dental implants. On each examination, 10 questions were scenario-type questions requiring interpretation or analysis and 10 questions were factual-based, knowledge questions. <b>Incorrect</b> <b>responses</b> and confidence levels by student and subject were recorded for a comparison of average misconceptions by question type and for correlations between scenario and knowledge question types for misconceptions on both assessments.

Adolescents (16 – 17 -year olds) and young adults (23 – 30 -year olds) were tested on a cued task switching paradigm specifically designed to isolate response preparation from response execution. A combined ERP and eletromyographic (EMG) investigation revealed that adolescents have attenuated contingent negative variation (CNV) activity during response preparation followed by larger P 3 b amplitude and EMG activity <b>in</b> the <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> hand during response execution. This is consistent with deficient response preparation and a reactive control strategy. Conversely young adults engaged increased response preparation followed by attenuated P 3 b activity and early EMG activity in the correct response hand during response execution which indicates a proactive control strategy. Through real time tracking of response-related processing we provide direct evidence of a developmental dissociation between reactive and proactive control. We assert that adoption of a proactive control strategy by adolescents is an important step in the transition to adulthood...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was {{to determine the extent to}} which individuals with or without traumatic brain injury (TBI) incorporate gestural and verbal information when interpreting indirect requests. Eighteen adults with severe TBI and eighteen neurologically-intact adults viewed 12 video vignettes depicting actors conversing in everyday communicative contexts. Each vignette concluded with an indirect request. The vignettes were presented in three conditions: verbal information only (VO), gestural information only (GO), and combined verbal and gestural information (VG). Following each vignette, participants answered prediction and interpretation probes to ascertain their understanding of the indirect requests. Responses to both probe questions were combined to form a single comprehension score. Computation of a 2 X 3 mixed-groups factorial ANOVA revealed the same performance pattern across both participant groups, with significantly better performance in the VG condition than either the VO or GO conditions; however, neurologically-intact participants performed significantly better than participants with TBI in all conditions. Further analysis involved categorization of <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses</b> to determine the basis for participant errors. In the VO and VG conditions, most <b>incorrect</b> prediction probe <b>responses</b> provided by members of both participant groups were feasible predictions in that they referenced possible future actions but with no mention of the action implied by indirect request; in contrast, most error responses in the GO condition were contextual in nature, referencing the context but not indirect request. <b>Incorrect</b> interpretation probe <b>responses</b> by neurologically-intact individuals most frequently revealed incorrect interpretation of the indirect request in the VO condition, contextual reference in the GO condition, and literal interpretation in the VG condition. <b>In</b> contrast, most <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses</b> provided by participants with TBI were literal or <b>incorrect</b> <b>in</b> the VO and VG conditions and contextual in the GO condition.

40|$|Human {{subjects}} were intermittently reinforced with money for performing correctly on a conditional matching-to-sample task. The matching performance was examined {{as a function}} of a) the duration of Time-Outs (TOs) which followed every <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> and b) the frequency (FR value) with which TOs followed <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses.</b> The matching accuracy increased with longer TOs and decreased with less frequent presentation of TOs...|$|R

40|$|Processing {{irrelevant}} {{visual information}} sometimes activates <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> impulses. The engagement of cognitive control mechanisms to suppress these impulses and make proactive adjustments {{to reduce the}} future impact of incorrect impulses may rely on the integrity of frontal-basal ganglia circuitry. Using a Simon task, we investigated the effects of basal ganglia dysfunction produced by Parkinson's disease (PD) on both on-line (within-trial) and proactive (between-trial) control efforts to reduce interference produced by the activation of an <b>incorrect</b> <b>response.</b> As a novel feature, we applied distributional analyses, guided by the activation-suppression model, to differentiate the strength of <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> activation and the proficiency of suppression engaged to counter this activation. For situations requiring on-line control, PD (n = 52) and healthy control (n = 30) groups showed similar mean interference effects (i. e., Simon effects) on reaction time (RT) and accuracy. Distributional analyses showed that although the strength of <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> impulses was similar between the groups PD patients were less proficient at suppressing these impulses. Both groups demonstrated equivalent and effective proactive control of response interference on mean RT and accuracy rates. However, PD patients were less effective at reducing the strength of <b>incorrect</b> <b>response</b> activation proactively. Among PD patients, motor symptom severity was associated with difficulties in on-line, but not in proactive, control of response impulses. These results suggest that basal ganglia dysfunction produced by PD has selective effects on cognitive control mechanisms engaged to resolve response conflict, with primary deficits in the on-line suppression of <b>incorrect</b> <b>responses</b> occurring <b>in</b> {{the context of a}} relatively spared ability to adjust control proactively to minimize future conflict...|$|R
