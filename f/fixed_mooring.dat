40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} first {{evidence}} that variability in zooplankton biomass {{can be characterized as}} a multifractal. An hourly tune series of vertically integrated acoustic biomass measurements, taken from a <b>fixed</b> <b>mooring</b> on the Atlantic coastline, provided the data for our analysis. Two measures of variability were analyzed: the first difference squared and the squared difference from the mean. When integrated over time, these quantities provide estimates of biomass variability. The distribution in time of these measures of variability is highly intermittent. We show that such intermittency is well described by the scaling properties of multifractals. In zooplankton ecology, potential applications of this analysis include comparing plankton variability distributions to those of passive scalars and environmental variables, quantifying spatial or temporal heterogeneity in intermittent quantities, and determining scales over which similar processes are operating...|$|E

Consequently, nonzero Eulerian residual flow results when averaged over one tidal period.

The assessment uses an adjoint-based data impact procedure that characterizes the forecast impact of every observation assimilated, and it allows the observation impacts to be partitioned by data type, geographic region, and vertical level. The impact cost function {{is the difference between}} HYCOM 48 - and 72 -h forecast errors computed for temperature and salinity at all model levels and grid points. It is shown that routine assimilation of large numbers of observations consistently reduces global HYCOM 48 -h forecast errors for both temperature and salinity. The largest error reduction is due to the assimilation of tem-perature and salinity profiles from the tropical <b>fixed</b> <b>mooring</b> arrays, followed by Argo, expendable bathyther-mograph (XBT), and animal sensor data.

The beneficial impact of assimilating Argo temperature and salinity profiles extends to all depths sampled, with salinity impacts maximum at the surface and temperature impacts showing a subsurfacemaximum in the 100 – 200 -m-depth range. The reduced impact of near-surface Argo temperature profile levels is due to the vertical covariances in the assimilation that extend the influence of the large number of sea surface temperature (SST) observations to the base of themixed layer.

In the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, the diversity of involved processes (e. g. tidally-driven circulation, plume dynamics) requires to adapt observing systems to the specific targeted environments. Also important is the requirement for those systems to sustain coastal applications. Two observational network design experiments have been implemented for the spring season in two regions: the Loire River plume (northern part of the Bay of Biscay) and the Western English Channel. The method used to perform these experiments is based on the ArM (Array Modes) formalism using an ensemble-based approach without data assimilation. The first experiment in the Loire River plume aims to explore different possible glider endurance lines combined with a <b>fixed</b> <b>mooring</b> to monitor temperature and salinity. Main results show an expected improvement when combining glider and mooring observations. The experiment also highlights that the chosen transect (along-shore and North-South, cross-shore) does not significantly impact the efficiency of the network. Nevertheless, the classification from the method results in slightly better performances for along-shore and North-South sections. In the Western English Channel, a tidally-driven circulation system, added value of using a glider below FerryBox temperature and salinity measurements has been assessed. FerryBox systems are characterised by a high frequency sampling rate crossing the region 2 to 3 times a day. This efficient sampling, as well as the specific vertical hydrological structure (which is homogeneous in many sub-regions of the domain), explains the fact that the added value of an associated glider transect is not significant. These experiments combining existing and future observing systems, as well as numerical ensemble simulations, highlight the key issue of monitoring the whole water column in and close to river plumes (using gliders for example) and the efficiency of the surface high frequency sampling from FerryBoxes in macrotidal regions...|$|E

Of particular interest is the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) response to oceanic Tropical Instability Waves (TIWs) that distort the SST front during May through January in normal years. In previous studies, time series of boundary layer properties clearly show the influence of TIWs but the relationship to spatial patterns of SST and wind stress has been inferred only from sparse in situ data. In this study, satellite observations are used to composite in situ data from moorings {{to compensate for the}} lack of a spatially dense mooring array. The variability in the position of the SST front caused by propagating TIWs enables <b>fixed</b> <b>mooring</b> locations to measure the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) response from a large range of locations relative to the front. The satellite data enable determination of the precise location of the mooring relative to the front. The advantage of this strategy is the recurring measurement of the ABL {{response to the}} SST front over the six month period considered here. The results indicate that the TIW-induced perturbations of sensible and latent heat flux are spatially shifted in phase towards the east relative to the perturbations of SST. The maximum fluxes are not centered directly over the warmest water, but are shifted towards the portion of the frontal region where a disequilibrium boundary layer is expected due to the advection of colder air from the equatorial region. The changes of sensible and latent heat fluxes across the SST front have magnitudes of about 11 Wm⁻² and 126 Wm⁻², respectively. The sensible and latent heat flux patterns are interpreted in two complementary ways: (1) as an atmospheric response to the change of oceanic forcing as air flows across the SST front; and (2) as the atmospheric response to westward propagating TIWs along the SST front...|$|E

Radial data from each antenna, {{as well as the}} combined total surface currents are Quality-Controlled {{in order to ensure that}} the data being produced are of the highest quality.

Additionally, the spatial distribution of the inertial component to the total KE varies seasonally, and according to the bathymetry. The low-pass (sub-inertial) filtered HF Radar currents show a predominant Northern current during the summer months in the channel, and a mean Southern current during the winter period.

40|$|Ice {{friction}} affects us in many ways, from slippery {{roads to}} winter sports. In cold regions, ice friction influences ice interaction with itself, which determines {{the motion of}} ice floes. It also influences the structural forces resulting from ice interactions with <b>fixed</b> and <b>moored</b> structures and with floating vessels. Ice friction also affects surface transportation over snow and ice. This paper addresses {{only one aspect of}} ice friction in winter sports, but it is potentially relevant to other applications, particularly surface transportation over ice. The model of ice friction described here is for a steel bobsleigh runner sliding on ice at high velocity. The model describes ice friction in the fully-lubricated, hydrodynamic regime, where a layer of meltwater completely separates the ice and slider surfaces. The effect of any contact between asperities on both surfaces is neglected. Friction results from a ploughing force, arising from ice deformation, crushing and extrusion, and from the shear stress in the lubricating Couette flow. The model takes into account frictional melting, heat conduction into the ice and the lateral squeeze flow of the lubricating liquid. The effect of pressure on the melting temperature is also accounted for. Sensitivity testing of the numerical model has been conducted to examine the influence of such factors as runner dimensions, sliding speed, ice temperature and g-forces. A comparison with recent measurements of bobsled ice friction made by one of the authors is encouraging, suggesting that the model has identified and adequately represented the most essential physical processes.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{preserve}} their efficiency, submarine tidal turbines and other marine renewable energy systems need an accurate knowledge of sea currents directions. The speeds and directions of these currents {{can be measured in}} a cell of water with currentmeters (AQD) or on a water column with profilers called AQP or ADCP which stands for Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. When these instruments are installed on carriers, mooring lines or mooring cages, it is necessary to correct the measured data in heading, roll and pitch, in order to interpret them in a terrestrial referential. In this way, they are equipped with a magnetic compass and tilt sensors. Magnetic environment influences compasses responses. There was no system to calibrate AQD and AQP in their using configurations. Following a method perfected in 2007 in order to correct angle errors and warranting a measurement uncertainty in the case of instruments <b>fixed</b> in <b>mooring</b> cages, a calibration platform for magnetic compasses and tilt sensors has been built. In order to show the interest and the corrections allowed by this equipment, this publication shows the effects of the instrumentation of a DORA mooring cage on the compass response of an AQD. The measurements underscore that the initial compass error of 4 ° peak-peak is between – 10 ° and + 5. 7 ° after installation in the cage. This publication shows also the results obtained after the calibration of a stock of 30 AQD currentmeters and 22 AQP profilers. The manufacturer specifications of 2 ° in heading are respected only in 37 % of cases for AQD’s and 23 % for AQP’s. The heading and roll specifications of 0. 2 ° are never respected but 86 % of profilers and 53 % of currentmeters show errors less than 2 °. ...|$|R

This paper reports on laboratory experiments on a series of simplified FPSO-shaped bodies, with the aim of understanding more about the wave-structure interaction, particularly the generation of scattered waves. These tests were carried out in the Ocean Basin at Plymouth University’s COAST Laboratory where the effects on the wave-structure interaction of model length, wave steepness and incident wave direction were investigated. All three models had semi-circular ends, separated by a box section for the 2 longer models. Input waves were based on focused wave groups generated using NewWave with an underlying JONSWAP spectrum. A general phase-based harmonic separation method was applied to separate the linear and higher-harmonic wave components of the free-surface elevation surrounding the bodies, and of relevance to the assessment of wave loads. Close to the bow of the model, the highest amplitude scattered waves are observed with the most compact model, and the third- and fourth-harmonics are significantly larger than the equivalent incident bound harmonic components. At the locations close to the stern, the linear harmonic is found to increase as the model length is decreased, although the nonlinear harmonics are similar for all three tested lengths, and the second- and third-harmonics are strongest with the medium length model. The nonlinear scattered waves increase with increasing wave steepness and a second pulse is evident in the higher-order scattered wave fields. As the incident wave angle between the waves and the long axis of the vessel is increased from 0 ° (head-on) to 20 °, the third- and fourth-harmonic scattered waves reduce on the upstream side. These third- and fourth-harmonic diffracted waves should be considered in assessing wave run-up for offshore structure design, and may be relevant to the excitation of ringing-type structural responses in <b>fixed</b> and taut <b>moored</b> structures...|$|R

Three different experiments were undertaken in this study to try to answer these questions: (i) slamming impacts of a square flat rigid/elastic plate, which represents a plate section of the bottom or bow of ship structure, onto pure and aerated water surface with zero degree deadrise angle; (ii) wave impacts on a truncated vertical rigid/elastic wall in pure and aerated water, where the wall represents a plate section of a hull; and (iii) wave-structure interactions of different FPSO-shaped models, where the models were <b>fixed</b> or taut <b>moored.</b> The experiments were carried out at Plymouth University’s COAST Laboratory. Spatial impact pressure distributions on the square plate have been characterised under different impact velocities. It was found that the impact pressures and force in pure water were proportional to the square of impact velocity. There was a significant reduction in both the maximum impact pressure and force for slamming in aerated water compared to that in pure water. An exponential relationship of the maximum force and the void fraction is proposed and its coefficients are found from drop test in this study. There was also a significant reduction in {{the first phase of the}} pressure and force impulse for slamming into aerated water compared with pure water. On the truncated wall, aeration also significantly reduced peak wave loads (both pressure and force) but impulses were not reduced by very much. For the case considered here, elasticity of the impact plate has a significant effect on the impact loads, though only at high impact velocities; here the impact loads were considerably reduced with increasing elasticity. Wave loading on the truncated wall was found to reduce with increasing elasticity of the wall for all investigated breaking wave types: high aeration, flip-through and slightly breaking wave impacts. In particular, impact pressure decreases with increasing elasticity of the wall under flip-through wave impact. As elasticity increases, the impulse of the first positive phase of pressure and force decreases significantly. This significant effect of hydroelasticity is also found for the total force impulse on the vertical wall under wave impacts. Scattered waves were generated from the interaction of focused wave groups with an FPSO model. The results show that close to the bow of the FPSO model, the highest amplitude scattered waves are observed with the most compact model, and the third- and fourth-harmonics are significantly larger than the incident bound harmonic components. At the locations close to the stern, the linear harmonic was found to increase as the model length was decreased, although the nonlinear harmonics were similar for all three tested lengths, and the second- and third-harmonics were strongest with the medium length model. The nonlinear scattered waves increased with increasing wave steepness and a second pulse was evident in the higher-order scattered wave fields for the fixed and free floating models. In addition, the higher harmonics of the mooring line force, and the heave and pitch motions all increased with increasing wave steepness. Incident wave angles of 0 (head-on), 10 and 20 degrees were experimentally investigated in this study. As the incident wave angle between the waves and the long axis of the vessel was increased from 0 to 20 degrees, the third- and fourth-harmonic scattered waves reduced on the upstream side. These third- and fourth-harmonic diffracted waves are important in assessing wave run-up and loading for offshore structure design and ringing-type structural response in <b>fixed</b> and taut <b>moored</b> structures. The second-, third- and fourth-harmonics of the mooring line force, and the heave and pitch motions decreased as the incident wave angle increased from 0 to 20 degrees...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{behavior of}} <b>fixed</b> and elastically <b>moored</b> floating breakwaters is {{studied in the}} present thesis, using a finite-difference, mathematical model based on the Boussinesq type equations. The flow under the floating breakwater is treated as confined flow separately. The pressure field beneath the floating structure is determined by solving implicitly the Laplace equation for the potential Φ of the confined flow using the appropriate boundary conditions. The dynamic equations of motion are solved with the consequent adjustments of the continuity equation {{in the case of}} elastically moored floating breakwaters. Numerical results, concerning the efficiency of fixed, heave motion and elastically moored floating breakwaters are compared to experimental results satisfactorily. The ability of the numerical model to predict the pressure field beneath the floating structure, the vertical force acting on it and the dynamic response of the breakwater is thoroughly examined by making comparisons of the numerical results with experimental data. The experimental part of the thesis was conducted in the CIEM flume of the Catalonia University of Technology, Barcelona. The influence of the incident wave characteristics (regular and irregular waves) and certain geometric characteristics such as the width and the draught of the structure on its efficiency are examined. Four different floating breakwaters configurations are examined: (a) fixed single floating breakwater, (b) heave motion floating breakwater, (c) fixed floating breakwater with attached front plate (impermeable and permeable) and (d) fixed double floating breakwater. Results related to transmission, reflection and energy dissipation of the incident (regular and irregular) waves on the structure are presented. A comparison of numerical and experimental results is also presented. For the single floating breakwater the efficiency of the structure is proportional to the width/wavelength and draught/water depth ratios. The fixed single floating breakwater operates in a highly reflective manner. On the other hand the heave motion floating breakwater operates in a dissipative manner with much lower reflection. The attached plate in the front part of the floating breakwater enhances significantly the efficiency of the structure. No great differences are observed between the impermeable and the permeable plate cases. Generally the most efficient configuration has been proven to be the double floating breakwater. However, with regard to cost effectiveness the configuration of the floating breakwater with the attached plate should be considered the most efficient for design purposes. The final goal is to study the hydrodynamics of floating breakwaters in shallow and intermediate waters. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{the nearest}} years the design load level for {{offshore}} structures in Arctic regions {{is likely to}} be controlled by first-year sea ice ridges and rubble fields if the icebergs are not present in the area. Drifting ridges may hit <b>fixed</b> or <b>moored</b> surface structure such as platforms or ships, or they may gouge the seabed endangering pipelines and wellheads. Both the temporal and spatial properties of the consolidated layer and the unconsolidated part (the ice rubble) of the ice ridge are important input into ridgeload models. A better understanding of the ice rubble behaviour will enable us to determine the ice-ridge load more accurately. This thesis deals with two separate but connected subjects, namely: the ice strength field heterogeneity of both first-year sea ice ridge and level ice and the mechanical behaviour of the ice rubble. Field mechanical testing of first-year sea ice by uniaxial compression has been done in order to improve the knowledge of the ice fields strength heterogeneity. The inplane ice strength non-homogeneity of different ice fields on the landfast level ice in the Spitsbergen fjords were investigated. A typical ice strength variability was found to be about 20 - 40 % for the vertical ice samples and 10 - 20 % for the horizontal ones. The weak zones were found within the entire ice fields. It was established that the strength of the ice samples taken from a certain depth from the ice cover surface at the different locations of the same ice field varied by a factor of 3 to 4. Furthermore, two first-year sea ice ridges have been examined with respect to the 2 D spatial strength distribution: one in the North-western Barents Sea and one in the Arctic Ocean nearby Spitsbergen. The ice ridges are characterized by high strength heterogeneity of 40 - 55 %, where the ice strength varied more than 3 times along both vertical and horizontal directions. Special Finite Difference program “Inhomogeneity” was used to study the influence of the ice strength heterogeneity on the ice loads. It was shown that the ice heterogeneity might be {{one of the reasons for}} the scale effect. In order to investigate the nature of freeze bonds between the ice blocks, series of field and laboratory small scale tests were conducted with submerged ice blocks. The small scale field tests were carried out in Adventfjorden on Spitsbergen. An opening was made in the landfast level ice. The level ice was sawed into cubic blocks which then were submerged down into the water. Some of the ice blocks were cut in two parts and then frozen together in order to simulate the freeze bonds between the ice blocks. The other blocks were submerged without forming the adfreeze bond. In addition to that, laboratory tests with both artificial ice (fresh and sea water) and natural sea ice were conducted in the cold laboratories at the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS). The temporal development of the freeze bonding strength and the local strength of the ice blocks in the ice rubble, their changes with block size, confinement and ice properties were studied. The average freeze bonding strength from the field tests was found as 32 ± 18 kPa after 48 hours of submerging. The corresponding freeze bonding strength from the laboratory tests was 67 ± 52 kPa for the natural sea ice and 274 ± 142 kPa for the artificial freshwater ice within 60 hours of testing. Moreover, the ratio of freeze bonding strength to the strength of the submerged ice was found in the range of 0. 008 to 0. 082 with an average around 0. 03 after 48 hours of submerging in the field. The corresponding strength ratio varied from 0. 14 to 0. 38 for the artificial fresh water ice and from 0. 015 to 0. 40 for the sea ice within 60 hours of testing in the laboratory. A pseudo-discrete continuum model has been developed to study the behaviour of the ice rubble and in particularly its initial failure mechanism that is associated with the breakage of the freeze bonding contacts (rubble skeleton). The model is a combination of discrete particle assembly generation and Finite Element analysis of this assembly. The model provides a possibility to simulate the contacts between the ice blocks. A parametric analysis simulating 2 D direct shear tests shows that the pseudo-discrete continuum model is very sensitive to both strength and morphology of the freeze bonds between the ice blocks. An attempt to extend the model to study large deformations within the ice rubble (that is associated with rotation, rearrangement of the ice blocks and their breakage) was considered. </p...|$|R
40|$|Hydrokinetic energy {{technologies}} {{have been proposed}} as renewable, environmentally preferable alternatives to fossil fuels for generation of electricity. Hydrokinetic technologies harness the energy of water in motion, either from waves, tides or from river currents. For energy capture from free-flowing rivers, arrays of rotating devices are most commonly proposed. The placement of hydrokinetic devices in large rivers {{is expected to increase}} the underwater structural complexity of river landscapes. Moore and Gregory (1988) found that structural complexity increased local fish populations because fish and other aquatic biota are attracted to structural complexity that provides microhabitats with steep flow velocity gradients (Liao 2007). However, hydrokinetic devices have mechanical parts, blades, wings or bars that move through the water column, posing a potential strike or collision risk to fish and other aquatic biota. Furthermore, in a setting with arrays of hydrokinetic turbines the cumulative effects of multiple encounters may increase the risk of strike. Submerged structures associated with a hydrokinetic (HK) project present a collision risk to aquatic organisms and diving birds (Cada et al. 2007). Collision is physical contact between a device or its pressure field and an organism that may result in an injury to that organism (Wilson et al. 2007). Collisions can occur between animals and <b>fixed</b> submerged structures, <b>mooring</b> equipment, horizontal or vertical axis turbine rotors, and structures that, by their individual design or in combination, may form traps. This report defines strike as a special case of collision where a moving part, such as a rotor blade of a HK turbine intercepts the path of an organism of interest, resulting in physical contact with the organism. The severity of a strike incidence may range from minor physical contact with no adverse effects to the organism to severe strike resulting in injury or death of the organism. Harmful effects to animal populations could occur directly (e. g., from strike mortality of individuals) or indirectly (e. g., if the loss of prey species to strike reduces food for predators). Although actively swimming or passively drifting animals may collide with any of the physical structures associated with hydrokinetic devices, turbine rotors are the most likely sources for risk of strike or significant collision (DOE 2009). It is also possible that during a close encounter with a HK device no physical contact will be made between the device and the organism, either because the animal avoids the device by successfully changing its direction of movement, or by successfully evading any moving parts of the device. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has been funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Waterpower Program to evaluate strike potential and consequences for Marine and Hydrokinetic (MHK) technologies in rivers and estuaries of the United States. We will use both predictive models and laboratory/field experiments to evaluate the likelihood and consequences of strike at HK projects in rivers. Efforts undertaken at ORNL address three objectives: (1) Assess strike risk for marine and freshwater organisms; (2) Develop experimental procedures to assess the risk and consequences of strike; and (3) Conduct strike studies in experimental flumes and field installations of hydrokinetic devices. During {{the first year of the}} study ORNL collected information from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) MHK database about geographical distribution of proposed hydrokinetic projects (what rivers or other types of systems), HK turbine design (horizontal axis, vertical axis, other), description of proposed axial turbine (number of blades, size of blades, rotation rate, mitigation measures), and number of units per project. Where site specific information was available, we compared the location of proposed projects rotors within the channel (e. g., along cutting edge bank, middle of thalweg, near bottom or in midwater) to the general locations of fish in the river (shoreline, bottom/midwater/surface of channel) to ascertain potential interactions. In addition, we are collaborating and communicating with scientists at other national laboratories and industry who are also developing information useful to this task. For example, other studies being funded by DOE include evaluations of different in-current (hydrokinetic) turbine designs for their effects on rates and severity of blade strike and likelihood of cavitation.
