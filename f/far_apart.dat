5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are <b>far</b> <b>apart.</b> If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels that are <b>far</b> <b>apart.</b> While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of H.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat roosts {{in caves}} in {{limestone}} hills, {{far from the}} entrance. While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, with a maximum of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> from each other. Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat of invasion by continuing air attacks on military targets in the British capital. Hans Jeschonnek still pushed for attacks on civilian morale. He argued that military and civilian industries were located too <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> to achieve a collapse of morale by attacking the former. Instead, he pressed for attacks against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only military targets in London were to be attacked.|$|E

50|$|Given the {{considerable}} overall width of this design, new suburban freeways are often designed with interchanges spaced <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> {{to avoid the}} need for parallel roadways.|$|R
5|$|The event {{appears to}} have {{affected}} all continents at the same time. Non-avian dinosaurs, for example, are known from the Maastrichtian of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and Antarctica, but are unknown from the Cenozoic anywhere in the world. Similarly, fossil pollen shows devastation of the plant communities in areas as <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> as New Mexico, Alaska, China, and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The {{system was}} impractical. The Hamburg air defence {{district}} controlled both air and ground defences, but each was geographically {{in no position}} to help the other. There was no combined arms synthesis, meaning that the FlaK arm did not directly support the German defences thereby forming one mass defence. Instead, fighter units protecting the coast were held there, with Kriegsmarine FlaK units, while the Hamburg air defence artillery was held too far inland. The Luftwaffe fighters and FlaK units were located too <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> to coordinate.|$|E
5|$|They also {{compare the}} {{possibility}} of extending property rights to animals to the approach of European colonists, who were prepared to extend property, but not sovereignty, rights to native peoples, resulting in oppression. Hadley, however, is himself critical of Donaldson and Kymlicka's sovereignty proposal, though the British philosopher Josh Milburn suggests that the proposals {{may not be as}} <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> as the authors indicate.|$|E
5000|$|A bus trap is a metal grate {{placed over}} a ditch or {{depression}} in the road with tines spaced <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> that small-diameter-wheeled vehicles fall in between the tines but close enough that larger-diameter-wheeled vehicles, such as buses, may pass.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, {{additional}} baseband {{signals are}} used to modulate carriers at other frequencies, creating other channels of information. The carriers are spaced <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> in frequency that the band of frequencies occupied by each channel, the passbands of the separate channels, do not overlap. All the channels are sent through the transmission medium, such as a coaxial cable, optical fiber, or through the air using a radio transmitter. As long as the channel frequencies are spaced <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> {{that none of the}} passbands overlap, the separate channels will not interfere with each other. Thus the available bandwidth is divided into [...] "slots" [...] or channels, each of which can carry a separate modulated signal.|$|R
50|$|In {{rare cases}} {{more than one}} hail spike has been {{documented}} with a single storm in one volume scan. This indicates {{that more than one}} hail core exists in the same storm and <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> that each core can be sampled by the radar individually.|$|R
5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained <b>far</b> <b>apart.</b> The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Lambda Tucanae is {{an optical}} double—that is, {{the name is}} given to two stars (Lambda1 and Lambda2) which appear close {{together}} from our viewpoint, but are in fact <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> in space. Lambda1 is itself a binary star, with two components—a yellow-white star of spectral type F7IV-V and an apparent magnitude of 6.22, and a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G1V and an apparent magnitude of 7.28. The system is 186 light-years distant. Lambda2 is an orange subgiant of spectral type K2III that is expanding and cooling and has left the main sequence. Of apparent magnitude 5.46, it is approximately 220 light-years distant from Earth.|$|E
50|$|When {{individual}} {{targets are}} spaced <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> {{that they can}} be distinguished from one another, it is straightforward to estimate the number of fish by counting the number of targets. This type of analysis is called echo counting, and was historically the first to be used for biomass estimation.|$|R
50|$|A twenty acre (8.1 ha) {{field to}} the north of the hall was chosen as the {{appropriate}} site to build the required operational set rooms (huts). The huts were spaced <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> to avoid collateral damage should a bombing raid occur. Each hut was brick-built with blast walls, and then a disguising outer covering was put over it.|$|R
50|$|Air {{traffic control}} (ATC) {{involves}} communication with aircraft {{to help maintain}} separation — that is, they ensure that aircraft are sufficiently <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> horizontally or vertically for no risk of collision. Controllers may co-ordinate position reports provided by pilots, or in high traffic areas (such as the United States) they may use radar to see aircraft positions.|$|R
5|$|The Dominican Order had {{its origins}} in the reformist {{ideology}} of Dominic de Guzmán, later Saint Dominic. By 1219, Dominic had established houses as <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> as Paris, Bologna, Madrid and Segovia; at his death in 1221, there were 21 houses. Expansion of the order continued into England as houses were established at Oxford in 1221 and London in 1224. There were five houses in England by 1230, by which time the Order was poised to enter Scotland. Later tradition had it that the Dominican Order entered Scotland in 1230, encouraged by King Alexander II and William de Malveisin, Bishop of St Andrews. However, the earliest certain date for {{the foundation of a}} Dominican house in Scotland is 1234.|$|E
5|$|The prickly shark has a flabby and {{cylindrical}} body, {{with the}} adults markedly bulkier than juveniles, and a short, moderately flattened head. The nostrils are placed <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> and preceded by small flaps of skin. The spiracles are tiny and positioned well behind the eyes, which lack nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a broad arch, with very short furrows at the corners. There are 21–25 and 20–27 tooth rows {{in the upper}} and lower jaws respectively. The knife-like teeth each have a strongly angled main cusp flanked by up to three smaller cusplets on either side; the lateral cusplets are absent in young sharks. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest.|$|E
5|$|The {{top four}} teams from these groups will {{advance to the}} {{knockout}} playoff stage. In the quarterfinals, the first place team from one group plays the fourth place team from the opposite group, and the second place team from one group plays the third place team from the opposite group. The winners advance to the semi-finals. In cases where the quarter-final venues are deemed too <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> to allow easy travel between them, the teams stay within their groups for the quarters. The winners of the quarter-finals advance to the semi-finals, with {{the winners of the}} semi-finals advancing to the Gold medal game and the losers advancing to the Bronze medal game.|$|E
50|$|In tests {{well beyond}} the design and proof pressures, this door type {{has shown that the}} slight {{deflection}} caused by the over-pressure moves the door and hub faces <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> to cause the O-ring seal to fail, thus releasing the pressure. The escaping air is diffused past the locking ring, preventing injury from high speed jets of air.|$|R
50|$|In {{high voltage}} systems {{containing}} transformers and capacitors, liquid insulator oil is the typical method used for preventing arcs. The oil replaces air in spaces that must support significant voltage without electrical breakdown. Other high voltage system insulation materials include ceramic or glass wire holders, gas, vacuum, and simply placing wires <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> to use air as insulation.|$|R
50|$|Tied columns {{have closed}} lateral ties spaced {{approximately}} uniformly across the column. The spacing of the ties {{is limited in}} {{that they must be}} close enough to prevent barreling failure between them, and <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> that they do not interfere with the setting of the concrete. The ACI codebook puts an upward limit on the spacing between ties.|$|R
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Marburg Colloquy and the split of the Confederation, Zwingli set his goal on an {{alliance}} with Philip of Hesse. He kept up a lively correspondence with Philip. Bern refused to participate, but after a long process, Zurich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530. Zwingli also personally negotiated with France's diplomatic representative, but the two sides were too <b>far</b> <b>apart.</b> France wanted to maintain good relations with the Five States. Approaches to Venice and Milan also failed.|$|E
5|$|During the {{turbulent}} {{era of the}} Civil Wars and the incorporation of Scotland into a Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, significant building in Scotland was largely confined to military architecture. Polygonal fortresses with triangular bastions {{in the style of}} the trace italienne were built to house English soldiers at Ayr, Perth and Leith, and 20 smaller forts were built as <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by new strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. The universities saw an improvement in their funding, as they were given income from deaneries, defunct bishoprics and the excise, allowing the completion of buildings including the college in the High Street in Glasgow. After the Restoration in 1660, large-scale building began again, influenced by a growing interest in Classicism.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{elevated}} to the peerage as Viscount Bruce of Melbourne by long-time colleague Clement Attlee, {{he would be}} {{an active participant in}} the chamber, attending regularly right up until his death. Bruce used it as a platform to continue to campaign on international and national social and economic questions, and to promote recognition and representation for Australia within the Commonwealth, though by this time Australian and British interests were becoming increasingly <b>far</b> <b>apart,</b> and the British Empire was rapidly disintegrating. He also continued to lobby the British government in these years to increase its commitment to third world development and the FAO. An avid golfer his whole life, Bruce became the first Australian captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1954. From 1948 to 1952 he was President of Leander Club, while continuing to coach rowing at Cambridge University sporadically, and frequently appeared at public events both in Australia and in England.|$|E

5000|$|Upstream connectivity: A given network {{operations}} center must have multiple upstream links to independent providers. Furthermore, {{to lessen the}} possibility of simultaneous damage to all upstream links, the physical location {{of each of these}} upstream links should be physically diverse: <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> that a piece of machinery (such as a backhoe) won't accidentally sever all connections at the same time.|$|R
5|$|In {{his teenage}} {{years he had}} trials for clubs as <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> as the Netherlands, Japan, and England. He was under {{contract}} at Birmingham City, Barnet and Japanese side Machida Zelvia. He joined the Glenn Hoddle Academy in Spain in summer 2009. From there he was sent out to Worcester City, Jerez Industrial, Doncaster Rovers, and Oxford United to gain first team experience. In June 2011 he signed with Port Vale via Hyde (partners of the Hoddle Academy). He left Port Vale in April 2013 after falling out with the club's management, and signed with Newport County for the 2013–14 season. After over 18 {{months out of the}} game, he signed with Sutton United in February 2016, and was an influential presence in midfield, helping the club to win promotion as champions of National League South {{at the end of the}} 2015–16 season, he left the club in December 2016 and joined Eastleigh for a brief spell four months later.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} that the developers faced was in adding enough elements to Metroid: Zero Mission to make it feel new, while keeping the spirit of the original Metroid. Because both games were made for the Game Boy Advance, Metroid: Zero Mission uses a rebuilt version of the game engine used for Metroid Fusion so that it {{did not need to be}} built from scratch. This marked the first time two Metroid installments have been released for the same video game console. Metroid Fusion had offered connectivity with Metroid Prime on the Nintendo GameCube, but Metroid: Zero Mission did not offer such a feature. Sakamoto explained that the developers wanted to make the game connect to Metroid Prime 2: Echoes on the GameCube, but the fact that both their release dates were <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> and not enough development time to implement connectivity features prevented them from doing so. However, they managed to include the ability for Metroid Fusion to connect with Metroid: Zero Mission.|$|E
5|$|One way of {{clustering}} {{a set of}} {{data points}} in a metric space into two clusters is to choose the clusters {{in such a way}} as to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, where the diameter of any single cluster is the largest distance between any two of its points. This is preferable to minimizing the maximum cluster size, which may lead to very similar points being assigned to different clusters. If the target diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by solving a 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever any two points are too <b>far</b> <b>apart</b> from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.|$|E
60|$|A sentry {{was posted}} at each end. At a cottage hard by were ten others, {{while there were}} twenty in the village they had just left. There were also sentries down the line; but these were <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> to render it certain {{that they could not}} muster in time to interfere, seriously, with the enterprise. With this information, they {{returned}} to the forest.|$|R
500|$|Bloody Disgusting {{gave the}} film five [...] "skulls" [...] {{in a review}} by Patrick Cooper, who wrote that it is [...] "a hugely {{entertaining}} atmospheric thriller," [...] and that [...] "the only parts that fumble a bit are the regrettable comedic moments... these well-intentioned bits sharply interrupt the serious ambiance of the film, but at least they're few and spaced <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> that they don't ruin the whole thing." ...|$|R
50|$|Almost {{all media}} in Rouyn-Noranda {{and the nearby}} city of Val-d'Or serves both cities. Although the cities are <b>far</b> enough <b>apart</b> that radio and {{television}} stations in the area serve the cities from separate transmitters, almost every broadcast station in either city has a rebroadcaster in the other city. The only nominal exceptions are the cities' separate NRJ stations, although at present even these stations share {{the majority of their}} broadcast schedule.|$|R
