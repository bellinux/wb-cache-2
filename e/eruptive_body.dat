The <b>eruptive</b> <b>body</b> comes in contact (through the tectonic breccia) with andesite necks (Poieni, Curmatura, Melciu, Piatra Tichileu, and Jgheabului Hills) and with sedimentary Cretaceous rocks.The porphyry copper deposit is made up mainly of fine disseminations, nests and veinlets (0.02÷3 cm) of pyrite, chalcopyrite, and magnetite; gold included in the chalcopyrite and pyrite, and secondary minerals: bornite, covellite, chalcocite, sphalerite, galena, molybdenite, germanite, malachite, azurite and is developed in microdioritic rocks.|$|E

The crystals in the nodules have a similar range of compositions to those found as phenocrysts in the flow, {{and many of the}} nodules may have been generated by crystallization of a magma with a similar composition to that of the host flow. While plagioclase is only present in nodules where the average forsterite content of olivines is 0. 8 GPa and is in agreement with estimates of crystallization pressures for the host basalt. The relationship between the compositional variability of melt inclusions and the forsterite content of the host olivine is revealed by REE analyses of over 120 melt inclusions. The degree of variability in REE concentrations and REE/Yb ratios decreases with falling forsterite content of the host olivine, as expected if melt mixing and fractional crystallization are operating together. The standard deviation of the REEs falls by a factor of ~ 4 between Fo 90 and Fo 87. This change in olivine composition can be produced by crystallization of 20 % which occurs on cooling of ~ 50 °C. The relative rates of mixing, cooling and crystallization may provide constraints upon the dynamics of magma bodies. The oxygen isotopic composition of olivines from the nodules and phenocrysts is highly variable (δ 18 O from 3. 3 – 5. 2 per mil) and shows little correlation with the forsterite content of the olivine. The full range of oxygen isotope variation is present in olivines with Fo 89 – 90, and the low δ 18 O signal is associated with melts of high Mg# and La/Yb. Such geochemical relationships cannot be produced by assimilation of low Mg# crustal materials alone, and may reflect oxygen isotopic variation within the mantle source. The geochemistry of the melt inclusions and their host crystals can be accounted for by fractional melting of a mantle source with variable composition, followed by concurrent mixing and crystallization beneath the Moho...|$|E
40|$|As a {{preamble}} to this thesis, four propositions and two deductions are stated. The succeeding {{pages are}} principally concerned with {{a study of}} the geology of southern Pascalis township, a review of the evidence upon which the propositions are based and a discussion of experimental results which prove the deductions to be true with regard to certain rocks of the area studied. The propositions are: 1. If certain conditions are fulfilled, many minerals will exhibit the phenomena of luminescence. 2. In most cases, one of the important conditions for luminescence is the presence within the mineral of small amounts of trace elements which are foreign to the pure mineral and which may modify the crystal lattice. 3. During the emplacement of <b>eruptive</b> <b>bodies,</b> or their subsequent metamorphism, small amounts of trace elements are distributed in special arrangements relative to the bodies, either within or adjacent to their boundaries. This probably applies regardless {{of the size of the}} eruptive. 4. Some of the trace elements of Proposition 3 may either form independent minerals, occur in the lattices of the rock forming minerals or cause the formation of lattice imperfections. From these propositions, it may be logically deduced: 1. Luminescent minerals should be found in or adjacent to many <b>bodies</b> of <b>eruptive</b> rocks. 2. The distribution of the luminescent minerals and the trace elements should bear some close relationship to each other. [ [...] . ...|$|R
