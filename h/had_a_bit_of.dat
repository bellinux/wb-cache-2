This created many stories for both characters as they plotted against their neighbours. Dennis stated [...] "the Paul and Izzy relationship was fantastic, {{it was very}} popular. Izzy was an interesting character because she was very emotional and insecure. That's what drove her evil ways. She <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a soulmate in Paul."

[...] "I almost <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> fear where {{everybody wants to be}} loved, everybody wants to be understood in a way that's not full of judgment or blame. So I put all of myself into the album and then [...] bits out."

She added that they have [...] "a {{lot of things in}} common, but they’re very different people. It’s almost like they shouldn’t be friends, but opposites attract. Lynsey sees qualities in Mercy that she kind of wishes she had herself. Mercy’s very straight-talking, she’s quite ballsy and calls a spade a spade, and sometimes Lynsey wishes she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> that gusto. So I think that’s what attracts her to Mercy". Both Metcalfe and Hassan praised the friendship between Mercedes and Lynsey, with Metcalfe saying she [...] "loved" [...] the friendship and enjoyed seeing her persona [...] "form a good bond with Lynsey" [...] while Hassan praised the chemistry between herself and Metcalfe.|$|E

Nemec stated in a 2008interview that [...] "the initial backlash from a very small core, outspoken group of the fandom <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a volatile reaction to it, which is totally natural... I'd say 95-plus percent of the fan base grew to like the character and accepted the character overall.

Fort Worth Star-Telegram contributor Robert Philpot, {{who gave}} the episode a B+ rating, {{thought it was a}} pleasant surprise and an indication that there [...] "might be some life" [...] left in the show. He added that the episode feels fresher because of the [...] "rapid-fire dialogue, farcical situations and ubiquitous double-entendres. And although this live edition was inarguably a stunt, it did prove that real people — and not mere machines — laugh at the characters and the jokes." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also noted that the episode showed that Will & Grace still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> life left. He added that McCormack seemed to flourish under the pressure, and that Hayes and Mullally [...] "were given free rein to flex their Jack and Karen [...] ".

Thankfully, for the sake of herself, her fans and mankind in general, Madge <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> re-think. [...] GHV2 contains some of the best pop music made by anybody", although he criticized the omission of some singles like [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] or [...] "Rain". Cristine Leach from Raidió Teilifís Éireann gave the compilation 4 out of 5 stars, saying that [...] " [...] is still the queen of pop and GHV2 is essential listening.

Berger scored the winning goal in Portsmouth's victory over his former club Liverpool in October 2003. A month later, he set up the first and fourth Portsmouth goals and scored the fifth in Portsmouth's 6–1 win against Leeds United. On Boxing Day 2003, Berger helped Portsmouth to a 2–0 win against Tottenham, scoring both goals of the game from free kicks, the first of which was scored from [...] Berger underwent an operation upon his knee in February 2004, forcing him to miss the remainder of the season.|$|E

It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they?

Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery.

500|$|Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode [...] "was full of laughs but <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a {{bittersweet}} aftertaste" [...] and had [...] "one {{hell of a}} cliffhanger" [...] ending. Rabin praised the Jim and Dwight teaming in the first episode, but said the plot line of Michael's lectures were predictable and [...] "promised more than it delivered". Rabin said the second episode [...] "wrapped up everything up nicely [...] delivered larfs aplenty"; he particularly enjoyed the subplot involving Angela's cats, {{and the fact that}} it [...] "left the door open for Holly's return". Will Leitch of New York magazine praised the cliffhanger ending of the first episode and said he was pleased the Holly character was still in the show's equation. Leitch also praised Ed Helms, who [...] "is nailing the right combination of ridiculous and sad-sack pathos", although he said he [...] " [...] nearly as inspired" [...] by the Jim and Dwight subplot. Leitch also enjoyed the second episode, particularly the [...] "legitimately sweet moment" [...] when Pam tells Michael that Holly still has feelings for him. Leitch was less praiseworthy of the Angela subplot involving her cats, and said the character [...] "appears to have officially gone batshit insane." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN criticized the first episode and said, [...] "I'm starting to wonder if the show is showing signs of winding down." [...] Fickett said the idea of Michael giving awkward lecture tours felt old and familiar, so much so that [...] "I was convinced it was a repeat". He also said the Jim and Dwight idea was funny, but [...] "nothing the show hasn't tapped before". Likewise, Fickett described the second episode as [...] "average Office and feels overly familiar without really blazing any new ground." [...] He also said it was disappointing Holly did not appear, and that Angela felt like a [...] "caricature" [...] in her subplot.|$|E
