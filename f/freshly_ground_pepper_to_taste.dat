Raisins or pineapple chunks may be added, and chilies, <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> black <b>pepper,</b> red pepper flakes, or whole peppercorns complete the mixture.

50|$|Macaroni bows or home-made thin pasta squares (like tiny mini lasagne) are boiled in salted water, drained, {{and mixed}} with some cooking oil or fat.

The cabbage is then mixed into the hot pasta, and served immediately.|$|R
50|$|Pearà {{requires}} a long, slow cooking; for its thermal properties, a traditional terracotta pot {{is to be}} preferred. First off the bread crumbs are mixed in the pot to the melted marrow and butter; afterwards scalding hot stock is added with a ladle while stirring continuously. The pot is then left to simmer {{for at least two}} hours, to obtain the desired creamy and thick texture. The sauce's namesake abundant, <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> black <b>pepper</b> is added {{towards the end of the}} cooking.Some recipes also add olive oil and grated Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano.|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of the cucumber sandwich reached its upper-class zenith in the Edwardian era, when cheap labour and plentiful coal enabled cucumbers to be produced in hotbeds under glass {{through most of the}} year. With the declining {{popularity of}} tea as a meal in the United Kingdom, there was a corresponding decline in the popularity of cucumber sandwiches, but they are still frequently served at teas, luncheons, and gatherings. Most English cricket clubs supply malt vinegar and <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> <b>to</b> dash inside the sandwich, and this is the simplest form commonly used in England.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Who {{would think}} of cooking a potato in boiling rosin? The origin and {{rationale}} for this interesting cooking behavior is lost in ethno-botanical lore but directions for the practice persisted until recent editions of The Joy of Cooking (Rombauer and Becker 1975). Indeed, the dish can still be obtained at Sweetie Pies Restaurant (Decatur, TX) one day a week. We obtained rosin (Pinerez 1277), produced by Hexion Specialty Chemicals, to duplicate the cooking recipe and to investigate the gustatory effects. The basic recipe involves heating the rosin to 275 0 F and carefully lowering the spud into the pot (see Figure 1). The potato initially sinks in the rosin, but after about 45 minutes, floats to the surface (Rombauer and Becker 1975). The potato is simmered a further 30 minutes, removed from the rosin, and wrapped in heavy brown paper with the ends twisted tightly. The rosin baked potato is cooled for 10 minutes and then slit and served with butter, salt, and <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> <b>pepper.</b> The cooking process must be done outside and the skin must not be eaten. The cooking in rosin provides a baked potato with an exceptional texture that is distinctively flaky. Figure 1.

5000|$|The Hoxne hoard pepper pot, {{commonly}} known as the Empress pepper pot, although it now seems not to represent an empress, is a silver piperatorium, partially gilded, dating from around 400 AD. It was found as part of the Hoxne Hoard in Hoxne, Suffolk, in November 1992, and is now in the British Museum, where it is normally on display. It is a hollow silver statuette of the top half of a woman's body, with a mechanism <b>to</b> allow <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> or spices <b>to</b> be loaded into its base and then shaken out. The mechanism does not grind the pepper and has a rotatable disc with three positions. One position allows filling, another has fine holes <b>to</b> allow <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> out and another allows the pot to be closed. [...] The pot was chosen as part of the 2010 BBC Radio 4 series, A History of the World in 100 Objects, as item 40.|$|R
5000|$|Like most {{characters}} in Watchmen, Rorschach has no obvious [...] "superpowers". He merely has his strong will, peak-human physical strength, and finely-honed sense of timing and precision. Rorschach is very resourceful and creative, adapting ordinary household objects into tools or weapons, {{such as the}} use of a can of aerosol spray in combination with multiple matches to set fire to a police officer and throwing <b>ground</b> black <b>pepper</b> <b>to</b> blind another police officer, during a confrontation at Moloch's house. During the series he is shown to use cooking fat, a toilet bowl, a cigarette, a fork and his jacket all as weapons; he is also shown using a coat hanger as a makeshift measuring device. He owns a gas-powered grappling gun, which he uses to climb buildings (and once as a makeshift harpoon gun against a police officer), as seen in Chapter One, which was designed and built by Nite Owl II.|$|R
50|$|Inhalation of <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz, when {{compared}} to inhalation of aged quartz, results in {{a significant increase in}} animal lung injury. <b>Freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz has increased reactive silicon-based oxygen radicals, and animals that are exposed to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz have been found to have decreased concentrations of antioxidant enzymes. Activated quartz particles decay with age in ambient air. Quartz dusts containing surface iron as an impurity have been shown to deplete cellular glutathione, contributing to the oxidative damage that is caused by particle and cell-derived ROS. Castranova et al. suggest that <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz dust that is contaminated with trace levels of iron may be more pathogenic than quartz dust alone.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{chemical}} and organoleptical properties of hot red pepper grown in GAP region in Southeast of Turkey were investigated. Four types of hot red <b>peppers</b> (A-Industrial red <b>ground</b> <b>pepper,</b> B-Industrial deep-red/ blackish <b>ground</b> <b>pepper,</b> C-Traditional deep-red/ blackish <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> sold {{in the market and}} D-Traditional deep-red/ blackish <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> consumed in home only) that were produced from the same pepper variety were taken for analyses. Results obtained indicated that with the exception of sample A, the rest of the samples were found not to contain aflatoxin. No significant differences between test samples were found in terms of chemical properties. Sample A had the highest level of invert sugar (20. 8 %), {{while the rest of the}} samples gave close values to each other. The industrial samples (samples A and B) had higher extractable colour (as ASTA unit) and pungency (as Scoville index) values than their traditional counterparts.
