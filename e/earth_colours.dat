5|$|In {{this period}} Ruisdael started {{painting}} coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among {{the most dramatic}} is Rough Sea at a Jetty, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few brown <b>earth</b> <b>colours.</b> However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, A Wooded Marsh, dated 1665, which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with <b>earth</b> <b>colours</b> not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no other}} 17th-century artist who {{employed}} the exorbitantly expensive pigment lapis lazuli (natural ultramarine) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the <b>earth</b> <b>colours</b> umber and ochre should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed. This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer’s understanding of Leonardo’s observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object. This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.|$|E

50|$|During the Middle Ages synopia in Latin and Italian came to mean {{simply a}} red ochre. It entered the English {{language}} {{as the word}} sinoper, meaning a red <b>earth</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} paints were red ochre, red lead, soot, calcium carbonate, and other <b>earth</b> <b>colours,</b> which were bound with fat and water. It also {{appears that the}} Vikings {{imported}} white lead, green malachite and blue azurite from Continental Europe. By using an electron microscope, chemists {{have been able to}} analyse traces of colours on runestones, and in one case, they discovered bright red vermilion, which was an imported luxury colour. However, the dominating colours were white and red lead. There are even accounts where runes were reddened with blood as in Grettis saga, where the Völva Þuríðr cut runes on a tree root and coloured them with her own blood to kill Grettir, and in Egils saga where Egill Skallagrímsson cut ale runes on a drinking horn and painted them with his own blood to see if the drink was poisoned.|$|E
2500|$|Of the rear, Elisabeth A.Fraser {{notes that}} [...] "he {{background}} {{cuts through the}} centre of the composition and drops inexplicably out and back from the cluster of [...] figures." [...] This dramatic arrangement breaks the picture apart into fragments, with clumps of tangled bodies, scattered glances and other details competing for the viewers attention. In the middle distance, another mêlée of humanitarian disaster unfolds, and the background is an uneven display of sacked, burning settlements and scorched earth. Most of the Mediterranean horizon is painted with bleak <b>earth</b> <b>colours,</b> and it is punctuated only by smoke, the mane of the rearing horse {{and the head of the}} soldier.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{long history}} of colour changes; prior to 1964 white was used instead of yellow as the second phase, and before World War II, a black earth and a green third phase in place of green earth and white phase was permitted. The {{regulations}} actually permitted (and still do) the use of any wire colour that is not an <b>earth</b> <b>colour,</b> providing it is unambiguously identified at all connections by clear labelling or by correctly coloured over-sleeving.|$|R

40|$|A {{historical}} paint manufactory in Staicele, Latvia (1967), {{was using}} local resources – <b>colour</b> <b>earth.</b> Oil paint composition consisted of pigment, drying oil, varnish and siccative. It had two different tones that are obtained by using natural <b>colour</b> <b>earth</b> pigments: ochre and its burnt form (burnt umber). Pigment quality was analyzed using historical documents, modern pigment tests, and manufactory technology. Chemical composition, particle size, and pigment tone were determined, and the coating ability was calculated. A palette of oil paints {{based on the}} historical recipes for restoring Staicele oil paints was created. Properties of <b>colour</b> <b>earth</b> pigments were compared to specimens taken from the local source of iron that is located near the old paint factory. Results provide a historical and technological insight as well as insight in {{the properties of the}} basic paint composition...|$|R

Rammanohar received widespread acclaim for these artworks.|$|E

50|$|In the Indian subcontinent, balaclavas are {{commonly}} referred to as monkey caps because of their typical <b>earth</b> tone <b>colours,</b> {{and the fact that they}} blot out most human facial features.

50|$|His highly {{finished}} {{paintings are}} worked on over many months, and draw {{mainly from the}} often arid and rocky landscape which surrounds his home. In his use of hot, <b>earth</b> <b>colours</b> and crisp detail, he is quintissentially an Australian artist pursuing typically Australian themes. In October 2006, Blow was a finalist in Australias richest award for landscape painting, the Fleurieu Peninsula Biennale Art Prize.|$|E
50|$|Pissarro's {{handling}} of colour {{in this painting}} is intricate as is described in the above paragraph but his palette is rather limited. The subdued tonal structure was not achieved {{by the use of}} dull <b>earth</b> <b>colours</b> but by mixing pure strong pigments such as ultramarine, vermilion, emerald green and chrome yellow. In the last stages Pissarro added strong accents of pure ultramarine and vermilion in small areas of the painting.|$|E
50|$|Crusties are {{distinctive}} {{for their}} unkempt appearance. They {{are associated with}} anti-capitalism, road protests, squatting, and begging. Typical dress styles involve dreadlocks, piercings, tattoos and dirty clothing, which are generally second-hand or army surplus. Similar to anarcho-punk, most clothing is black in colour. <b>Earth</b> <b>colours</b> are also common. Denim jackets, hooded sweatshirts with sewn-on patches, vests covered in studs, spikes, and band patches are characteristic elements of the crust punk style of dress.|$|E
25|$|The {{library was}} {{originally}} also the smoking room, {{so it is}} surprising that the original painted ceiling has survived and could be fully restored. The ceiling is heavily painted, gilded and sculptured in an eclectic manner, taking its general design from classical sources. The background is cream, but there is much use of Pompeiian red, an <b>earth</b> <b>colour</b> which gained popularity in Victorian England after the renewed excavations by Giuseppe Fiorelli in 1860. Small panels feature clearly painted classical motifs and portraits with distressed backgrounds, to look like pieces of ancient frescoes. Four medallions show the named poets Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer and Tennyson, all admired by the Romantics. All the spaces on the cream background are filled with illustrations imitating the original maiolica style, featuring stylised goats and fauns, cornucopia, grapes, birds and flowers, but also angels and putti in the centre. The decoration around the edge has a Green Man.|$|R

50|$|He {{was not a}} {{colourist}} by nature; his tones were monochromatic. He {{used only}} four colours, greys, greens, ochres and Indian red; old colours, <b>earth</b> <b>colours</b> applied with architectural deliberation on a grid-like base. It was this tonal quality, {{as well as the}} subject matter of much of his mid-Eighties work - the unemployed sitting in Hackney Library, trench-coated figures drifting though city streets, a bicycle propped against a wall - that gave his work a nostalgic quality.|$|E
50|$|John Hitchens is an English painter born in 1940. His work is {{influenced}} by the landscape of the South Downs and his main subject area is the countryside of West Sussex, England. He also spent extended periods working in North Wales and North West Scotland. Hitchens' paintings are primarily concerned with expressing patterns and textures of the landscape. During the past decades his work has evolved into an abstract style using a range of <b>earth</b> <b>colours.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A long running {{relationship}} between the artist and Greenhill Galleries commenced with her first exhibition in 1974. Art Critic Ivor Frances reported in a newspaper review, Pottery is Exciting, that ‘The exhibition pottery is large and sculptural, subtly coloured in harmonious glazes [...]. Joyce Scott has overcome many of the firing problems which occur in making large, light ceramic articles [...]. and the glazes crawl and break into fractured <b>earth</b> <b>colours,</b> browns and greens, all over the surface.’ ...|$|E

50|$|The mural {{will be a}} {{permanent}} feature of the amphitheatre. The artist used Keim Mineral Paints, invented in 1878. The system is a liquid silicate paint which comprises a potassium silicate binder with inorganic fillers (feldspar) and natural <b>earth</b> oxide <b>colour</b> pigments. When applied onto a mineral substrate the binder is absorbed and forms a micro-crystalline silicate structure. This crystalline structure allows the substrate to breathe but prevents the ingress of driven rain.|$|R

However {{to reduce the}} expense, a scarf of dove grey cloth (the colour of humility) with a warm red lining (to signify warmth of feeling) was {{substituted}} with only a patch of Maclaren tartan {{on the point of}} the scarf and worn by those passing the Gilwell practical course. In 1924 use of the scarf became restricted to Wood Badge holders only. Today the scarf is more the <b>earth</b> tone <b>colour</b> beige than grey.|$|R

It shows Mukherjee's first fresco on {{the ceiling of the}} new dormitory of Kala Bhavan, executed using <b>earth</b> <b>colours</b> to display a pond surrounded by rural life around Santiniketan. The documentary also shows another fresco drawn at China Bhavana which displays life at the Santiniketan campus. Mukherjee himself then explains another fresco done at the Hindu Bhavana in Santiniketan covering three walls of the central hall, which displays religious themes of Medieval India and its uniqueness of not having any preliminary tracing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{lower part}} of the field {{consists}} of two panels, blue and gold, which represent heaven and <b>earth.</b> The <b>colours</b> also symbolize both spiritual and material accomplishment. The letters [...] "ACS" [...] in red symbolize life forming a bridge between both; they also symbolize the blood of Christ uniting heaven and earth. In addition to the school name, the letters ACS are also variously said to spell out Academic achievements, Christian Character, and Sportsmanship or Service beyond self. Finally, the overall shield shape represents the knightly virtues of chivalry, honour, loyalty, valour and manliness.|$|R

The whole concept of the 'village' presents a mosaic of texture and <b>colours,</b> <b>earth,</b> bricks, tiles and thatch. Nrityagram received the award for best rural architecture from the Vice- President of India in 1991.|$|R
