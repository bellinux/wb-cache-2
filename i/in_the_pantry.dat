500|$|The {{room on the}} {{opposite}} side of the Clifton Maybank corridor from the Great Hall was originally two rooms comprising the [...] "pannetry" [...] (sic) and [...] "buttery." [...] In a large household the buttery and [...] "pannetry" [...] were part of the offices pertaining to the kitchen, and as at Montacute they were generally close to the Great Hall. The buttery was traditionally the place from which the yeoman of the buttery served beer and candles to those lower members of the household not entitled to drink wine. Montacute's buttery is typical, as it had a staircase to the beer cellar below. The [...] "pannetry" [...] was the room from which the yeoman of the pantry served bread. By the time of Montacute's completion, upper servants often dined and entertained visiting servants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantry.</b> This layout was a medieval concept and later, as custom dictated that servants withdraw from the principal areas of the house, these rooms became used by the family as reception and private dining rooms. Eventually, in the early 20th century, Lord Curzon amalgamated the two rooms to create the grand, and socially necessary, dining room, which Montacute had lacked since the Great Chamber had been abandoned more than 100 years earlier.|$|E

2500|$|After Kennedy's {{defeat in}} Oregon, the California primary {{was seen as}} crucial to both Kennedy and McCarthy. McCarthy stumped the state's many colleges and universities, where he {{was treated as a}} hero for being the first presidential {{candidate}} to oppose the war. Kennedy campaigned in the ghettos and barrios of the state's larger cities, where he was mobbed by enthusiastic supporters. Kennedy and McCarthy engaged in a television debate {{a few days before the}} primary; it was generally considered a draw. On June 4, Kennedy narrowly defeated McCarthy in California, 46%–42%. However, McCarthy refused to withdraw from the race and made it clear that he would contest Kennedy in the upcoming New York primary, where McCarthy had much support from anti-war activists in New York City. The New York primary quickly became a moot point, however, for Kennedy was shot shortly after midnight on June 5; he died twenty-six hours later. Kennedy had just given his victory speech in a crowded ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles; he and his aides then entered a narrow kitchen pantry on their way to a banquet room to meet with reporters. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantry</b> Kennedy and five others were shot by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Rosicrucian Palestinian of Christian background and Jordanian citizenship, who hated Kennedy because of his support for Israel. Sirhan admitted his guilt, was convicted of murder, and is still in prison. In recent years some have cast a doubt on this, including Sirhan himself, who said he was [...] "brainwashed" [...] into killing Kennedy and was a patsy.|$|E
2500|$|If Behn is {{a curious}} {{exception}} to the rule of noble verse, Robert Gould breaks that rule altogether. Gould was born of a common family and orphaned at the age of thirteen. He had no schooling at all and worked as a domestic servant, first as a footman and then, probably, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantry.</b> However, he was attached to the Earl of Dorset's household, and Gould somehow learned to read and write, as well as possibly to read and write Latin. In the 1680s and 1690s, Gould's poetry was very popular. He attempted to write odes for money, but his great success came with Love Given O'er, or A Satyr Upon ... Woman in 1692. It was a partial adaptation of a satire by Juvenal, but with an immense amount of explicit invective against women. The misogyny in this poem is some of the harshest and most visceral in English poetry: the poem sold out all editions. Gould also wrote a Satyr on the Play House (reprinted in Montagu Sommers's The London Stage) with detailed descriptions of the actions and actors involved in the Restoration stage. He followed the success of Love Given O'er with a series of misogynistic poems, all of which have specific, graphic, and witty denunciations of female behaviour. His poetry has [...] "virgin" [...] brides who, upon their wedding nights, have [...] "the straight gate so wide/ It's been leapt by all mankind," [...] noblewomen who have money but prefer to pay the coachman with oral sex, and noblewomen having sex in their coaches and having the cobblestones heighten their pleasures. Gould's career was brief, but his success was not a novelty of subliterary misogyny. After Dryden's conversion to Roman Catholicism, Gould even engaged in a poison pen battle with the Laureate. His [...] "Jack Squab" [...] (the Laureate getting paid with squab as well as sack and implying that Dryden would sell his soul for a dinner) attacked Dryden's faithlessness viciously, and Dryden and his friends replied. That a footman even could conduct a verse war is remarkable. That he did so without, apparently, any prompting from his patron is astonishing.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project {{aimed to explore}} the demand, importance, and perceived satisfaction of {{fresh fruits and vegetables}} served in food pantries among residents and staff of a subsidized, low-income housing organization based in central Texas using mixed methods. This study additionally aimed to identify best practices for operating a healthy food pantry based within subsidized housing organizations, as well as emerging themes among food pantry clients and staff that consist of mainly of low-income Hispanic, African American, and white populations. In exploring these themes, food pantry clients were surveyed pre and post introduction of an intervention to enhance delivery and promotion of fruit and vegetables at two food pantries that occur twice a month at properties of the identified organization. ^ This study used a serial cross sectional design in which a convenience sample of food pantry clients from two food pantry locations was interviewed pre and post implementation of enhanced fruit and vegetable access and promotion at <b>the</b> <b>pantries.</b> Clients completed a self-completed questionnaire to determine the perceived need of certain food items <b>in</b> <b>the</b> food <b>pantry,</b> perceived satisfaction of <b>the</b> food <b>pantry,</b> as well as healthy and unhealthy dietary practices. Key informants (food <b>pantry</b> staff) involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pilot intervention were identified and measured only at post intervention through interviews that aimed to determine perceived benefits, barriers and facilitating factors to operating and providing healthy food <b>in</b> <b>the</b> food <b>pantries.</b> ^ Results indicated a positive change in perceived satisfaction among <b>the</b> food <b>pantry</b> clients. At baseline, 38. 5 % (n= 5) of clients strongly agreed that they liked food that <b>the</b> <b>pantry</b> offers, with 53. 8 % (n= 7) strongly agreeing that <b>the</b> food <b>pantry</b> offered healthy foods at pre-intervention. At 6 -month post intervention, 94. 1 % (n= 16) of respondents strongly agreed that they liked the food that <b>the</b> food <b>pantry</b> program offers and that <b>the</b> food <b>pantry</b> offers healthy food (Table 3). Most common themes identified as barriers and challenges from food pantry staff key informant interviews were the need to have refrigeration, lack of adequate transportation for delivery of food, lack of adequate staff and lack of time. ^ Findings from this exploratory study suggest positive acceptance and satisfaction of food pantry clients with introduction of increased availability of fresh fruits and vegetables. Findings were consistent with the literature regarding barriers to implementation of interventions at food pantries. Future research should examine how to encourage the selection of healthy foods while decreasing selection of unhealthy foods such as chips, cookies, candies, and sugar-sweetened beverages. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} food pantries {{is to provide}} {{short-term}} assistance to food insecure individuals, however recent research indicates that food pantries are often used over longer periods of time. Therefore, {{there is a greater}} importance for food pantries to distribute nutrient dense foods. We examined <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> client satisfaction and desire for change in available foods from baseline, 3 and 6 months post-implementation of a new healthy food policy. SUBJECTS: Food pantry clients were recruited to complete a survey while waiting to utilize food pantry services. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two food pantries in Grand Rapids, MI were studied at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-implementation of a new healthy food policy. Access of West Michigan provided demographic information on food pantry clients. Pantry clients’ satisfaction and desire for change in available foods were measured through a survey. ANALYSES: Frequencies were used to describe discrete characteristics. RESULTS: The pre-surveys indicated clients desired to have more access to fruits and vegetables. The post-survey indicated clients were aware of <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> fruits and vegetables after implementation of the healthy food policy. Client satisfaction remained high throughout the implementation of the healthy food policy. CONCLUSIONS: Food pantry clients were satisfied with the new healthy food policy and <b>the</b> resultant increase <b>in</b> fruits and vegetables available for selection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pantries...</b>|$|R
