It is an example of using redundancy to increase safety and reduce the likelihood of failure, analogous to <b>double</b> <b>insulation.</b> Double switching increases the cost and complexity of systems in which it is employed, for example by extra relay contacts and extra relays, so the technique is applied selectively where it can provide a cost-effective safety improvement.|$|E

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems, the fault frequently involves arcing and burning {{for all the}} wiring exposed to mechanical damage and other insulation stresses including wiring not fixed and connected by flexible cords and cables. The IEC Standard 60364 stops the design of electric power systems at the outlets of branch circuits or at the fixed equipment. A complete design instead should {{take care of the}} connections of the portable equipment and of extension cords (as requested by NFPA 70) that are exposed to arc-faults and may cause fire and/or electric shock hazard. The cords supplying the Class II equipment are without a grounding protection conductor, so the failure of the <b>double</b> <b>insulation,</b> caused by external damage, can't be expected to be easily detected as a ground fault. A protection must be provided to prevent the fault from extinguishing itself without being detected and remaining energized, thus presenting an electric shock hazard by direct contact with a live part, rendered accessible after local insulation failure. The authors highlight this worst case and suggest the protection achieved by wiring the circuits, particularly extension cords, with special power cables. Ground-fault-forced cables, GFFCs convert a line-to-line fault into a line to ground fault, that will be detected and protected by ordinary ground fault protective devices (GFPDs).

The standard curtain reduced sleeper area heating load by 21 % in one test truck, while the arctic curtain decreased it by 26 %.

40|$|How is it {{possible}} to increase homeowners’ insulation activity? Answering this question is key to successful policies regarding energy-efficient buildings worldwide. In Germany, <b>doubling</b> today’s <b>insulation</b> rate of about 1 % is an important element for reaching the government’s target of an 80 % reduction in energy demand in the building sector by 2050. This thesis uses an agent-based model analysis to improve the understanding of homeowners’ insulation activity and to explore new approaches aiming at its increase in Germany. Two agent-based models were developed and utilized. The first model was developed mainly based on insights derived from a structured literature review. The second emerged from the previous one, incorporating the results of an online survey conducted among 275 homeowners. The results indicate that homeowners’ economic means have little influence on their decision to install insulation. Instead, their insulation decision-making is mostly affected by situational factors and their attitudes towards insulation. Situational factors, such as the condition of the building, are important because they initiate homeowners’ individual decision-making processes on insulation. The simulation results show that improving homeowners’ attitudes about insulation by providing information has a comparatively low potential for increasing their insulation activity. Out of the policy options this thesis explored, the introduction of an obligation to insulate the walls within one year after change of house ownership was found to have the greatest impact on homeowners’ insulation activity. The research has been published in the scope of three peer-reviewed articles: Friege, Jonas, and Emile J. L.
