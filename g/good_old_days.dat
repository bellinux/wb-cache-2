500|$|Cole {{initially}} {{looked for}} original songs to {{record for the}} album, but said [...] "the songs being sent were pretty bad." [...] A writer from Vibe said Cole's decision to create a covers album was a marketing strategy to breed [...] "a connection between song and interpreter and between singer and audience" [...] and appeal to [...] "fans yearning for the <b>good</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> before they had to hire a sitter to go see a show". Cole later clarified she {{could not afford to}} record an album of original material, explaining [...] "we're doing a contemporary urban record on a jazz budget".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the moderately negative feedback {{the third and fourth}} seasons received, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said of the fifth season: [...] "Overall, it feels more like the <b>good</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> than Grey's Anatomy has in a long time." [...] Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five [...] "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: [...] "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: [...] "Grey's has always loved grand gestures. You like them or you don't; the only real question is whether the show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did." ...|$|E

500|$|As for the game's combat, Snider {{called it}} streamlined, {{but said that}} players {{who do not want}} to use the pause {{mechanic}} {{would not be able to}} appreciate the game, as the combat requires both patience and strategy. He liked the game's third-person view more than the top-down view, saying that being able to view the sky made environments feel more complicated, and praised the high difficulty of boss battles, which task players to manage their stamina carefully. His conclusion was that Origins [...] "feels like a real throwback to the <b>good</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> of PC role-playing epics." [...] VanOrd said that the combat system was easily recognizable for players who have played other RPGs developed by BioWare. He added that players can have a lot of fun switching between characters, and agreed that the game had created thrilling boss battles. He praised the choice to have health and stamina replenish immediately after battles, as it sped up combat pace and flow. Tan also commended the combat, finding it a better system than other BioWare RPGs, but disliked the fact that characters can't step into water. Juba praised the amount of space for players to experiment with new skills and abilities, adding that the required focus and attention make combat very satisfying.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Michael Liedtke and George Avalos, {{in a review}} of the sixth season in The Charlotte Observer, called the episode [...] "just plain bad". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club roundly criticized the episode and awarded it a [...] "D–", calling it [...] "a famously bad episode of The X-Files." [...] He noted that [...] "the worst thing about 'Agua Mala' is that it comes so very, very close to working that it’s frustrating to see just how little it actually does" [...] due to its bizarre structure and convoluted antagonist. VanDerWerff criticized Darren McGavin's appearance in the episode, calling it a [...] "glorified cameo", and noted that his character function as the [...] "kind of old man who stands on his porch and yells about the <b>good</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> to the neighborhood kids." [...] He did however, call the shot of the [...] "writhing tentacle in the overhead lamp" [...] the [...] "one good thing" [...] in the episode. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, writing that the episode's [...] "laughs aren't clever, and the scares are silly".|$|E
500|$|On March 31, 2017, Dylan {{released}} his triple album, Triplicate, comprising 30 new recordings of classic American songs, including [...] "As Time Goes By" [...] by Herman Hupfeld and [...] "Stormy Weather" [...] by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler. Dylan's 38th studio album {{was recorded in}} Hollywood's Capitol Studios and features his touring band. Dylan posted a long interview on his website to promote the album, and was asked if this material was an exercise in nostalgia. [...] "Nostalgic? No I wouldn’t say that. It’s not taking a trip down memory lane or longing and yearning for the <b>good</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> or fond memories of what’s no more. A song like [...] "Sentimental Journey" [...] is not a way back when song, it doesn’t emulate the past, it’s attainable and down to earth, it’s {{in the here and}} now." [...] The album was awarded a score of 84 on critical aggregator website Metacritic, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". Critics praised the thoroughness of Dylan's exploration of the great American songbook, though, in the opinion of Uncut: [...] "For all its easy charms, Triplicate labours its point to the brink of overkill. After five albums' worth of croon toons, this feels like a fat full stop on a fascinating chapter." ...|$|E

500|$|Welles said, [...] "the {{film was}} not {{intended}} as a lament for Falstaff, but {{for the death of}} Merrie England. Merrie England as a conception, a myth which has been very real to the English-speaking world, and is to some extent expressed in other countries of the Medieval epoch: the age of chivalry, of simplicity, of Maytime and all that. It is more than Falstaff who is dying. It's the old England dying and betrayed." [...] Many film theorists and Welles biographers have written about the recurrent theme of the [...] "Lost Eden" [...] in Welles's work and of characters who are nostalgic for an idealized past, which Welles called [...] "the central theme in Western culture." [...] Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that [...] "even if the <b>good</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> never existed, the fact that we can conceive of such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit." [...] Film scholar Beverle Houston argued that this nostalgia made Welles's depiction of Falstaff infantile and called his performance a [...] "ower baby...an eating, sucking, foetus-like creature." [...] Welles also called Falstaff [...] "the greatest conception of a good man, the most completely good man, in all of drama", and said that [...] "the closer I thought I was getting to Falstaff the less funny he seemed to me. When I played him before in the theater, he seemed more witty than comical. And in bringing him to the screen, I found him only occasionally, and only deliberately, a clown." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers were {{in favor}} of Storm of Zehirs focus on {{exploration}} and the ability to postpone or ignore the game's main storyline, and they compared the gameplay to older role-playing video games such as Icewind Dale II and Fallout. GameZone's reviewer said [...] "This is a game that harkens back to the <b>good</b> <b>old</b> <b>days</b> of adventure D video-gaming", and IGN said [...] "this feels like an homage to the old school D games of the past". [...] The ability to handcraft an entire party instead of just the main character was welcomed, with GameSpot's reviewer noting [...] "Rather than playing as a solo hero chosen for some great destiny, you roll up a party of four average joes just like you did way back when in D classics like the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale franchises," [...] (It should be noted that Baldur's Gate did not actually contain the ability to create the entire party in single player mode; however, in multiplayer, this was possible) [...] and IGN saying [...] "There's a strange kind of nerd joy when it comes to creating a D party". [...] Reviewers also appreciated the [...] "Party Conversation System", which allows typically underutilized social skills to be used by the entire party during conversation. [...] GameSpy said [...] "It's a terrific convention in which the game responds not to one but to every member of an adventuring party. [...] have the option to interject some special comment into a conversation that might open up otherwise unavailable avenues". [...] Reviewers were grateful that the time-based, [...] "spirit-eating" [...] gameplay mechanic of Mask of the Betrayer was not included.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Rick Florino of Artistdirect was very positive on the album, writing {{that the film}} [...] "hearkens back to the <b>good</b> <b>old</b> <b>days,</b> and the film's soundtrack is not {{only one of the}} best soundtracks this year, it's also bound to be remembered as a classic." [...] The writer praised Browning's take on [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", writing that it [...] "adds a lush darkness and vibrant vulnerability to the song reminiscent of Portishead's Beth Gibbons but with a flair all her own." [...] Florino awarded the album four and a half stars out of five, and concluded his review, writing, [...] "This is the kind of soundtrack that needs to be listened to from front to back, and if it's any indication, the film is destined {{to be one of the}} most mind-blowing and magnificent screen event this year, perhaps even the decade." [...] Allmusic's Heather Phares reviewed the album positively, praising Browning for [...] "deliver the soundtrack’s most affecting performances". Phares concluded her review with [...] "Sucker Punch is elaborate and sometimes overwrought, but it’s absolutely true to the film’s aesthetic." [...] Billboard reviewer Phil Gallo described the soundtrack as [...] "a rush of male-targeted female power" [...] which de Vries and Bates scored with [...] "dark, eerie and violent soundscapes". Gallo found Yoav's contribution to [...] "Where Is My Mind" [...] to be [...] "the soundtrack's most tender moment". Writing for Empire, Danny Graydon highlighted Browning's songs as [...] "seductive takes", and praised both Gugino and Isaac for [...] "an exuberant version of Roxy Music’s 'Love Is The Drug'" [...] and considering Björk's collaboration [...] "magnificently reversions 'Army Of Me' with Skunk Anansie". Jon M. Gilbertson of Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was not very fond of the album, writing that [...] "Maybe these covers make more sense in filmic context, but on their own they exude an air of pointlessness. They are, like Snyder's movies, stylish but curiously hollow." ...|$|E

[...] The Hindustan Times Anupama Chopra gave the film 2 stars, saying, [...] "There are a few moments in the film that took {{me back to the}} <b>good</b> <b>old</b> <b>day.</b> But mostly, Main Tera Hero is loud and tiring. The frenzied plot didn't deliver enough funny lines. The burden of making this enterprise work rests mostly with Varun, who is as hyper as a helium-filled energiser bunny. Meanwhile, the two svelte heroines - Ileana D'Cruz and Nargis Fakhri - simper about looking sexy. I just wish it had been more interesting". India Today gave the film 2 stars: [...] "If this film was made to establish Varun Dhawan as a comedy actor who can do something different then they have achieved what they wanted.
