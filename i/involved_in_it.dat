The plot is described as having been planned by three men, but many in the senate, army and equestrian order {{were said to have}} been informed of it and <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|One of the {{featured}} matches was between John Cena versus Sabu in an Extreme Rules lumberjack match, a standard match {{with the exception}} that the ring {{is surrounded by a}} group of wrestlers not directly <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> and competed under hardcore rules. On the television debut of ECW on Sci Fi on June 13, a brawl broke out between Rob Van Dam and Edge. Edge, who stormed through the ECW crowd, was attacked by Cena, who cost Cena the WWE Championship at ECW's One Night Stand, and written into the storyline, sought revenge against Edge. Following the attack, Cena went to ringside where he knocked ECW Representative Paul Heyman unconscious, after Heyman awarded the pinfall win to Van Dam at One Night Stand. Following the attack, Heyman announced that all ECW superstars would be at Raw the following week. The following week on Raw, Heyman appeared alongside ECW superstar, Balls Mahoney, who was booked to face Cena in a singles match. The match was won by Cena after he made Mahoney submit. After the match, Cena was attacked by ECW superstar Sabu, who in the premiere of ECW on Sci Fi won a 10-man Extreme Battle Royal, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner, where the winner would face Cena at Vengeance in a singles match. Sabu assaulted Cena in which he performed a leg drop on Cena, diving onto him and putting Cena through the Raw announcers' table. The following night on an episode of ECW on Sci Fi, Cena showed up in the ECW locker room, where he challenged Sabu to an Extreme Rules lumberjack match, for which Sabu accepted.|$|E

The documentary Voyage in Time {{was produced in}} Italy in 1982, as was Nostalghia in 1983. His last film The Sacrifice was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter. Tarkovsky once said that a director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and monotonous films.|$|E

25|$|Another {{challenge}} of feminist historians is integration in digital format. Women’s historians {{have had some}} success in working with digital humanists in creating their databases, but the databases {{are few and far}} between. This creates a problem for feminist historians trying to create a feminist history database based on women’s history databases. Since data mining is not a field many digital humanist women are <b>involved</b> <b>in,</b> <b>it</b> can be a challenge to find the necessary relationships between these few. Though Filene argues that data mining {{is the best way to}} integrate histories, this lack of involvement by feminist digital humanists detaches the work from others sharing similar feminist historian’s work.|$|E
25|$|Lemond {{claims that}} from his {{earliest}} days of professional cycling, he was strongly against taking drugs to alter performance (although there are few records of him speaking out during his career), and his career is not as tarnished by suspicions as his contemporaries or successors. His willingness (after his career) {{to speak out against}} doping and those prominent individuals <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> (primarily Lance Armstrong) ended up inadvertently linking him with the sport’s doping scandal controversies. In his opposition to fraud, corruption and what he saw as complicity on the part of cycling officials, LeMond became a lightning rod of sorts for the sports most prominent personalities.|$|E
25|$|In 1856, General Francis Rawdon Chesney {{traveled}} to Palestine {{to survey the}} land for a railway {{in the company of}} Sir John McNeil, a railway expert. After examining two possible routes, he deemed a rail line to Jerusalem too expensive, estimating construction costs at 4,000–4,500 pounds per kilometer. McNeil then proposed a short line from Jaffa to Lydda only, and a macadam road from there to Jerusalem (which would cost only 150 pounds per kilometer). Chesney did not give up, contacting Sir Arthur Slade, a general in the Ottoman army, who supported the plan for a railway in what is today Iraq. Slade opposed a Jaffa–Jerusalem line, which he believed would benefit England and be against Turkey's interests. Although Montefiore was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> nothing came of Chesney's initiative. According to another account, Montefiore backed out of the project when Culling Eardley reiterated during a meeting that the railway would serve Christian missionary activity.|$|E
