25|$|As in Campaign 139, the PAVN {{pulled up}} {{just short of}} {{overrunning}} Long Tieng and ending the Laotian Civil War. The Royalists were battered and in questionable shape to undertake an offensive. With further North Vietnamese offensives in the offing, the American government found itself presented with a double-edged dilemma. L'Armee Clandestine was the only Lao military force still ready to fight in northern Laosbut barely ready. Continued defense of Long Tieng could lead to their defeat and loss of the war. On the other hand, removing the Hmong from their traditional homeland might irretrievably break their fighting spirit, and lose the war. However, Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley, who actually directed the war, believed that with the PAVN being attrited by air strikes, the Hmong could endure. Besides, Vang Pao had returned from hospital, and Hmong morale consequently perked up. On the other hand, CIA Chief of Station Hugh Tovar believed that the Lao were becoming <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Americans risking only money and supplies while Lao were being killed.|$|E

Initially, the album cover was to be shots of the band taken in front of the Fillmore East with their names on the marquee above them, but no one was satisfied with the results. The band's main purpose for the cover was that it be as [...] "meat and potatoes" [...] as the band's ethos and performing, and someone suggested the band make it a photograph of the band in an alley waiting with their gear to go onstage.|$|E

500|$|The Cooper Union {{speech was}} the {{beginning}} of a split between Bill Haywood and the Socialist Party, leading to the split between the factions of the IWW, one faction loyal to the Socialist Party, and the other to Haywood. The rift presented a problem for Debs, who was influential in both the IWW and the Socialist Party. The final straw between Haywood and the Socialist Party came during the Lawrence Textile Strike when, <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> decision of the elected officials in Lawrence, Massachusetts, to send police who subsequently used their clubs on children, Haywood publicly declared that [...] "I will not vote again" [...] until such a circumstance was rectified. Haywood was purged from the National Executive Committee by passage of an amendment that focused on the direct action and sabotage tactics advocated by the IWW.

500|$|Waineʻe Church {{was burned}} down on June 28, 1894, after sparks from a rubbish fire ignited the wooden belfry of the church. Although {{the fire was}} accidental, annexationist Sereno Edwards Bishop, writing in 1897, blamed the Hawaiian royalists {{and those who had}} opposed Pali for the burning of the building. He stated: [...] "The {{excellent}} pastor of this church, Reverend A.Pali, had become obnoxious to a majority of his people on account of politics. He had favored the abolition of monarchy, having become, like a majority of his colleagues in the pastorate, exceedingly <b>disgusted</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> increasing heathenish tendencies of the court. The dissension arising from Pali's attitude had led to the burning of the fine old stone church by partisans of the Royalist side, and the people were too weak to rebuild." [...] This biased, false report has been repeated in the conventional history of Hawaii written with the use of English language sources. The church was later rebuilt and destroyed multiple times and was renamed Waiola Church in 1953.|$|E
