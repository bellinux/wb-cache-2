40|$|Using a survey: the Panel of Employment Policy Beneficiaries, {{this study}} {{measured}} {{the effectiveness of}} Solidarity <b>Employment</b> <b>Contracts</b> (CES), <b>Employment</b> <b>Initiative</b> <b>Contracts</b> (CIE), and <b>Employment</b> Training and Placement Courses (SIFE group training and integration), comparing the return to employment of past beneficiaries, with a control group of eligible job seekers. The selection bias has been minimised by pairing the beneficiary and control groups, against variables which influence participation in the schemes (family background and previous career, but also living standard and financial situation). On average the CIE is effective for returning to employment and improving living standards, while the CES and the SIFE group schemes do not significantly improve the careers of the beneficiaries {{compared with those of}} the control group. Nevertheless, taking part in CES or a SIFE group scheme can be beneficial for those aged between 26 and 49, in comparison with the careers of the control group.

In section four an analysis {{of the quality of the}} created employment and the impact on the male and female labour force can be found.
