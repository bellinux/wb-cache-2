2500|$|The Flyboat is {{the primary}} mode of {{transportation}} in the series. The main base is a red flying disc with 4 blue and yellow wheels, it has 3 lights: 1 green, 1 orange and 1 purple; the Flyboat has a clear plastic bottom where 5 gears, that are possibly part of the engine, are visible. The Flyboat's rocket boosters are 2 <b>felt</b> <b>marker</b> caps that are controlled by a green Popsicle stick that when lifted up makes boosters point down, which allows the Flyboat to hover in the air. Lastly, the boat has a mast made out of blue Erector pieces with a marble on top and a sail (the color, design, and print varies) with the Wonder Pets logo on it. Usually, Linny pilots the Flyboat, but there are episodes where Ming-Ming or Tuck pilot it instead. Most other modes of transportation are {{a variation of the}} Flyboat and primarily use the same components such as the Flysub, which is basically a modified Flyboat capable of traveling underwater or modify it to fit a specific theme tied to the theme of the episode such as The Circusboat in [...] "Join the Circus!". In [...] "Save the Raccoon", the Flyboat breaks down during their rescue of a Baby Raccoon stuck in a Recycling Bin and find that its gears have come loose, forcing them to create a new vehicle called the Flycycle from recyclable materials in order to save the Baby Raccoon. In [...] "Save the Loch Ness Monster", it is shown that the Flyboat can be converted in a sail/motor boat by changing the position of the wheels and the boosters, called the Boat-Boat. In [...] "Three Wonder Pets and a Baby", Linny decides to create Babyboat, using a red Baby carriage as its main base instead of the Flyboat's red disc. The Wonder Pets have trouble building it at first as they are all trying to do everything at the same time so Linny suggests that they build it step-by-step and this solution to build the Babyboat would later inspire them of how to deal with pacifying the crying Baby Piglet. In [...] "Ollie to the Rescue", Ollie creates his own version for his Thunder Pets team, which he calls the Ollieboat. He uses the Flyboats red flying disc as its main base and a carrot for a mast. However, Ollie is a poor flyer and requires the Wonder Pets assistance to fly the Ollieboat out of the classroom.|$|E

50|$|Objectivists {{believe that}} subjectivists' {{preferences}} are often driven by gullibility and fashion—e.g., the late eighties' vogue for marking {{the edges of}} CDs with a green <b>felt</b> <b>marker</b> or suspending cables above the floor on small racks—and bear no relation to well-known laws of physics.|$|E
50|$|During this 40-year period, {{many new}} carvers appeared, and style and subject matter became decidedly modern. Subjects became more ethnically and {{socially}} diverse (e.g., a Chinese woman with triangular hat, hippies {{with long hair}} and glasses, men wearing floppy hats, etc.). Some of these new artists used new techniques such as power engravers, vibrating tools, and <b>felt</b> <b>marker</b> pens to add color to hair.|$|E

Around {{the time he}} joined with CJCA, Bill Matheson also joined CITV-TV in Edmonton as its weatherman. Despite advances in technology, Matheson was known for sticking with his <b>felt</b> <b>marker,</b> his weatherboard, and a long pointer which he would bounce {{on the ground and}} catch {{at the end of every}} forecast.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} of differential maternal allocation to eggs {{in response to}} manipulated male attractiveness in the migratory pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). We manipulated {{the size of a}} male secondary sexual trait, the white forehead patch, right after male arrival to the breeding area and before female arrival. Patch size was (1) enlarged to the maximum observed in the population, (2) reduced by 40 % or (3) kept constant by painting with indelible <b>felt</b> <b>markers</b> over the natural feather patch. Male behaviour was affected by the experimental manipulation, as individuals with enlarged patches performed more approaches to the nestbox in response to song playback during the territory occupation and nest-site presentation phases. Females paired with males with reduced forehead patches laid significantly smaller eggs than those paired with males in the control and enlarged-patch treatments. Laying date and clutch size did not differ among the experimental groups. We discuss that manipulations of ornaments designed to study differential allocation at laying should reduce as well as enlarge their expression...|$|R
50|$|A <b>felt</b> tip <b>marker</b> {{can be used}} as {{they are}} {{convenient}} and tend not to dry up as quickly; marking blue in the form of dye or ink has a tendency to dry in the containers and become unusable quickly. On rough structures, such as castings or forgings, whitewash or a mixture of chalk and water can be used. A solution of copper sulfate, distilled water, and a few drops of sulfuric acid can be used on machined surfaces. This thin copper coating is more resistant to rough handling and the action of cutting fluid.|$|R

5000|$|Score Mountain (commonly SCORE! Mountain Challenge), {{conceived}} of in 1993 by Ingrid Stabb, a loyalty marketing professional in Palo Alto, California, is utilized to visualize and track a goal based on goal-setting theory. It encapsulates a long-term [...] "goal program that rewards completion, helping students to set and pursue academic goals: students attain bronze, silver, gold, and even 'top of the mountain' goals when they complete {{a certain number}} of sessions, advancing them up a wooden mountain to the summit." [...] Wooden sculptures of SCORE! Mountain can be found in SCORE! Educational Centers around the United States and Israel. SCORE! Mountain Challenge is also the brand name of a K-12 series of educational workbooks. The first SCORE! Mountain was created on paper in 1993 for a first grade boy who was struggling to learn to read. The boy could fill in his progress with a <b>felt</b> <b>marker</b> on a picture depicting him riding a bicycle up and over the mountain. Cycling up the mountain represented learning phonetics and how to sound out words. Reaching the pinnacle represented reading his very first paragraph by himself, whereas the rest of the path “would be all down hill from there” as he prepared for second grade reading. The boy enjoyed using the mountain as a motivational metaphor and started reading paragraphs by himself in no time.|$|E

50|$|Similar {{to other}} self-taught artists, Sister Morgan used simple forms {{to depict the}} human figure. Her works are {{characterized}} by their lack {{of the use of}} formal techniques such as perspective and definition of light and shadow, giving them a flat, two dimensional quality. She painted and drew using acrylics, tempera, ballpoint pen, watercolors, crayon, colored and lead pencils and <b>felt</b> tip <b>markers.</b> Using inexpensive materials she had at hand, Sister Morgan painted on paper, toilet rolls, plastic pitchers, paper megaphones, scrap wood, lampshades, paper fans and styrofoam trays. The fact that she was self-taught, coupled with her choice of materials as well as her style and subject matter have led her to be characterized as a naive, folk, visionary, vernacular and outsider artist.|$|R

50|$|A {{historical}} marker in {{the park}} {{across the street from}} the school commemorates the camp, and the 1917 riot that occurred there. The marker was, initially, to be placed by the Memorial Park golf course club house. This was strongly opposed by The Friends of Memorial Park. The group <b>felt</b> that the <b>marker</b> would be better suited for location in a right of way median located at Washington Avenue and Wescott, an area that was not a part of Memorial Park. The marker was finally placed on the edge of the park at the corner of Arnot Street and Haskell.|$|R
40|$|Detoxified {{male and}} female alcohdics (aged 20 - 49 years) and age-matched {{controls}} performed a series of 15 - 8 ec target-tapping tasks in which they alternatively marked two target strips with a <b>felt</b> <b>marker</b> as rapidly and as accurately as possible. Consistent with “Fitts ’ Law” (Fitts PM: J Exp Psych 47981 - 391, 1954), a highly linear relationship between movement time and task difficulty was observed in all four groups. Overall, the alcohdis were slower and made more errors than the controls, although the pattern of deficit differed for males and females. Accuracy, but not speed, was impaired in male alco-holics. The production of undershoot e m was increased more in akohdics than nonakoholics in targets of narrower width, whereas the production of overshoot errors was increased more in alcoholics as target separation decreased.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages #-#) My work is {{a search}} for visual equivalents [...] in form, color, line, and scale [...] to my inner experiences. I fear being the perennial drop of water, following {{the path of least}} resistance. My working process, as reflected in my work, is a series of personal questions: Am I able to know myself, change myself, resist unwanted change? This series is an effort towards self-determination. The Process and Materials Initially a plethora of impulses, my work is first made actual in the form of small sketches (small inasmuch as 1 l/ 4 " x 3 / 4 " is typical). The media is ideally black fine point pen on white, unlined paper but it is, for the most part, a matter of what is available [...] 68 pencil on old stained receipts, <b>felt</b> tip <b>marker</b> on a current nearby calendar, etc. These somewhat ???automatic??? images arise from the insistent, anxious need to express myself and from the innocent, childlike joy of discovery and invention.

50|$|A marker pen, fineliner, marking pen, {{felt-tip}} marker, felt-tip pen, flow, marker or texta (in Australia) or sketch pen (in India), is a pen {{which has}} its own ink-source, and a tip made of porous, pressed fibers such as <b>felt.</b> A permanent <b>marker</b> consists of a container (glass, aluminum or plastic) and a core of an absorbent material. This filling serves as a carrier for the ink. The upper part of the marker contains the nib that was made in earlier time of a hard felt material, and a cap to prevent the marker from drying out. Until the early 1990s the most common solvents that were used for the ink were toluene and xylene. These two substances are both harmful and characterized by a very strong smell. Today, the ink is usually {{made on the basis of}} alcohols (e.g. 1-propanol, 1-butanol, diacetone alcohol and cresols). Markers may be waterproof, dry-erase, or permanent which will be further expanded on in this article.|$|R
50|$|Holtz creates his scenes after researching locations, {{and often}} uses locals as models. He paints slowly {{and with great}} care, but with a swift Impressionistic style. The people in his portraits and scenes are {{generally}} more cheerful and optimistic than standard portraits of Hassidic individuals. He paints oils and watercolors, and also does <b>felt</b> pen, pastel, <b>marker,</b> ink and charcoal drawings, as well as woodcuts. His oil paintings typically have a brown hue, while his work with felt pen is often in sepia tones, and on some of his works he used very bright colors, with {{a strong emphasis on}} the interplay of light and shadow. He is heavily influenced by the ancient staircases and alleyways of Jerusalem, with its modest religious population, which has made a strong impression on him in his youth, the streets of Tzfat, and the works of Rembrandt, Johannes Vermeer and Peter Bruegel, as well as Jewish artists Moritz Daniel Oppenheim, Leonid Pasternak and Isidor Kaufmann have had a strong influence on him. He has said that realism is the best way he can express himself.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{there is}} {{published}} {{research on the}} methods markers use in marking various types of assessment, there is relatively little information on the processes markers use in approaching a marking exercise. This qualitative paper describes the preparation and experiences of general practice (GP) teachers who undertake marking a written assessment in an undergraduate medical course. METHODS: Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} seven of the 16 GP tutors on an undergraduate course. The purposive sample comprised two new markers, two who had marked {{for a couple of years}} and three experienced markers. Each respondent was interviewed twice, once following a formative assessment of a written case study, and again after a summative assessment. All interviews were audio-taped and analysed for emerging themes. A respondent validation exercise was conducted with all 16 GP tutors. RESULTS: Markers had internal concerns about their ability to mark fairly and made considerable efforts to calibrate their marking. They needed guidance and coaching when marking for the first time and adopted a variety of marking styles, reaching a decision through a number of routes. Dealing with pass/fail borderline scripts and the consequences of the mark on the student were particular concerns. Even experienced <b>markers</b> <b>felt</b> the need to calibrate their marks both internally and externally CONCLUSION: Previous experience of marking appears to improve markers' confidence and is a factor in determining the role which markers adopt. Confidence can be improved by giving clear instructions, along with examples of marking. The authors propose that one method of providing this support and coaching could be by a process of peer review of a selection of papers prior to the main marking. New markers in particular would benefit from further guidance, however they are influenced by others early on in their marking career and course organisers should be mindful of this when arranging double marking...|$|R
