5|$|Aleister Crowley {{wrote in}} The Antecedents of Thelema, (1926), an {{incomplete}} work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set forth {{the law of}} Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described <b>in</b> <b>code</b> Crowley's life and the holy text that {{he claimed to have}} received, The Book of the Law. Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.|$|E
5|$|Alster was {{launched}} on 5 January 1928, and completed on 25 February 1928. She {{was built for}} Norddeutscher Lloyd. The Code Letters QMHG were allocated and her port of registry was Bremen. She served on routes between Germany and Australia and East Asia. Lloyds Register entries show that she held a passenger certificate from 1934–40. With the change <b>in</b> <b>Code</b> Letters in 1934, Alster was allocated DOEO as her callsign. She had a crew of 69 and could initially take 14 passengers. In 1930 the passenger capacity was increased to 16.|$|E

A highlight of Centaurs pre-war career was {{the rescue of}} the 385ton Japanese whale-chaser Kyo Maru II in November 1938. Kyo Maru II had developed boiler problems while returning from the Antarctic and was drifting towards the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, where she {{was in danger of}} being wrecked by the reefs in the area. Centaur responded to the distress signal and towed Kyo Maru II to Geraldton.|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} we have {{consider}} the interleaver design problem for small frame sizes. The effect of many trellis termination <b>in</b> <b>coding</b> scheme is observed {{by comparing the}} performance of the uniform interleaver type with and without termination scheme of coding. We also analyze the performance of different termination <b>in</b> <b>coding</b> schemes when used with an optimized interleaver type <b>in</b> turbo <b>coding.</b> 2 Performance Reference <b>in</b> <b>Coding</b> As <b>in</b> Chapter 8 we have considered ourselves to unpunctured rate of 1 / 3 symmetric Turbo codes with help of encoder memory ν = 2 and generator (1; 5 / 7). It is clear that we have chosen a very small block size τ = 64 to analyze the effect of termination <b>in</b> turbo <b>coding</b> where it should be most pronounced scheme. The effect of interleaver choice for Turbo codes with component code and block size are indicative of what can be expected with other good component codes and similarly small block sizes. We simulate the uniform interleaver with and without termination scheme <b>in</b> turbo <b>coding.</b> To terminate the uniform interleaver <b>in</b> <b>coding</b> we use the scheme proposed by the JPL team <b>in</b> <b>coding</b> scheme.

5|$|Following the women's suggestion, Emma {{searches}} for and finds Walt's journal containing {{all of his}} pumpkin growing secrets. She discovers that Walt documented all of his strategies <b>in</b> <b>code.</b> After Seth helps to translate {{a portion of the}} journal, he tries to partner with her, but she refuses believing she must grow the pumpkins by herself. Emma is unable to spread manure as she falls down while attempting to use the tiller. During a poker game Seth wins a bet which forces Emma to collaborate with him for the contest. While they work together, Seth participates in Emma's radio program. Bobby informs Seth about her reasons for joining the contest.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, two new phylogeny-aware tools appeared. One {{is called}} PAGAN that was {{developed}} by the same team as PRANK. The other is ProGraphMSA developed by Szalkowski. Both software packages were developed independently but share common features, notably the use of graph algorithms to improve the recognition of non-homologous regions, and an improvement <b>in</b> <b>code</b> making these software faster than PRANK.|$|E
5|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing <b>in</b> <b>Code</b> (2003), detects some {{similarities}} to The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin (1903). Both tales have touches of the pourquoi story in their explanations of why squirrels collect nuts, and both incorporate rhymes and riddles in their narratives. However, there is a crucial difference that diminishes the artistry of Timmy Tiptoes: the rhymes and riddles in Squirrel Nutkin shed light on Nutkin's character and create a guessing game for the reader while those in Timmy Tiptoes are bland devices that simply move the characters to reunions with their wives and the tale to its conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Of special note is that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer {{in a corner of}} the screen. In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit to Williams headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted <b>in</b> <b>code</b> fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse emulator in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is clearly visible.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of July 13, 1863, a brigade of 870 Union soldiers departed their base camp located a few miles upriver (east) of Charleston, West Virginia. Their orders, which came from General Eliakim P. Scammon, were to disable the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad. Telegraph line strung along the railroad line was also a target. If circumstances allowed, nearby lead and salt mines would also be objectives. Although the railroad, lead mine, and salt mine were obvious targets, communications sent by General Scammon were <b>in</b> <b>code.</b> Thus, exact details of the plan were known by few.|$|E
5|$|Randall left {{no doubt}} about his sympathies when he {{assigned}} members to the committee, stacking it with Hayes's enemies from both parties.

The Pelton telegrams were <b>in</b> <b>code,</b> which the committee was able to decode; Republicans had also sent ciphered dispatches, but the committee was unable to decode them. The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess.|$|E
