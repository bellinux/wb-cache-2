5|$|Hypokalemia, a {{deficiency}} of potassium in the plasma, {{can be fatal}} if severe. Common causes are increased gastrintestinal loss (vomiting, diarrhea), and increased renal loss (<b>diuresis).</b> Deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness, paralytic ileus, ECG abnormalities, decreased reflex response; and in severe cases, respiratory paralysis, alkalosis, and cardiac arrhythmia.|$|E
5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion <b>diuresis</b> compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
5|$|Potassium {{levels can}} {{fluctuate}} severely during {{the treatment of}} DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A {{large part of the}} shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic <b>diuresis.</b> Hypokalemia (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the heart rate. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.|$|E
25|$|Postobstructive <b>diuresis,</b> {{diuretic}} {{phase of}} acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and kidney transplant.|$|E
25|$|Newly {{emerging}} evidence {{showed that}} glucocorticoids {{could be used in}} the treatment of decompensated heart failure to potentiate renal responsiveness to diuretics, especially in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large dose of loop diuretics. Glucocorticoids induce a potent <b>diuresis</b> in heart failure because they could improve renal responsiveness to atrial natriuretic peptide by upregulating natriuretic peptide receptor A NPR-A expression in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, inducing a potent <b>diuresis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aspirin {{and other}} nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs {{have been found}} to attenuate the <b>diuresis</b> and natriuresis induced by spironolactone therapy but not to affect its antihypertensive effect.|$|E
25|$|Furosemide acts within 1hour of oral {{administration}} (after IV peak effect within 30minutes); <b>diuresis</b> is complete within 6hours (for {{oral administration}}) and 2hours (for IV administration).|$|E
25|$|Treatments for {{primidone}} overdose {{have included}} hemoperfusion with forced <b>diuresis,</b> {{a combination of}} bemegride and amiphenazole; and a combination of bemegride, spironolactone, caffeine, pentylenetetrazol, strophanthin, penicillin and streptomycin.|$|E
25|$|In chronic kidney {{diseases}} with hypoalbuminemia, {{it is used}} {{along with}} albumin to increase <b>diuresis.</b> It is also used along with albumin in nephrotic syndrome to reduce edema.|$|E
25|$|<b>Diuresis</b> (production {{of urine}} by the kidney) occurs constantly, {{and as the}} bladder becomes full, afferent firing increases, yet the {{micturition}} reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until {{it is appropriate to}} begin voiding.|$|E
25|$|Monitoring diuresis: <b>Diuresis</b> can be {{monitored}} by weighing the patient daily. The goal is weight loss {{of no more}} than 1.0nbsp&kg/day for patients with both ascites and peripheral edema and no more than 0.5nbsp&kg/day for patients with ascites alone.|$|E
25|$|Cortisol {{acts as a}} diuretic, {{increasing}} water <b>diuresis,</b> glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma {{flow from}} the kidneys, as well as increasing sodium retention and potassium excretion. It also increases sodium and water absorption and potassium excretion in the intestines.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids {{could act}} centrally, {{as well as}} peripherally, {{to assist in the}} {{normalization}} of extracellular fluid volume by regulating body’s action to atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Centrally, glucocorticoids could inhibit dehydration induced water intake; peripherally, glucocorticoids could induce a potent <b>diuresis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some {{situations}} {{elimination of the}} poison can be enhanced using <b>diuresis,</b> hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, hyperbaric medicine, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusion or chelation. However, this may actually worsen the poisoning in some cases, so it should always be verified based on what substances are involved.|$|E
25|$|Nesiritide, a {{recombinant}} form of B-natriuretic peptide, {{is indicated}} {{for use in}} patients with acute decompensated heart failure who have dyspnea at rest. Nesiritide promotes <b>diuresis</b> and natriuresis, thereby ameliorating volume overload. It is thought that, while BNP is elevated in heart failure, the peptide that is produced is actually dysfunctional or non-functional and thereby ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, salvinorin A shows {{atypical}} properties as an agonist of the KOR {{relative to}} other KOR agonists. For instance, it is 40-fold less potent in promoting internalization (that is, receptor downregulation) of the human KOR relative to the prototypical KOR agonist U-50488.The drug has been found not to produce <b>diuresis</b> in mice, possibly due to its short duration.|$|E
25|$|The {{action on}} the distal tubules is {{independent}} of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, free water clearance. Because of the large NaCl absorptive capacity of the loop of Henle, <b>diuresis</b> is not limited by development of acidosis, {{as it is with}} the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{specific}} antidote for trazodone. Management of overdosage should, therefore, be symptomatic and supportive. Any person {{suspected of having}} taken an overdosage should be evaluated at a hospital as soon as possible. Activated charcoal, and forced <b>diuresis</b> {{may be useful in}} facilitating elimination of the drug, gastric lavage has been shown to not be useful unless done during the first hour after intake.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>diuresis</b> involves the proximal tubule of the kidney. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is found here, allowing the reabsorption of bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. By inhibiting this enzyme, these ions are excreted, along with excess water, lowering blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and intraocular pressure. By excreting bicarbonate, the blood becomes acidic, causing compensatory hyperventilation with deep respiration (Kussmaul respiration), increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels {{of carbon dioxide}} in the blood.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{specific}} antidote for venlafaxine, and management is generally supportive, providing {{treatment for the}} immediate symptoms. Administration of activated charcoal can prevent absorption of the drug. Monitoring of cardiac rhythm and vital signs is indicated. Seizures are managed with benzodiazepines or other anticonvulsants. Forced <b>diuresis,</b> hemodialysis, exchange transfusion, or hemoperfusion {{are unlikely to be}} of benefit in hastening the removal of venlafaxine, due to the drug's high volume of distribution.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol has a {{dehydrating}} {{effect by}} causing increased urine production (<b>diuresis),</b> which could cause thirst, dry mouth, dizziness and {{may lead to}} an electrolyte imbalance. Studies suggest that electrolyte changes play only a minor role in {{the genesis of the}} alcohol hangover and are caused by dehydration effects. Drinking water may help relieve symptoms as a result of dehydration but it is unlikely that rehydration significantly reduces the presence and severity of alcohol hangover.|$|E
25|$|Hypertonic Saline with σ=1 {{has been}} of {{interest}} since early 1980s. Hypertonic Saline which contains sodium chloride works in regulating ICP, intravascular volume and cardiac output without causing significant <b>diuresis,</b> but there are theoretical side effects ranging from neurological complications to subdural hematoma. Hypertonic saline solution has been choice of neuro critical care {{for the past few}} years. Hypertonic Saline solution used varies and could be 3%, 7.5%, 10%, or 24.3% saline solution. When Hypertonic Solution is administered, the dosage is 2 g/kg.|$|E
25|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water has effects on the circulation, renal system and fluid balance, and breathing, which are caused by the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water providing support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion <b>diuresis</b> compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body due to head out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
25|$|Mannitol is {{an alcohol}} {{derivative}} of simple sugar mannose, {{and its use}} has been investigated since 1962. With a σ=.9, molecular weight of 182 daltons, half life of 2–4 hours, ease of preparation, chemical stability and free radical scavenging properties, it's been regarded as the principal osmotic agent for clinical use. However, it could cause <b>diuresis,</b> renal failure, hyperkalemia and hemolysis. If mannitol is administered, the dosage used is mannitol 20% solution of 1-1.5 g/kg, followed by 0.25-1 g/kg doses as needed every 1 to 6 hours depending on the ICP.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{observation}} and supportive care are {{the mainstay of}} treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Although benzodiazepines are absorbed by activated charcoal, gastric decontamination with activated charcoal is not beneficial in pure benzodiazepine overdose as the risk of adverse effects would outweigh any potential benefit from the procedure. It is recommended only if benzodiazepines have been taken {{in combination with other}} drugs that may benefit from decontamination. Gastric lavage (stomach pumping) or whole bowel irrigation are also not recommended. Enhancing elimination of the drug with hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, or forced <b>diuresis</b> is unlikely to be beneficial as these procedures have little effect on the clearance of benzodiazepines due to their large volume of distribution and lipid solubility.|$|E
25|$|Doses of {{caffeine}} {{equivalent to the}} amount normally found in standard servings of tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks appear to have no diuretic action. However, acute ingestion {{of caffeine}} in large doses (at least 250–300mg, equivalent to the amount found in 2–3 cups of coffee or 5–8 cups of tea) results in a short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals who have been deprived of caffeine {{for a period of}} days or weeks. This increase is due to both a <b>diuresis</b> (increase in water excretion) and a natriuresis (increase in saline excretion); it is mediated via proximal tubular adenosine receptor blockade. The acute increase in urinary output may increase the risk of dehydration. However, chronic users of caffeine develop a tolerance to this effect, and experience no increase in urinary output.|$|E
25|$|Metolazone {{may also}} be used in renal (kidney) disease, such as chronic renal failure or the {{nephrotic}} syndrome. Chronic renal failure causes excess fluid retention that is often treated with diet adjustments and diuretics. Metolazone may be combined with other diuretics (typically loop diuretics) to treat diuretic resistance in CHF, chronic renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome. Metolazone and a loop diuretic will synergistically enhance <b>diuresis</b> {{over the use of}} either agent alone. Using this combination, diuretic effects will occur at two different segments of the nephron; namely, the loop diuretic will act at the loop of Henle, and metolazone will act at the distal convoluted tubule. Metolazone is frequently prescribed in addition to the loop diuretic. Metolazone may be used for edema caused by liver cirrhosis as well.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{inhibits}} {{the effects}} of mineralocorticoids, namely, aldosterone, by displacing them from MR in the cortical collecting duct of renal nephrons. This decreases the reabsorption of sodium and water while limiting the excretion of potassium (A K+ sparing diuretic). The drug has a slightly delayed onset of action, and so it takes several days for <b>diuresis</b> to occur. This is because the MR is a nuclear receptor which works through regulating gene transcription and gene expression, in this case, to decrease the production and expression of ENaC and ROMK electrolyte channels in the distal nephrons. In addition to direct antagonism of the MRs, the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone may also in part be mediated by direct inactivation of steroid 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase (18-hydroxylase), enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of mineralocorticoids. If levels of mineralocorticoids are decreased then there are lower circulating levels to compete with spironolactone to influence gene expression as mentioned above. The onset of action of the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone is relatively slow, with the peak effect sometimes occurring 48 hours or more after the first dose.|$|E
25|$|Distillation removes all {{minerals}} from water, and {{the membrane}} methods of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most to all minerals. This results in demineralized water {{which is not}} considered ideal drinking water. The World Health Organization has investigated {{the health effects of}} demineralized water since 1980. Experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased <b>diuresis</b> and the elimination of electrolytes, with decreased blood serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium, and other minerals in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Demineralized water may also increase the risk from toxic metals because it more readily leaches materials from piping like lead and cadmium, which is prevented by dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Low-mineral water has been implicated in specific cases of lead poisoning in infants, when lead from pipes leached at especially high rates into the water. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10mg/L with 20–30mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20mg/L minimum and a 40–80mg/L optimum, and a total water hardness (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2 to 4mmol/L. At water hardness above 5mmol/L, higher incidence of gallstones, kidney stones, urinary stones, arthrosis, and arthropathies have been observed. Additionally, desalination processes can increase the risk of bacterial contamination.|$|E
500|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} arises {{because of}} a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen via glycogenolysis and [...] also through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process known as osmotic <b>diuresis.</b> This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (lipolysis), which are converted through a process called beta oxidation, again in the liver, into ketone bodies (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate). β-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pKa and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower the blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration.|$|E
2500|$|Impaired sodium {{reabsorption}} increases <b>diuresis</b> {{by three}} mechanisms: ...|$|E
2500|$|Severe {{hyponatremia}} {{or severe}} symptoms (confusion, convulsions, or coma): consider hypertonic saline (3%) 1–2 ml/kg IV in 3–4 h. Hypertonic saline may [...] {{lead to a}} rapid dilute <b>diuresis</b> and fall in the serum sodium. It {{should not be used}} in those with an expanded extracellular fluid volume.|$|E
2500|$|Desmopressin will be {{ineffective}} in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing {{the underlying cause}} (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) or indomethacin {{can be used to}} create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme <b>diuresis</b> with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing <b>diuresis.</b> [...] This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. [...] Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{also used}} to treat {{congestive}} heart failure in cats and dogs (which experience fluid on the lungs) and complications from heartworm. [...] It can be used in conjunction with an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory to treat this condition. [...] It can also be used in an attempt to promote <b>diuresis</b> in anuric or oliguric acute renal failure.|$|E
2500|$|Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) {{is a major}} concern. The dose {{is reduced}} when the patient's {{creatinine}} clearance (a measure of renal function) is reduced. Adequate hydration and <b>diuresis</b> is used to prevent renal damage. The nephrotoxicity of platinum-class drugs seems {{to be related to}} reactive oxygen species and in animal models can be ameliorated by free radical scavenging agents (e.g., amifostine). Nephrotoxicity is a dose-limiting side effect.|$|E
2500|$|Furosemide is {{primarily}} used [...] {{for the treatment}} of hypertension and edema. It is the first-line agent in most people with edema caused by congestive heart failure. [...] It is also used for liver cirrhosis, kidney impairment, nephrotic syndrome, in adjunct therapy for swelling of the brain or lungs where rapid <b>diuresis</b> is required (IV injection), and in the management of severe hypercalcemia in combination with adequate rehydration.|$|E
