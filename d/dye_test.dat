2500|$|The {{children}} {{returned to}} Jackson's Neverland ranch {{and a day}} later their mother joined them after resuming preparations {{for the trip to}} Brazil—although, she would later testify, she did not really want to go. From February 25 to March 2 the family, along with some of Jackson's staff, stayed in a hotel in Calabasas, California, and went shopping in preparation for the trip to Brazil. After that, the family stayed at Neverland again. On March 10, the mother and the accuser drove from Neverland to Kaiser Permanente Hospital with a urine sample of the accuser, Gavin, for a scheduled medical check-up. On the way to the hospital, Janet spilled the urine sample on the passenger-side floor of the car. [...] When asked by a Jackson employee what happened, Janet said that she spilled the urine accidentally. [...] At the hospital, Gavin received numerous tests for his kidney, including a <b>dye</b> <b>test.</b> [...] The urine sample, however, was insufficient for one of the tests, and it came back inconclusive. Afterward, the accuser returned to Neverland, while the mother went to stay with her fiance. It would be the boys' last stay at the Neverland ranch. Apparently, the accuser was very angry with his mother that she would not allow him to return.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{whether there is a}} 'best' technique for delivering drugs to the middle meatus. DESIGN: Single-blind cross-over study in healthy individuals using endoscopic video-imaging. PARTICIPANTS: A <b>dyed</b> <b>test</b> formulation was administered intranasally on seven non-sequential days to ten healthy individuals with no 'nasal' history. The participants were recruited through advertisement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of seven different techniques, 20 nostrils and 140 endoscopic videos for the deposition patterns of <b>dyed</b> <b>test</b> formulation. Analysis was possible in 90 % of all endoscopic videos. Three head positions were tested for both nasal drops and nasal sprays. RESULTS: Deposition of <b>dyed</b> <b>test</b> formulation near the middle meatus was observed in 43 % of all observations. No significant differences were observed in terms of delivery between any of the seven techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests there may not be a single 'best' technique for topical nasal drug delivery. A more individual approach to topical nasal drug treatment, taking anatomy and head position into account would seem to be more appropriat...|$|R

40|$|Comparative {{assessment}} of the toxicological effects of two azo dyes [Reactive Orange 16 (R 016); Congo Red (CR) ] and two anthraquinone dyes [Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR); Disperse Blue 3 (DB 3) ] was performed on two in vitro cell models, the ciliate protozoa Tetrahymena pyriformis and the microalga Selenastrum capricornutum. Growth impairment, viability assay using calcein AM and ethidium homodimer- 1 (CAM/EthD- 1 assay), grazing and morphometric assay were the tests performed on T pyriformis using 48 h-tests. They represented simple and fast bioassays providing overall information on the morphological and physiological state of the cells exposed to different <b>dyes.</b> The algal <b>test</b> measured growth inhibition after a 96 -h exposure.

For this test, the patient takes oral phenazopyridine (Pyridium) 200 mg three times a day, and indigo carmine or methylene blue is filled into the empty urinary bladder via a urethral catheter. Pyridium turns urine orange in the kidneys, and methylene blue (or indigo carmine) turns urine blue in the bladder.|$|E

5000|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{capability of}} the PAMG-1 protein has originally been used by an immunoassay that employs a series of monoclonal antibodies (MABs) to the PAMG-1 protein. This immunoassay detects the presence of PAMG-1 in the cervico-vaginal discharge of pregnant woman and {{has been shown to}} detect rupture of membranes with approximately 99% accuracy. In 2014, an unprecedented study involving 140 patients was published that compared this device to a seldom-used, invasive gold standard for diagnosing rupture of membranes called the indigo carmine test. The results of this study showed a 99% correlation between the two tests and led the investigators to propose the use of the noninvasive PAMG-1 test in situations where the use of the invasive <b>dye</b> <b>test</b> is not practical.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the influence of individual anatomical differences on intranasal drug deposition. The data of a comparison of seven different administration techniques in ten healthy volunteers was used in this single-blind crossover pilot study. After intranasal administration of a <b>dyed</b> <b>test</b> formulation, endoscopic video imaging was done on seven non-sequential days. The deposition pattern per individual around the head of the middle turbinate was analyzed for each technique and correlated with the individual anatomy. Decreased deposition of <b>dyed</b> <b>test</b> formulation in the target area around the head of the middle turbinate was observed in the presence of minor septal deviations, narrow nasal valve areas, or inferior turbinate hypertrophy; a lateral head position helps to bypass a minor septal deviation.

The results support previous findings that the <b>dye</b> <b>test,</b> indirect haemagglutination test, and latex agglutination test measure different antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii. In early glandular toxoplasmosis, when specific IgM was detected, the titres of both the latex agglutination test and the indirect haemagglutination test were lower than the <b>dye</b> <b>test.</b> Repeat specimens from 11 of the patients showed four {{cases in which the}} latex agglutination test titres never exceeded 1 / 256, whereas both the <b>dye</b> <b>test</b> and the indirect haemagglutination test showed significant titres and specific IgM was detected in every case. We conclude that the latex agglutination test should not be used as a substitute for the <b>dye</b> <b>test</b> in the serological diagnosis of glandular toxoplasmosis.

40|$|Each of {{thirteen}} lots of Cheddar cheese {{was made from}} 430 lb. of milk, and the protein recovered in the cheese and whey was compared with that in the original milk. Protein determinations on the milk, cheese and whey were made by an acid orange 12 <b>dye</b> binding <b>test,</b> and by Kjeldahl analysis. Similarly fat recovery was determined by using the Babcock fat test on milk, the modified Babcock test on cheese, and the Mojonnier test on whey.

40|$|The <b>dye</b> <b>test</b> for the {{detection}} of Toxoplasma-specific antibodies was first described by Sabin and Feldman 50 years ago. The test is highly specific and sensitive and considerable information is available on the development and persistence of <b>dye</b> <b>test</b> antibodies after primary Toxoplasma infection. However, the test uses live Toxoplasma gondii and is now only employed in a few laboratories. It is still the reference method for the serodiagnosis of toxoplasmosis, and a multicentre study comparing <b>dye</b> <b>test</b> results between different laboratories was much needed. We report in this article the results of a multicentre evaluation of the test involving nineteen laboratories in eight countries. The study revealed overall satisfactory standardization between the laboratories, but there were differences in the test protocols, the use of reference/standard preparations and the interpretation of results. There is still no agreement on the level of <b>dye</b> <b>test</b> values which reflect infection with the parasite, and conversion from titres to international units (IUs) did not improve standardization. However, the results indicated that a value of > 4 IU or a titre of 1 : 16 met the definition of positivity of most participants.
