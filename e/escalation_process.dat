5000|$|Researchers {{have also}} {{developed}} an argument regarding how escalation of commitment is observed {{in two different}} categories. Many researchers believe that the need to escalate resources is linked to expectancy theory. [...] "According to such a viewpoint, decision makers assess the probability that additional resource allocations will lead to goal attainment, {{as well as the}} value of goal attainment (i.e., rewards minus costs), and thereby generate a subjective expected utility associated with the decision to allocate additional resources." [...] The next phase of the <b>escalation</b> <b>process</b> is self-justification and rationalizing if the decision the leader made used resources well, if the resources being used were used to make positive change, and assuring themselves that the decision they chose was right. Leaders must balance costs and benefits of any problem to produce a final decision. What matters most often in assuring the leader that they made the right choice regardless of the final outcome is if their decision is what others believed in.|$|E
50|$|Taking {{place on}} October 25, 2000, between cases 35 and 36, the Timerangers confront the Londers {{criminal}} Boribaru, who somehow resists the <b>Escalation</b> <b>process</b> once {{hit by the}} Voltech Bazooka and runs off. This infuriates Matoi Tatsumi who, with his siblings, {{are dealing with the}} fire Boribaru caused to call the Timerangers out, and he criticizes the Timerangers for lacking any spirit. Later, unaware of their civilian identities, the Tatsumi Siblings arrive at Tomorrow Research to get help in finding their father, who mysteriously disappeared, along with their V Braces. When Tac alerts them to a Londers attack, the Timerangers confront relatives of the Londers prisoners they defeated with the Tatsumi siblings watching them transform from afar. By then, it is revealed that the Londer prisoners' new-found invincibility is the work of Spell Master Pierre, the surviving servant of the Psyma family. However, just as Pierre is about to get his revenge, Mondo comes to his children's aid and gives them their V Braces to help the Timerangers. The two Sentai teams fight the prisoners until Pierre makes Boribaru powerful enough to create a time/space distortion that sucks all combatants into pocket dimensions. While others fight for their lives against the prisoners with their transformation devices disabled, Pierre tries to stop Mondo from getting the Sentai teams back until TimeFire intervenes. Having Naoto call in V Rex, who scares Pierre away, Tac links himself to its Chrono Unit while having Naoto order his robot to create a time hole for the teams to assume their Sentai forms and defeat the prisoners, while returning to their time. With Time Fire joining in, the TimeRangers and GoGo V teams manage to freeze the Londers relatives. However, left behind by Don Dolnero and his group, Pierre is forced to use a Saima Fusion spell with Boribaru to become Pierre Bori, who overpowers Shadow Alpha, reverting it to Time Robo Alpha. But in a gambit that could tear apart the fabric of time, Mondo takes advantage to Time Robo's hammer time space to call MaxLiner and GoLiner from 1999 so the GoGoFive can form Victory Robo. With Victory Robo transferring the energies of its Victory Prominence to Time Robo, it assumes Riding Time Robo Formation to V Rex to execute Pressure Prominence to both destroy Pierre and arrest Boribaru. Soon after, as the GoGoFive mecha return to 1999, the two sentai teams part on good terms.|$|E

40|$|Two {{extremes}} of forest conflict exist: low- and high-intensity conflicts. Theoretical debate on how forest conflict escalates from one extreme {{to the other}} has begun to take place; however, empirical research is lacking. Our paper aims to explore the conflict <b>escalation</b> <b>process</b> using a case study approach. We explored whether two theoretical building blocks of conflict escalation (stages and patterns) can be evaluated at the field level. We conducted fieldwork in Baru Pelepat village, Sumatra, to investigate a conflict between a logging company and a local community. We performed interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders. The conflict revolved around an unclear boundary between a state forest, within which the logging company operated, and the communal forest, which led to local community opposition to logging activity. The conflict escalated over time as parties failed to find a solution. We describe escalation stages associated with the conflict and also the pattern of conflict escalation. The findings suggest that theoretical frameworks of conflict escalation are applicable at field level. A number of practical options for managing the conflict and the implications for wider forest management are discussed. While understanding the conflict <b>escalation</b> <b>process</b> does not necessarily guarantee effective settlement of a conflict, it nonetheless helps to strategically devise conflict management efforts...|$|E

40|$|In a {{study of}} {{conflict}} in organizations, Lindenberg's relational signaling theory is used to develop hypotheses {{on the impact of}} relationship strength, network embeddedness, and organizational change on social escalation. Social escalation is defined as the involvement of one or more third parties in a conflict. An empirical test is conducted with data on 67 conflicts involving 22 managers, gathered during three years of ethnographic fieldwork and a longitudinal network study in a management team of a German paper factory. Multilevel analysis indicates that strong ties between conflicting parties decrease the level of social escalation, whereas informal power advantage of one party increases the chances for social escalation. Both effects disappear over time. It is argued that the dissolving impact of relationships and networks is due to the disappearance of so-called solidarity frame-stabilizing activities in the firm.

An inductive content analysis revealed two important issues: the dynamics of intergenerational conflicts and the <b>escalation</b> <b>process</b> of conflicts. The results demonstrated that conflicts {{are more likely to}} be intergenerational than intra-generational due to the role of senior members in daily business operations, generational differences, and a perception gap that exist between generations concerning each other’s competencies in doing the business. Furthermore, the set of factors contributing to conflict escalation is related to how family members handle the conflict, how they manage their emotions, and how they are able to avoid non-family employee involvement. These findings provide a foundation for taking preventative actions, implementing strategies for managing conflicts or devising effective solutions for resolving conflicts before they become more destructive. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{companies}} have been confronted with {{a new type of}} negative consumer behavior: consumers who have turned hostile and who are strongly determined to cause damage to the brand. Empowered by new technological possibilities, an individual consumer can now wreak havoc on a brand with relatively little effort. In reflection of this new phenomenon, the authors introduce the concept of consumer brand sabotage (CBS). On the basis of different underlying motives, a conceptual framework distinguishes CBS (a form of hostile aggression: harming the brand as dominant motive) from other forms of negative consumer behavior, such as customer retaliation and negative word of mouth (instrumental aggression: harming a brand is only a means to achieve other objectives, e. g., restoring equity). This framework adapts insights from aggression and appraisal theories as well as qualitative interviews with actual saboteurs to a consumer-brand relationship context in order to develop an improved theoretical understanding of the under-researched phenomenon of CBS. The authors analyze the mental <b>escalation</b> <b>processes</b> of individual consumers toward CBS and develop a road map for future research...|$|R

To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} capacity alert calls in reducing acute hospital overcrowding through addressing rising occupancy, high patient throughput and increased access block. Methods. Retrospective analysis of 24 months of in-patient, emergency department, and capacity alert call log data from a largemetropolitan public hospital inAustralia. The analysis explored statistical differences in patientflowparameters between capacity alert call days and other days including a control case set of days with statistically similar levels of occupancy. Results. The study identified a significant (P < 0. 05) reduction in occupancy, patient throughput and access block on capacity alert call days. Capacity alert call days reversed rising occupancy trends, with 6 out of 7 flow parameters reporting significant improvement (P < 0. 05) over the 48 h following the call. Only 3 of these 7 flow parameters were significantly improved 48 h after control case days, confirming value in the alertmechanism and that the results are not a regression toward the mean phenomenon.

40|$|Study objective: Escalation {{policies}} {{are used by}} emergency departments when responding {{to an increase in}} demand (e. g., a sudden inflow of patients) or a reduction in capacity (e. g., a lack of beds to admit patients). The policies aim to maintain the ability to deliver patient care, without compromising safety, by modifying ‘normal’ processes. The study objective was to examine escalation policies in theory and practice. Methods: This was a mixed-method study, involving: i) a conceptual analysis of NHS escalation policies (n= 12) and associated escalation actions (n= 92); and ii) a detailed ethnographic study of escalation in situ over an eighteen-month period in a large UK emergency department (n= 30 observations). Results: The conceptual analysis of NHS escalation policies found that their use requires the ability to: i) dynamically reconfigure resources (staff and equipment); ii) change workflow; and iii) relocate patients. In practice it was discovered that when the emergency department is under pressure, these prerequisites cannot always be attained. Instead, <b>escalation</b> <b>processes</b> were adapted to manage pressures informally. This adaptive need (‘work as done’) was found to be incompletely specified in policies (‘work as imagined’).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} and empirical investigation of the <b>escalation</b> <b>process</b> that results when states are in dispute over some issue(s) in the international system. Escalation {{is viewed as a}} cost-imposing bargaining strategy enacted by states for the purpose of eliciting concessions from the adversary. Each state has a cost tolerance which identifies the maximum costs a state is willing to suffer to achieve their demand on the issue at stake. A player determines the likelihood that escalation will produce the adversary's concession by comparing the cost tolerances of both players. Once a player decides that the opponent has a greater willingness to bear the costs of escalation, that player concedes and quits the escalation game. A formal theory of the <b>escalation</b> <b>process</b> is developed which produces several hypotheses identifying the conditions under which states are expected to escalate in conflict and, once the decision to escalate is made, the level of escalation that that state is likely to achieve. One advantage in developing a general theory of escalation is that the interrelationships among the variables are expected to hold across a wide variety of escalation contexts. These hypotheses are then tested empirically in order to assess the utility of the general theory of escalation. In one of these contexts, the extended deterrence crisis, potential attackers are expected to refrain from pursuing higher levels of escalation when the attacker can perceive the value that the defender attaches to its ally and when the defender has the capacity to impose serious escalation costs on its opponent. Another of the hypotheses tested produced the expectation that lower cost tolerant actors were more likely to achieve their highest level of escalation on their first move in the conflict given that they were unable to prevail in a long, drawn-out game of escalation with their stronger opponent. The results of the empirical tests indicate that the general theory of escalation developed in the thesis is useful in identifying the conditions that motivate states to escalate, the level of escalation that is likely to be achieved and the conditions under which states concede...|$|E
40|$|Through a {{secondary}} data {{analysis of a}} nationally representative Pew survey [35 - 36], we empirically test the validity of two contrasting theoretical models of adolescent information privacy behaviors. Our results suggest that in seeking to understand the underlying processes of teens’ privacy risk-taking and risk-coping behaviors within social media, a “risk-centric ” framework may be more useful than a traditional “concern-centric ” framework that emphasizes privacy antecedents and outcomes. Our newly proposed and validated “risk-centric ” framework implies a possible risk <b>escalation</b> <b>process</b> wherein teens make online disclosures and render themselves more susceptible to experiences of risky online interactions; in turn, these risky experiences are associated {{with higher levels of}} teen privacy concern. Higher levels of teen privacy concern predict both advice-seeking and remedy/corrective risk-coping behaviors.

There were two conflict escalation periods, in May and September 2005 about the conference. Such conflict escalation periods strengthen the parties’ own understanding of the issue and context of conflict; thus, further demarcates the adversaries by increasing the number of issues and parties to the conflict. The purpose of this endeavor is to question a possible link between the media rhetoric and newspapers’ ideological positioning in Turkey in a conflict escalation period and to identify whether the media rhetoric in the Armenian conference was escalation-oriented or de-escalation oriented. The main aim for such an exploration is to emphasize the role of media in conflict <b>escalation</b> <b>processes</b> and the need to develop a constructive conflict environment with conflict analysis and resolution perspective in Turkey. The results of the research suggest that in both escalation periods, escalation-oriented rhetoric was used more by the media. Moreover, it was found that there is a link between the media rhetoric and newspapers’ ideological positioning. Consequently, in Turkey more attention should be paid to the roles of media in conflict situation and most importantly new constructive media policies should be developed by considering the other structural factors that create such a media environment...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a theory of}} federal agency reorganization covering a large per-centage of reorganization cases occurring from 1934 through 1976. The theory views federal agency reorganization as closely related to de novo agency creation. Agency reorganization and creation are often the last two steps in an <b>escalation</b> <b>process</b> through which society deals with problems generated by large scale discontinuous socioeconomic-technological changes called novelties. Escalation {{is part of a}} more comprehensive process called conceptualization in which interest groups and govern-ment officials seek to understand a novelty’s implications, to modify the novelty to fit socioeonomic-political systems, and to modify socioeconomic-political systems to fit the novelty. If an agency is created before conceptualization has ended, it is very likely that it will be reorganized repeatedly until conceptualization is complete. Thus two modes of agency reorganization are identified: reorganization of existing agencies as part of the escalation response to a novelty, and instability caused by agency creation prior to the end of conceptualization. Federal executive reorganization is a recurrent theme in academic writing on government and a never-ending source (or symptom) of conflict in government itself.
