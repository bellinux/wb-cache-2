40|$|When {{a client}} asks whether {{her or his}} {{depression}} {{is caused by a}} chemical imbalance, how do you respond? Depression is regularly depicted in popular media as resulting from a “chemical imbalance ” and this depiction raises a number of interesting questions for practicing clinicians. How accurate is the chemical imbalance explanation for depression? How widely do laypersons agree with the explanation, and how do they interpret the explanation? We discuss the origins, accuracy, and transmittal (e. g., via direct-to-consumer advertising) of the chemical imbalance explanation for depression. We next present results from a <b>group</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> examining lay endorsement and interpretation of the explanation.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we provide a {{foundation}} {{for a new generation}} of services and tools. We define new ways of capturing, sharing and reusing information and intelligence provided by single users and communities, as well as organizations by enabling the extraction, generation, interpretation and management of Collective Intelligence from user generated digital multimedia content. Different layers of intelligence are generated, which together constitute the notion of Collective Intelligence. The automatic generation of Collective Intelligence constitutes a departure from traditional methods for information sharing, since information from both the multimedia content and social aspects will be merged, while at the same time the social dynamics will be taken into account. In the context of this work, we present two case studies: an Emergency Response and a Consumers Social <b>Group</b> <b>case</b> <b>study...</b>|$|E

40|$|In this {{specialist}} work I {{explored the}} effects of integrative group dance-movement and music therapy methods on improvement of mental health of {{children with special needs}} in post war environment. The research was accomplished along with the international volunteer humanitarian project of Arts Therapies in Sarajevo. The main goal of research was to establish how dance-movement and music therapy methods can stimulate verbal and non-verbal communication, creativity, self-expression and increase of social interaction. One of objectives was also to reduce consequences of traumatic experiences from war and to raise quality of life of children with mental disorders in post-war environment. For this purpose I used Arts which was always used for establishment of safe and trusting relation. Arts was also used for soothing, relaxation, improvement of concentration, development of higher self esteem and establishment of better physical and psychical health. Theoretical part starts with introduction of Arts Therapies and its characteristics. Creativity, intelligence and communication are described in more details along with dance and movement. Goals of dance-movement and music therapy are presented and possible use is discussed at description of people with special needs. Theoretical part ends with description of Humanitarian project „Sarajevo 2008 “ with definition of traumatic experience and post-traumatic stress syndrome. For research work I have selected the method of <b>group</b> <b>case</b> <b>study.</b> I studied eight children aged 4, 5 to 9, 5 years who were included in the program of daily center for children with special needs in Sarajevo. Therapeutic sessions were conducted in the daily center together with assistance of student of music therapy program from Denmark. The action plan included dance-movement and music therapeutic methods and techniques of group work. Although the program was prepared in advance it enabled flexibility, spontaneousness and adaptation to the needs of children. Method of <b>group</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> on post war Sarajevo area was designed and implied with the purpose of improving psychophysical health of children with special needs. The results of the study showed that methods of dance-movement therapy in connection with methods of arts therapy contribute to better verbal and body communication.

In addition, this paper also investigated some research processes of current professional and academic practices. Of particu-lar interest was the conversion of the group’s and the individual’s tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge within the organizational domains, personal domains, or both. This paper brings out inner dialogues and open discourse responses in one-on-one interviews within a phenomenologi-cal, reflective practitioner methodology, in order to explain the increased interest in this method-ology within the nature of Critical Institutional Research. One area of controversy between Criti-cal Institutional Professional Research and the traditional Institutional Professional Research is the role of “reflective practice, ” which remains under-developed. This paper explores the impor-tance of reflective practice employing the term “living thesis paradigm ” as a means of developing expert research methods. Finally the conclusions aim to help the individual practitioner develop skills of reflective practice and to help organizational members develop communities of inquiry, as well as to contribute to wider understanding of the place of inquiry in the development of pro-fessional practice...|$|E
40|$|This article explores children's imaginative {{interaction}} with Internet {{games in the}} belief that an understanding of children's life experiences is essential to effective teaching and learning within the classroom. It is underpinned by the idea that imaginative play is, at least in some part, the work of children undertaking identity practice. It focuses on a small <b>group</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> of 8 - and 9 -year-old children, from diverse cultural backgrounds, who were regular players on free-access commercial Internet games. As children frequently perform imaginative narrative play both privately and in groups triggered from experiences with novels, films and television, the research initially focused on whether similar activities resulted from experiences with commercially sponsored free Internet game sites. If so, to what extent might these texts also influence children's creative output? To explore this, the children attended a weekly after-school computer club during which they played on Internet games. During the course of the club sessions, each child was observed and interviewed about the experiences they had resulting from the gameplay. Through consideration of the children's play and opinions, the teacher researcher developed valuable insights into her students and their worlds to the benefit of her practice.

40|$|Introduction: Past {{research}} has indicated that teaching baby sign language to infants can be stressful for parents. Thus, a previous study to test this assertion was conducted. A baby sign workshop was conducted and consisted of teaching the parents approximately 200 signs and information on implementation. Results indicated that parents did not report stress as a result of using baby sign with their children. The current case study administered {{a modified version of the}} baby sign workshop survey one year post hoc. Purpose: To observe continued use of baby sign, as well as parental perception of the impact of baby sign on parental stress and/or parent-child interaction. Methods: Participants of a single <b>group</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> completed a qualitative follow-up survey and participated in a brief interview. Results: The results indicate that the majority of the families continued to use baby sign after the workshop until their children began using spoken communication to a greater extent. Parent-reported responses have remained consistent from the previous study, indicating parents did not report stress as a result of using baby sign with their children. Additionally, parents reported positive impacts of baby sign on child development and parent-child interaction. Conclusions: Continued use of baby sign with infants and young children does not produce stress in parents. Some limitations and a discussion for future research are presented. ...|$|E
