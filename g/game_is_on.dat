5|$|The arcade game {{features}} {{raster graphics}} on a CRT monitor displaying 4096 colors and amplified stereophonic sound. The visuals are reflected into view via a {{mirror in the}} cabinet. The arcade cabinet is upright, with the marquee bearing the game's name protruding outward. There are large, blue plastic molds around the cabinet designed to resemble an alien cocoon. The music for Space Gun was composed by Norihiro Furukawa and Naoto Yagishita of Zuntata, Taito's music division. A soundtrack CD (a split release with the soundtrack for Taito game Liquid Kids) was released by Pony Canyon and Scitron on January 21, 1991. This album was also released as part of Taito 1500 Collector's Box on September 17, 1993.

25|$|Although {{the only}} way to move in the <b>game</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> foot, once Roll Caskett repairs a support car, she is able to {{directly}} take Mega Man to specific areas. In Legends, large gems called Refractors are used as a power source. Small shards of them can be exchanged for money, and in the game, enemies that are destroyed will often drop these Refractor Shards. When shards are picked up, the equivalent amount of Zenny, the game's basic unit of currency, is added automatically. The health of Mega Man can be increased through the game in the shops, while it can be recovered through packs bought at shops, obtaining red spheres from defeated opponents or by asking the character Data to recover Mega Man's health. Mega Man also has a Life Shield which reduces the damage that he can receive from enemies. The damage caused by enemies can also be reduced by obtaining upgrades to Mega Man's armor or his helmet. Mega Man's interactions with characters from the game can also affect the price of objects. If the player makes Mega Man be rude with characters, prices from objects will be increased and the dialogues with people will also change.|$|E

A massively multiplayer online game based on the Fallout franchise has been in development, a project for which Interplay retained the creation rights, though Bethesda has filed several injunctions against Interplay in an attempt to prevent this.

500|$|Development of {{the game}} began in June 2005 with parts {{of the game}} Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix meant to bring clues of Birth by Sleep. The game was {{directed}} by Tetsuya Nomura and co-directed by Tai Yasue. Nomura has referred to the game as [...] "Episode 0" [...] (and later [...] "Episode 0.1") saying that the <b>game</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the same scale and plays as big an importance as Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II. The game has been well-received, selling 1.27 million copies worldwide as of November 2010, and receiving positive comments by video game publications. Critics praised the gameplay, graphics, music, and storyline of the game, with criticism reserved for the level design and the characters. A high definition version of the Final Mix edition was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2014 and PlayStation 4 in 2017 {{as a part of}} the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix collection.|$|E
500|$|Although {{developers}} billed {{a realistic}} atmosphere, reviewers criticized {{that aspect of}} the game. [...] "I understand the emphasis for this <b>game</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the gameplay. However, a little more effort {{could have been made}} with the visuals and particularly in the audio department. Crowds will applaud your great plays and touchdowns, but the essence of a football game revolves around atmosphere. Here, it’s completely lacking," [...] said Acevedo in his review. The game was also criticized for its lack of play-by-play and poor audio. [...] "There's no witty banter between a play-by-play announcer and color commentator (although some would argue that Madden's audio presentation's been seriously lacking the past few iterations), there's no stadium music aside from “Boom” by P.O.D. being played during kickoffs (it gets old pretty fast), and the stadium crowds are basically an afterthought," [...] added Doug Aamoth of Techland. After the patch, the song only comes up for the first kick-off and the kick-off of the second half.|$|E
500|$|Development of {{the game}} began in June 2005 and was {{originally}} intended for the PlayStation 2 with Sora as the prototype protagonist {{of the game}}. Birth by Sleep was developed by Square Enix's fifth Product Development Division, based in Osaka, the same team behind Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories, and uses the same graphical engine as both [...] and Dissidia Final Fantasy. During development of Kingdom Hearts II, the Osaka-based team had requested {{to be involved in}} a spin-off if one were to be made. Development of the game began before the release of Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+. The plot was completed, but development was halted six months after it began due to development of Re:Chain of Memories. When development resumed, the team changed the platform to the PlayStation Portable so as {{to make use of the}} PSP's functions such as co-operative and competitive multiplayer gameplay. The title of the game is based on II Final Mixs secret ending, [...] "Birth by Sleep", a title which director Tetsuya Nomura developed as he wanted a phrase having [...] "by" [...] as well as to use an English title like previous games. Nomura has referred to the game as [...] "Episode 0", saying that the <b>game</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the same scale and plays as big an importance as Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E

500|$|Chulip {{received}} mostly average critical scores {{upon its}} release in North America. The game currently holds a 57% on the aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic. The ambitious gameplay of Chulip {{has been almost}} universally criticized. Ray Barnholt of 1UP.com, Ryan Davis of GameSpot, Micah Seff of IGN, and Gus Mastrapa of X-Play all labeled the often-unclear progression presented to the player as [...] "frustrating" [...] and [...] "tedious", requiring an excessive amount of patience. Mastrapa summarized, [...] "Since the <b>game</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> 24-hour clock a missed opportunity means having {{to wait until the}} next day to take another crack. Add the fact that your inexperienced, young avatar can die from heartbreak, resulting in a 'game over' screen and the loss of unsaved progress and you've got a recipe for annoyance." [...] Barnholt, Davis, and Seff did positively credit Natsume for the inclusion of the mini-strategy guide. Despite faulting the [...] "indistinct objectives", Davis found gratification in successful kisses. [...] "The whole kissing thing is absolutely fantastic in concept," [...] Davis stated, [...] "And there's something unsettling about your character's encouraged promiscuity." [...] However, Game Informer writer Ben Reeves described the game {{as one of the most}} poorly designed games he has ever played due to its lack of in-game direction and frequency of game overs. In January 2008, Game Informer listed Chulip one of the worst games of 2007.|$|E
