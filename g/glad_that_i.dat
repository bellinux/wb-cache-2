500|$|Cameron {{explained}} forfeiting {{his share}} as complex. [...] "...the short version {{is that the}} film cost proportionally much more than [...] and True Lies. Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. Titanic also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more," [...] he said. [...] "As the producer and director, I {{take responsibility for the}} studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{mentioned}} jokingly in a 1990 BBC Television {{interview on}} the program Omnibus, that the main theme of the video and the cat metaphor represented that [...] "Pussy rules the world". She added {{that the idea of}} the cat licking the milk and then pour it over, was the director's. [...] "It's great but believe me I fought him on that. I didn't want to do it. I thought it's just so over the top and silly and kind of cliched, an art student or a film student's kind of trick. I'm <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> gave in to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Kompalla gave an {{interview}} with newspaper General-Anzeiger after the series. [...] "When I recall these matches, my flesh creeps. Ten more such games and I would age several years. I am very <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got back home uninjured." [...] He went on to state that the Canadians played [...] "very crudely, purposely using foul methods that endanger {{the lives of their}} rivals." [...] He complained that the Canadian team threw [...] "cucumbers and other leftovers" [...] at his colleague Franz Baader on the flight from Moscow to Prague and harassed visitors in hotels. Bobby Hull also criticized Team Canada, stating that the fighting and gestures of the Canadian players [...] "were a bad example to young players and diplomatically harmful." ...|$|E

I threw on my clothes and ran down at once. My patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers.|$|R
500|$|... "Dancing With Myself" [...] is McHale's {{first solo}} {{performance}} on the show. Murphy commented that the performance is Artie's chance to [...] "break away from being misunderstood by everyone" [...] and express himself, explaining that although Artie is usually [...] "a very secure guy" [...] who does not care about others' opinions of him, [...] "Wheels" [...] sees his friends take his disability for granted: [...] "So this performance is all about him saying, 'Look, this is who I am, and this is who I want to be. McHale has stated that performing as Artie has made him {{more aware of the}} challenges that people with disabilities face: [...] "It's a completely different side of life. More than ever, I realize how grateful I am {{to be able to get}} up between each take and walk around. I'm <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can represent that kind of life on television so millions of people see it every week. And the whole point of it is to show that Artie can still do everything everyone else can that matters." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson had {{the matter}} investigated, and after having Cobb's September 24 doubleheader {{statistics}} re-checked, discovered {{only the first}} game of Cobb's statistics had been scored, but not the second game, in which he went 2-for-3. This put Cobb's suggested actual batting average at [...]385, again ahead of Lajoie's. In the end, Johnson ruled that Lajoie's sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit (which would have allowed him to go 9-for-9) but that Cobb's batting average was greater, recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to Lajoie's 227 hits in 591 at bats. Johnson asked Chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player, to which he agreed. Initially Lajoie refused the car but eventually relented and accepted it. Cobb said, [...] "I am <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> won an automobile and am especially pleased that Lajoie also gets one. I have no one to criticize. I know the games were on the square and I am greatly pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "I am quite satisfied that I was treated fairly in every way by President Johnson, but I think the scorer at St. Louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits. However, I am glad that the controversy is over. I have the greatest respect for Cobb as a batter and am glad of his success." ...|$|E
500|$|To protect Wollstonecraft, Imlay {{registered}} her as {{his wife}} in 1793, {{even though they were}} not married. After declaring war on Britain, France was blockaded by the Royal Navy, which caused shortages that worsened the problem of inflation. Imlay engaged in blockade-running, chartering ships to be bring in food and soap from America into France, which explained why both he and Wollstonecraft were not arrested during the Reign of Terror. As the Terror began in France with arrests and executions occurring daily, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion as someone from a nation that was at war with France and who was known to be a friend of leading Girondins, which led Imlay to make a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her into an American citizen, in order to protect her from arrest. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined (Wollstonecraft's sisters believed she had been imprisoned). Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins [...] "nightmarish" [...] with gigantic parades in the day where everyone had to cheer, lest they fall under suspicion of not being committed to the republic, and police raids at night to arrest [...] "enemies of the republic". In a letter to her sister Everina, written in March 1794, Wollstonecraft wrote: [...] "It is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind...death and misery, in every shape of terror, haunted this devoted country – I certainly am <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> came to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded." ...|$|E

He {{was a big}} hitter, too, and {{it was difficult to}} bowl a ball from which he could not score. He made me <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not a bowler.

2500|$|Howard's {{abilities}} and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars. Tim Duncan once remarked in 2007: [...] " [...] is so developed... He {{has so much}} promise and I am <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{will be out of}} the league when he is peaking." [...] Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: [...] " [...] is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn't that gifted, as far as body and physical presence." [...] Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: [...] "It's like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they're {{going to have to change}} the rules." [...] As early as December 2007, ESPN writer David Thorpe declared Howard to be the most dominant center in the NBA.|$|E
