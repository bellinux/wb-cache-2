5|$|The game {{features}} a changing weather system, which will vary from every hour and will provide obstructions for various forces and installations. For example, fog will close runways whereas storms will temporarily disrupt bombing runs and dogfights. Over time, RAF squadrons {{will run out}} of ammunition or fuel, and thus must replenish at the nearest RAF station, which will render them vulnerable to a Luftwaffe bombing run. In between turns, the player <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> request reinforcements from RAF reserves, however the longer the campaign progresses, {{the quality of the}} reserves will diminish.|$|E
5|$|In most {{variations}} Black <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> play Bb4+, a move whose advisability {{depends on}} White's possible answers. If White blocks the check with Nb1–c3 then Black should capture the knight only if White {{is forced to}} take back with the pawn, after which the isolated, doubled pawns are a positional advantage for Black that fully compensates {{the loss of the}} bishop pair, and even the gambitted pawn. Due to its immunity to pawn attacks, the c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. Piece exchanges can be good for Black even if he is a pawn down, as he can hope to exploit the crippled pawn structure in the ending. On the other hand, if White can recapture with a piece, the trade on c3 typically concedes the bishop pair for insufficient compensation.|$|E
5|$|Escaping {{the castle}} is made {{difficult}} by shadow creatures {{sent by the}} Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her {{for any length of}} time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.|$|E

The Maku Tree is killed in the past on Veran's orders; Link uses a time portal to travel to the past to prevent this. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight Essences of Time to defeat Veran. Link sets out to retrieve the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Labrynna's past and present. After getting the sixth Essence, Link is told he <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> save Nayru. He invades Queen Ambi's castle and removes Veran's spirit from Nayru, but Veran then possesses Queen Ambi.

Inside, the Returners battle their way through Kefka's defenses and destroy the three statues, the source of Kefka's newfound power.
