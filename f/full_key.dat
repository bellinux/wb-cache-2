50|$|The {{assessments}} {{were introduced}} following {{the introduction of}} a National Curriculum to schools in England and Wales under the Education Reform Act 1988.

The assessments were introduced only for the core subjects of English, Mathematics and Science. The first assessments in Key Stage 1 were a range of cross-curricular tasks to be delivered in the classroom, known as standardised assessment tasks - hence the common acronym 'SATs'. However, the complexity of the use of these meant they were quickly replaced by more formal tasks. The assessments in Key Stages 2 and 3 were developed using more traditional tests.|$|E
5000|$|Space {{efficiency}} of B+ trees {{can be improved}} by using some compression techniques. One possibility is to use delta encoding to compress keys stored into each block. For internal blocks, space saving {{can be achieved by}} either compressing keys or pointers. For string keys, space can be saved by using the following technique: Normally the i-th entry of an internal block contains the first key of block [...] Instead of storing the <b>full</b> <b>key,</b> we could store the shortest prefix of the first key of block [...] that is strictly greater (in lexicographic order) than last key of block i. There is also a simple way to compress pointers: if we suppose that some consecutive blocks [...] are stored contiguously, then it will suffice to store only a pointer to the first block and the count of consecutive blocks.|$|E

5000|$|The usual {{sense in}} which this term is (loosely) used, is in {{reference}} to a particular attack, brute force key search [...] - [...] especially in explanations for newcomers to the field. Indeed, with this attack (always assuming keys to have been randomly chosen), there is a continuum of resistance depending {{on the length of}} the key used. But even so there are two major problems: many algorithms allow use of different length keys at different times, and any algorithm can forgo use of the <b>full</b> <b>key</b> length possible. Thus, Blowfish and RC5 are block cipher algorithms whose design specifically allowed for several key lengths, and who cannot therefore be said to have any particular strength with respect to brute force key search. Furthermore, US export regulations restrict key length for exportable cryptographic products and in several cases in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g., famously in the case of Lotus Notes' export approval) only partial keys were used, decreasing 'strength' against brute force attack for those (export) versions. More or less the same thing happened outside the US as well, as for example in the case of more than one of the cryptographic algorithms in the GSM cellular telephone standard.|$|E
5000|$|Radix sort is a sorting {{algorithm}} {{that works}} for larger keys than pigeonhole sort or counting sort by performing multiple passes over the data. Each pass sorts the input using {{only part of the}} keys, by using a different sorting algorithm (such as pigeonhole sort or counting sort) that is suited only for small keys. To break the keys into parts, the radix sort algorithm computes the positional notation for each key,according to some chosen radix; then, the part of the key used for the th pass of the algorithm is the th digit in the positional notation for the <b>full</b> <b>key,</b> starting from the least significant digit and progressing to the most significant.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we formalize {{the notion of}} leakage attacks on {{iterated}} block ciphers, in which the attacker can find (via physical probing, power measurement, or {{any other type of}} side channel) one bit of information about the intermediate state of the encryption after each round. Since bits computed during the early rounds can be typically represented by low degree multivariate polynomials, cube attacks seem to be an ideal generic key recovery technique in these situations. However, the original cube attack requires extremely clean data, whereas the information provided by side channel attacks can be quite noisy. To address this problem, we develop a new variant of cube attack which can tolerate considerable levels of noise (affecting more than 11 % of the leaked bits in practical scenarios). Finally, we demonstrate our approach by describing efficient leakage attacks on two of the best known block ciphers, AES (requiring about 2 35 time for <b>full</b> <b>key</b> recovery) and SERPENT (requiring about 2 18 time for <b>full</b> <b>key</b> recovery) ...|$|E
