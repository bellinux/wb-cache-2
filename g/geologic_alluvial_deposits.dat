40|$|Twenty-two shallow, reversed, seismic {{refraction}} profiles {{were conducted}} in the Brazos River floodplain to test the feasibility of using seismic methods to provide hydrogeologic information in this province. The specific objectives were to map the total and saturated thickness of the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> and to outline gravel lenses within the alluvium. It {{was found that the}} water table was the only interface at which the acoustical properties of the deposits above and below changed sufficiently to be mapped by seismic methods. The <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> above the water transmitted compressional waves at an average velocity just greater than the velocity of sound in air. The saturated <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> transmitted seismic waves at an average velocity of slightly greater than the velocity of sound in water. The saturated <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> and the bedrock appear to have a continuous increase in velocity with depth rather than a significant change in acoustical characteristics. The seismic measurements in themselves could not delineate gravel lenses within the alluvium. However, the zones of greater permeability were indicated on the resulting contour map of the water table by the areas of gentle gradients. Zones of greater permeability in the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> are probably gravel lenses...|$|R

In urban areas it’s important determine the geometry of the alluvial body to identify buildings in danger of yielding. This paper proposes a methodology to identify and define the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> trough historical topography and analysis of few mechanical drillings if well scatterd and deep enough to reach the subsurface of the alluvial terrains. Through the vectorilizaton of contour lines of old topography preceding urban expansion, {{the production of the}} D. E.

The subsurface of the alluvium has been drown on the data of the mechanical drillings following the contour lines’arrangement of the surface.

Investigations carried out during this study have interpreted nearly 800 stratgraphic sections and physical-mechanical features of the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> of the Tiber and those of its right-and left-bank tributaries. The analysis allowed to define, for each investigated deposit, a representative series sbdivided into lithomecanical units. When comparing the stratigraphic and geologic features among the series, a remarkable difference in geomechanical behaviour in the deposits from the Tiber's left-and right-bank tributaries and within the river's deposits themselves could be recognized.

40|$|The {{results of}} field surveys, velocimetric records, and {{numerical}} models are reported {{with the goal}} of analyzing the local seismic response in a section of the Nera River alluvial valley in central Italy. <b>Alluvial</b> <b>deposit</b> geometry and dynamic properties were defined by geological and geophysical investigations. 2 D amplification effects were pointed out by horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios (HVSRs) as well as by horizontal-to-horizontal spectral ratios (HHSRs) to a reference station; HVSRs were derived from both noise and weak-motion records, while HHSRs were only computed from weak motions. Where travertine deposits are interlayered within the alluvia, 2 D amplification effects are shown only by HHSRs. The observed amplifications: (1) consist of peaks of the amplification functions A (f) in the range 1 - 10 Hz, (2) generally correspond to two frequency ranges whose values mainly depend on the valley shaped ratio and on the local heterogenities of the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits,</b> and (3) can be regarded as due to a 1 D resonance combined with lateral wave propagation. Numerical models via the finite difference method were performed by the Italian National Institute for Geophysics and Volcanology-Web Interface for Seismological Application and by the Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua codes. The obtained results: (1) show a good agreement with HHSRs, (2) prove that some 2 D amplification effects are constrained by both the shape ratio of the valley and the heterogeneity of the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits,</b> (3) reveal focalization effects within the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits</b> strictly related to the shape of the valley, and (4) allow the comparison of the A(f) functions in both linear and nonlinear dynamic behavior and the computation of the shear strains due to ground motion within the <b>alluvial</b> <b>deposits...</b>|$|R
