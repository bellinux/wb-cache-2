40|$|Ionic polymer {{transducers}} {{are soft}} actuators that produce large bending deflections {{when a small}} voltage is applied across their thickness. The electromechanical coupling in ionomeric materials {{is due to the}} charge motion in the polymer backbone. Increasing the capacitance of the actuator increases the motion of the charges and the actuation performance of ionic polymer transducers {{has been shown to be}} strongly correlated with charge motion. Ionomers exhibit large capacitance due to the electric double layer formed on the polymer-electrode interface. Increasing the effective interfacial area results in the increase in the capacitance, and manipulating the <b>electroding</b> process of the ionic polymers has proved to have major effect on capacitance and therefore transduction. In this paper a novel <b>electroding</b> technique is developed and characterized. The method is composed of mixing an ionic polymer solution with a fine metal powder such as RuO_ 2, and attaching it to the membrane as an electrode. Scanning Electron Microscopy images are obtained for several plating processes, and relations between plating parameters and electrode morphology are established. The transducers are characterized as actuators by measuring their strain output, force output, and capacitance. Capacitance values of up to 45 mF/cm^ 2 are obtained using the novel <b>electroding</b> method, which is between five and ten times higher than that obtained with a standard impregnation-reduction process. The performance of the transducers fabricated with the novel <b>electroding</b> technique exceeds the performance of those fabricated with the impregnation-reduction method by a factor of between 2 and 5. Transducers fabricated with the impregnation-reduction method generally produce 200 to 500 microstrain/V while the ones fabricated with the new process exhibited free strain values of greater than 1550 microstrain/V at low frequencies.

40|$|In smart textiles, {{electrical}} conductivity is often required for several functions, especially contacting (<b>electroding)</b> and interconnecting. This thesis explores electrically conductive textile surfaces made by combining conventional textile coating methods with the intrinsically conductive polymer complex poly(3, 4 -ethylene dioxythiophene) -poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). PEDOT:PSS {{was used in}} textile coating formulations including polymer binder, ethylene glycol (EG) and rheology modifier. Shear viscometry was used to identify suitable viscosities of the formulations for each coating method. The coating methods were knife coating, pad coating and screen printing. The {{first part of the}} work studied the influence of composition of the coating formulation, the amount of coating and the film formation process on the surface resistivity and the surface appearance of knife-coated textiles. The electrical resistivity was largely affected by the amount of PEDOT:PSS in the coating and indicated percolation behaviour within the system. Addition of a high-boiling solvent, i. e. EG, decreased the surface resistivity with more than four orders of magnitude. Studies of tear strength and bending rigidity showed that textiles coated with formulations containing larger amounts of PEDOT:PSS and EG were softer, more ductile and stronger than those coated with formulations containing more binder. The coated textiles were found to be durable to abrasion and cyclic strain, as well as quite resilient to the harsh treatment of shear flexing. Washing increased the surface resistivity, but the samples remained conductive after five wash cycles. The second part of the work focused on using the coatings to transfer the voltage signal from piezoelectric textile fibres; the coatings were first applied using pad coating as the outer electrode on a woven sensor and then as screen-printed interconnections in a sensing glove based on stretchy, warp-knitted fabric. Sensor data from the glove was successfully used as input to a microcontroller running a robot gripper. These applications showed the viability of the concept and that the coatings could be made very flexible and integrated into the textile garment without substantial loss of the textile characteristics. The industrial feasibility of the approach was also verified through the variations of coating methods...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{investigations}} on the dielectric properties of polycrystalline ceramics having uncommon substitutions in barium titanate and other related phases of BaTiO 3 -CaTiO 3, MgTiO 3 -CaTiO 3 and MgTiO 3 -BaTiO 3 systems. After presenting a brief introduction on the ceramic materials studied {{in terms of their}} crystal structures, electrical properties, nonstoichiometry and microstructural characteristics. The thesis describes the synthesis of the ceramics and the methodology of different techniques utilized in characterizing the samples. Barium calcium titanate was synthesized through novel wet chemical techniques and the dielectric properties of calcium substituted barium titanate do not reveal multi-site occupancy whereas they are predominantly influenced by the A/B cationic ratio. The role of transition metals of the 3 d series from vanadium (Z= 23) to zinc (Z= 30) in modifying the crystallographic phase content, microstructure and the dielectric properties of BaTiO 3 ceramics containing 10 at% impurities were studied. All the transition metals brought about the phase conversion to hexagonal BaTiO 3, although no systematics could be arrived at relating the hexagonal content to the 3 d electronic configuration of the impurities. The relaxor dielectrics arising from the titanate solid solution with uncommon substitution and its interconversion to normal ferroelectrics is studied. The effects of cationic substitutions of iron and niobium for titanium in BaTiO 3 pervoskite lattice in crystal symmetry and dielectric properties were investigated. The above dielectric characteristics are comparable in a converse way to those of the well known Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 -PbTiO 3 system wherein the relaxor behaviour occurs within the lower lead titanate compositional limits. The modification in -T characteristics of positive temperature coefficient in resistance (PTCR) by the addition of segregative additives such as B 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3 etc in BaTiO 3 and its conversion to grain boundary layer capacitance is studied. The presence of Al-related hole centers at the grain boundary regions resulted in charge redistribution across the modified phase transition temperatures due to symmetry-related vibronic interactions, which result in broad PTCR characteristics extending to higher temperatures. The processing of high permittivity ceramics by the manipulation of microstructural features in semiconducting BaTiO 3 is studied wherein the grain boundary layer effect superimposed with the contributions from the barrier layers formed during <b>electroding</b> related to microstructure is proposed to be responsible for the unusual high permittivity in semiconducting BaTiO 3. The influence of Mg 2 + as a substituent in modifying the crystallographic phase contents, microstructure and the dielectric properties of (Ba 1 -xMgx) TiO 3 ceramics, (x ranging from zero to 1. 0) is studied. The results point to the dual occupancy of Mg 2 + both in A and B sublattice and the role of oxygen vacancy as well as (Ti 3 + –VO) defects in stabilization of hexagonal phase to lower temperatures. The microwave dielectrics of the BaMg 6 Ti 6 O 19 phase formed in the compositional range of x= 0. 4 to 0. 7 was investigated for suitable application in microwave dielectrics. Extensive miscibility between the ilmenite-type MgTiO 3 and perovskite-type CaTiO 3 over a wide compositional range is brought about by the simultaneous equivalent substitution of Al 3 + and La 3 +. The resulting Mg 1 -(x+y) CaxLay) (Ti 1 -yAly) O 3 ceramics exhibit improved microwave dielectric properties by way of high permittivity, low TCK and high quality factor. The elemental distribution reveals the complexity in the Mg/Ca distribution and its correlation with the solid state miscibility as well as dielectric properties.
