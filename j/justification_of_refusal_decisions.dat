25|$|In 2000 Singh was {{appointed}} by then Foreign Secretary Robin Cook as 'Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance' between October 2000 and November 2002. The position was established in 1993 and requires a review of around 1000 randomly chosen entry clearance refusals without a right of appeal {{and looking at the}} overall quality <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>decisions,</b> paying particular attention to fairness, consistency and the procedures used to reach those decisions. He makes random checks on some 800-1,000 visa refusals a year to see whether decisions are consistent and fair, and makes an annual report to the Parliament of the United Kingdom suggesting any improvements he thinks necessary. Singh is the second person to hold the job – his predecessor was Dame Elizabeth Anson. Rabinder Singh QC was also an independent member on a three-strong panel commissioned {{in the wake of the}} race row which erupted on Big Brother UK 2007 where Jade Goody and fellow housemates were accused of racist bullying towards Indian actress Shilpa Shetty.|$|R

40|$|The {{essential}} facilities doctrine {{is a powerful}} tool for compelling dominant undertakings to share their products or services when these inputs are indispensable for another undertaking to perform business activity. The main objective of the {{essential facilities}} doctrine is to stimulate competition in related markets. However, due to its divergent effects, the doctrine should be applied carefully. The central focus of this article is on the two issues of a great practical significance – legitimate business <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> the <b>refusal</b> to deal and terms under which compulsory access should be granted. Once the facility has been determined to be indispensable, the next question is whether the refusal to supply is objectively justified. There are two different kinds <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> – <b>of</b> 'micro' and 'macro' level. From the micro point of view the circumstances of the particular owner of the facility are relevant. This article points out that the concept <b>of</b> objective <b>justifications</b> at a micro level involves also that of proportionality. At the macro level, in turn, the pro-competitive impacts and negative effects of the doctrine should be balanced. It follows that while deciding about the compulsory access to the facility, the allocative and dynamic efficiencies should be considered and the doctrine should be applied only when benefits to competition outweigh the costs of antitrust intervention. The second important issue addressed by this article relates to the terms of mandatory access to essential facilities. The main conclusion is that it must be provided on a nondiscriminatory basis and at a reasonable price. This article outlines that also the mandated terms are crucial for the static and dynamic competition...|$|R
40|$|Public {{engagement}} {{is considered}} a crucial process in the transition towards sustainable energy systems. However, less space {{has been devoted to}} understand how policy makers and stakeholders view citizens and their relationship with energy issues. Nonetheless, together with technological advancements, policies and political debates on energy affect public engagement as well as individual practices. This article aims at tackling this issue by exploring how policy makers and stakeholders have socially constructed sustainable energy in Italian parliamentary debates and consultations during recent years (2009 - 2012). Results show that societal discourses on sustainable energy are oriented in a manner that precludes public engagement. The political debate is characterised by argumentative short-circuits' that constrain individual and community actions to the acceptance or the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> top-down <b>decisions</b> and that leave little room for community empowerment and bottom-up innovation...|$|R
40|$|Today, most media authors {{acknowledge}} {{and to some}} degree integrate the user-generated content of their fandom. Some, however, still perform authoritarian positions of prohibition. George R. R. Martin, the creator of A Song of Ice and Fire, attempts to ban fanfiction, whilst acknowledging he cannot control use of the characters licensed to the TV adaptation (Game of Thrones). Building on the work of Jonathan Gray and Alexandra Herzog on paratexts in fandom studies, this article performs a critical discourse analysis on a systematic sample of the paratexts fanfic authors attach to fanfic from a cross section of online forums. These statements discursively reconfigure constructions of authorship and ownership, strongly inflected by the factors of site, audience and category. However, these paratexts evidence a paradox, legitimating their work by reference to the authority of what is already legitimate. The more radical gesture may be the absence <b>of</b> paratextual <b>justification,</b> and <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> the incitement to discourse' which Foucault recognised as a technique of modern power...|$|R

40|$|David Boonin has {{recently}} advanced several {{challenges to the}} self-defense <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment. Boonin argues that the self-defense <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment justifies punishing the innocent, justifies disproportionate punishment, cannot account for mitigating excuses, and does not justify intentionally harming offenders as we do when we punish them. In this paper, I argue that the self-defense justification, suitably understood, can avoid all of these problems. To help demonstrate the self-defense theory’s attraction, I also develop some contrasts between the self-defense justification, Warren Quinn’s better known ‘auto-retaliator’ argument, and desert-based <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> punishment. In sum, I show that the self-defense <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment is more resilient than commonly supposed and deserves {{to be taken seriously}} as a <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment...|$|R

40|$|Using {{the speech}} act <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> and formulaic {{language}} as focuses of analysis, this thesis aims to explore {{whether or not}} grammatical proficiency and development is distinct from pragmatic proficiency. The {{data were collected from}} 36 Thai EFL learners at three proficiency levels: low intermediate, intermediate and advanced, using four open role-plays. The role-plays were designed to incorporate different combinations of sociolinguistic variables of power and distance, as expounded in Brown and Levinson's politeness theory. The data were analyzed from two perspectives: pragmatic and lexicogrammatical. In the pragmatic analysis, the data were segmented in to refusal moves and interactional function categories. Drawing on politeness theories of face-saving, the analysis focused on a comparison of the learners' use <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> moves, the pragmatic orientation <b>of</b> their <b>refusal</b> moves in refusal episodes and face-saving manoeuvres. The lexico-grammatical features of the data were analyzed in terms of their formulaicity. Sixteen native speakers of English were asked to identify formulaic sequences in the role-play transcription. The formulaic sequences identified were tallied, analyzed in terms of proportion, frequency and variety, and compared across the three proficiency levels. The analyses show that 1) the pragmatic orientation <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> moves <b>of</b> the learners at the three proficiency levels was similar but 2) that the use <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> moves to mitigate the force <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> was slightly different across the levels; 3) the overall language produced by the advanced learners had the highest proportion of formulaic language, but 4) in the lexicalizations <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> the low-inter-mediate learners used more formulaic language than the other two groups. The results indicate that the pragmatic aspects <b>of</b> the learners' <b>refusals</b> seem to be independent of their proficiency level while the way they used formulaic language in the role-plays and in the lexicalizations <b>of</b> <b>refusals</b> are related to proficiency level. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In Javanese context, refusal {{tends to}} threat the {{feelings}} and self worth of addressees while in British, refusal is not normally face threatening {{or at least}} it is not as face threatening {{as it is in the}} Javanese context. This paper compares sequencing of semantic formulae and adjuncts <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> to invitations phrased by native speakers of British English and Javanese learners of English. The data <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> are elicited through written discourse completion tasks (DCT) involving nine scenarios. Refusal strategies are classified based on a modified version <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> taxonomy by Beebe, Takahashi, and Uliss-Weltz (1990). Overall the refusal strategies employed by the two groups are similar. Few differences in sequencing of semantic fomulae and adjuncts <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> are due to politeness function.

40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} {{situations in}} which refusal will occur and examined the refusal strategies and corresponding linguistic forms that can be employed to react to various refusal situations in Chinese culture. Since refusal is an act in response to other acts, acts that prompt refusals {{play an important role}} in the choices <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> strategies. Therefore, this paper categorizes situations <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> according to the initiating acts <b>of</b> <b>refusal.</b> Based on 160 video clips collected from five television series, this paper found that refusal is initiated by four types of acts: request, offer, invitation, and suggestion. Each type can be subcategorized in terms of their different communicative functions. The study can facilitate the instruction <b>of</b> <b>refusal</b> to learners <b>of</b> Chinese from multiple pers-pectives. Although there are a number <b>of</b> studies <b>of</b> <b>refusal,</b> most <b>of</b> them deal with either English or Japanese (e. g., Morrow 1995, Gass & Houck 1999).
