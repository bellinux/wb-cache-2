40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{productivity}} losses due to <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> during {{in vitro}} fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) treatment and {{to describe the}} pattern of IVF-related <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> Additionally, the influence of general and psychological variables on IVF-related <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> was analyzed. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Eight IVF hospitals participated in the study. SAMPLE: Women undergoing their first treatment with IVF/ICSI. METHODS: The Health and Labour Questionnaire (HLQ) was used to estimate the costs of IVF-related <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> (n= 384). Diaries were used to collect background information and reasons for IVF-related absence. Psychological data were derived using the Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC) and the Inventory Social Relations and the Illness Cognition Questionnaire. Regression analyses were performed using two models, one without and one with psychological data, {{to assess the impact}} of the different variables on IVF-related <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: IVF-related <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> and the costs of productivity losses due to IVF/ICSI per treatment. RESULTS: Overall <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> during IVF/ICSI treatment was on average 33 hours, of which 23 hours were attributed to IVF/ICSI. Costs of productivity losses due to IVF/ICSI were euro 596 per woman. Significant predictors of IVF-related <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> were the number of hours of paid work, age and self-reported physical and/or emotional problems due to IFV treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing emotional complaints and women with physical complaints due to IVF/ICSI reported significantly more IVF-related <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is {{to show how the}} {{temperament}} of leaders has an effect on temporary <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> in public administration and may potentially be one of the causes of temporary <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> Research on Slovenian public administration was conducted in February 2015 and involved 3, 220 respondents. A quantitative research method (survey) was used to collect the data which were then analyzed with the SPSS statistical program and Microsoft Excel. The results of the research reveal that leaders’ temperaments have a statistically signifi cant effect on temporary <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> in public administration. The effect is evident both in the number of days {{as well as in the}} number of occurrences of <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> The survey results show that public administration is dominated by leaders with choleric (45 %) and phlegmatic temperaments (41 %). Employees with a leader with a melancholic temperament were absent <b>from</b> <b>work</b> the most (11. 7 days), followed by those working under a sanguine leader (10. 6 days); the greatest frequency of absence were reported for employees with a sanguine leader (1. 9 times), and the fewest for those with a melancholic leader (1. 5 times). </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Low {{back pain}} {{is a common}} medical and social problem {{frequently}} associated with disability and <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> However, data on effective return to work after interven-tions for low back pain are scarce. Objective: To determine {{the effectiveness of a}} behavior-oriented graded activity program compared with usual care. Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Occupational health services department of an airline company in the Netherlands. Patients: 134 workers who were absent <b>from</b> <b>work</b> because of low back pain were randomly assigned to either graded activity (n 67) or usual care (n 67). Intervention: Graded activity, a physical exercise program based on operant-conditioning behavioral principles, to stimulate a rapid return to work. Measurements: Outcomes were the number of days of <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> because of low back pain, functional status (Roland Disability Questionnaire), and severity of pain (11 -point numerical scale). Results: The median number of days of <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> over 6 months of follow-up was 58 days in the graded activity group and 87 days in the usual care group. From randomization onward, graded activity was effective after 50 days of <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> (hazard ratio, 1. 9 [95 % CI, 1. 2 to 3. 2]; P 0. 009). The graded activity group was more effective in improving functional status and pain than the usual care group. The effects, however, were small and not statistically significant. Conclusions: Graded activity was more effective than usual care in reducing the number of days of <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> because of low back pain.

40|$|This paper {{comprises}} two parts: {{a theoretical}} part {{in which a}} number of theoretical and methodological recommendations about research on absence are {{made on the basis}} of a review of selected literature, and an empirical part that contains analyses of <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> in the Danish slaughterhouse industry. In the theoretical part it is asserted that sickness absence cannot be understood if it is viewed as a simple function of ill health or other individual factors, such as job dissatisfaction. Absence should rather be regarded as a coping behaviour that reflects an individual's perception of his/her health (illness) and is a function of a number of factors at different levels, primarily the combination of job demands and coping possibilities at the job (job strain). Several ideal methodological requirements regarding absence research are formulated on this basis. The empirical part presents an analysis of <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> in the Danish slaughterhouse industry based on a study of 4407 slaughterhouse workers. It is shown that a number of factors at the company level, the job level and the individual level are associated with an individual's <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> over a 12 -month period. It is further shown that people with high job strain have a significantly higher absence rate, that there is a clear association between sickness absence and perceived health and that absence is part of a pattern along with other coping strategies which are directed against stressing working conditions and perceived ill health. Lastly, it is discussed whether <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> is a functional coping strategy. <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> coping behaviour slaughterhouse workers job strain...|$|R

At the same time, to a greater degree than most other topics in the field, it is a concept that is familiar to the general public at large. The goal of this thesis is to add to the large body of absence research while capitalizing on the topic's presence in the public domain. Through two separate studies, the thesis focuses on social expectations and norms surrounding <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> Relying on elements of attribution and accountability theories, Study 1 uses an experimental approach to uncover norms surrounding attendance. Results indicate that reasons for absence and context in which absence is occurring influence judgments and reactions to <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work.</b> Study 2 presents a content analysis of how <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> has been portrayed in the New York Times over the last 150 years.

Results indicate that the reporting is varied, but that themes relating to gender, social context, outcomes, reasons for absence, and outcomes of absence are consistently found in the press. The dual-methodological approach of the thesis demonstrates the multi-level, collective nature of absenteeism, illuminates links between absence and gender and context, and treats <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> as a behavior involving all workers, with important causes and effects...|$|R

40|$|Background. Dolenjska is {{a region}} with well {{developed}} viniculture and spirits production. The {{analysis of the}} mortality, premature mortality, hospitalization and temporary <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> attributed to alcohol in Dolenjska in comparison {{to those in the}} other part of Slovenia was performed. Methods. Data source on mortality, premature mortality, hospitalization and temporary <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> was national statistics of the Institut of Public Health of the Republic of Slovenia and of the Health Insurance Institut of Slovenia. Statistical data were collected in accordance with diagnoses and age limits defined by the metodology of the Centers for Disease Control in USA for each gender separately (1991 – 1996). Alcohol-related mortality, premature mortality, hospitalization and temporary <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> were calculated using in the USA established alcohol attributable fractions for each disease or injury {{with the exception of the}} cirrhosis of the liver, for which the known Slovene alcohol attributable fraction exists. Results. Selected health indicators are pointing important differences for men and partly for women in Dolenjska in comparison to the rest of Slovenia. In Dolenjska there are 12. 0 % of deaths, 23. 0 % of premature mortality, 6. 2 % of hospitalizations and 3. 4 % of temporary <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> attributed to alcohol. In the other part of Slovenia there are 9. 6 % of deaths, 19. 4 % of premature mortality, 5. 3 % of hospitalizations and 3. 4 % of temporary <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> attributed to alcohol. Conclusions. There is a need to build up national alcohol policy. It must be based upon measures for reducing alcohol supply and demand, early detecting and preventing harmful drinking and treatment of the dependance on alcohol. Specifity of some regions where people produce alcohol drinks by themselves must be considered. Epidemiological research about alcohol use, drinking habits among people and harmful effects of alcohol on peoples health must be performed. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess voice {{complaints}} and <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> due to voice problems among teachers of primary and secondary education, as well as among a control group, 2, 117 questionnaires were analysed. The total group consisted of 1, 878 teachers and 239 controls. Female teachers more frequently reported voice complaints and <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> due to voice problems than their male colleagues. No unequivocal relationship between age {{on the one hand}} and voice complaints and <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> due to voice problems on the other hand was observed. Therefore, the percent of cases was corrected for gender but not for age. More than half of the teachers reported voice problems during their career and about one fifth had a history of <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> due to voice problems. These numbers are relatively high compared to those of the controls with as well as to those without a vocally demanding profession. More than 20 % of the teachers sought medical help or had been treated for a voice problem. Remarkably, more than 12 % of the teachers had experienced voice problems during their training and this group reported significantly more voice complaints and <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>work</b> due to voice problems in their career than the colleagues without voice problems during the training. The results of the Voice Handicap Index scores followed these trends. These findings point at voice problems during education as a risk factor for getting voice problems during the career. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that teaching is a high-risk profession for the development of voice problems, which is in accordance with other studies and support the contention that voice is a worldwide problem in the teaching profession. Furthermore, this study indicates the importance of voice care not only during training for the profession but also during the career. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel. status: publishe...|$|R
