5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, {{the anatomy}} of the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct Mauritian <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> the Mascarene coot, {{it appears that the}} Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both populations were said to be easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E

50|$|Diving <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> sea <b>ducks</b> forage deep underwater. To {{be able to}} {{submerge}} more easily, {{the diving}} ducks are heavier than dabbling <b>ducks,</b> <b>and</b> therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly.|$|R
5|$|Harvey was {{appointed}} to captain an Australian XI in a warm-up match against the touring Englishmen, indicating that the selectors were considering him for the Test captaincy. Harvey scored a <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> 38 and the Australians lost heavily by 345 runs on a wicket with a crater. Therefore, Benaud was made Australian captain ahead of Harvey.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test at Nottingham Harvey scored 64 {{and three}} in a rain-affected draw. He then made a <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> ten as Australia took the series lead in the Second Test at Lord's.

Bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Swainson’s hawk and the prairie falcon are birds of prey that are relatively common. Waterfowl such as Western grebe, Northern pintail, Great blue heron and Barrow’s goldeneye have stable populations and rare sightings of Trumpeter swans are reported. pheasant, ruffed grouse and wild turkey are widely distributed across the open sage lands. Harlequin <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> northern goshawk are generally rare but management plans were implemented to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, many of {{the grand}} mansions on the Strand were {{demolished}} as the aristocracy moved to the West End. The <b>Duck</b> <b>and</b> Drake tavern on Strand was famed as a venue for the conspirators involved in the Gunpowder Plot. In {{the time of the}} Civil War, the Nag's Head tavern was the venue of a meeting between Henry Ireton and some of the Levellers which resulted in the production of Remonstrance of the Army, demanding the abolition of the monarchy and the trial of King Charles I.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of Snow White, work had continued on the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series of shorts. Mickey Mouse switched to Technicolor in 1935, by which time the series had added several major supporting characters, among them Mickey's dog Pluto and their friends Donald <b>Duck</b> <b>and</b> Goofy. Donald, Goofy, and Pluto would all be appearing in series of their own by 1940, and the Donald Duck cartoons eclipsed the Mickey Mouse series in popularity.

5|$|Make Way for Ducklings won the 1942 Caldecott Medal for McCloskey's illustrations, {{executed}} in charcoal then lithographed on zinc plates.

In 1991, Barbara Bush gave a duplicate of this sculpture to Raisa Gorbachev as part of the START Treaty, and the work is displayed in Moscow's Novodevichy Park.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American black <b>duck,</b> <b>and</b> also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E

5|$|This {{is a large}} <b>duck,</b> <b>and</b> the male's long central tail {{feathers}} {{give rise}} to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet.

The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.|$|E
