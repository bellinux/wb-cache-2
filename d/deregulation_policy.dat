30|$|In Turkey, {{the first}} {{deregulation}} rules for privatization were produced in 1984, but transactions remained low {{compared with that}} of the 2000 s.

Thus, the trade unions, which were banned after the military coup in the early 1980 s, organized strikes until Turkey created institutional changes under new legislation and implementations. One {{of the reasons for the}} increase in strikes, lock-outs and lost workdays was slow <b>deregulation</b> <b>policies.</b> Turkey developed new institutional changes to stimulate and create a ground for privatizations. With that aim, the Privatization Board of Turkey was established in 1994; hence, privatization became institutionalized. After this important institutional change, the power of trade unions became weaker, and the number of strikes and lock-outs gradually decreased (see Table  6).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{builds on}} the Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003) model of deregulation. We {{concentrate}} on product market to construct a framework explaining in a more nuanced way the redistributive effects of deregulation between sectors and within the same sector, and possible oppositions to this policy by firms and workers. In a general equilibrium framework, we introduce two sectors(regulated and unregulated), heterogeneity in firms' productivity, and a…fixed cost of entry. In such a context effects of <b>deregulation</b> <b>policies</b> can be ambiguous depending on some parametric restrictions, and sometime counterproductive. As a result, <b>deregulation</b> <b>policies</b> are not always welfare improving: a deregulation action will succeed in increasing competition and reducing mark up {{when the economy is}} already partially deregulated (sufficiently high level of competition), but may achieve the opposite outcome when it is highly regulated. Additionally, we study the choice of the best policy instrument and the optimal sequencing in the use of instruments. ...|$|R

Specifically, six types of panel data are prepared, based on three cross-sections [...] all states (except for Alaska and Hawaii) and the District of Columbia, deregulated states, and non-deregulated states [...] and two time series [...] the period before deregulation and the period after deregulation.

40|$|A central {{objective}} of port privatization and/or <b>deregulation</b> <b>policies</b> is stimulating greater efficiency by engendering {{a more competitive}} market and commercial approach to management. Korea provides {{a prime example of}} a nation that is implementing such policies. Also, its ports play a pivotal role in world shipping, particularly in the ever-burgeoning container market. The success of these policies in increasing the productive efficiency of Korean container terminals is assessed. The UK container terminal sector provides a useful benchmark for comparison since privatization and deregulation have formed an integral part of UK port reforms for nearly 20 years and the effect on efficiency, having had time to mature, will be much easier to gauge. The stochastic frontier model is justified as the chosen methodology for estimating productive efficiency levels and is applied to cross-sectional data under a variety of distributional assumptions. A panel data model is also estimated. Results are consistent and suggest (1) The degree of private sector involvement in sample container terminals is positively related to productive efficiency and (2) Improved productive efficiency has followed the implementation of privatization and <b>deregulation</b> <b>policies</b> within the Korean sector. Even though not categorical, these conclusions are important because the market for container throughput is internationally competitive and if policies which promote competition between Korean container terminals lead to greater productive efficiency, this will inevitably make the sector as a whole more competitive internationally. ...|$|R

Industrial output thus fell by 20%, real wages by at least 36%, and the public debt soared from US$8 billion to US$45 billion; by 1983, interest charges alone reached US$6.5 billion, creating a balance of payments crisis that weakened the economy for years.|$|R

We unbundle privatization and liberalization and find, despite conventional wisdom, that both right-wing and left-wing governments liberalize and privatize network industries. However, right-wing executives tend to privatize more and to liberalize less, relative to left-wing governments. Thus, contrary to previous literature, ideological cleavages affect the ‘structure’ of deregulation, i. e. {{the way in}} which liberalization and privatization are combined, rather than its ‘level’. This result may shed new lights on the analysis of the political determinants of market-oriented policy...|$|R
