In this episode, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) returns from <b>jury</b> <b>duty</b> and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) questions him on every detail of his case. However, Jim later comes under fire when the office realizes he faked <b>jury</b> <b>duty</b> to spend time with his wife, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and their new baby, Phillip. Meanwhile, Angela (Angela Kinsey) and the state senator welcome their new baby.|$|E
5|$|TGS head writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is {{assigned}} to solve a public relations problem caused by the show's stars, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), during their hosting duties of the St. Patrick's Day parade, in which Jenna passed out and Tracy cursed during the live television broadcast. To make things worse, Liz is summoned to <b>jury</b> <b>duty</b> and cannot avoid it despite claiming to be Princess Leia. When she leaves for <b>jury</b> <b>duty,</b> she does not leave anyone in charge and allows the staff to go without direction—until later when she puts NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) in charge after learning that the staff {{have gotten out of}} hand. Liz is on a court case about a woman, named Rochelle Gaulke (Jackie Hoffman), whose work life and frustrations parallel her own; the two both have employees named Tracy and Jenna, both believe their employees waste their time, and make their lives difficult.|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the city's firefighting capabilities, the city established a reserve unit called the Exempt Fireman's Company, so called {{because it was}} made up of firemen who were exempt from militia and <b>jury</b> <b>duty.</b> The company was led by veteran fireman Zophar Mills, who had helped stop the great 1835 fire from crossing Wall Street.|$|E

5|$|Before Peter is {{preparing}} to leave for <b>jury</b> <b>duty,</b> the family is seen watching a television sitcom entitled How Henry Kissinger Met Your Mother, a parody of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother, which features Henry Kissinger, whose heavy accent makes his speech unintelligible.

500|$|Kakaibang Idol was {{a special}} episode of Philippine Idol held on September 23, 2006, {{a week after the}} Top 12 Finalists have been named. [...] It was an {{interactive}} reality singing competition consisting of notable auditionees who either did not pass or failed to make it through Semifinals. [...] The program was named Kakaibang Idol (A Different Kind of Idol) because the seven contestants made an impact among viewers.

50|$|The 1993 Constitution {{fragmented}} the Jury {{into three}} autonomous entities, separating the National Registry of Identification and Civil Status (Registro Nacional de Identificación y Estado Civil, RENIEC) and the National Office of Electoral Processes (Oficina Nacional de Procesos Electorales, ONPE) from it. RENIEC {{was made in}} charge of registering eligible voters, while ONPE was designed to organize the elections, leaving the <b>Jury</b> the <b>duties</b> of making any rulings concerning electoral processes, including the proclamation of official results.|$|R
5000|$|The {{early history}} of juries {{supports}} {{the recognition of the}} de facto power of nullification. By the 12th century, common law courts in England began using juries for more than administrative <b>duties.</b> <b>Juries</b> were composed primarily of [...] "laymen" [...] from the local community. They provided a somewhat efficient means of dispute resolution with the benefit of supplying legitimacy.|$|R
5|$|During the {{preliminary}} hearing in late July, prosecutors presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors at both of his homes, indicating that Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue house {{and spent most of}} his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a U.S. Postal Service inspector revealed that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address; prosecutors cited utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his 28th Avenue home, as well as loan applications that indicated he lived in Burlingame. In his defense, Jew produced a <b>jury</b> <b>duty</b> summons to indicate his address in San Francisco, and questioned the possible bias of the witnesses against him.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to recommendations from the governor, the General Assembly enacted cost-saving {{reforms in the}} judicial system, including the abolition of criminal, chancery, and common pleas courts, dividing the state instead into 18 circuit court districts. The number of jurors required for certain cases was reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting <b>jury</b> <b>duty.</b> Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by local law enforcement. Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state property tax was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.|$|E
5|$|Bergstein then shopped {{the script}} around to other studios but was {{repeatedly}} rejected, until she {{brought it to}} Vestron Pictures, the newly formed studio division of Stamford, Connecticut, based Vestron Inc., the leading independent home video distribution company. While honing their pitch to Vestron, Gottlieb and Bergstein chose Emile Ardolino as the film's director, who had won the 1983 Academy Award for the documentary, He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'. Ardolino had never directed a feature film, but was extremely passionate about the project; he even sent a message {{from where he was}} sequestered on <b>jury</b> <b>duty,</b> insisting that he was the best choice as director. The team of Gottlieb, Bergstein, and Ardolino then presented their vision for the film to Vestron's president, Jon Peisinger, and the company's vice president for production, Mitchell Cannold. By the end of the meeting, Peisinger had greenlighted the project to become Vestron's first feature film production. The approved film was budgeted at the relatively low amount of $5million, {{at a time when the}} average cost for a film was $12million.|$|E
60|$|And now {{the case}} was sent to him for reconsideration. He hated such reconsiderations. He first read Sir John Joram's letter, and {{declared}} to himself that it was unfit {{to have come from}} any one calling himself a lawyer. There was an enthusiasm about it altogether beneath a great advocate,--certainly beneath any forensic advocate employed otherwise than in addressing a jury. He, Judge Bramber, had never himself talked of 'demanding' a verdict even from a jury. He had only endeavoured to win it. But that {{a man who had been}} Attorney-General,--who had been the head of the bar,--should thus write to a Secretary of State, was to him disgusting. To his thinking, a great lawyer, even a good lawyer, would be incapable of enthusiasm as to any case in which he was employed. The ignorant childish world outside would indulge in zeal and hot feelings,--but for an advocate to do so was to show that he was no lawyer,--that he was no better than the outside world. Even spoken eloquence was, in his mind, almost beneath a lawyer,--studied eloquence certainly was so. But such written words as these disgusted him. And then he came across allusions to the condition of the poor lady at Folking. What could the condition of the lady at Folking have to do with the matter? Though the poor lady at Folking should die in her sorrow, that could not alter the facts as they had occurred in Australia! It was not for him, or for the Secretary of State, to endeavour to make things pleasant all round here in England. It had been the <b>jury's</b> <b>duty</b> to find out whether that crime had been committed, and his duty to see that all due facilities were given to the jury. It had been Sir John Joram's duty to make out what best case he could for his client,--and then to rest contented. Had all things been as they should be, the Secretary of State would have had no duty at all in the matter. It was in this frame of mind that Judge Bramber applied himself to the consideration of the case. No juster man ever lived;--and yet in his mind there was a bias against the prisoner.|$|R
25|$|In 1835, a law {{was passed}} {{requiring}} the purchase of an engine, along with better equipment, to be partially funded {{by the state and}} partially by the city, {{in order to protect the}} Indiana statehouse.

5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on <b>jury</b> <b>duty</b> for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to know who did it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her feel bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E

60|$|In {{a country}} where money was all-powerful the power of money was used without stint and without scruple. Judges were bribed to do their <b>duty,</b> <b>juries</b> to convict, {{newspapers}} to support and legislators to betray their constituents and pass the most oppressive laws. By these corrupt means, and with the natural advantage of greater skill in affairs and larger experience in concerted action, the capitalists soon restored their ancient reign {{and the state of}} the laborer was worse than it had ever been before. Straman says that in his time two millions of unoffending workmen in the various industries were once discharged without warning and promptly arrested as vagrants and deprived of their ears because a sulking canal-boatman had kicked his captain's dog into the water. And the dog was a retriever.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the common}} grounds of a new trial is that the verdict is {{contrary}} to law.

It is the <b>duty</b> of the <b>jury</b> to take the law from the court, whether the court in so giving it is right or wrong.

500|$|In {{mentioning}} {{that he has}} been summoned for <b>jury</b> <b>duty,</b> and implying its exclusivity, Peter is confronted by Brian who reveals that the only reason he was selected was because he had voted in the last election. Peter goes on to state that he actually stuffed the ballot box at the Oscars, when the nominees included Grover from Sesame Street, Bluto from Popeye, and Daniel Day-Lewis, among others. Actress Anne Hathaway presented the award. Going on to find out that everyone is asked to do <b>jury</b> <b>duty,</b> Peter soon seeks to be kicked out, just as he was from the rock band Coldplay once he suggested that they write a song that is [...] "not whiny bullcrap".

500|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{returns from}} <b>jury</b> <b>duty</b> and learns that, in his week-long absence, his {{co-workers}} {{were forced to}} make up for his vacancy, suffering setbacks and inconveniences in the process. Jim reveals to the camera that, while he was called for duty, he was dismissed at noon and headed home to Pam (Jenna Fischer) and their two children; he saw that Pam was overwhelmed and took {{the rest of the week}} off to help take care of their children. To appease his interested co-workers, Jim fabricates numerous details of his <b>jury</b> <b>duty,</b> and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) becomes suspicious when Jim mistakenly refers to a food truck franchise Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) ate at during his <b>jury</b> <b>duty</b> as a [...] "restaurant". Dwight accuses Jim of lying about <b>jury</b> <b>duty</b> and extracts from Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) a promise to fire Jim if he proves he is correct. Ashamed, Jim privately admits his guilt to Andy, who insists that they keep the matter a secret so that he will not be held to his promise to fire Jim. However, Dwight increases his attempts to prove Jim's guilt, and Jim finally decides to defy Andy's orders and tell his co-workers the truth rather than wait for Dwight to inevitably expose him. While this angers most of the employees, Dwight is thrilled at the confession and demands that Andy keep his promise to fire Jim. Andy refuses, so Dwight tries to contact Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). To smooth things over, Jim and Pam bring in their children, CeCe and Phillip, to present pictures that CeCe drew for the co-workers. It becomes clear that Jim and Pam drew the pictures themselves, but before the members of the office can berate the couple, the children begin crying loudly, creating a cacophony that Jim and Pam struggle to control, forcing them to take them back to the car. Realizing the stress that having young children causes, the office workers, ultimately, forgive Jim for his behavior and even suggest he leave early to help Pam, which he does.|$|E

After Brian informs him that everyone serves <b>jury</b> <b>duty</b> at some point, Peter tries to be kicked out of court by annoying the others, expressing fabricated prejudices, singing Surfin' Bird, and attempting to discuss the trial outside of the courtroom. When Peter returns home that night, the local news announces that the Earth will be destroyed by the newly discovered, and continually expanding, black hole within the next 24 hours. Frantic over the news, everyone in Quahog attempts to live out the best last day possible. Herbert finally attempts to have sex with Chris, Quagmire has sex with Bonnie, and Peter finally manages to steal a lion from the zoo and say the [...] "you-know-what word" [...] in a black neighborhood (he is well respected as a result). As the countdown reaches its final seconds, Peter confesses to Lois that while he loves her, he hates spending time with his kids.

500|$|Ginsburg {{volunteered to}} write the brief for Reed v. Reed, , wherein the Supreme Court {{extended}} the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to women for the first time. She argued and won Frontiero v. Richardson, , which challenged a statute {{making it more difficult}} for a female service member to claim an increased housing allowance for her husband than for a male service member seeking the same allowance for his wife. Ginsburg argued the statute treated women as inferior, and the Supreme Court ruled 8–1 in her favor. The Court again ruled in Ginsburg's favor in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, , where Ginsburg represented a widower denied survivor benefits under Social Security, which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children. She argued it discriminated against female workers denying them the same protection as their male counterparts. Ginsburg filed an amicus brief and sat with counsel at oral argument for the case Craig v. Boren, , in which she challenged an Oklahoma statute which set different minimum drinking ages for men and women. For the first time, the Court imposed what is known as [...] "intermediate scrutiny" [...] on laws discriminating based on gender, a heightened standard of Constitutional review. Her last case as a lawyer before the Court was 1978's Duren v. Missouri, , which challenged the validity of voluntary <b>jury</b> <b>duty</b> for women as she deemed women's participation in government service as vital and that <b>jury</b> <b>duty</b> should not be optional. At the end of Ginsburg's oral presentation, then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist asked Ginsburg, [...] "You won't settle for putting Susan B. Anthony on the new dollar, then?"

According to Posner, the later coverage of the family [...] "makes it clear that, with the exception of Mrs. Palsgraf, the Palsgraf family was thrilled by its association with a famous case, notwithstanding the outcome". In 1991, that association became closer, as Lisa Newell, first cousin four times removed of Judge Cardozo, married Palsgraf's great-grandson, J. Scott Garvey.|$|E
