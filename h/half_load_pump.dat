By {{analyzing}} two old {{forms of}} hydraulic winch test benches (Traditional hydraulic winch test bench and throttling hydraulic winch test bench), the new hydraulic winch test bench applies a new energy recycle technology and avoids enormous energy consumption.

It also analyzes the working principles of the new test bench’s obverse processes. The displacement of the <b>loading</b> <b>pump</b> should adapt to the change of the diameter ratio of the main drum and the auxiliary drum, so we use one <b>loading</b> <b>pump</b> and limit its displacement to realize energy recycle. Furthermore, the new test bench’s experiment is carried out to evaluate the efficiency of this test bench’s energy saving rate.

The results also indicate that this particular stack has insufficient heat exchange area with cooling air resulting in relatively large cooling air flow rates and low temperatures...|$|R

40|$|In this work, the {{adsorption}} of toluene on pure-silica MEL zeolite is investigated using {{a variety}} of experimental and simulation methods. First, we measured the volumetric and calorimetric isotherms at 301 K and at 315 K. The volumetric adsorption isotherm presents a substep at a loading of roughly 4 molecules per unit cell that shifts to higher pressures at higher temperatures and that coincides with a sudden increase in the isosteric heat of adsorption. Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the substep at <b>half</b> <b>load</b> is caused by the {{adsorption of toluene}} molecules at different energetic sites within the porous network. According to this, toluene molecules occupy first the intersections, and once all intersections are filled, additional toluene molecules place themselves within the channels. The structure of the adsorbate/adsorbent system was further investigated by performing X-ray powder diffraction experiments of the zeolite at three different loads: empty, at <b>half</b> <b>load</b> (before the substep), and at high load (after the substep). Numerous new low intensity peaks and splittings of existing peaks at the empty and half-loaded diffractograms appear in the diffraction pattern of the high load sample. Atomic structural models compatible with the experimental spectra were obtained by performing N-reverse Monte Carlo simulations. Whereas at <b>half</b> <b>load</b> a good fit of the experimental diffraction pattern can be obtained using the rigid zeolite approximation, at high load, this is only possible when the flexibility of the zeolite is incorporated. In this structural model, the channel cross sections are deformed from a nearly circular shape in the empty zeolite to a more elliptical shape {{in the case of the}} high load zeolite.

40|$|A novel {{in-cylinder}} {{pressure method}} for determining ignition delay {{has been proposed}} and demonstrated. This method proposes a new Bayesian statistical model to resolve the start of combustion, defined as being {{the point at which}} the band-pass in-cylinder pressure deviates from background noise and the combustion resonance begins. Further, it is demonstrated that this method is still accurate in situations where there is noise present. The start of combustion can be resolved for each cycle without the need for ad hoc methods such as cycle averaging. Therefore, this method allows for analysis of consecutive cycles and inter-cycle variability studies. Ignition delay obtained by this method and by the net rate of heat release have been shown to give good agreement. However, the use of combustion resonance to determine the start of combustion is preferable over the net rate of heat release method because it does not rely on knowledge of heat losses and will still function accurately in the presence of noise. Results for a six-cylinder turbo-charged common-rail diesel engine run with neat diesel fuel at full, three quarters and <b>half</b> <b>load</b> have been presented. Under these conditions the ignition delay was shown to increase as the load was decreased with a significant increase in ignition delay at <b>half</b> <b>load,</b> when compared with three quarter and full loads...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} high rate vermicomposting {{of sewage sludge}} using high stocking densities of earthworms. To examine the loading capacity, two vermicompost beds were established in identical 0. 84 in diameter reactors, one loaded at an average rate of 10 kg-wet-sludge-mixture m(- 2) day(- 1) (0. 5 kg-carbon m(- 2) day(- 1)), the other loaded at 20 kg-wet-sludge-mixture m(- 2) day(- 1) (1 kg-carbon m(- 2) day(- 1)). The sludge mixture was from a commercial vermicomposting company (Vermitecho) and contained 80 - 90 % sludge and 10 - 20 % green waste and clay. The beds were operated in fed-batch mode for 38 days, and then monitored for a further 12 days without any further sludge loading. Earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were added once or twice weekly over the 38 days loading period to gradually decrease the ratio of sludge loading rate to total earthworm biomass. By adding earthworm incrementally, the feeding rate ranged from 3. 9 to 1. 25 kg-wet-sludge kg-earthworm(- 1) day(- 1) for the full load experiment and 2 - 0. 62 kg-wet-sludge kg-earthworm- 1 day(- 1) for the <b>half</b> <b>load</b> experiment. The extent of degradation was estimated by fitting a 1 st order model to the CO 2 production rate from the beds. Based on the 1 st order model, 53 +/- 20 % (95 % CI) and 68 +/- 4 % of the organic carbon was converted to CO 2 -C in the full <b>load</b> and <b>half</b> <b>load</b> experiments respectively. The CO 2 production rate in the <b>half</b> <b>load</b> experiment became stable and repeatable when the total earthworm biomass reached 5. 4 kg, corresponding to a feed rate of 1. 04 kg-wet-sludge-mixture kg-earth worm(- 1) 1 day(- 1). In contrast, the rate of CO 2 production was still climbing and traces of methane were evident in the full load experiment {{at the end of}} the 38 day loading period. The experiments indicate that high rate vermicomposting beds are sustainable providing the feeding rate does not exceed approximately 1 kg-wet-sludge kg-earthworm(- 1) day(- 1).
