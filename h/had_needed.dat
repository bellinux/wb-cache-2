5|$|The quadrangular castle {{design that}} emerged in France during the 13th century was another {{development}} that removed {{the need for a}} keep. Castles <b>had</b> <b>needed</b> additional living space since their first emergence in the 9th century; initially this had been provided by halls in the bailey, then later by ranges of chambers alongside the inside of a bailey wall, such as at Goodrich. But French designs in the late 12th century took the layout of a contemporary unfortified manor house, whose rooms faced around a central, rectangular courtyard, and built a wall around them to form a castle. The result, illustrated initially at Yonne, and later at Château de Farcheville, was a characteristic quadrangular layout with four large, circular corner towers. It lacked a keep, which was not needed to support this design.|$|E

They drew 12–12 with Japan in Bordeaux, conceding an injury-time try by Koji Taira. In their final game they lost 37–6 to an Australian side consisting mostly of second-string players.

25|$|Taberner House {{was built}} between 1964 and 1967, {{designed}} by architect H. Thornley, with Allan Holt and Hugh Lea as borough engineers. Although the council <b>had</b> <b>needed</b> extra space since the 1920s, {{it was only}} with the imminent creation of the London Borough of Croydon that action was taken. The building, being demolished in 2014, was in classic 1960s style, praised at the time but subsequently much derided. It has its elegant upper slab block narrowing towards both ends, a formal device which {{has been compared to}} the famous Pirelli Tower in Milan. It was named after Ernest Taberner OBE, Town Clerk from 1937 to 1963. Until September 2013, Taberner House housed most of the council's central employees and was the main location for the public to access information and services, particularly with respect to housing.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, ADMARC <b>had</b> <b>needed</b> to {{sell the}} {{strategic}} reserve to repay its loans, and after a poor harvest later in 1997, maize stocks were low and consumer prices high. Rainfall in 1997/98 was erratic and the 1998 crop was also poor: ADMARC released reserves and imported maize to prevent famine. The 1999 and 2000 harvests were good, with large sweet potato and cassava crops {{as the result of}} USAIDprojects to promote drought-resistant foods. ADMARC undertook a partial sale of its reserves in 2000, as it could not pay the interest its commercial loans. Sales, including some exports at low prices continued in 2001 despite a poor harvest. The harvest of 2002 was also disappointing, and failure to prevent food shortages caused deaths from hunger and related diseases, mainly in 2002. Estimates of the death toll ranged from a semi-official figure of 500 to 1,000 to credible reports by NGO over 1,000. The harvest of 2003 was also poor and that of 2004 was deficient in maize and in root crops; the next satisfactory harvest was in 2005. Rural poverty increased and by 2005, about 14% of Malawian adult were HIV positive.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, {{official}} histories {{were being}} written by three departments at the War Office {{and one in}} the Admiralty. Lord Esher chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence, suggested that a subcommittee be established as the Historical Section, to centralise the collection of army and navy archives, as a repository of the lessons of war for strategists. Esher thought that the lessons of the South African War (11 October 1899 – 31 May 1902) could not be shown unless the naval, military and political aspects of the war were treated as one. In January 1907, the subcommittee was established with Sir George Clarke as chairman, charged with the completion of an official history of the Boer War. The original account was begun by Colonel G. F. R. Henderson (1854–1903), before ill health forced him to retire. Before he died, Henderson had completed a narrative up {{to the beginning of the}} war but it was not published. A later version, (History of the war in South Africa 1899–1902, four volumes, 1906–1910) by Major-General J. F. Maurice reached publication but <b>had</b> <b>needed</b> a large number of assistants, which increased the price of the book; it was favourably received but did not sell well.|$|E

25|$|Although Loyola {{had closed}} their deficit, the Bearcats {{continued}} to stall on offense. A field goal by Hunter cut Cincinnati's advantage to one point, 51–50, entering the final minute. The Bearcats {{came out of}} their stall and ran a fast break, which was capped by a Thacker basket. With 17 seconds on the clock, Hunter responded by scoring again, bringing the Ramblers back within one point. Harkness fouled Shingleton with 12 seconds on the clock, sending him to the free throw line for two attempts. Making both would put the Bearcats {{on the verge of}} winning the NCAA championship, as there were no three-point field goals at the time. After making one free throw, Shingleton was off on his second try, and Hunter secured the rebound for Loyola. Miller received the ball and juggled it briefly; Ireland and Fimrite believed that he had been guilty of traveling, but it was not called a violation on the court. Miller passed the ball to Harkness, who attempted a 12-foot jumper. His shot was good, tying the game at 54–54. Jucker attempted to call a timeout, but the referees did not hear his request due to crowd noise and the clock expired with the game still tied. A five-minute overtime period was required to break the deadlock. Three previous NCAA finals <b>had</b> <b>needed</b> one, including the Bearcats' 1961 title game.|$|E
25|$|Arsenal's {{second game}} in the Emirates Cup was against Ligue 1 runners up Monaco. Wenger fielded a 4–3–3 formation, which saw the {{introduction}} of first team names Wojciech Szczęsny, Laurent Koscielny, Jack Wilshere, Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud into the side. Summer signings Sánchez and Chambers started the match, which also served as the debut for £12million signing Mathieu Debuchy. Arsenal <b>had</b> <b>needed</b> only a draw to claim the Emirates Cup and entered the game looking for that draw. However, Monaco were gifted the only goal of the match in the 37th minute when Radamel Falcao was given {{the freedom of the}} Arsenal penalty area to head home João Moutinho’s free-kick, awarded for Wilshere's clumsy lunge on Nabil Dirar, a challenge that booked the English midfielder. Having won 5–1 against Benfica 24 hours earlier, Arsenal struggled against the French side and created {{little in the way of}} clear-cut chances. Sánchez played on both flanks and then through the middle in the second period before being withdrawn in the 74th minute. Following the introduction of Chuba Akpom into the side, Arsenal showed direct running and looked for an equaliser. Akpom, who replaced Sánchez, was brought down by Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subašić as Akpom burst into the box, only for referee Martin Atkinson to award a free-kick rather than a penalty— despite replays showing the foul was clearly inside the area. The game finished 1–0 to Monaco, and with Valencia winning 3–1 against Benfica earlier that day, the Spanish side won the trophy.|$|E
25|$|Five matches {{were played}} from Friday to Sunday; the VB Series began with two matches, while a full round of ING Cup matches was {{played on the}} Saturday. On Friday the 13th, Australia beat Sri Lanka by 116 runs in the tri-series opener, with Sri Lanka's two most {{experienced}} bowlers, Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan, yielding combined bowling figures of 20–1–140–0, while in the ING Cup, the Warriors won and earned a bonus point at home after chasing down 198 {{to win in the}} fortieth over, with Justin Langer getting a half-century. The following day, the Bushrangers beat the Blues to cut the deficit {{at the top of the}} table to six points, with Gerard Denton and Cameron White sharing six wickets between them. Chasing 188 to win, the Bushrangers were three for 160, but lost four wickets in 23 balls before Andrew McDonald's 14 not out took them across the line. In the final match, the Tigers and the Redbacks tied in a match that was cut from 50 to 35 overs a side following rain. Michael Bevan made 54 for the Tigers, who chased a revised target of 172 to win, and when Bevan was dismissed the Tigers required 13 off 14 balls. Three more wickets fell, Shaun Tait taking two in an over, and both teams had to be content with the tie. Finally, South Africa beat Australia by five wickets on a Sunday game in Brisbane, with Brett Lee conceding 17 off his final over after South Africa <b>had</b> <b>needed</b> 47 off 30 balls.|$|E
