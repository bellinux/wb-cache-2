500|$|After being knifed in {{the back}} by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) in the third season finale, Naomi uses her {{satellite}} phone to call George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on the freighter. [...] Before she dies, she tells him that her injury was an accident and to give her love to her sister. [...] Meanwhile, Hurley finds Jacob's cabin. [...] He looks {{through the window and}} sees an unidentified man in a rocking chair, before someone steps up to the glass, only the left eye visible. [...] Hurley runs away, but finds the cabin again—in a different location. [...] He squeezes his <b>eyes</b> <b>shut</b> and when he opens them, the building is gone and Locke appears.|$|E
500|$|In {{the right}} panel, Dyer is shown with his <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> {{vomiting}} into a hand basin. In the two outer frames his figure is shadowed by arrows, pictorial devices that Bacon {{often used to}} place a sense of energy into his paintings. In this work, the arrows point to a man about to die, and according to Tóibín they scream [...] "Here!", [...] "Him!". The arrow of the right panel, according to Tóibín, points to a [...] "dead figure on the lavatory bowl, as though telling the Furies where to find him". The triptych is centralised by the lightbulb, and {{by the fact that}} Dyer faces inwards in the two outer canvasses. The triptych's composition and setting are poised to suggest instability, and the doors in each side panel are splayed outwards as if to look into the darkness of the foreground.|$|E
500|$|Gestation {{is nearly}} three months long. The number of cubs born can vary from one to eight, though the common number is three to five. Birth {{takes place in a}} {{sheltered}} place such as thick vegetation. Each cub weighs nearly [...] at birth; the <b>eyes,</b> <b>shut</b> at birth, open in 4to 11 days. Newborn cubs can crawl and spit; they can start walking by two weeks. Their nape, shoulders and back are thickly covered with long bluish grey hair. This downy underlying fur, called a [...] "mantle", gives them a Mohawk-type appearance; this fur is shed as the cheetah grows older. A study noted that this mane gives a cheetah cub the appearance of the honey badger; this could act as a camouflage in both animals. Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable during the first few weeks of their life; mothers keep their cubs hidden in dense vegetation for the first month.|$|E

500|$|Travel writer Cash Peters {{identifies}} six characteristics {{common to}} many of the museum's artworks. The first is that MOBA artists are unable to render hands or feet, and mask them by extending figures' arms off the canvas, hiding them with long sleeves, or placing shoes on feet in inappropriate scenarios. Second, Peters compared artists Rembrandt and J. M. W. Turner, masters of landscapes, who [...] "could probably paint with their eyes shut" [...] to MOBA artists who apparently did paint with their <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> as skies are often painted in any color but blue, flora are created without reference to any existing plant organisms, and fauna appear so small in the background it is impossible to discern what kind of animals they are. Third, MOBA artists apply perspective inconsistently, either from one painting to the next, or within a single work. [...] Peters's fourth observation concerns the difficulty MOBA artists seem to have in successfully rendering noses: he writes that a nose will be attempted so many times that the work takes on a third dimension as paint is reapplied over and over. Fifth, bad artists favor [...] "mixed media": if in doubt, they glue feathers, glitter, or hair to their work. Lastly, Peters suggests that artists know their work is bad, but apparently feel the piece may be saved by including a monkey or a poodle in the composition.|$|E
2500|$|There were naysayers, and the commonest {{criticism}} {{was that the}} production distracted the viewer from the play by prioritizing Brook's cleverness over Shakespeare's; one reviewer called it a [...] "self-indulgent display of directorial gimmickry". Theatre historian John Russell Brown felt that the play was constrained by Brook's eccentric personal interpretations. However, even those critics who disliked the staging choices praised the verse-speaking for its clarity and freshness. One Shakespearean scholar supposedly watched it with his <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> loving the acting, but hating the visuals.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the three}} gods {{are at the}} falls, Ótr (in {{the form of an}} otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead Ótr) and show him their catches, {{including}} the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar [...] "seized them and made them ransom their lives" [...] in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.|$|E

2500|$|The {{different}} {{names of the}} game are more recent. The first print reference to [...] "noughts and crosses", the British name, appeared in 1864. In his novel Can You Forgive Her? (1864) Anthony Trollope refers to a clerk playing [...] "tit-tat-toe". The first print reference to a game called [...] "tick-tack-toe" [...] occurred in 1884, but referred to [...] "a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the <b>eyes</b> <b>shut</b> to bring the pencil {{down on one of}} the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored". [...] "Tic-tac-toe" [...] may also derive from [...] "tick-tack", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of [...] "noughts and crosses" [...] as [...] "tic-tac-toe" [...] occurred in the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Devotion to Muhammad is an {{exceptionally}} strong practice within Sufism. Sufis have historically revered Muhammad {{as the prime}} personality of spiritual greatness. The Sufi poet Saadi Shirazi stated, [...] "He who chooses a path contrary {{to that of the}} prophet , shall never reach the destination. O Saadi, do not think that one can treat that way of purity except {{in the wake of the}} chosen one [...]" [...] Rumi attributes his self-control and abstinence from worldly desires as qualities attained by him through the guidance of Muhammad. Rumi states, [...] "I 'sewed' my two <b>eyes</b> <b>shut</b> from [...] this world and the next – this I learned from Muhammad." [...] Ibn Arabi regards Muhammad as the greatest man and states, [...] "Muhammad's wisdom is uniqueness (fardiya) because he is the most perfect existent creature of this human species. For this reason, the command began with him and was sealed with him. He was a Prophet while Adam was between water and clay, and his elemental structure is the Seal of the Prophets." [...] Attar of Nishapur claimed that he praised Muhammad in such a manner that was not done before by any poet, in his book the Ilahi-nama. Fariduddin Attar stated, [...] "Muhammad is the exemplar to both worlds, the guide of the descendants of Adam. He is the sun of creation, the moon of the celestial spheres, the all-seeing eye...The seven heavens and the eight gardens of paradise were created for him, he is both the eye and the light in the light of our eyes." [...] Sufis have historically stressed the importance of Muhammad's perfection and his ability to intercede. The persona of Muhammad has historically been and remains an integral and critical aspect of Sufi belief and practice. Bayazid Bastami is recorded to have been so devoted to the sunnah of Muhammad that he refused to eat a watermelon due to the fact that he could not establish that Muhammad ever ate one.|$|E
