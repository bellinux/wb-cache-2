5|$|Four {{species of}} small mammal are {{considered}} native: the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), the Jersey bank vole (Myodes glareolus caesarius), the Lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura suaveolens) and the French shrew (Sorex coronatus). Three wild mammals are well-established introductions: the rabbit ({{introduced in the}} mediaeval period), the red squirrel and the hedgehog (both introduced in the 19th century). The stoat (Mustela erminea) became extinct in Jersey between 1976 and 2000. The <b>Green</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta bilineata) is a protected species of reptile; Jersey is its only habitat in the British Isles.|$|E
25|$|The {{island is}} home to a variety of reptiles. The Balkan terrapin (Mauremys rivulata) can be found near fresh water along with the Greek marsh frog (Pelophylax kurtmuelleri), though this habitat is slowly disappearing due to development. The Balkan wall lizard (Podarcis taurica) is seen {{regularly}} in daylight in warm weather and the Hemidactylus turcicus at night. A larger lizard is the Balkan <b>green</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta trilineata). Several varieties of snakes can be observed: the Montpellier snake (Malpolon monspessulanus), the leopard snake (Elephe situla), the large whip snake (Coluber jugularis), the grass snake (Natrix natrix), and a species of viper.|$|E

The mammals recorded are: badger (Meles meles), beech marten (Martes foina), fox (Vulpes vulpes), [...] red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and soforth. There are also several species of avifauna. The reptile species reported include Aesculapian snake (Elaphe longissima), European <b>green</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta viridis), Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), horned viper (Vipera ammodytes), spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), and wall lizard (Podarcis muralis). Animals, which are under different protection categories, reported in the park are: black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo), lesser spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina), marbled polecat (Vormela peregusna), Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), and Romanian hamster (Mesocricetus newtoni).|$|E

40|$|In spite that chemoreception is {{important}} in sexual selection for many animals, such as reptiles, the mechanisms that confer reliability to chemical signals are relatively unknown. European <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> (Lacerta viridis) have substantial amounts of α-tocopherol ( = vitamin E) in their femoral secretions. Because vitamin E is metabolically important and can only be attained from the diet, its secretion {{is assumed to be}} costly. However, its role in intraspecific communication is unknown. Here, we experimentally show that male European <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> that received a dietary supplement of vitamin E increased proportions of vitamin E in their femoral secretions. Furthermore, our experiments revealed that females preferred to use areas scent marked by males with experimentally increased vitamin E levels in their secretions. Finally, female preferences were stronger when vitamin E differences between a pair of males' secretions were larger. Our results demonstrate that female <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> are able to discriminate between males based on the vitamin E content of the males' femoral secretions. We suggest that the possible cost of allocating vitamin E to secretions, which might be dependent on male quality, may be a mechanism that confers reliability to scent marks of <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> and allows their evolution as sexual signals...|$|R

500|$|The American {{evolutionary}} zoologists Jane Van Zandt Brower and Lincoln Pierson Brower {{followed up}} the experiments {{described in the}} book (pp.153–159). Beddard, they write, observed the results of feeding the drone fly Eristalis tenax, a harmless but intimidating Batesian mimic of honeybees, to various predators. A chameleon, a <b>green</b> <b>lizard,</b> and a sand skink eagerly consumed the flies, whereas a thrush and a great spotted woodpecker did not. However, they — like Cott before them, they note — were unable to replicate Beddard's claim that toads would eat insects of any kind, including stinging bees and wasps. They describe their own experimental investigations of bees and their drone fly mimics, like Beddard using toads as the predators, concluding that the Batesian mimicry of the honeybee by the drone fly was [...] "highly effective".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{earliest}} {{world record}} of the <b>green</b> <b>lizards,</b> Lacerta viridis group, is described from the lower Miocene of Central Europe. The fossils come from greenish, calcareous marls and limnic clayey silts of the Ottnangian zone MN 4 of the Dolnice locality near Cheb in the Czech Republic. Sediments are interpreted as marginal, riparian facies. The material consists of isolated frontal bones of two different ontogenetic stages and one isolated fragment of parietal. Their morphology is identical {{to that of the}} extant members of the L. viridis group. However, the fossil material is much older than the previously described specimens of <b>green</b> <b>lizards.</b> Therefore, this finding extends our knowledge about the evolution and stratigraphic range of the group and about composition of the early Miocene herpetofauna in central Europe...|$|R

60|$|My host was an archæologist, and we ate {{surrounded}} by broken earthenware, fragmentary mosaics, and grinning skulls. It was curious afterwards to wander in the graveyard which, with indefatigable zeal, he had excavated, among the tombs of forgotten races, letting oneself down {{to explore the}} subterranean cells. The paths he had made in the giant cemetery were lined with {{a vast number of}} square sandstone boxes which had contained human ashes; and now, when the lid was lifted, a <b>green</b> <b>lizard</b> or a scorpion darted out. From the hill I saw stretched before me the great valley of the Guadalquivir: with the squares of olive and of ploughed field, and the various greens of the corn, it was like a vast, multi-coloured carpet. But later, with the sunset, black clouds arose, splendidly piled upon one another; and the twilight air was chill and grey. A certain sternness came over the olive-groves, and they might well have served as a reproach to the facile Andaluz; for their cold passionless green seemed to offer a warning to his folly.|$|E
6000|$|The hours passed; {{the cool}} breeze changed to hot; the sun blazed over the canyon wall; the stones scorched; the flies buzzed. I {{fell asleep in}} the scant shade of the sage bushes and awoke, stifled and moist. The old plainsman, never weary, leaned with his back against a stone and watched, with narrow gaze, the canyon below. The steely walls hurt my eyes; the sky was like hot copper. Though nearly wild with heat and aching bones and muscles and the long hours of wait--wait--wait, I was ashamed to complain, for there sat the old man, still and silent. I routed out a hairy {{tarantula}} from under a stone and teased him into a frenzy with my stick, {{and tried to get}} up a fight between him and a scallop-backed horned-toad that blinked wonderingly at me. Then I espied a <b>green</b> <b>lizard</b> on a stone. The beautiful reptile was about a foot in length, bright green, dotted with red, and he had diamonds for eyes. Nearby a purple flower blossomed, delicate and pale, with a bee sucking at its golden heart. I observed then that the lizard had his jewel eyes upon the bee; he slipped {{to the edge of the}} stone, flicked out a long, red tongue, and tore the insect from its honeyed perch. Here were beauty, life and death; and I had been weary for something to look at, to think about, to distract me from the wearisome wait! ...|$|E

40|$|Consistent {{individual}} differences within (animal personality) and across (behavioural syndrome) behaviours became well recognized {{during the past}} decade. Nevertheless, our knowledge about the evolutionary and developmental mechanisms behind the phenomena is still incomplete. Here, we explored if risk-taking and exploration were consistent and linked to different ecologically relevant traits in wild-caught adult male European <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> (Lacerta viridis) and in their 2 – 3 weeks old laboratory-reared offspring. Both adults and juveniles displayed animal personality, consistency being higher in juveniles. We found correlation between risk-taking and exploration (suggestive of a behavioural syndrome) only in adults. Juveniles were more explorative than adults. Large or ectoparasite-free adult males were more explorative than small or parasitized males. Juvenile females {{tended to be more}} risk-taking than males. Behaviour of fathers and their offspring did not correlate. We conclude that European <b>green</b> <b>lizards</b> show high behavioural consistency and age is an important determinant of its strength and links to traits likely affecting fitness...|$|R
