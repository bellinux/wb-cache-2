5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> are seen in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|Experiments and {{observations}} show that Einstein's description of gravitation accounts for several <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in {{the orbits of}} Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, most recently gravitational waves.|$|E

50|$|The {{magnetization}} occurs {{parallel to}} the axis of spin. Barnett was motivated by a prediction by Owen Richardson in 1908, later named the Einstein-de Haas <b>effect,</b> <b>that</b> magnetizing a ferromagnet can induce a mechanical rotation. He instead looked for the opposite <b>effect,</b> <b>that</b> is, that spinning a ferromagnet could change its magnetization. He established the effect with {{a long series of}} experiments between 1908 and 1915.|$|R
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to high ambient pressure have physiological <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration of human dives, and allow different types {{of work to be}} done.|$|E

5|$|Narcosis {{is known}} to be {{additive}} to even minimal alcohol intoxication, and also to the effects of other drugs such as cannabis (which is more likely than alcohol to have <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> last into a day of abstinence from use). Other sedative and analgesic drugs, such as opiate narcotics and benzodiazepines, add to narcosis.|$|E
5|$|Sega later {{produced}} gun games which resemble first-person light gun video games, {{but were}} in fact electro-mechanical games that used rear image projection {{in a manner similar}} to a zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen. An early example of this was Duck Hunt, which Sega released in 1969; it featured animated moving targets on a screen, printed out the player's score on a ticket, and had sound <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> were volume controllable.|$|E
5|$|Steering may be {{supplied}} by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself. This self-stability {{is generated by}} a combination of several <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> depend on the geometry, mass distribution, and forward speed of the bike. Tires, suspension, steering damping, and frame flex can also influence it, especially in motorcycles.|$|E

5|$|The list of benzodiazepines {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of insomnia is fairly similar among most countries, but which benzodiazepines are officially designated as first-line hypnotics prescribed {{for the treatment of}} insomnia varies between countries. Longer-acting benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam and diazepam have residual <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> may persist into the next day and are, in general, not recommended.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Markham Bypass was to link Highway48 with Highway401 via the Morningside Avenue extension through Toronto. York Region planned for a continuous connection between the bypass and Morningside, meeting Steeles Avenue west of its intersection with Ninth Line. However, Toronto resisted, citing the environmental <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> would come from two new crossings over the Rouge River.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{structural}} and biochemical <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> viruses {{have on the}} host cell is extensive. These are called cytopathic effects. Most virus infections eventually result {{in the death of}} the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis, alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis. Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activities because of suppression by virus-specific proteins, not all of which are components of the virus particle.|$|E

5|$|While {{the cast}} {{departed}} {{to work on}} other projects, the post-production team was tasked with finalizing the film {{in time for a}} Christmas release; the resulting work would take twice as long as the filming process had taken. Editor Todd Ramsay and assistants spent principal photography syncing film and audio tracks. The resulting rough cuts were used to formulate plans for sound effects, music, and optical <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> would be added later.|$|E
5|$|With its {{demand for}} hardness, clarity and {{precision}} and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant subjective emotions Imagism had later <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> are demonstratable in T. S. Eliot's 'Preludes' and 'Morning at the Window' and in D. H. Lawrence's animal and flower pieces. The rejection of conventional verse {{forms in the}} nineteen-twenties owed much to the Imagists repudiation of the Georgian Poetry style.|$|E

5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E
5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E
5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
