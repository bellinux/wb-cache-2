His instruction encompassed a broad array of subjects that included mathematics, political economy, logic, history and geography. He learned to speak and write not only in Portuguese, but also Latin and French. He could translate from English and understood German.

5|$|StarCraft, {{along with}} its {{expansion}} Brood War, rapidly grew in popularity in South Korea, establishing a successful professional gaming scene. Some pro-gamers have gained television contracts, sponsorships, and tournament prizes, allowing the most famous player, Lim Yo-Hwan, who is known in-game as SlayerS `BoxeR`, to gain a fanclub of over a half million people. Professional gamers dedicate many hours <b>each</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> playing StarCraft when preparing for the highly competitive leagues. Lee Yun-Yeol, a Terran player known as NaDa, reported earnings in 2005 of US$200,000. In April 2009, a Collegiate Star League was formed in the U.S. to facilitate inter-collegiate competition amongst university teams and clubs. On October 2009, the first live collegiate StarCraft match occurred between Rutgers University and Princeton University in a best-of-five series.|$|E

The Andorian female cast members took around four and a half hour <b>each</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> get into make-up and costume, but on the first day Brink required further make-up time as that day's shoot required her to appear in-character in her underwear. This meant that after the normal make-up schedule, she was sprayed blue from head to toe. At the end of that day's filming, the shower facilities at the studio's executive gym was used to remove the paint. Meanwhile, the Romulan make-up took three hours to apply, with all the relevant scenes completed in a single day.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} has a {{metabolic}} rate {{two or three}} times that of comparatively sized terrestrial mammals. It must eat an estimated 25 to 38% of its own body weight in food <b>each</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> burn the calories necessary to counteract the loss of heat due to the cold water environment. Its digestive efficiency is estimated at 80 to 85%, and food is digested and passed in as little as three hours. Most of its need for water is met through food, although, in contrast to most other marine mammals, it also drinks seawater. Its relatively large kidneys enable it to derive fresh water from sea water and excrete concentrated urine.|$|E
5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title Woman on Trial. When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the play The Night is Young. After the play opened, he considered changing its name <b>each</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> match the current date.|$|E

5|$|Although the Giants played well, {{the team}} {{experienced}} financial hardship {{during its first}} year. Player salaries were so low that most had to take additional jobs to support themselves. The team's brief practices, held at 4:30 p. m. <b>each</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> accommodate outside-work schedules, enabled little in-season improvement. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925 and owner Tim Mara spent $25,000 {{of his own money}} during the season to keep the team going. The financial struggle continued until the 11th game of the season, when the visiting Red Grange and the Chicago Bears drew more than 73,000 fans (a pro-football record) and an additional 20,000 were turned away. This gave the Giants much-needed revenue, possibly altering the team's history. In the 19–7 Bears victory, Grange intercepted a pass intended for Bomar and returned it for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE started {{test flights}} on 14 March 1956, with the service taking 20 minutes from Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The {{scheduled}} service was inaugurated on 21 May as {{a stop on}} Braathens SAFE's route between Oslo and Stavanger Airport, Sola. Passengers could travel twice <b>each</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> both airports, with tickets costing NOK30. The service was seasonal and only flown during the summer half of the year. Notodden Airport proved to have too few passengers, resulting in the route being terminated {{after the end of}} the 1958 season. The last season, the service was operated by Thor Solberg on contract with Braathens SAFE. From 1959, Solberg started with a two-month service with six weekly round trips to Fornebu, after securing a NOK5,000 guarantee from the municipality to cover any losses. The route was abandoned after the single season.|$|E
5|$|Breeders {{would choose}} {{potential}} exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, {{and they would}} be given a great deal of extra attention. They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours <b>each</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> keep them in as good a physical condition as possible. Before the show, their legs and feet would be washed, their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with linseed oil. While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal before the show to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the ducks with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible. Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks, with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin. By the beginning of the 20thcentury the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat.|$|E

5|$|On 1 August 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank {{issued a}} decree {{requiring}} all Kraków Jews {{to leave the}} city within the next two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto <b>each</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> their jobs at the factory. Enlargements to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of an outpatient clinic, co-op, kitchen, and dining room for the workers, in addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim's economy: the fishing {{industry}}, from the fishing vessels that put in <b>each</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> the canning industry and to the city's fish market, beach agriculture, and seaweed-gathering for fertilizing fields are the result of its geography. Tourism and the related industries are more relevant in Póvoa's economy these days, as fisheries have lost importance. Nevertheless, the mean value of fish landed in 2004, in its seaport, was almost three times that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher in the average vessels' capacity. Its fishing productivity is also comparatively higher than the national average. A Poveira is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production, 80 to 85%, is exported and deals with high-end brands in canned fish, for MDC markets. Export market brands include: Poveira, D'Henry IV, Ala-Arriba, Minerva, and Alva.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth <b>each</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E
