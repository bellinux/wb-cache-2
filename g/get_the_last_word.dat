When there was no bacillus it was assumed that, since no disease could exist without a bacillus, it was simply eluding observation. When the bacillus was found, as it frequently was, in persons who were not suffering from the disease, the theory was saved by simply calling the bacillus an impostor, or pseudobacillus. The same boundless credulity which the public exhibit as to a doctor's power of diagnosis was shown by the doctors themselves as to the analytic microbe hunters. These witch finders would give you a certificate of the ultimate constitution of anything from a sample of the water from your well to a scrap of your lungs, for seven-and-sixpense. I do not suggest that the analysts were dishonest. No doubt they carried the analysis as far as they could afford to carry it for the money.

40|$|Turning {{from the}} {{substantive}} issue of defining charity, this article considers the “who” question {{by examining the}} roles of the courts, legislatures, municipalities, and charities in determining exemption and payments in lieu of taxes. The three covered topics – constitutional power, statutory interpretation, and the “intermediate sanctions” of user fees and PILOTs – braid together to form the procedural framework for the financial relationship between nonprofit property owners and the taxing jurisdictions that host them. Change the parameters of one, and you change the others. Staying off the rolls or minimizing the tax bite often results from compromise – whether at the state constitutional level; in state statutes; as a matter of assessment; or through negotiation with local governmental bodies. But such an application of a multi-level framework for mischief leads to legal incoherence. The article begins with the knockdown, drag-out separation-of-powers fight that has arisen in Illinois and Pennsylvania: Which branch, the judicial or legislative, defines “charities” granted exemption by the state constitution? Next up is the more mundane world of statutory interpretation, where even here courts second-guess the legislature. A June 2015 decision by the New Jersey tax court exemplifies what could be view as “passive-aggressive separation of powers,” when the court basically says, “Surely the legislature could not have meant this entity (or this use of property) to qualify as charity. ” This latest decision not only seems to render all “sophisticated centers of medical care” in New Jersey taxable, but also is causing sleepless nights for Princeton University: The same judge is hearing a challenge to the university’s exemption brought by local taxpayers. New Jersey’s January 2016 proposed legislation fell a pocket veto short of enactment: It would have imposed a formulary community-service fee on nonprofit hospitals. Legislative efforts are again underway. Perhaps such a third-way solution might become more common. Voluntary agreements for payments in lieu of taxes are literally all over the map, from Boston’s revamped comprehensive PILOT program to a Florida appellate court’s striking of a PILOT program as inconsistent with statutory exemption.

40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{response}} to an article by: Eskridge Jr., William N., The Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s Perry Decision and the Constitutional Politics of Marriage Equality, in 64 Stan. L. Rev. Online 93 (2012). This essay examines the impact of Perry v. Brown, 671 F. 3 d 1052 (9 th Cir. 2012), the first appellate federal court decision on the constitutional validity of marriage exclusion laws. The author argues that the major contribution of the Perry decision is to illuminate the meaning of animus, a term that is sharply contested in Equal Protection jurisprudence, and to explicate its relationship to standards of review. The Ninth Circuit holds that evidence of animosity toward a disfavored group triggers a heightened rational basis standard of review. The Supreme Court has not yet settled on how to analyze evidence of animus. In his dissent in Romer v. Evans, Justice Scalia ridiculed the idea that believing homosexuality to be immoral could be compared to racial or religious bias. By contrast, in her concurrence in Lawrence v. Texas, Justice O’Connor articulated the principle adopted by the Ninth Circuit in Perry: that laws driven by animus toward a social group are subject to a “more searching” version of rational basis review. The majority of Justices, however, appear to be gunshy about even acknowledging the existence of heightened rational basis review, even though they have been relying on it sub silentio for several decades. The Perry court provides the fullest articulation of it to date. The Court of Appeals in Perry also takes a new perspective on how courts should assess the validity of popularly enacted initiatives such as Proposition 8. For both proponents and opponents of popular constitutionalism, the gay marriage debates raise the question of whether voters or courts should <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> in a constitutional democracy when they take polar opposite positions on a minority rights issue. The Perry opinion would impose less a death knell to such initiatives than a set of speed bumps, through which courts would analyze whether a discriminatory provision was the retraction of a right or a failure to extend it, and whether it had a demonstrably legitimate purpose, other than simply the imposition of stigma. In the gay marriage context, the court left open the possibility that limiting marriage to different sex couples could be justified by the desire to discourage “accidental procreation. ” However, based on evidence about the campaign to pass Proposition 8, the court found that animus had been the dominant motivation in this case...|$|E

40|$|This essay aims {{to explore}} two {{opposite}} {{understandings of the}} relevance and justification {{of the use of}} history. On one side we find the claim that historical examples lost their significance in the period between the eighteenth and the nineteenth century, due to the change of the notion of history, causing history to lose it's timeliness and therefore it's ability to educate morally. On the other side we meet a nineteenth century argumentation recognizing this tendency though underlining that untimely history is capable of moral instruction. The starting point of this essay is set in the sentence appointed by Cicero, historia magistra vitae, which defines history as the misstress of life. The definition of this sentence is {{based on the belief that}} it is possible to draw from the experience of others as be they one's own. Reinhart Koselleck (1923 - 2006) sets out the claim that history loses it's morally educative significance in the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. The essay challenges this view through three early works of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 - 1900). It was about to lose it's significance, because science at the time was fixated with finding the historical background for everything, without considering the use of it. He opposes to Koselleck's thesis by exemplifying how Ancient Greece is exactly what present time needs to get back on track from the scientific derail. The two agree on the term that the ideal of historia magistra vitae is dismantled but they disagree on the outcome of this situation. Koselleck sums up the situation from a viewpoint distant to the time of action claiming that the result of it all is history being valuable only to itself. Nietzsche though <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> saying that life is the ultimate goal of the use of history...|$|R

At one point in Giardello's career, Harris {{proved to be a}} useful ally whom Gee could turn to; that relationship, however, deteriorates with Gee's growing acts of command-oriented rebellion. Harris had asked Detective Frank Pembleton to cover up a scandal involving congressman Jeremy Wade, which nonetheless resulted in a lost election. Despite having ordered Pembleton to leave him out of the cover up, Harris believed Giardello could have done more to protect the Congressman in the aftermath. To punish Gee, Harris purposefully promotes an incompetent and bigoted officer named Roger Gaffney to a captain's position that Gee had earned and expected. As Gaffney is a [...] "fat Irish ass" [...] very much like Gee's racist training partner Mickey Shea, Harris sends Gee a reminder that his days in the BPD will be subject to dealing with contempt from the department's upper command. Gee, however, <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> on Harris after the fallout with the African Revival Movement, in which Harris' one-time partner Burundi Robinson provides Gee with incriminating information regarding Harris and a drug case where a large amount of heroin went missing: Harris stole the drugs and sold them to a dealer, and when Robinson protested they decided to flip a coin, with the loser resigning and the winner burying the story. After Robinson's suicide, Gee leaks this information to the press, and Harris is forced to resign in disgrace, with the ever-pleasant Gaffney pretending that he's upset about Harris' [...] "long and distinguished career" [...] being ruined because he wants to anger Gee.

What the play does not mention is that she wrote several books, including An English Woman In America, A Lady's Life In The Rocky Mountains, and Among the Tibetans. Her adventures take her to {{all corners of the}} world. At dinner Isabella tells everyone that she was first instructed to travel by a doctor who thought it would improve her poor health. Following this advice she took her first trip, a sea voyage to America in 1854. As mentioned in the play, she lived with her mother and her younger sister for a long time, Henrietta Bird, who she often talks about with great affection throughout the dinner party. She also mentions Jim Nugent at the party, a man with whom she spent quite a bit of time in America. Outside of the play, Jim was in love with Isabella but she never paid attention to his advances. In real life she once {{wrote in a letter to}} her sister [...] "He is a man any woman might love, but no sane woman would marry." [...] Jim would later be found murdered. Isabella is an interesting character at the dinner party in the play, because she seems to have the most in common with Marlene. Isabella, like Marlene, did not marry young because of her career, but later married Dr. John Bishop, who died two days before their 5th anniversary.

These two writers, born a generation apart, are both regionalists whose works transcend regionalism, but otherwise they seem as different in style and thematic concerns as two contemporary authors can be.
