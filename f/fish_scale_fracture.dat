The results show that microneedles produced from the nanocellulose loaded <b>fish</b> <b>scale</b> biopolymer requires higher temperature for micromolding (80 ± 5 °C) than microneedles from only <b>fish</b> <b>scale</b> biopolymer, which were moldable at 50 ± 5 °C. The mechanical properties of the <b>fish</b> <b>scale</b> biopolymer-nanocellulose (FSBP-NC) films showed that the addition of nanocellulose (NC) resulted in lower elongation and higher tensile stress compared to <b>fish</b> <b>scale</b> biopolymer (FSBP) films. The nanocellulose also prevented dissolution of the needles and absorbed up to 300 % and 234 % its own weight in water (8 % and 12 % w/w NC/FSBP), whereas FSBP films dissolved completely within 1 min, Indicating that the FSBP-NC films can be used to produce microneedles with prolonged dissolution rate. FTIR spectrometry of the FSBP films was compared with the FSBP-NC films and the NC gels. The FTIR showed typical peaks for <b>fish</b> <b>scale</b> polymer and nanocellulose with evidence of interactions.

40|$|A {{detailed}} stratigraphic and sedimentologic {{study of}} the Early Cenomanian <b>Fish</b> <b>Scales</b> Formation and the Barons Sandstone in southern Alberta, based on detailed core measurement and well log correlation, was undertaken {{in order to assess}} the principal controlling factors on the mid-Cretaceous stratigraphic fill of the Cordilleran foreland basin. Fine-grained units in the basin, such as the <b>Fish</b> <b>Scales</b> Formation (Mowry equivalent) and the Early Turonian Second White Specks Formation (Greenhorn equivalent), have traditionally been attributed to deposition during episodes of high eustatic sea levels. However, facies, allostratigraphy, and isopach patterns of the latest Albian Westgate, <b>Fish</b> <b>Scales,</b> mid–late Cenomanian Belle Fourche and Second White Specks formations in southern Alberta suggest that strata were deposited alternately during orogenic loading periods and unloading periods. We interpreted the <b>Fish</b> <b>Scales</b> Formation, a deposit formed during the marine transgression of the Mowry Seaway in the latest Albian–earliest Cenomanian, to have been deposited in a wide shallow interior seaway during an orogenic unloading period. The Barons Sandstone, interbedded with the mudstone of the <b>Fish</b> <b>Scales</b> Formation, is interpreted as a regressive shoreface, distributary channel and barrier island sandstone deposited during the unloading period. We also tentatively interpreted the Second White Specks Formation, a regional stratigraphic marker deposited during the so-called peak eustatic sea level in the Early Turonian, to have been deposited in a wide shallow interior seaway during a period of regional orogenic unloading. This study questions the significance of the Mowry Shale and Greenhorn Formation as indicators of eustatic highstands of sea level, and suggests regional tectonism as the primary control on basin evolution.

It may generate several adverse effects such as iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and reduced physical and intellectual working capacity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the Fe(II) -binding activity of collagen peptides from fishery by-products. Lates calcarifer, Mugil cephalus, Chanos chanos, and Oreochromis spp are four major cultivated fishes in Taiwan; thousands of <b>scales</b> of these <b>fish</b> are wasted without valuable utilization. In this study, <b>scales</b> of these <b>fish</b> were hydrolyzed by papain plus flavourzyme. Collagen peptides were obtained and compared for their Fe(II) -binding activity. Collagen peptides from Chanos chanos showed the highest Fe(II) -binding activity, followed by those from Lates calcarifer and Mugil cephalus; that from Oreochromis spp exhibited the lowest one. Fe(II) -binding activity of collagen peptides from <b>fish</b> <b>scales</b> was also confirmed with a dialysis method. Molecular weight (MW) distributions of the collagen peptides from <b>scales</b> of four <b>fish</b> are all < 10  kDa, and averaged 1. 3  kDa. Hydrolysates of <b>fish</b> <b>scales</b> were further partially purified with ion exchange chromatography. Fractions having Fe(II) -binding activity were obtained and their activity compared.
