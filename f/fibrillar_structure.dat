Sprucewood (Picea abies), among others, are reported to possess cellulose fibrils with a normalized diameter of 2.5 nm. There is also a reported link between the age of the wood and the spiral angle of the fibrils with respect to the longitudinal direction. Earlywood is said to have a consistent 4.6 ± 0.6° rest angle, whereas latewood is said to have a transition region from 4.6° to 19.8 ± 0.7°. [...] In latewood, the two spiral angle regions of cellulose fibrils are not continuous, meaning that there are two independent tracheid structures in “older” trees meeting different mechanical requirements. Moreover, longitudinally oriented fibrils improve tensile strength, whereas the addition of 20° tilted fibrils, exclusive to latewood tracheids, provides stability against compression.|$|E

Atomic Force Microscopy and Raman spectroscopy focused on how cross-linking affected the collagen <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure.</b> In the cross-linked fibres, a clear <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure</b> comparable to native collagen was observed which was not observed in the non-cross-linked fibre.

40|$|The {{change in}} the biaxial {{residual}} stress state of hydroxyapatite crystals and collagen <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure</b> in sections of bovine cortical bone has been investigated {{as a function of}} dehydration and radiation dose using combined small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. It is shown that dehydration of the bone has a pronounced effect on the residual stress state of the crystalline phase, while the impact of radiation damage alone is less dramatic. In the initial hydrated state, a biaxial compressive stress of approximately - 150 MPa along the bone axis exists in the hydroxyapatite crystals. As water evaporates from the bone material, the stress state moves to a tensile state of approximately 100 MPa. The collagen <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure</b> is initially in a tensile residual stress state when the bone is hydrated and the state increases in magnitude slightly with dehydration. Radiation dose in continually hydrated samples also reduces the initial biaxial compressive stress magnitude in the hydroxyapatite phase; however, the stress remains compressive.

40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}}-β (TGFβ) is a dimeric peptide growth factor which regulates {{cellular}} differentiation and proliferation during development. Most cells secrete TGFβ {{as a large}} latent TGFβ complex containing mature TGFβ, latency associated peptide, and latent TGFβ-binding protein (LTBP) - 1. The biological role of LTBP- 1 in development remains unclear. Using a polyclonal antiserum specific for LTBP- 1 (Ab 39) and three-dimensional collagen gel culture assay of embryonic heart, we examined the tissue distribution of LTBP- 1 and its functional role during the formation of endocardial cushion tissue in the mouse embryonic heart. Mature TGFβ protein was required {{at the onset of}} the endothelial-mesenchymal transformation to initiate endocardial cushion tissue formation. Double antibody staining showed that LTBP- 1 colocalized with TGFβ 1 as an extracellular <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure</b> surrounding the endocardial cushion mesenchymal cells. Immunogold electronmicroscopy showed that LTBP- 1 localized to 40 – 100 nm extracellular <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure</b> and 5 – 10 -nm microfibrils. The anti–LTBP- 1 antiserum (Ab 39) inhibited the endothelial-mesenchymal transformation in atrio-ventricular endocardial cells cocultured with associated myocardium on a three-dimensional collagen gel lattice. This inhibitory effect was reversed by administration of mature TGFβ proteins in culture. These results suggest that LTBP- 1 exists as an extracellular <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure</b> and plays a role in the storage of TGFβ as a large latent TGFβ complex...|$|E

40|$|<b>Fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> {{are common}} {{features}} on the feet of many animals, such as geckos, spiders and flies. Theoretical analyses often use periodical array to simulate the assembly, and each fibril {{is assumed to be}} of equal load sharing (ELS). On the other hand, studies on a single fibril show that the adhesive interface is flaw insensitive when the size of the fibril is not larger than a critical one. In this paper, the Dugdale-Barenblatt model has been used to study the conditions of ELS and how to enhance adhesion by tuning the geometrical parameters in <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures.</b> Different configurations in an array of fibres are considered, such as line array, square and hexagonal patterns. It is found that in order to satisfy flaw-insensitivity and ELS conditions, the number of fibrils and the pull-off force of the fibrillar interface depend significantly on the fibre separation, the interface interacting energy, the effective range of cohesive interaction and the radius of fibrils. Proper tuning of the geometrical parameters will enhance the pull-off force of the <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures.</b> This study may suggest possible methods to design strong adhesion devices for engineering applications. © 2007 The Royal Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The tensile {{strength}} of gel-spun polyethylene fibers obtained after hot-drawing depends on spinning conditions uch as spinning speed, spinning temperature, spinline stretching, polymer concentration, and molecular weight/molecular weight distribution. High deformation {{rates in the}} spinline result in shish-kebab structures which after hot-drawing lead to fibers with poor properties. This is in contrast o hot-drawn fibers obtained from gel-spun fibers with a lamellar structure. Lamellar or shish-kebab struc-tures in the gel-spun fibers can be distinguished by means of DSC experiments on strained fibers. On {{the basis of these}} xperiments a qualitative prediction of the final ten-sile properties can be made. DSC experiments on (un) strained hot-drawn fibers show {{that in the case of}} shish-kebab structures an incomplete transformation i to a <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure</b> takes place which partly explains the low {{tensile strength}}. Chain slippage which becomes possible after the orthorhombic-hexagonal ph se transition is involved in the fracture mechanism. The shift of the orthorhombic-hexagonal ph se transition to higher temperatures with increasing tensile strength indicates that he increase in strength corre-sponds to an increase in length of the crystal blocks. Consequently, creep failure also occurs at higher stresses. The melting behavior of cold-drawn and hot-drawn fibers is qualitatively similar, but the transformation i to a <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure</b> is more complete in the latter case...|$|E

40|$|An actin-like protein was {{purified}} to apparent homogeneity from chick-embryo homogenates and chick-embryo fibroblasts {{by the use}} of poly-L-proline-agarose affinity chromatography; {{we therefore}} refer to this protein as PBP (poly-L-proline-binding protein). PBP binds to deoxyribonuclease-agarose, co-migrates with known actin standards on SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and has an amino acid composition similar to that of actin. Linear peptide maps after digestion with Staphylococcus aureus proteinase reveal its apparent homology with gamma-actin; however, isoelectric-focusing experiments show that PBP is clearly more acidic than any of the three major isoforms of actin. PBP polymerizes in the presence of ATP to form <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> resembling actin paracrystalline aggregates. In chick-embryo fibroblasts, immunofluorescence with antibodies to PBP shows that its distribution is cytoplasmic: perinuclear staining of the cytoplasm, generalized cytoplasmic staining and peripheral <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> are evident. In contrast, antibodies specific for the (alpha, gamma) -actins reveal the typical stress fibre structures characteristic of fibroblastic cells.

40|$|The prion-forming C-terminal {{domain of}} the fungal prion HET-s forms {{infectious}} amyloid fibrils at physiological pH. The conformational switch from the nonprion soluble form to the prion fibrillar form {{is believed to have}} a functional role, as HETs in its prion form participates in a recognition process of different fungal strains. On the basis of the knowledge of the high-resolution structure of the prion forming domain HET-s(218 - 289) in its fibrillar form, we here present a numerical simulation of the fibril growth process, which emphasizes the role of the topological properties of the <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure.</b> An accurate thermodynamic analysis of the way an intervening HET-s chain is recruited to the tip of the growing fibril suggests that elongation proceeds through a dock and lock mechanism. First, the chain docks onto the fibril by forming the longest beta-strands. Then, the re-arrangement in the fibrillar form of {{all the rest of the}} molecule takes place. Interestingly, we also predict that one side of the HET-s fibril is more suitable for sustaining its growth with respect to the other. The resulting strong polarity of fibril growth is a consequence of the complex topology of HET-s <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure,</b> as the central loop of the intervening chain plays a crucially different role in favoring or not the attachment of the C-terminus tail to the fibril, depending on the growth side...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} and structural {{properties of the}} extracellular matrix (ECM) {{play an important role}} in regulating cell fate. The natural ECM has a complex <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure</b> and shows nonlinear mechanical properties, which are both difficult to mimic synthetically. Therefore, systematically testing the influence of ECM properties on cellular behavior is very challenging. In this work we show two different approaches to tune the <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structure</b> and mechanical properties of fibrin hydrogels. Addition of extra thrombin before gelation increases the protein density within the fibrin fibers without significantly altering the mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogel. On the other hand, by forming a composite hydrogel with a synthetic biomimetic polyisocyanide network the protein density within the fibrin fibers decreases, and the mechanics of the composite material can be tuned by the PIC/fibrin mass ratio. The effect of the changes in gel structure and mechanics on cellular behavior are investigated, by studying human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) spreading and differentiation on these gels. We find that the trends observed in cell spreading and differentiation cannot be explained by the bulk mechanics of the gels, but correlate to the density of the fibrin fibers the gels are composed of. These findings strongly suggest that the microscopic properties of individual fibers in fibrous networks play an essential role in determining cell behavior...|$|E
40|$|Tissue Engineering {{scaffolds}} with a {{wide range}} of properties and using several types of materials have been produced using different processing techniques. Among those, hybrid scaffolds, made of synthetic biodegradable and natural-origin polysaccharides, have been arising as the most adequate 3 D structures to support the mechanical solicitations once implanted as well as cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. A well-known methodology to combine micro/nanofibers with/ within scaffolds is the combination of electrospinning and bare scaffold. However, in the common approach, fibers are not homogeneously distributed along the 3 D scaffold, being limited to its surface; to achieve deposition on the interior of the scaffold, the electrospinning has to be used during bare scaffolds preparation in a complex process that may lead to structure delamination. Herein, we present a novel approach to hybridize and introduce <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> and coatings inside 3 D scaffolds, rendering truly hierarchical systems. The structures were created combining an unconventional layer-by-layer (LbL) electrostatic selfassembly technology with physical crosslinking by freeze-drying. LbL is based on a simple alternated deposition of polyanions and polycations, i. e. polyelectrolytes (PEs), and the introduction of such materials inside the scaffolds creates a new environment which allows to control cell behavior, by enhancing surface area available for cells attachment and the similarity to extracellular matrix composition and structure, without damaging the mechanical integrity and properties of the bare scaffold. Alginate and chitosan were used as polyanion and polycation, respectively, and polycaprolactone bare scaffolds were produced by rapid prototyping. Scaffolds were modified with the PEs using a homemade dipping robot to study the effect of several LbL assembling parameters on the final structure. Characterization of the structures revealed that one can obtain nanocoatings or nanocoatings plus <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> inside the scaffolds, homogeneously distributed and linked to the wall of the bare scaffold in a controlled manner. SaOs- 2 osteoblastic-like cells were used to assess the cytocompatibility of the hybrid scaffolds quantifying dsDNA, ALP activity and observing cell distribution. After 7 days in culture, cells were able to colonize whole longitudinal section of the scaffolds, being able to adhere to the <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> and showing similar or higher ALP activity and dsDNA content comparing with the unmodified PCL scaffolds. In conclusion, this new methodology virtually allows the modification of any 3 D structure with the introduction of a new hierarchical level in tissue engineering scaffolds, as coatings or <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures,</b> which acts as systems to control cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. Intravitreal {{injection}} of therapeutic DNA, complexed to nonviral carriers such as cationic liposomes, may be promising {{in the treatment}} of many severe retinal eye diseases. However, after intravitreal injection, such DNA/cationic liposome complexes - called lipoplexes (LPXs) - which are typically hundreds of nanometers in size, must first diffuse through the vitreous before they can reach the retina. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate whether vitreous is a barrier for the LPXs and to find strategies to overcome this barrier. METHODS. Fluorescent polystyrene nanospheres and LPXs were mixed with vitreous, and their mobility was monitored by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), a microscopy-based technique. The stability of LPXs and naked plasmid DNA in vitreous was studied by gel electrophoresis. RESULTS. We showed that polystyrene nanospheres, in our first experiments used as a model for the LPXs, do not diffuse freely into the vitreous but adhere to <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> in the vitreous, most likely to collagen fibers. Making the surfaces of the polystyrene nanospheres hydrophilic by attaching hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains at their surfaces circumvented the binding to <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> in the vitreous. FRAP revealed that "pegylated" polystyrene nanospheres, as long as they are smaller than 500 nm, are indeed mobile in the vitreous. It was further demonstrated that LPXs severely aggregate in vitreous and strongly bind to biopolymers in the vitreous, which immobilizes them completely. However, as observed for the polystyrene nanospheres, coating of the LPXs with PEG averted their aggregation in the vitreous and their binding to <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures.</b> CONCLUSIONS. Modifying the surfaces of LPXs with hydrophilic PEG chains prevents them from aggregating in vitreous. In this way, LPXs are obtained that can freely move in vitreous, an absolute criterion for reaching the retina after intravitreal injection...|$|R

However, all <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> formed possess an unexpected right-handed twist, a rare chirality within the corpus of amyloid experimental observations. We confirm by small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations that these fibrils are composed of conventional left-handed &# 0946;-sheets, but that packing stresses between adjacent sheets create this twist of unusual handedness. We also show that the right-handed fibrils represent a metastable state toward &# 0946;-sheet-based microcrystals formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of a designed bioactive lipopeptide C 16 -GGGRGDS, comprising a hexadecyl lipid chain {{attached to a}} functional heptapeptide, with the lipid-free apoliprotein, Apo-AI, is examined. This apolipoprotein is {{a major component of}} high density lipoprotein and it is involved in lipid metabolism and may serve as a biomarker for cardiovascular disease and Alzheimers’ disease. We find via isothermal titration calorimetry that binding between the lipopeptide and Apo-AI occurs up to a saturation condition, just above equimolar for a 10. 7 μM concentration of Apo-AI. A similar value is obtained from circular dichroism spectroscopy, which probes the reduction in α-helical secondary structure of Apo-AI upon addition of C 16 -GGGRGDS. Electron microscopy images show a persistence of <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> due to self-assembly of C 16 -GGGRGDS in mixtures with Apo-AI above the saturation binding condition. A small fraction of spheroidal or possibly “nanodisc” structures was observed. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data for Apo-AI can be fitted using a published crystal structure of the Apo-AI dimer. The SAXS data for the lipopeptide/ Apo-AI mixtures above the saturation binding conditions can be fitted to the contribution from <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> coexisting with flat discs corresponding to Apo-AI/lipopeptide aggregates...|$|R
30|$|The ECM of CDLs is complex, {{like most}} ECMof stiff CDLs {{increases}} from surface to bulk, suggestings. The matrix {{is comparable to}} a hydrogel due to the high water content (80 – 90  % in sea-cucumber dermis), where GAGs that link <b>fibrillar</b> <b>structures</b> {{have an important role}} in maintaining ECM hydration [8, 72]. GAGs are hydrophilic structures, assuming an extended conformation, inflating interfibrillar spaces, forming channels where water molecules move and enabling matrices to resist high compressive forces [8, 19, 21].|$|R
