5|$|By the 16th century, Capitolinus {{had become}} Capitolino in Italian, and Capitolium Campidoglio. The Capitoline Hill {{contains}} few ancient <b>ground-level</b> ruins, {{as they are}} almost entirely covered up by Medieval and Renaissance palaces (now housing the Capitoline Museums) that surround a piazza, a significant urban plan designed by Michelangelo.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} facade, the Yeti audio-animatronic, and {{the roller}} coaster are three independent structures. Each structure reaches the <b>ground-level</b> and does not touch the other two structures. This was achieved via 4-D scheduling software that told builders how to construct it.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid has a T-shaped {{substructure}} with a descending corridor {{leading to}} a chamber with a gabled roof. Similarly to the main pyramid, the substructure was constructed in a shallow open pit dug into the ground before the pyramid construction started and is therefore located just below <b>ground-level.</b>|$|E
5|$|The stone {{addition}} exhibits {{two stories}} of deep verandas extending across its eastern front façade. These verandas were once supported by tall columns {{rising from the}} addition's <b>ground-level</b> porch, {{to the roof of}} the second-story porch. An exterior stairway once connected the lower porch to the upper porch.|$|E
5|$|A curiosity is the {{underground}} (formerly <b>ground-level)</b> restored {{portion of the}} Jewish cemetery where 19th-century Rabbi Moses Sofer is buried, located {{at the base of}} the castle hill near the entrance to a tram tunnel. The only military cemetery in Bratislava is Slavín, unveiled in 1960 in honour of Soviet Army soldiers who fell during the liberation of Bratislava in April 1945. It offers an excellent view of the city and the Little Carpathians.|$|E
5|$|Below <b>ground-level</b> on {{the north}} side, the first floor {{includes}} a cafe and study rooms. The main floor, which is the second floor, includes a two-story atrium {{as well as the}} circulation desk and main entrance. The third floor contains the OSU Archives, and along with the fourth floor, houses the library's offices. A children's library and the special collections are located on the fifth floor, while the sixth floor only covers the southern two-thirds of the structure.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne Airport {{has five}} car parks, {{all of which}} operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The short-term, {{multi-level}} long-term, business and express carparks are covered, while the long-term parking is not. The main multi-level carpark {{in front of the}} terminal was built in the late 1990s, replacing the pre-existing <b>ground-level</b> car parking. It has been progressively expanded ever since.|$|E
5|$|The EPA has {{initiated}} several air quality requirements that help reduce <b>ground-level</b> ozone {{that leads to}} urban heat islands. In the Clean Air Act, one of the EPA's chief policies, there are certain regulations that are {{put in place to}} ensure the state's emissions stay below a certain level. Included in the Clean Air Act, all states must set forth a State Implementation Plan (SIP) which is designed to guarantee all states meet a central air quality standard.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} these {{personal}} modifications mostly went unrecorded. It is believed he achieved a height of 10,000 feet in nine minutes, curtailing the standard time by some five minutes. It was perhaps on exaggeration but no record remains to certify what McCudden did. He did note the maximum <b>ground-level</b> speed as 135mph in his log book. He achieved these feats with the limited resources of a front-line squadron and without any official assistance.|$|E
5|$|At its {{southern}} end {{near the mouth}} of the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the <b>ground-level</b> Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard. The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of the parkway. There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of the parkway. To travel east from the southbound lanes of the parkway, motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the plume highly buoyant; this, {{together}} with settled weather conditions, allowed the plume to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing. When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible that the plume would be less buoyant and that <b>ground-level</b> smoke concentrations could then rise significantly. By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues {{in the basement and}} <b>ground-level</b> incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1910s, a {{completely}} reconstructed New West End Terminal (which gradually became {{better known as}} Coney Island Terminal) was built on an elevated structure. The new terminal unified the terminals {{of most of the}} former steam railroad lines terminating at Coney Island, aside from the Long Island Rail Road-controlled New York and Manhattan Beach Railway. This new terminal could accommodate hundreds of thousands of passengers a day. This project entailed rerouting the Brighton and Culver Lines from a <b>ground-level</b> alignment to an elevated structure with four tracks and eight platforms.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania {{remained}} a Soviet Socialist Republic until 1990. In 1948, {{the headquarters of}} the 7th Guards Cherkassy Airborne Division was established in the fortress' commandant's headquarters. The barracks were used by the 108th paratroopers regiment and the Fifth Fort served the air defense regiment. Most of the forts, however, served as depots or housed farming organizations. During the postwar expansion and development of the city, parts of the fortress were dismantled; as part of the construction of Kaunas Polytechnic Institute the <b>ground-level</b> entrenchments of one defensive sector were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The late 12th-century defences at Framlingham Castle have invoked {{much debate}} by scholars. One interpretation, put forward for example by {{historian}} R. Allen Brown, {{is that they}} were relatively advanced for their time and represented a change in contemporary thinking about military defence. Framlingham has no keep, for example – this had been a very popular feature in previous Anglo-Norman castles, but this castle breaks with the tradition, relying on the curtain wall and mural towers instead. The pattern of <b>ground-level</b> arrowslits at Framlingham were similarly innovative for their time, enabling interlocking and flanking fire against attackers. The design of Framlingham's defences is similar in many ways to Henry II's innovative work at Dover and Orford.|$|E
5|$|Air {{travel to}} Missoula began in 1927, which {{is served by}} Missoula International Airport at Johnson-Bell Field, a public airport run by the Missoula County Airport Authority. It is the largest airport in western Montana, serving 582,821 {{passengers}} in 2011. The current building contains three jet bridges and three <b>ground‑level</b> boarding gates. There are direct flights year‑round to Billings, Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and seasonally to Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco. Four airlines operate out of Missoula (Allegiant Air, Delta Air Lines, Horizon/Alaska Airlines, and United Airlines) in addition to cargo carriers FedEx Express, and UPS Airlines. The airport {{is also home to}} Homestead Helicopters and fixed‑base operators Minuteman Jet Center (an Avfuel fuel provider), and Northstar Jet (a Phillips66 fuel provider).|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna was {{combined}} {{with several other}} railroads to create the Consolidated Rail Corporation, who continued maintenance of the New Jersey and New York Line {{for the next seven}} years, until the newly formed New Jersey Transit took over the station in 1983. On March 17, 1984, the station building, now 114 years old, was added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and by that June, the station was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The station building was restored in 2001 by contractors from Jablonski Building Conservation Incorporated in Midtown Manhattan, who had experience restoring train stations. The building conservation repainted the old station's wooden siding yellow and the bay windows to a brand new brown on the station's <b>ground-level</b> platform.|$|E
5|$|Mistra {{was ruled}} from Constantinople after 1262, then was the suzerain of the Despotate of the Morea from 1348 to 1460. In Mistra, {{there are several}} {{basilica}} plan churches with domed galleries that create a five-domed cross-in-square over a <b>ground-level</b> basilica plan. The Aphentiko at Brontochion Monastery was built c. 1310–22 and the later church of the Pantanassa Monastery (1428) is of the same type. The Aphentiko may have been originally planned as a cross-in-square church, but has a blend of longitudinal and central plan components, with an interior divided into nave and aisles like a basilica. The barrel-vaulted nave and cross arms have a dome at their crossing, and the corner bays of the galleries are also domed to form a quincunx pattern. A remodeling of the Metropolis church in Mistra created an additional example. The Pantanassa incorporates Western elements in that domes in its colonnaded porch are hidden externally, and its domes have ribs of rectangular section {{similar to those of}} Salerno, Ravello, and Palermo.|$|E
5|$|Nigersaurus was {{suggested}} by Sereno and colleagues to be a <b>ground-level,</b> non-selective browser. The {{width of the}} muzzle and lateral orientation of the tooth row show that the sauropod could gather much food and crop it close to the ground, within one metre of the surface. This is further supported by facets on the labial (externally facing) side of the upper teeth, similar to Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus, which are evidence that food or substrate wore the animal's teeth as it fed. Nigersaurus also bears signs of low-angle tooth-to-tooth wear {{on the inside of}} the maxillary crowns, which suggests that jaw movement was limited to precise up-and-down motions. Worn teeth from the lower jaw have not yet been discovered, but they are expected to show opposing tooth-to-tooth wear. The ability to raise their heads well above the ground does not necessarily mean they browsed on items there, and the short neck of Nigersaurus would have restricted the browsing range compared to other diplodocoids.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} of {{construction}} added three salient bastions, each of which were over {{twice the size of}} the northern bastion. The new bastions were placed along the part of al-Rahba's citadel that faced the desert to the west. The builders in the second phase also reinforced al-Rahba's walls with roughly cut conglomerate blocks fixed together by high-quality mortar. In the third phase, higher quality mudbrick was used, the western curtain wall was elevated and the southwestern curtain wall was replaced and decorated with bands of Arabic inscriptions. In addition, a large, brick dome was built atop the <b>ground-level</b> chamber of the northwestern bastion. The external walls of the fortress reached their final form during the third phase, though there would be further restorations in later decades.|$|E
5|$|Rich {{families}} from Rome usually {{had two or}} more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domūs) {{and at least one}} luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (balneum), {{but it was not a}} place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (head of household) met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity. It was also a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine and the images of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and <b>ground-level</b> spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae). In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the insulae—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.|$|E
25|$|Support of <b>ground-level</b> pilotis - the piloti {{tended to}} be {{symbolic}} rather than representative of actual structure.|$|E
25|$|Support of <b>ground-level</b> pilotis, {{elevating}} the building {{from the earth}} and allowed an extended continuity of the garden beneath.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a {{possible}} effect of rising temperatures is {{significantly higher levels}} of <b>ground-level</b> ozone, which would substantially lower yields.|$|E
25|$|This <b>ground-level</b> station {{opened on}} June 24, 1916. Both {{levels of the}} station have three tracks and two island platforms.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Alstom {{announced}} SRS, {{an energy}} storage system that charges supercapacitors on board a tram by means of <b>ground-level</b> conductor rails located at tram stops. This allows trams to operate without overhead lines for short distances. The system has been touted {{as an alternative to}} the company's <b>ground-level</b> power supply (APS) system, or can be used in conjunction with it, as in the case of the VLT network in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which opened in 2016.|$|E
25|$|New Brunswick Parking Authority manages 14 <b>ground-level</b> and {{multi-story}} parking facilities {{across the}} city. CitiPark manages a downtown parking facility at 2 Albany Street.|$|E
25|$|On Dec. 29, 2003, a world-record <b>ground-level</b> UV {{index of}} 43.3 was {{detected}} at Bolivia's Licancabur volcano, though other scientists dispute readings higher than 26.|$|E
25|$|SO2 and {{nitrogen}} oxide react {{in the atmosphere}} to form fine particles and <b>ground-level</b> ozone and are transported long distances, {{making it difficult for}} other states to achieve healthy levels of pollution control.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} stone cairn {{just on the}} {{northeast}} side of the stone circle. It {{has been reduced to}} <b>ground-level</b> and the outline can barely be traced. It is not necessarily an original part of the site.|$|E
25|$|Trumbull on the Park – Recently opened along Bushnell Park, this {{apartment}} community {{is housed in}} a new 11-story brick building along with a parking garage and <b>ground-level</b> retail space. Additional units are housed in recently renovated historic buildings on nearby Lewis Street.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{evidence}} to show that <b>ground-level</b> ozone can harm lung function and irritate the respiratory system. Exposure to ozone (and the pollutants that produce it) is linked to premature death, asthma, bronchitis, heart attack, and other cardiopulmonary problems.|$|E
25|$|Flatness of {{the local}} terrain and {{proximity}} to the bay have made flooding a recurring problem for the area. Baytown and surrounding communities once relied on groundwater for its needs, but severe land subsidence has forced much the city to turn to <b>ground-level</b> water sources.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} over the best type of guideway. Proposals include beams similar to monorails, bridge-like trusses {{supporting}} internal tracks, and cables embedded in a roadway. Most designs put the vehicle {{on top of the}} track, which reduces visual intrusion and cost as well as easing <b>ground-level</b> installation. An overhead track is necessarily higher, but may also be narrower. Most designs use the guideway to distribute power and data communications, including to the vehicles. The Morgantown PRT failed its cost targets because of its steam-heated track, so most proposals plan to resist snow and ice in ways that should be less expensive. Masdar's system has been limited because it attempted to dedicate <b>ground-level</b> to PRT guideways. This led to unrealistically expensive buildings and roads.|$|E
25|$|American Airlines Building – Located at 915 Main Street {{across from}} Capital Community College and the Residence Inn by Marriott, {{the site was}} {{formerly}} home to an E. J. Korvette department store and later American Airlines. The building has been converted into apartments with renovated <b>ground-level</b> retail space.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, for the Olympics Games, {{the light}} rail system was inaugurated, with 28km, 42 stations, {{distributed}} in 3 lines. The trams are {{the first in the}} world to use a combination of <b>ground-level</b> power supply (APS) and on-board supercapacitor energy storage (SRS), in order to eliminate overhead lines along the entire route.|$|E
