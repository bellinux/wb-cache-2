5|$|<b>Humble</b> began play on Rice's {{freshman}} team {{as an end}} in 1940. He {{advanced to}} the varsity team the next year. While he started as an end, coach Jess Neely switched him to guard before {{the first game of the}} season. He thrived in the new position, and was named a sophomore all-star by the Associated Press after the Rice Owls finished 1941 with a 6–3–1 win–loss–tie record. The following year, <b>Humble</b> earned All-Southwestern Conference honors and won the George Martin Award, given to Rice's most valuable player, as Rice put up a 7–2–1 record.|$|E

5|$|Standard Oil {{initially}} {{chose not}} to become directly involved in oil production in Texas, and instead formed Security Oil Company as a refining operation utilizing Guffey-Gulf and Texas Company as suppliers. Following state lawsuits related to anti-trust statutes, Security Oil was reorganized into Magnolia Petroleum Company in 1911. That same year, the <b>Humble</b> Oil Company (today Exxon Corporation) was formed by Ross Sterling and Walter William Fondren in <b>Humble,</b> Texas. The headquarters were moved to Houston, and the company eventually sold half of its shares to Standard Oil of New Jersey, establishing a long-term partnership that lasted for decades. The company built the Baytown Refinery, which became Texas' largest refining operation.

5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, and, even though she looked younger than her age, most important women's roles were out of her age range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A <b>humble</b> employee at a <b>humble</b> salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E

5|$|After the season, <b>Humble</b> {{enlisted in}} the United States Marine Corps and was sent {{to fight in the}} Pacific War. He rose to the rank of first {{lieutenant}} and won a Bronze Star Medal. Upon his discharge in 1946, <b>Humble</b> returned to Rice.
