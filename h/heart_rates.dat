5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES:   To {{evaluate}} in {{a general}} population, the relationships between dysglycaemia, insulin resistance and metabolic variables, and <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> recovery and <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability. METHODS:   Four hundred and forty-seven participants in the Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance syndrome (DESIR) study were classified according to glycaemic status over the preceding 9 years. All were free of self-reported cardiac antecedents and were not taking drugs which alter <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> During five consecutive periods: rest, deep breathing, recovery, rest and lying to standing, <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> varability were evaluated and compared by ANCOVA and trend tests across glycaemic classes. Spearman correlation coefficients quantified the relations between cardio-metabolic risk factors, <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> varability. RESULTS:   <b>Heart</b> <b>rate</b> differed between glycaemic groups, except during deep breathing. Between rest and deep-breathing periods, patients with diabetes had a lower increase in <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> than others (P(trend) < 0. 01); between deep breathing and recovery, the <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> of patients with diabetes continued to increase, for others, <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> decreased (P(trend) < 0. 009). <b>Heart</b> <b>rate</b> was correlated with capillary glucose and triglycerides during the five test periods. <b>Heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability differed according to glycaemic status, especially during the recovery period. After age, sex and BMI adjustment, <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability was correlated with triglycerides at two test periods. Change in <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> between recovery and deep breathing was negatively correlated with <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability at rest, (r=- 0. 113, P < 0. 05) : lower resting <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability was associated with <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> acceleration. CONCLUSIONS:   <b>Heart</b> <b>rate,</b> but not <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability, was associated with glycaemic status and capillary glucose. After deep breathing, <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> recovery was altered in patients with known diabetes and was associated with reduced <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability.

40|$|A high <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> {{and a low}} <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> {{variability}} at {{rest are}} established predictors of various forms of functional impairment, morbidity, and mortality [1 – 6]. Two explanations can be given for these associations.

On the other hand, a high <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and a low <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability are brought about by cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension, and physical inactivity [2, 3, 7 – 9]. Since research on <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability has almost exclusively been conducted in western populations with an affluent sedentary lifestyle and high prevalences of these risk factors, it {{has been difficult to}} determine whether or not <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability are associated with functional impairment, morbidity, and mortality independently of cardiovascular risk factors...|$|R

25|$|Bradycardia {{was defined}} as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute when {{textbooks}} asserted that the normal range for <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> was 60–100 BPM. The normal range has since been revised in textbooks to 50–90 BPM for a human at total rest. Setting a lower threshold for bradycardia prevents misclassification of fit individuals as having a pathologic heart rate. The normal heart rate number can vary as children and adolescents tend to have faster <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> than average adults. Bradycardia may be associated with medical conditions such as hypothyroidism.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{individuals}} having a constant blood volume, {{one of the}} physiological ways to deliver more oxygen to an organ is to increase heart rate to permit blood to pass by the organ more often.

However, <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention. Tachycardia is defined as a resting heart rate above 100 bpm, though persistent rest rates between 80–100 bpm, mainly if they are present during sleep, may be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia (see below).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For a {{long-haul}} flight passenger, if he/she is an adult, his/her normal <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> {{should be}} 60 - 100 beats per minute. However, {{the combination of}} long flight duration, dehydration and reduced oxygen availability etc. flying factors may cause his/her heart beating out of the normal range {{for a long time}} which endangers his/her heart health. In this paper, we present a new bio-feedback based music system to promote the passenger’s heart health with his/her preferred music. If the passenger’s <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> is higher than the normal <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> the system recommends his/her preferred calm music to the passenger to transfer his/her <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> back to normal; If the passenger’s <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> is lower than the normal <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> the system recommends his/her preferred upbeat music to uplift his/her <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> back to normal; if the passenger’s <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> is normal, the system recommends the passenger preferred music to keep his/her <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> at normal.

40|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>Rate</b> Variability {{studies are}} a known measure for the {{autonomous}} {{control of the}} <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> In special situations, its interpretation can be ambiguous, since the respiration has {{a major influence on}} the <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability. For this reason it has often been proposed to measure <b>Heart</b> <b>Rate</b> Variability, while the subjects are breathing at a constant respiration rate. That way the spectral influence of the respiration is known. In this work we propose to remove this constant respiratory influence from the <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and the <b>Heart</b> <b>Rate</b> Variability parameters to gain respiration free autonomous controlled <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> signal. The spectral respiratory component in the <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> signal is detected and characterized.
