25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> {{accurate}} to group Arabesk with folk music. It owes little to folk music, {{and would be}} more accurately described as form of popular music based on the makam scales found in Ottoman and Turkish classical music. Though Arabesk was accused of having been derived from Arabic music, the scales (makam) used identify it as music, that, though influenced by both Arabic and Western music, is much more Turkish in origin.|$|E
25|$|The celebrated New Left {{historian}} Robert Brenner from California {{has also}} attempted {{to provide an}} explanation of the postwar boom and its aftermath in terms of profitability trends. Brenner's interpretation was heavily criticized by Anwar Shaikh, who argued that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> credible from an econometric or theoretical point of view. According to Shaikh, Brenner had an inflated view of American factories, to the point where Brenner believed that the profitability of US manufacturing determined the destiny of the whole world economy. In reality, US factory production wasn't that big.|$|E

Though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> mandatory to reside in the campus, most of the students do so. A total of 240 rooms are provided in two Halls of Residence (North Hall and South Hall) with three blocks each: East Block, Middle Block and West Block. Each room has provision for accommodating a maximum of 3 to 4 students. Each student is provided with basic living ingredients from the authority without any cost.|$|E

25|$|Although the Parthenon is architecturally {{a temple}} {{and is usually}} called so, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> one in the {{conventional}} sense of the word. A small shrine has been excavated within the building, {{on the site of}} an older sanctuary probably dedicated to Athena {{as a way to get}} closer to the goddess, but the Parthenon never hosted the cult of Athena Polias, patron of Athens: the cult image, which was bathed in the sea and to which was presented the peplos, was an olivewood xoanon, located at an older altar on the northern side of the Acropolis.|$|E
25|$|In 1911/1912, Hearne toured Australia {{with one}} of the strongest England sides ever. He played in all the Tests, but was utterly hopeless as a bowler on Australian pitches both then and in 1920/1921 and 1924/1925, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> clear why. He had the spin and the pace from the ground to succeed on rock-hard pitches, but he lacked flight and could rarely persist for long enough to be {{effective}} in a long struggle. As a batsman, he did very well in the first two Tests, with 114 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground his only Test hundred - but he declined sharply afterwards.|$|E
25|$|During this period, {{he won a}} {{large number}} of {{international}} awards. It could be argued that although his films show the development of ideas from existentialism, surrealism, Marxism, German expressionism, Postmodernism, Nouvelle Vague and Italian neorealism. Sen's cinema for the most part does not provide a happy ending or a definitive conclusion (unlike many of the films of Sen's better known contemporary Satyajit Ray). In many of Sen's later films, the audience becomes a participant in the process of the development of the plot. The director invites and provokes the audience into a shared process of forming multiple conclusions, that are at the same time unique and different. The director does not play the role of god, his audience does. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> surprising that unlike Allen who has a steady niche audience in the Western literati and aficionados, Sen's experimentation with parallel cinema had significantly cost him much of a devoted audience composing of largely the Calcutta-based westernized intelligentsia.|$|E

2500|$|Coburn {{was one of}} the {{original}} authors of the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act upheld by the Supreme Court in Gonzales v. Carhart. The act relied on an expansive view of the Constitution's Commerce Clause, as it applies to [...] "any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion." [...] The Act's reliance on such a broad reading of the Commerce Clause was criticized by Independence Institute scholar David Kopel and University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds, who noted that [...] "nless a physician is operating a mobile abortion clinic on the Metroliner, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> possible to perform an abortion 'in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.'"

2500|$|However, {{since the}} text was {{intended}} to be explicitly satirical and hyperbolic, other critics are ambivalent about its rightful place as a science fiction precursor. For example, English critic Kingsley Amis wrote that [...] "It is hardly science-fiction, since it deliberately piles extravagance upon extravagance for comic effect" [...] yet he implicitly acknowledged its SF character by comparing its plot to early 20th century space operas: [...] "I will merely remark that the sprightliness and sophistication of True History make it read like a joke at the expense of nearly all early-modern science fiction, that written between, say, 1910 and 1940." [...] Lucian translator Bryan Reardon is more explicit, describing the work as [...] "an account of a fantastic journey - to the moon, the underworld, the belly of a whale, and so forth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> science fiction, although it has sometimes been called that; there is no 'science' in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{included}} two sophisticated instrumental tracks composed solely by Brian.

Of [...] "Let's Go Away for Awhile", Perone observes, [...] "There are melodic features but no tune to speak of. As an instrumental composition, this gives the piece an atmospheric feel; however, the exact mood is difficult to define." [...] Of [...] "Pet Sounds", the piece represents the Beach Boys' surf heritage more than any other track on the album with its emphasis on lead guitar, although Perone maintains that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> a surf composition, citing its elaborate arrangement involving countless auxiliary percussion parts, abruptly changing textures, and de-emphasis of a traditional rock band drum set.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film {{four out of}} four stars and described the film as [...] "a dazzling movie from Walt Disney in which computers {{have been used to}} make themselves romantic and glamorous. Here's a technological sound-and-light show that is sensational and brainy, stylish, and fun". However, {{near the end of his}} review, he noted (in a positive tone), [...] "This is an almost wholly technological movie. Although it's populated by actors who are engaging (Bridges, Cindy Morgan) or sinister (Warner), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> a movie about human nature. Like Star Wars or The Empire Strikes Back, but much more so, this movie is a machine to dazzle and delight us". Ebert closed his first annual Overlooked Film Festival with a showing of Tron.
