5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey <b>from</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> the water column, {{it tends to}} hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as croakers, flatfishes, and cutlassfishes, {{and to a lesser}} extent on {{cartilaginous}} fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. Other sharks and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, catsharks, angel sharks, guitarfishes, stingrays, and eagle rays.|$|E

25|$|Amtrak began {{operations}} in May 1971 {{with a mixture}} of equipment from its predecessor railroads, much of which was painted in a variety of railroad-specific paint schemes.

Amtrak elected not to keep the same rolling stock on the same routes and it was not unexpected to find rolling stock <b>from</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> the US on any train. To build the brand of Amtrak as a unified passenger railroad, the equipment was gradually repainted into system-wide Phases starting around 1972 with Phase I.|$|E

25|$|Prior to this event, no {{solar eclipse}} had been visible {{across the entire}} {{contiguous}} United States since June 8, 1918; not since the February 1979 eclipse had a total eclipse been visible <b>from</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> the mainland United States. The path of totality touched 14 states, {{and the rest of}} the U.S. had a partial eclipse. The area of the path of totality was about 16 percent of the area of the United States, with most of this area over the ocean, not land. The event's shadow began to cover land on the Oregon coast as a partial eclipse at 4:05p.m. UTC (9:05a.m. PDT), with the total eclipse beginning there at 5:16p.m. UTC (10:16a.m. PDT); the total eclipse's land coverage ended along the South Carolina coast at about 6:44p.m. UTC (2:44p.m. EDT). Visibility as a partial eclipse in Honolulu, Hawaii began with sunrise at 4:20p.m. UTC (6:20a.m. HST) and ended by 5:25p.m. UTC (7:25a.m. HST).|$|E
25|$|The {{preference}} {{of virtual reality}} exposure therapy over in-vivo exposure therapy is often debated, {{but there are many}} obvious advantages of virtual reality exposure therapy that make it more desirable. For example, the proximity between the client and therapist can cause problems when in-vivo therapy is used and transportation is not reliable for the client or it is impractical for them to travel as far as needed. However, virtual reality exposure therapy can be done <b>from</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> the world if given the necessary tools. Going along with the idea of unavailable transportation and proximity, there are many individuals who require therapy but due to various forms of immobilizations (paralysis, extreme obesity, etc..) they can not physically be moved to where the therapy is conducted. Again, because virtual reality exposure therapy can be conducted anywhere in the world, those with mobility issues will no longer be discriminated against. Another major advantage is fewer ethical concerns than in-vivo exposure therapy. Once again, considering the idea of close proximity no longer being a requirement, this decreases the chances of inappropriate client-therapist relations taking place.|$|E
