5|$|In January 2016, Russia, for {{the first}} time in combat conditions, {{deployed}} four Su-35S planes to Khmeimim air base in Syria as part of Russian air operations in the country.

The aircraft complemented the Su-30SMs in flying combat air patrols and providing protection to other aircraft that were conducting bombing missions. As a result of operations in Syria, problems were <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's avionics and were subsequently rectified.
