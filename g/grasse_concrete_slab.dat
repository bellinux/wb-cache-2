Through flexural test, the deformation process and failure mode of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with GFRP bars and steel bars are examined, respectively. The deflection, cracking load, ultimate load and concrete strain are compared between two kinds of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs.</b> From the test results, it is clarified that the moment-deflection curve of GFRP reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> {{can be divided into}} two stages. Before concrete cracks the behaviors of two kinds of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> are almost the same. However, the deflection of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with GFRP bars increases much faster after cracking and the stress-strain diagram is linear up to rupture with no discernible yield point. The ultimate load of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with GFRP bars is 1. 2 times of that of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with steel bars. Based on the test results, finite element analysis is performed in order to study the influence of reinforcement ratio. Parameter analysis shows that the flexural rigidity of GFRP reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> increases with the reinforcement ratio after cracking...|$|R

A literature review on the engineering databases uncovered some awards and application articles on the technologies, but little analysis about its structural performance can be found. In this paper, Strand 7 Finite Element Analysis in conjunction with Rhinoceros 4 3 D CAD software was used to create composite FEA models of <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs.</b> These composite models were loaded to observe stresses and cracked section behaviour in both hollow-core <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> and solid <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> to determine the relative merits of hollow core <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> over regular solid <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Concrete is a {{material}} that is good in compression but weak in tension. Enhancing the tensile properties of concrete will lead to its greater application in construction. It was reported that improvement in the mechanical properties of reinforced concrete structure {{can be done by}} the inclusion of short fibres. Steel fibres have been reported to be able to increase the toughness, abrasion, impact resistances and allow for decrease in <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> thickness. This paper focuses on a study conducted in the laboratory to investigate the behaviour of steel fibre reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slab.</b> Four reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> with different parameters to be studied were cast and tested to failure. The <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> cast consist of slab with reinforcement bar R- 150, slab with reinforcement bar R- 300 and 1 % dosage of steel fibres, slab with 1 % dosage of steel fibres, and one plain <b>concrete</b> <b>slab.</b> All the slabs cast having the overall size of 100 x 500 x 1000 mm, and tested to failure under four point loading. The behaviour of the <b>concrete</b> <b>slabs</b> was studied through their ultimate load, load deflection characteristic upon loading, cracking history, and mode of failure. The results indicated that the inclusion of steel fibres can increased the ultimate load of the sample and its ability to absorb more energy after cracking, i. e. the toughness, compared with the control slab.

The equations are solved by Galerkin method. It is shown from the calculating example that the proposed method not only is easy to calculate, but also has high convergent speed. Introdution The steel and concrete composite structure is a new-type structure based on steel structure and reinforced concrete structure. The steel and concrete composite girder is the most useful composite structure. In the action of load, the shear lag effect will produce in the flange of steel girder and <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> of the composite structure. Since the shear connector between steel girder and <b>concrete</b> <b>slab</b> has some flexiblity, there is slip on the composite surface of steel girder and <b>concrete</b> <b>slab.</b> Therefore the influence of slips and shear lags should be considered {{for the purpose of}} analysing the mechanical behaviour of the structrue reliably.
