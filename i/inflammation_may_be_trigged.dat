Costabel <b>Inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> defined as a local or general response of living tissue to injury or {{to the presence of}} injurious agents. Teleologically, inflammation is presu-mably designed as both a protective and reparative res-ponse, which aims at restoration of optimal organ function. Thus, <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> viewed as an essentially self-curtailing process-loop, in which a complex series of interdigitating cytological, biochemical, and immuno-logical components serve to return to a physiological baseline of optimal organ function. Processes which constitute inflammation form an in-tricate functional network, in which almost every singl...|$|R

5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> given as treatment.|$|R

40|$|Previously {{encountered}} stimuli {{can bring}} to mind a vivid memory of the episodic {{context in which the}} stimulus was first experienced ("remembered" stimuli), or can simply seem familiar ("known" stimuli). Past studies suggest that more attentional resources are required to encode stimuli that are subsequently remembered than known. However, it is unclear if the attentional resources are distributed differently during encoding and recognition of remembered and known stimuli. Here, we record eye movements while participants encode photos, and later while indicating whether the photos are remembered, known or new. Eye fixations were more clustered during both encoding and recognition of remembered photos relative to known photos. Thus, recognition of photos that bring to mind a vivid memory for the episodic context in which they were experienced is associated with less distributed overt attention during encoding and recognition. The results suggest that remembering is related to encoding of a few distinct details of a photo rather than the photo as a whole. In turn, during recognition remembering <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>trigged</b> by enhanced memory for the salient details of the photos...|$|R

40|$|Monocytes/macrophages are {{important}} targets for dengue virus (DENV) replication; they induce inflammatory mediators and are sources of viral dissemination {{in the initial}} phase of the disease. Apoptosis is an active process of cellular destruction genetically regulated, in which a complex enzymatic pathway <b>is</b> activated and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>trigged</b> by many viral infections. Since the mechanisms of apoptotic induction in DENV-infected target cells are not yet defined, we investigated the virus-cell interaction using a model of primary human monocyte infection with DENV- 2 {{with the aim of}} identifying apoptotic markers. Cultures analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy yielded DENV antigen positive cells with rates that peaked at the second day post infection (p. i.), decayed afterwards and produced the apoptosis-related cytokines TNF-&# 945; and IL- 10. Phosphatidylserine, an early marker for apoptosis, was increased at the cell surface and the Fas death receptor was upregulated at the second day p. i. at significantly higher rates in DENV infected cell cultures than controls. However, no detectable changes were observed in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- 2 in infected cultures. Our data support virus modulation of extrinsic apoptotic factors in the in vitro model of human monocyte DENV- 2 infection.
