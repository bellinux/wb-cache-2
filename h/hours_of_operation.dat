5|$|Healthcare in Tripura {{features}} a {{universal health care}} system run by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the Government of Tripura. The health care infrastructure {{is divided into three}} tiers– the primary health care network, a secondary care system comprising district and sub-divisional hospitals and tertiary hospitals providing speciality and super speciality care. As of 2010–11, there are 17 hospitals, 11 rural hospitals and community health centres, 79 primary health centres, 635 sub-centres/dispensaries, 7 blood banks and 7 blood storage centres in the state. Homeopathic and Ayurvedic styles of medicine are also popular in the state. The National Family Health Survey– 3 conducted in 2005–06 revealed that 20 per cent of the residents of Tripura do not generally use government health facilities, and prefers private medical sector. This is overwhelmingly less compared to the national level, where 65.6 per cent do not rely on government facilities. As in the rest of India, Tripura residents also cite poor quality of care as the most frequent reason for non-reliance over public health sector. Other reasons include distance of the public sector facility, long waiting time, and inconvenient <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> As of 2010, the state's performance in major public health care indices, such as birth rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate is better than the national average. The state is vulnerable to epidemics of Malaria, Diarrhea, Japanese Encephalitis and Meningitis. In summer 2014 the state witnessed a major Malaria outbreak.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Two {{anaesthetic}} machines, the "Primus ® " and the "Zeus ® " (Draeger AG, Lübeck, Germany), {{were subjected}} to a cost analysis by evaluating the various expenses that go into using each machine. Methods These expenses included the acquisition, maintenance, training and device-specific accessory costs. In addition, oxygen, medical air and volatile anaesthetic consumption were determined for each machine. Results Anaesthesia duration was 278 ± 140 and 208 ± 112 minutes in the Primus ® and the Zeus ®, respectively. The purchase cost was € 3. 28 and € 4. 58 per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> in the Primus ® and the Zeus ®, respectively. The maintenance cost was € 0. 90 and € 1. 20 per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> in the Primus ® and the Zeus ®, respectively. We found that the O 2 cost was € 0. 015 ± 0. 013 and € 0. 056 ± 0. 121 per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> in the Primus ® and the Zeus ®, respectively. The medical air cost was € 0. 005 ± 0. 003 and € 0. 016 ± 0. 027 per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> in the Primus ® and the Zeus ®, respectively. The volatile anaesthetic cost was € 2. 40 ± 2. 40 and € 4. 80 ± 4. 80 per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> in the Primus ® and the Zeus ®, respectively. Conclusion This study showed that the "Zeus ® " generates a higher cost per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> compared to the "Primus®". </p...|$|R
