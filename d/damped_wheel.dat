40|$|The main {{noise source}} when a rail vehicle is {{circulating}} under approximately 280 km/h is {{the interaction between}} wheel and rail. This paper presents a summary of different solutions that could be envisaged to reduce the level of this source. Being the wheel the most critical component for noise emission, particular attention is being paid to existing solutions to add damping to the wheel. A wheel including a friction damping solution –a modified ring damper- is analysed in detail. Ring dampers are steel rings fitted inside grooves cut under the wheel rim, usually one at {{each side of the}} tread; in this case it is a heavier ring at one side of the wheel. The paper includes some experimental results obtained in the laboratory aiming at verifying the modal damping for the different modes with this 2 ̆ 2 <b>damped</b> <b>wheel</b> 2 ̆ 2 and some on track test for a global evaluation of the solution. Additionally, an analysis of the effectiveness of modifying the friction coefficient between the rail and the wheel is also reported. A 2 ̆ 2 friction modifier 2 ̆ 2 is added {{at the top of the}} rail and noise and vibration measurements have been carried out on the track for an experimental evaluation of its effectiveness...|$|E

These {{consisted of a}} spring-mounted 3.5 kg (7.75 lb) iron weight inside a vertical cylinder http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/bv/2cv.htm and are similar to, yet much smaller than versions of the tuned mass dampers used on tall buildings.|$|R

2500|$|The {{suspension}} also automatically accommodates differing payloads in the car- {{with four}} people and cargo {{on board the}} wheelbase increases by around 4cm (2in) as the suspension deflects, and the castor angle of the front wheels increases {{by as much as}} 8 degrees thus ensuring that ride quality, handling and road holding are almost unaffected by the additional weight. On early cars friction dampers (like a dry version of a multi-plate clutch design) were fitted at the mountings of the front and rear swinging arms to the cross-tubes. Because the rear brakes were outboard, they had extra tuned mass dampers to <b>damp</b> <b>wheel</b> bounce from the extra unsprung mass. Later models had tuned mass dampers ("batteurs") at the front (because the leading arm had more inertia and [...] "bump/thump" [...] than the trailing arm), with hydraulic telescopic dampers / shock absorbers front and rear. The uprated hydraulic damping obviated the need for the rear inertia dampers. It was designed to be a comfortable ride by matching the frequencies encountered in human bipedal motion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for optimizing the suspension damping and stiffness parameters of nonlinear quarter-car models subjected to random road excitation. The investigation starts with car models involving passive damping with constant or dual-rate characteristics. Then, we also examine car models where the damping coefficient of the suspension is selected {{so that the}} resulting system approximates the performance of an active suspension system with sky-hook damping. For the models with semi-active or passive dual-rate dampers, {{the value of the}} equivalent suspension damping coefficient {{is a function of the}} relative velocity of the sprung mass with respect to the wheel subsystem. As a consequence, the resulting equations of motion are strongly nonlinear. For these models, appropriate methodologies are first employed for obtaining the second moment characteristics of motions resulting from roads with a random profile. This information is next utilized in the definition of a vehicle performance index, which is optimized to yield representative numerical results for the most important suspension parameters. Special attention is paid to investigating the effect of road quality as well as on examining effects related to wheel hop. Finally, a critical comparison is performed between the results obtained for vehicles with passive linear or bilinear suspension dampers and those obtained for cars with semi-active shock absorbers.

50|$|In August 2008, {{the models}} {{were given a}} minor facelift, {{resulting}} most petrol engined models being withdrawn from sale in the United Kingdom, and other countries of Europe.

5000|$|Pneumatic or elastic tires help by {{providing}} some springing {{for most of}} the (otherwise) unsprung mass, but the damping that can be included in the tires is limited by considerations of fuel economy and overheating. The shock absorbers, if any, damp the spring motion also and must be less stiff than would optimally <b>damp</b> the <b>wheel</b> bounce. So the wheels execute some vibrations after each bump before coming to rest. On dirt roads and perhaps on some softly paved roads, these motions form small bumps, known as corrugations, washboarding or [...] "corduroy" [...] because they resemble smaller versions of the bumps in roads made of logs. These cause sustained wheel bounce in subsequent vehicles, enlarging the bumps.|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{consists}} of designing and modelling a damper {{system for a}} Wärtsilä Steerable Thruster. Aim is to reduce torque peaks caused by ice impacts on the propeller shaft of the thruster. A passive ideal damper {{as well as a}} novel hydraulic-mechanical damper are modelled and the effects of the damper are simulated in varied ice impact scenarios. Simulated ice impact cases are generated to be similar to the ones of Det Norske Veritas regulations. In addition further custom ice impacts with variable sinusoidal impact lengths are generated. Simulations are conducted without a damper, with a passive ideal damper and with the novel hydraulic-mechanical damper. A validated simulation model of the WST- 14 propulsion system is given for use in this master’s thesis by Tampere University of Technology Laboratory of Automation and Hydraulics. Novel hydraulic-mechanical damper is a rotating dual-mass torsional damper. Damper {{consists of}} two main inertias; a damper case and a <b>damper</b> <b>wheel,</b> as well as hydraulic spring and damping elements. Both active and semi-active variations of the damper are considered. Simulation results of the hydraulic-mechanical damper are studied and it is acknowledged that the damper has reasonable effect on reducing torque peaks on some impact cases and negligible or even inverse effects on certain impact cases. Most signiﬁcant results of the hydraulic-mechanical damper are torque peak reduction of 8. 6 % in the propeller shaft and maximum peak-to-peak reduction of over 40 %. In certain ice impact cases the simulation results show a falling torque peak reduction of maximum of 9 kNm, or over 15 % of the falling torque, resulting in prevention of gear hammering...|$|R

50|$|In 2013 the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) {{introduced}} the series production version of PRE-SCAN, {{but with a}} stereo camera instead of laser projectors. The system dubbed Magic Body Control is fitted with a road-sensing system (Road Surface Scan) that pre-loads the shocks for the road surface detected. Using a stereo camera, the system scans the road surface up to 15 meters ahead of the vehicle at speeds up to 130 kph mph, and it adjusts the shock <b>damping</b> at each <b>wheel</b> to account for imperfections in the road. Initially only available on 8-cylinder models and above, Magic Ride Control attempts to isolate the car's body by predicting rather than reacting to broken pavement and speed humps. The ABC has undergone major modifications for the new S-Class: the <b>wheel</b> <b>damping</b> is now continuously adjustable, the spring strut response has been improved and the pump efficiency has been further enhanced. A digital interface connects the control unit and the sensors, while the fast FlexRay bus connects the control unit and the vehicle electronics. Processing power is more than double that of the previous system.|$|R
5000|$|A cush {{drive is}} a part of a {{motorcycle}} or scooter drive-train that is designed to reduce stress from engine torque damaging other components during gear or throttle changes. A common design used by almost all street motorcycles, it has three major pieces: the wheel, the sprocket assembly, and the rubber <b>damper.</b> The <b>wheel</b> and the sprocket assembly fit together with five or more sections much like two hands woven together. In between the contact of the two assembly are rubber blocks. This makes it so the wheel and the sprocket have a dampening layer between them, and the rubber blocks reduce wear and fatigue of the metal assemblies. Another popular system incorporates metallic compression type coil springs placed between the input and output shafts of the cush drive assembly.|$|R

Although there are different {{ways to reduce the}} noise generated by a railway wheel, most devices are based on the mechanism of increasing <b>wheel</b> <b>damping.</b> Sandwich-type constrained layer dampers can be designed so their resonance frequencies coincide with the wheel’s resonant vibration frequencies, and thus the damping effect can be concentrated within the frequency ranges of interest. However, the influence of design parameters has not yet been studied.

The satellite is stabilised by a single Ymomentum wheel and 3 -axis magnetorquer rods, used for nutation <b>damping</b> and <b>wheel</b> momentum management. The primary attitude sensor used for attitude and rate estimation, is a miniature 3 -axis magnetometer. This paper will show the attitude performance results during pointing of the CMOS cameras. One of the challenges was {{how to handle a}} large residual magnetic moment disturbance on the satellite. This disturbance was caused by an unforseen permanent magnetisation dipole from the thruster solenoids, which could not be fully cancelled by the magnetorquer rods. To enable the onboard attitude and rate Kalman filter to give accurate state estimates, the magnetic disturbance was first characterised and then partially compensated for, using the magnetorquer rods. The paper will explain how this problem was solved, before the Y-momentum wheel could be utilised to stabilise and point the imaging payload. The attitude disturbances during firings of the butane gas thruster will also be presented and characterised. The effect of these firings on the orbit will be shown as measured by the GPS receiver on SNAP- 1. The lessons learned from the AODCS design of a SSTL nanosatellite are summarised...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{vibration}} <b>damping</b> in <b>wheeled</b> vehicles {{is mainly}} performed {{by means of}} passive hydraulic systems. Active and semi-active solutions are adopted when there is particular interest in varying the damping response of the shock absorbers for vehicle handling and comfort. To this end, electro-hydrostatic actuation (EHA) devices represent a promising alternative in active vibration control. In these systems, an electric motor is employed to drive a fixed-displacement hydraulic pump. The flow generated by the pump is then conduced into a hydraulic piston {{that acts as a}} conventional damper. The use of a motor as a primary actuation device eases the control task and offers a large output bandwidth. This feature represents an advantage with respect to active hydraulic technologies, which attain limited bandwidth frequencies and use highly nonlinear servo-valves. Moreover, the reversible nature of the electric machine in EHA actuators allows part of the energy exchanged during damping to be recovered. When compared to electromechanical shock absorbers, EHA devices offer higher output power densities and higher efficiencies. In this context, the present paper describes the design, modelling and control of an active EHA system utilized for vehicle damping purposes. An overview of the current active solutions and a comparison with the EHA technology are revised. Results in terms of damping response and energy harvesting capabilities are then discusse...|$|R

In the last decade, several large research projects have been carried out across Europe with the aim of reducing wheel/rail rolling noise at source.

Sloshing is when the inner frame oscillates, and it occurs in all monowheels and diwheels where the centre of gravity of the inner frame is offset from the centre line of the wheels. It is very prevalent as these platforms typically have low <b>damping</b> between the <b>wheel</b> and the frame, to minimise power consumption during locomotion. In addition, during severe braking or acceleration the inner frame will tumble relative to the earth centred frame, which affects the ability of the driver to control the platform.
