40|$|The use of {{artificial}} aggregates such as <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> {{in the production}} of asphalt concrete makes it possible to reduce both natural aggregate extraction and the use of non-renewable raw resources, giving considerable environmental benefits.

In a systematic test of 23 mineral substrates (no organic matter), Jauch and Fischer (2000) found that all trended towards acidification over the 7 -year study period.

40|$|The {{interlayer}} pores of swelling 2 : 1 clays {{provide an}} ideal 2 -dimensional {{environment in which}} to study confined fluids. In this paper we discuss {{our understanding of the}} structure and dynamics of interlayer fluid species in <b>expanded</b> <b>clays,</b> based primarily on the outcome of recent molecular modelling and neutron scattering studies. Counterion solvation is compared with that measured in bulk solutions, and at a local level the cation-oxygen coordination is found to be remarkably similar in these two environments. However, for the monovalent ions the contribution to the first coordination shell from the clay surfaces increases with counterion radius. This gives rise to inner-sphere (surface) complexes in the case of potassium and caesium. In this context, the location of the negative clay surface charge (i. e. arising from octahedral or tetrahedral substitution) is also found to be of major importance. Divalent cations, such as calcium, eagerly solvate to form outer-sphere complexes. These complexes are able to pin adjacent clay layers together, and thereby prevent colloidal swelling. Confined water molecules form hydrogen bonds {{to each other and to}} the clays' surfaces. In this way their local environment relaxes to close to the bulk water structure within two molecular layers of the clay surface. Finally, we discuss the way in which the simple organic molecules methane, methanol and ethylene glycol behave in the interlayer region of hydrated clays. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering of isotopically labelled interlayer CH 3 OD and (CH 2 OD) 2 in deuterated clay allows us to measure the diffusion of the CH 3 - and CH 2 -groups in both clay and liquid environments. We find that in both the one-layer methanol solvates and the two-layer glycol solvates the diffusion of the most mobile organic molecules is close to that in the bulk solution...|$|E

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} is an evaluation of the zeolitized facies of Campanian Ignimbrite as raw material for the production of lightweight expanded aggregates (LEA). A commercial product (Cab 70) was used as reference for this rock. Tests were carried out on “pure” samples or mixed with an industrial waste mud (DPM—Dried Polishing Mud) deriving from a porcelain stoneware tile polishing process. This mud contains SiC, a phase known to act as bloating enhancer. Raw materials were subjected tomineralogical (XRPD–RIR method) and chemical (XRF) analyses. Bloating upon heating was measured (Leitz heating microscope) on Cab 70, DPM and on three mixtures having the following Cab 70 /DPMratios: 85 / 15 (Mix 1); 70 / 30 (Mix 2); 50 / 50 (Mix 3). LEAproductionwas assessed both in static (muffle kiln) and in dynamic (rotating kiln) conditions by firing pellets, 3 – 8 mm in size, between 1220 – 1380 °C. The unit weight of the single particle was determined on fired and unfired products. All materials evidenced a decreasing density with temperature whereas the same parameter decreases with DPM increasing content. Cab 70 LEAs never dropped below 0. 90 g/cm 3, even at the highest temperature, whereas DPM LEAs range between 0. 86 g/cm 3 (at 1260 °C) and 0. 46 g/cm 3 (at 1380 °C). A direct but not linear relationship between DPMcontent and density was evidenced. Among the three mixtures,Mix 2 showed the lowest DPMcontent able to produce the strongest density reduction. To get LEAs with the same density the rotating kiln required temperatures generally 60 – 80 °C higher than those of the muffle kiln. This difference should be related to the different thermal insulation of the two systems during firing. Two sets of LEAs were massively produced in dynamic conditions from Cab 70 (at 1380 °C) and Mix 2 (at 1300 °C). These latter showed better technical performances in terms of unit weight of the single particle (0. 81 vs. 0. 98 g/cm 3), bulk unit weight (460 vs. 565 kg/m 3), water absorption coefficients (1. 4 vs. 5. 5 % after 24 h) and compressive strength of the particles (2. 9 vs. 0. 6 MPa). Differences in pore shape, dimension, abundance and spatial distribution were observed by SEMbetween the two sets. The technical features of these LEAs were comparable to some <b>expanded</b> <b>clays,</b> with similar grain size, commercialised in Italy. These results are worth interesting as they reveal new perspectives of application both for a rock characterized by a low exploitation cost and widely available in central-southern Italy, as well as for an industrial waste produced in high amount but not recycled at all...|$|E

Also the influence of geosynthetic stiffness on the pre-peak pull-out behaviour is discussed in the paper. The observations also suggest that the obtained results on a narrow particle size distribution are not necessarily transferable to conventional soils...|$|R
40|$|Production {{of cement}} based {{building}} materials incorporating alternative filler, {{which comes from}} production industry like a waste, nowadays {{becomes more and more}} popular. It could be related not only to the cheaper expenses of the production if to compare with adequate products made of conventional raw materials, but also to the efforts {{to improve the quality of}} environmental. The global heating and environmental pollution is becoming more and more actual topic along with industrial development, as results the utilisation and recycling of production waste or by-products are set as the priority of each country. Investigations were carried out to explore the suitability of dolomite waste as fillers in <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> lightweight concrete by partly substituting of conventional quartz sand. Mineralogical composition of dolomite waste was detected by XRD. Obtained data indicated that the dolomite waste contain dolomite, quartz and calcite. From the view of quantitative analyse, the amount of impurity (quartz and calcite) is lower than 8. 4 %. The goal of the study is to examine <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> lightweight concrete mechanical and physical properties by making a comparison between traditional <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> lightweight concrete and units which containing different amount of dolomite waste. Physical properties such as density, porosity and absorption were determined. Tests were also performed to determine mechanical properties. Frost resistance and durability were tested. It was determined that it is possible to use dolomite waste in <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> lightweight concrete products by partly or totally substituting of conventional quartz sand...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} adding tragacanth, {{which is a}} natural resin, as <b>expanded</b> <b>clay</b> {{aggregate}} and binder to specimens on the thermal and mechanical properties of lightweight concretes has been examined in this study. <b>Expanded</b> <b>clay</b> with diameters of 4 - 8 mm and by proportion 5 %, 10 % and 20 % of cement’s weight was added to specimens in the study. As a binder, by addition of 1 % tragacanth to cement {{at the rate of}} 1 %, new lightweight concrete specimens with densities varying between 867 kg/m 3 to 1452 kg/m 3 were produced. Tragacanth with the same propor-tions of mixture was prepared in pure specimens in order to compare. Water / cement ratio was kept constant in all mixtures. At the end of a drying time of 28 days, thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, compressive strength, modulus of elastic-ity, water absorption and drying quantities of specimens were confirmed. As a result, decrease of thermal conductivity, density and compressive strength of specimens was seen through adding tragacanth and raising the amount of <b>expanded</b> <b>clay...</b>|$|R
