A few days before the 2015 election took place, Tsakalotos was quizzed on Syriza's economic policies by a number of economists, debt campaigners and investment analysts at the London School of Economics. Tsakalotos said there was a need for fiscal space, meaning 6–7billion Euros a year to spend on an <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy.</b> He also said that they would cancel the austerity budgets already agreed with the European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), pay back the loans from the IMF and focus on rescheduling and writing off the loans from the EU.|$|E

40|$|The paper studies empirically <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> around {{elections}} in 25 developing countries as {{affected by the}} exchange regime. It is argued that countries with flexible exchange regimes {{are less likely to}} engage in <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> before elections because such policies can result in devaluations and inflation which affects government popularity adversely. The empirical results show that governments indeed try to improve their re-election prospects with the help of <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> only in countries with fixed exchange rates and adequate reserve levels. For some countries, this raises doubts about the usefulness of fixed exchange rates for stabilizing the macro economy, unless reforms of the institutional framework reduce the scope for election-oriented fiscal expansion...|$|R

50|$|<b>Expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> {{consists}} of increasing net public spending, {{which the government}} can effect by a) taxing less, b) spending more, or c) both. Investment and consumption by government raises demand for businesses' products and for employment, reversing {{the effects of the}} aforementioned imbalance. If desired spending exceeds revenue, the government finances the difference by borrowing from capital markets by issuing government bonds. This is called deficit spending. Two points are important to note at this point. First, deficits are not required for <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> and second, it is only change in net spending that can stimulate or depress the economy. For example, if a government ran a deficit of 10% both last year and this year, this would represent neutral fiscal policy. In fact, if it ran a deficit of 10% last year and 5% this year, this would actually be contractionary. On the other hand, if the government ran a surplus of 10% of GDP last year and 5% this year, that would be <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> despite never running a deficit at all.|$|E

3000|$|If {{the voter}} is ideological {{the answer is}} quite straightforward.

30|$|Let us now {{consider}} the case of non-ideological voters ex ante thinking that austerity measures are more appropriate than <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> to return sustainable economic growth.

40|$|The paper studies empirically the <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> {{instruments}} {{by which}} governments try to influence election outcomes in 24 developing countries for the 1973 - 1992 period. The study {{finds that the}} main vehicle for <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> around elections is increasing public expenditure rather than lowering taxes, and public investment cycles seem particularly prominent. Institutional mechanisms which constrain discretionary expenditure policies and which strengthen fiscal control are therefore worthwhile considering to prevent opportunistic policy making around elections...|$|R
5000|$|One type {{frequently}} discussed is when <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> reduces investment {{spending by}} the private sector. The Government is [...] "crowding out" [...] investment because it is demanding more Loanable Funds and it is increasing interest rates from the borrowing, but that was broadened to multiple channels that might leave total output little changed or smaller.|$|E
50|$|In the {{classical}} view, the <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> also decreases net exports, {{which has a}} mitigating effect on national output and income. When government borrowing increases interest rates it attracts foreign capital from foreign investors. This is because, all other things being equal, the bonds issued from a country executing <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> now offer {{a higher rate of}} return. In other words, companies wanting to finance projects must compete with their government for capital so they offer higher rates of return. To purchase bonds originating from a certain country, foreign investors must obtain that country's currency. Therefore, when foreign capital flows into the country undergoing fiscal expansion, demand for that country's currency increases. This causes the currency to appreciate, reducing the cost of imports and making exports from that country more expensive to foreigners. Consequently, exports decrease and imports increase, reducing demand from net exports.|$|E

Studying the content of the national <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> (discretionary measures versus built-in stabilizers, revenue-based versus expenditure-based <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies,</b> the relationship existing between the size of the fiscal impulses-adjustments and the composition of these measures) shows the significant differences between the <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> {{implemented in the}} European Union countries...|$|R
40|$|Within {{currency}} unions, {{according to}} the pre-crises consensus, countries can rely on <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> to stabilize economic activity locally. Monetary policy's role, in turn, is to stabilize economic activity at the union level. Against this background, we reassess the optimal degree of fiscal stabilization within currency union provided that monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Specifically, we contrast the optimal level of government consumption from an individual country's perspective with the optimal level from the union's perspective and explore the need for coordinating <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R
30|$|Let us start {{considering}} {{the case in}} which politicians know that <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> are more popular with the electorate than cutbacks and other stiff austerity measures.

Since ideological voters are in our model biased towards policy E, we say {{we have in this}} case a scenario with like biases.|$|R
50|$|Since in the Keynesian view, recessions {{are caused}} by {{inadequate}} aggregate demand, when a recession occurs the government should {{increase the amount of}} aggregate demand and bring the economy back into equilibrium.

The results of this analysis confirm the basic findings of earlier studies, namely, that monetary expansion, driven mainly by <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies,</b> explains {{to a large degree}} the inflationary process in Nigeria.

40|$|Emerging market {{financial}} crises {{during the late}} 1990 s were marked by sudden withdrawals of funds by foreign creditors, resulting in production declines.

This paper formulates an open-economy general equilibrium model for resolving this policy conundrum and analyzing the impact of disciplined <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> on post-crisis recovery.

50|$|At {{the outset}} of Joseph Estrada’s presidency, the Asian {{financial}} crisis that characterized the period prompted the national leadership {{to take a second}} look at the country’s economic policies and strategies. To maintain macroeconomic stability in light {{of the effects of the}} economic turmoil, the government had to raise domestic demand by sustaining expenditures and pump-priming the areas of public infrastructure and social services. It had to adopt an <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> by allowing a reasonable level of cyclical deficit to be financed largely through foreign borrowing while offsetting the negative impact of deficit by introducing structural reforms in the budget process.|$|E
50|$|Although {{significant}} oil {{discoveries in}} 1976 allowed a temporary recovery, the windfall from petroleum sales also allowed continuation of Echeverría's destructive fiscal policies. In the mid-1970s, Mexico {{went from being}} a net importer of oil and petroleum products to a significant exporter. Oil and petrochemicals became the economy's most dynamic growth sector. Rising oil income allowed the government to continue its <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> partially financed by higher foreign borrowing. Between 1978 and 1981, the economy grew more than 8 percent annually, as the government spent heavily on energy, transportation, and basic industries. Manufacturing output expanded modestly during these years, growing by 8.2 percent in 1978, 9.3 percent in 1979, and 8.2 percent in 1980.|$|E
50|$|Economic growth {{picked up}} in the late 1990s {{following}} slow growth and domestic fiscal adjustment in early years of the decade. Despite an <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> the public debt remained moderate at around 50 percent of GDP as deficits were financed partly by privatization receipts. Since 2001, economic growth declined caused by adverse shocks such as a slowdown in the global economy and natural disasters. To deal with the shocks, fiscal policy became more expansionary while privatization receipts declined. As a result, public debt increased sharply to near 110 percent of GDP in 2003. Economic conditions worsened when Hurricane Ivan hit the country in September 2004; progress in fiscal consolidation was impeded as government revenues fell and policy priority was shifted to post-hurricane relief.|$|E

50|$|Systemic banking crises are {{associated}} with substantial fiscal costs and large output losses.

In crises of liquidity and solvency, central banks can provide liquidity to support illiquid banks.

Recent contributions in this journal emphasized the role of <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> not only during recessionary conditions but rather as a standard feature of the macroeconomic policy stance, arguing that budget deficits lead to higher business profits and, therefore, economic growth.

50|$|In economics, an <b>expansionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> {{includes}} higher {{spending and}} tax cuts, that encourage economic growth. In turn, an {{expansionary monetary policy}} is one that seeks to {{increase the size of}} the money supply. As usual, inciting of money supply is aimed at lowering the interest rates on purpose to achieve economic growth by increase of economic activity. Conversely, contractionary monetary policy seeks {{to reduce the size of}} the money supply. In most nations, monetary policy is controlled by either a central bank or a finance ministry. Neoclassical and Keynesian economics significantly differ on the effects and effectiveness of monetary policy on influencing the real economy; there is no clear consensus on how monetary policy affects real economic variables (aggregate output or income, employment). Both economic schools accept that monetary policy affects monetary variables (price levels, interest rates).|$|E
