40|$|Hazelnuts {{are widely}} used into the confectionary {{industry}} for their flavour and taste. Nondestructive techniques are required to detect {{the quality of the}} nuts <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> with the aim of avoiding putting a poor product into the market chain. In this work, Time Domain-NMR (TD-NMR) has been employed to detect hidden defects <b>in</b> <b>hazelnuts</b> <b>in</b> <b>shell.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) technique has been used to evaluate the transverse relaxation times, T 2, for healthy and unhealthy hazelnuts, highlighting the differences between them. An index that takes in account the different time constants of the transverse relaxation curve has been defined to establish a classification method for the hazelnuts.

40|$|Response surface {{methodology}} {{was applied}} to predict the optimum conditions for extraction of phenolic compounds <b>in</b> <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shell.</b> The phenolic content <b>in</b> the <b>shell</b> extract was determined spectrophotometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method and expressed as gallic acid equivalent (mg GAE g− 1). Two central composite designs were used to investigate the effects of two independent variables, namely solvent composition (%) and extraction time (min), on phenolic extraction. In a first series of repeated batch extractions, the solvent consisted of different methanol percentages in distilled water at pH 4, while in a second series methanol was substituted by ethanol. The highest phenolic content (6. 67 mg GAE g− 1 of shell) was predicted at the extraction conditions of 55. 7 % ethanol and 108. 7 min. These best conditions, obtained and applied to 13 different cultivars, showed values varying from 9. 18 mg GAE g− 1 of shell for Barcelona to 3. 00 mg GAE g− 1 of shell for Tonda di Giffoni.

40|$|Abstract: The {{adsorption}} {{behavior of}} hazelnut shell and its ash for cadmium ions from aqueous solution {{has been investigated}} {{as a function of}} appropriate equilibrium time, amount of adsorbent, concentration of adsorbate, pH and particle size using a batch system. Experiments were conducted by use of jar test apparatus. Studies showed that pH of aqueous solution affected cadmium adsorption as a result of removal efficiency increased with increasing solution pH but after pH about 6 the removal efficiency decreased. The maximum adsorption were about 98. 2 and 99. 1 % for hazelnut shell and its ash, respectively, at pH 6, contact time 1 180 minutes and initial concentration of 30 mgL. Desorption of cadmium was 12 % at pH 6 the cadmium sorption obeyed both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The studies showed that hazelnut shell ash was more favorable than <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shell</b> <b>in</b> removing cadmium and thus, was a better adsorbent...|$|R

While the people of Iran have been trying to legally change this practice by implementing a higher minimum in marriage, there have been countless blocks to such an attempt. Although the average age of women being married has increased by about five years in the past couple decades, young girls being married is still common feature of marriage in Iran—even though there is an article in the Iranian Civil Code that forbid the marriage of women younger than 15 years of age and males younger than 18 years of age.|$|R

40|$|Hazelnuts {{are widely}} used nowadays, and can pose {{a serious threat to}} {{allergic}} consumers due to cross-contamination that may occur during processing. This might lead to the presence of hidden <b>hazelnut</b> <b>in</b> foods. Therefore, reliable tests are needed to detect <b>hazelnut,</b> especially <b>in</b> processed foods. A hazelnut-specific indirect competitive ELISA based on polyclonal chicken antibodies was developed. The polyclonal antibodies were raised against modified <b>hazelnut</b> proteins <b>in</b> order to improve the detectability of <b>hazelnut</b> proteins <b>in</b> processed foods. The assay showed a detection limit of 1. 36 mu g hazelnut protein/mL of 5 mM urea in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7. 4). Limited cross-reactivity with walnut and pecan nut was observed; no cross-reactivity was observed with other food ingredients. Blank cookies spiked before analysis showed recoveries of 73 - 107 %. However, cookies spiked before baking showed that the detectability was severely decreased. Addition of lactose to the cookies, which led to more severe modification through the Mail lard reaction, led to an increase in the detectability.

40|$|Background: Allergenicity {{of foods}} can be {{influenced}} by processing. Tree nuts are {{an important source of}} nutrition and increasingly consumed; however, processing methods are quite variable and data are currently lacking on the effects of processing on allergenicity. Objective: To perform a systematic literature review on the effects of food processing on the allergenicity of tree nuts. Methods: A systematic literature search of PubMed and Embase databases was performed, with screening of references, related articles and citations. Studies were included if they assessed the allergenicity or immunogenicity of processed nuts. Results: The search resulted in 32 articles suitable for analysis. Clinical studies indicate that roasting reduces the allergenicity of <b>hazelnut</b> <b>in</b> individuals with a birch pollen allergy and reactivity to raw hazelnut. Thermal processing may reduce the allergenicity of the PR- 10 protein <b>in</b> <b>hazelnut</b> and almond <b>in</b> vitro.
