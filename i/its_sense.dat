40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a sensing scheduler that learns {{about the environment}} monitored and adjusts <b>its</b> <b>sensing</b> behaviour according to the variation in the environment. The aim is to preserve energy by minimising sensing events in normal situation, but response quickly and reliably when a rare-event happens. Temporally, the scheduler uses statistical long-term and short-term averages to tune <b>its</b> <b>sensing</b> frequency. Spatial neighbour coordination is incorporated to enhance information dissemination across the network and minimise detection delay. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes few ways of {{improving}} a WSN’s energy efficiency that already uses an energy efficient data routing protocol for continuous monitoring application. The proposed improvements are (i) data negotiation, (ii) development of data change expectancy, and (iii) data vanishing. In data negotiation, an active sensor sends <b>its</b> <b>sensed</b> data {{only when the}} data changes. In expectancy development, a sensor develops the expectancy of when <b>its</b> <b>sensed</b> data might change. It then adjusts <b>its</b> <b>sensing</b> frequency accordingly to avoid unnecessary sensing. In data vanishing, duplicate sensed data from multiple sensors are discarded while routed to the BS. Together, the proposed improvements {{can be viewed as}} an emulated cache where latest sensed data are always known without requiring the sensors to sense and report continuously. Our simulation results also show significant WSN lifetime increase from this emulated caching...|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, {{it is able to}} recognize observers at great distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> of smell is excellent.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess is {{one example}} of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American {{national}} identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> of self through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely {{utilized}} available {{light to}} give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> of authenticity. Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used just three words: Yeah', 'right' and 'sure. Beresford, Foote and Duvall considered the climactic scene {{to be the one}} in which Mac, tending the family garden, discusses with Rosa Lee his pain over his daughter's death. Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a long take and long shot so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact. Duvall said he felt the scene underscored Mac's stoicism in the face of tragedy and loss.|$|E

5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using <b>its</b> <b>sense</b> of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E
5|$|With prey often {{scarce in}} its oceanic environment, the silky shark is a swift, inquisitive, and {{persistent}} hunter. It feeds mainly on bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and has been}} known to drive them into compacted schools before launching open-mouthed, slashing attacks. This species often trails schools of tuna, a favored prey. <b>Its</b> <b>sense</b> of hearing is extremely acute, allowing it to localize the low-frequency noises generated by other feeding animals, and, by extension, sources of food. The silky shark is viviparous, meaning that the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. Significant geographical variation is seen in its life history details. Reproduction occurs year-round except in the Gulf of Mexico, where it follows a seasonal cycle. Females give birth to litters of up to 16pups annually or biennially. The newborn sharks spend their first months in relatively sheltered reef nurseries on the outer continental shelf, growing substantially before moving into the open ocean.|$|E

The Bayesian network structure is learned from complete environment information data using K 2 algorithm combined with GA. The mobile robot actively plans <b>its</b> <b>sensing</b> action to obtain sensing information event by taking into account the trade-off between global localization belief and the sensing cost.
