5|$|The {{expedition}} passed onwards through Kejache {{territory and}} reported that the Kejache towns were situated in easily defensible locations and were often <b>fortified.</b> One of these was built on a rocky outcrop near a lake and a river that fed into it. The town was <b>fortified</b> with a wooden palisade and {{was surrounded by a}} moat. Cortés reported that the town of Tiac was even larger and was <b>fortified</b> with walls, watchtowers and earthworks; the town itself was divided into three individually <b>fortified</b> districts. Tiac was said to have been at war with the unnamed smaller town. The Kejache claimed that their towns were <b>fortified</b> against the attacks of their aggressive Itza neighbours.|$|E

Players need not own a space or naval commander to <b>fortify</b> into lunar or water territories. However, to <b>fortify</b> from a territory on the Earth Game Board to a territory on the Moon Game Board one of the connected territories must be a space station.|$|R

5|$|Castles {{can take}} several forms. The most common is the motte-and-bailey which {{consists}} of a motte (a mound)– surmounted by a keep or tower– connected to a bailey, an outer enclosure where the barracks and workshops were located. Other types of castle in Cheshire are ringworks and <b>fortified</b> manor houses. Ringworks are similar to motte-and-bailey castles but lack the motte; although contemporary with motte-and-baileys, they are an uncommon form of fortification. A ringwork may have been built rather than a motte-and-bailey because the soil was too thin to provide a proper motte or {{simply because of the}} preference of the builder. A <b>fortified</b> manor house was the administrative centre of a manor– a division of land in medieval England– and was usually the home of the local lord. <b>Fortified</b> manor houses are considered castles because they often had battlements or crenellations.|$|E

5|$|Crossing {{points in}} the defence network– bridges, tunnels and other weak spots– were called nodes or points of resistance. These were <b>fortified</b> with {{removable}} road blocks, barbed wire entanglements, and land mines.

In places entire villages were <b>fortified</b> using barriers of scaffolding, sandbagged positions and loopholes in existing buildings.|$|E

5|$|Gibraltar was <b>fortified</b> for {{the first}} time in 1160 by the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min in {{response}} to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of Aragon and Castile. Gibraltar was renamed Jebel al-Fath (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist, and a <b>fortified</b> town named Medinat al-Fath (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.|$|E
5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} {{can be prevented}} or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples are red meat, poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, <b>fortified</b> bread, and <b>fortified</b> breakfast cereals.|$|E

As attempts at settling and <b>fortifying</b> the Strait of Magellan were abandoned the Spanish began to <b>fortify</b> the Captaincy General of Chile {{and other parts of}} the west coast of the Americas.

5|$|When the Roman fleet reached Africa, {{a council}} was held aboard Belisarius' {{flagship}} (The Vandalic War, I.15), {{where many of}} his officers advocated an immediate attack on Carthage itself, especially since {{it was the only}} <b>fortified</b> city in the Vandal realm, the walls of the other cities having been torn down to prevent a rebellion. Belisarius, however, mindful of the fate of the 468 expedition and wary of an encounter with the Vandal fleet, spoke against it.

5|$|Zhu Yuanzhang, {{the first}} Emperor of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), was advised by Zhu Sheng, a sage, {{to build a}} <b>fortified</b> high wall around the city, create storage {{facilities}} for food and then establish his empire by unifying all the other states. Following the hermit's advice, Zhu established the Ming dynasty, and then built a highly <b>fortified</b> wall over a previously existing palace wall of the Tang dynasty (618 -907). He started building the Xian City Wall, as the capital of northwestern Shaanxi Province in 1370. He incorporated the ancient <b>fortified</b> embankments built by the Sui and Tang Dynasties by including them in the wall's western and southern parts, enlarging the eastern and northern parts. The edifice was built over an eight-year period and was well maintained during both the Ming Dynasty, and the Qing Dynasty, which followed.|$|E
5|$|Æthelflæd {{had already}} <b>fortified</b> an unknown {{location}} called Bremesburh in 910 and in 912 she built defences at Bridgnorth {{to cover a}} crossing of the River Severn. In 913 she built forts at Tamworth to guard against the Danes in Leicester, and in Stafford to cover access from the Trent Valley. In 914 a Mercian army drawn from Gloucester and Hereford repelled a Viking invasion from Brittany, and the Iron Age Eddisbury hill fort was repaired to protect against invasion from Northumbria or Cheshire, while Warwick was <b>fortified</b> as further protection against the Leicester Danes. In 915 Chirbury was <b>fortified</b> to guard a route from Wales and Runcorn on the River Mersey. Defences were built before 914 at Hereford, and probably Shrewsbury and two other fortresses, at Scergeat and Weardbyrig, which have not been located.|$|E
