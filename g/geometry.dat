The Cartan <b>geometries</b> modeled on skeletons can be used for the description of such categories of Cartan <b>geometries</b> and therefore we develop the theory of Cartan <b>geometries</b> modeled on skeletons, in detail. In particular, we show that there are functors from the categories of Cartan <b>geometries</b> with morphisms induced by extension functors to certain categories of Cartan <b>geometries</b> modeled on skeletons with the usual morphisms. We study how to compute (infinitesimal) automorphisms of Cartan <b>geometries</b> modeled on skeletons and how to compute the morphisms induced by the extension functors for particular Cartan <b>geometries.</b> Some examples and applications of the morphisms induced by extension functors are presented in the setting of the Riemannian <b>geometries.</b> Comment: 22 p...|$|R
50|$|Finite <b>geometries</b> may be {{constructed}} via linear algebra, starting from vector spaces over a finite field; the affine and projective planes so constructed are called Galois <b>geometries.</b> Finite <b>geometries</b> {{can also be}} defined purely axiomatically. Most common finite <b>geometries</b> are Galois <b>geometries,</b> since any finite projective space of dimension three or greater is isomorphic to a projective space over a finite field (that is, the projectivization of a vector space over a finite field). However, dimension two has affine and projective planes that are not isomorphic to Galois <b>geometries,</b> namely the non-Desarguesian planes. Similar results hold for other kinds of finite <b>geometries.</b>|$|R

This suggests a similar connection for RWPri <b>geometries.</b> We prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the RWPri <b>geometries</b> of G and those of G/Φ(G). Hence only RWPri <b>geometries</b> for Frattini free groups have to be considered.

5|$|From 1945 onwards, Britain {{conducted}} {{a number of}} studies into the properties and use of variable <b>geometry</b> wings. The noted British engineer and inventor Sir Barnes Wallis began exploring the concept during the Second World War and became an early pioneer and advocate for the variable <b>geometry</b> wing, conceiving of an aircraft consideration that lacked conventional features such as a vertical stabiliser and rudder, instead using variable <b>geometry</b> wings to provide primary controllability in their place. In 1946, Wallis published a paper upon this research, which was quickly hailed as being a major scientific breakthrough in the aviation industry. Wallis proceeded to advocate for the production of an aircraft, military or civil, that would take advantage of a variable <b>geometry</b> wing. The Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Defence arranged for a series of tests to demonstrate the application of the technology to projectiles, both for research purposes and a potential form of anti-aircraft defence; while Wallis worked upon this research programme, he continued to promote the concept of a manned variable <b>geometry</b> aircraft.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that supersymmetric {{microstate}} <b>geometries</b> are classically unstable. One argument for instability involves considering the motion of a massive particle near the ergosurface of such a spacetime.

Another argument for instability is related to the phenomenon of stable trapping of null geodesics in these <b>geometries.</b> Such trapping is studied in detail for the most symmetrical microstate <b>geometries.</b> It is found that there are several distinct types of trapped null geodesic, both prograde and retrograde.
