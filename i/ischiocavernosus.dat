These exercises also serve to contract, among others, the <b>ischiocavernosus,</b> bulbospongiosus, and cremaster muscle in men, as voluntary contraction of the pubococcygeus muscle also engages the cremasteric reflex, which lifts the testicles up, although this does not occur in all men.

50|$|The raised rim at {{the border}} of the shaft and glans is called the corona. The urethra runs through the shaft, {{providing}} an exit for sperm and urine. The root consists of the expanded ends of the cavernous bodies, which fan out to form the crura and attach to the pubic bone and the expanded end of the spongy body (bulb). The root is surrounded by two muscles; the bulbocavernosus muscle and the <b>ischiocavernosus</b> muscle, which aid urination and ejaculation. The penis has a foreskin that typically covers the glans; this is sometimes removed by circumcision for medical, religious or cultural reasons. In the scrotum, the testicles are held away from the body, one possible reason for this is so sperm can be produced in an environment slightly lower than normal body temperature.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{presence}} of mechanical stimulation, erection is initiated by the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) with minimal input from the central nervous system. Parasympathetic branches extend from the sacral plexus into the arteries supplying the erectile tissue; upon stimulation, these nerve branches release acetylcholine, which, in turn causes release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells in the trabecular arteries. Nitric oxide diffuses to the smooth muscle of the arteries (called trabecular smooth muscle), acting as a vasodilating agent. [...] The arteries dilate, filling the corpora spongiosum and cavernosa with blood. The <b>ischiocavernosus</b> and bulbospongiosus muscles also compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa, limiting the venous drainage of blood. Erection subsides when parasympathetic stimulation is discontinued; baseline stimulation from the sympathetic division of the ANS causes constriction of the penile arteries, forcing blood out of the erectile tissue.|$|E

40|$|Background. In men, {{involuntary}} or voluntary <b>ischiocavernosus</b> muscle contrac-tions after erection lead to intracavernous blood pressures {{far higher}} than the systolic pressure, which builds and maintains penile rigidity. Thus, erectile dysfunction may be partly due to <b>ischiocavernosus</b> muscle atrophy and may be treated by rehabilita-tion interventions. Objective. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether pelvic-floor muscle strengthening interventions could be associated with increases in intracav-ernous pressure that would increase penile rigidity. Design. An observational study was conducted. Methods. One hundred twenty-two men with isolated erectile dysfunction and 108 men with isolated premature ejaculation participated (no neuromuscular dis-eases or previous perineal rehabilitation). Thirty-minute sessions of voluntary con-tractions coupled with electrical stimulation were designed to increase ischiocaver-nosus muscle strength (monitored through intracavernous pressure increase).

40|$|KEY WORDS <b>ischiocavernosus</b> muscle; bulbospongiosus muscle; lumbosacral spi-nal motoneurons; ejaculation; male copulatory {{behavior}} ABSTRACT Despite {{the importance}} of rabbits in reproductive studies, little infor-mation {{is available on the}} anatomy and participation of the striated-perineal muscles in male copulatory behavior. In our study, we describe the gross anatomy of two stri-ated-perineal muscles: the <b>ischiocavernosus</b> (ICm) and the bulbospongiosus (BSm). Both muscles have their origin at the ischiadic arc, but the ICm is inserted into the penile crura and the BSm onto the ligamentum suspensorium of the penis. The moto-neurons of both muscles were identified using retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase coupled to wheat-germ agglutinin. Motoneurons were dispersed in the lower-lumbar and upper-sacral spinal-cord segments, instead of being aggregated in the neuronal nucleus as in other species: the rat, mouse, gerbil, cat, and man. Bilat-eral dennervation of the ICm or BSm or both in sexually experienced male rabbits did not affect copulatory variables measured at 10, 20, and 30 days after surgery. How-ever, muscular dennervation produced extravaginal ejaculations in 42 % of copulatory tests and no ejaculation in 7 % of tests, although male pelvic thrusting occurred. These results suggest the participation of the ICm and BSm perineal muscles in penile orien-tation during copulation but not in seminal emission as described in other mammalian species.

40|$|The corpus cavernosus penis (CCP) and electromyographic (EMG) {{activity}} of the ex-ternal penile muscles were recorded during erection and ejaculation of the goat. The mean peak CCP pressures were 18, 83, and 7003 mm Hg for the quiescence, mild erection, and maximum erection stage of the penis. The contractions of the <b>ischiocavernosus</b> muscles (1 CM) were in phase with the peak pressures of the CCP. Anesthesia of the 1 CM prevented the high peak CCP pressures, indicating that these muscles {{are the source of}} energy for the high pressure recorded. The mechanism of erection in man and animals has been under investigation for many years. Explanations for the mechanism of penile erection have been primarily the-ories deduced from anatomical studies and limited physiological experimentation (Dey-sack, 1939; Denamur and Simonnet, 1950; Conti, 1952). It is generally considered that erection of the penis is produced by a com-bination of elevated arterial pressure, dila-tion of the arteries to the penis, restricted venous return, relaxation of the walls of the cavernous spaces, and contraction of the external penile muscles. The importance of each factor has not been delineated. The role of the <b>ischiocavernosus</b> muscles (1 CM) and bulbocavernosus muscles (BCM) is an example for consideration. Henderson and Roepke (1933) noted the pumping action of these muscles, but attached little significance to it. Sisson and Grossman (1953) stated that the contraction of the 1 CM pulls th...|$|E
40|$|Sexually mature male goats {{were used}} to study the {{hemodynamics}} of penile erection. Contrast medium was injected into the internal pudendal artery and serial angiographs of the erection, and detumescence phases of the erection cycle. The flow of contrast medium in-jected after erection by electrostimulation was blocked at the caudal edge of the ischiai arch just proximal to {{the origin of the}} deep arteries of the penis. It is suggested that the major valvular mechanism that makes the corpus cavernosum penis a closed system during erection is a mechanical compression cf the internal pudendal arteries, deep arteries of the penis ex-ternal to or within the tunica albuginea 0 ! the crus, and veins against the ischium by contrac-tion of the <b>ischiocavernosus</b> muscles. The hemodynamics of penile erection {{has been the subject of}} studies in several species of animals. Some investigators proposed that increased blood flow into the penis was the main factor of erection (Newman et a!., 1964), although earlier workers suggested that mechanical compression of the venous drainage was an important factor (Sisson and Grossman, 1953; Dorr and Brody, 1967). Recent work of Lewis ci ’ a!., 1968 on the bull and Beckett et a!., 1972, on the goat indicates that the corpus cavernosum penis (CCP) pressure of these two species is several times higher than arterial pressure during erection. Beckett ci ’ a!., 1972, also reported that the peak CCP pressures observed during maximum erection could be abolished by local anesthesia of the <b>ischiocavernosus</b> muscles (1 CM) with lidocaine.

40|$|Abstract: Penile {{urethral}} obstruction in cats is {{a commonly}} seen clinical case in veterinary medicine practice. In cases {{where there is}} no response to catheterisation or medical intervention, surgery is needed to enable urination and correct uraemia and hyperkalaemia. Several surgical techniques of urethrostomy have been described for this aim. In performing standard prepucial urethrostomy great care must be taken to minimise leakage in the anastomosis site and promote healing when performing the pelvic urethra and prepucial mucosa anastomosis. To achieve this, the line of anastomosis has been reinforced by covering the anastomosis with the bilateral bulbourethral tissue, m. ischiourethralis and m. <b>ischiocavernosus</b> using simple mattress sutures. This modification, which varies from the technique performed by Yeh and Şaroğlu, has been termed the coating technique. Advantages of this new technique over standard perineal urethrostomy are discussed. This technique was used in the treatment of 55 cats with penile urethra obstruction presented to our clinic. Among them 52 cats showed uncomplicated recovery. Following anastomosis, a male dog urethral catheter with an outer diameter of 2. 6 mm was placed in each patient.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{reaction}} of the corpora cavernosa (CC), the corpus spongiosum (CS), the bulbocavernosus (BCM) and <b>ischiocavernosus</b> (ICM) muscles to passage of urine through the urethra during micturition is not known. We investigated {{the hypothesis that the}} passage of urine through the urethra stimulates the corporal tissue and cavernosus muscles. Methods In 30 healthy men (mean age 42. 8 ± 11. 7 years), the electromyographic activity (EMG) of the CC, CS, BCM, and ICM were recorded before and during micturition, and on interruption of and straining during micturition. These tests were repeated after individual anesthetization of urethra, corporal tissue, and cavernosus muscles. Results During micturition, the slow wave variables (frequency, amplitude, conduction velocity) of the CC and CS decreased while the motor unit action potentials of the BCM and ICM increased; these EMG changes were mild and returned to the basal values on interruption or termination of micturition. Micturition after individual anesthetization of urethra, corporal tissue and cavernosal muscles did not effect significant EMG changes in these structures, while saline administration produced changes similar to those occurring before saline administration. Conclusion The decrease of sinusoidal and increase of cavernosus muscles' EMG activity during micturition apparently denotes sinusoidal relaxation and cavernosus muscles contraction. Sinusoidal muscle relaxation and cavernosus muscles contraction upon micturition are suggested to be mediated through a 'urethro-corporocavernosal reflex'. These sinusoidal and cavernosus muscle changes appear to produce a mild degree of penile tumescence and stretch which might assist in urinary flow during micturition. </p...|$|E

Using spinal cord slices of young male rats and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we investigated the sensitivity of pudendal motoneurons to nicotinic cholinergic agonists. Motoneurons were identified following 1, 1 '-dilinoleyl- 3, 3, 3 ', 3 '-tetramethylindocarbocyanine, 4 -chlorobenzenesulphonate retrograde labelling. In the presence of atropine, both dorsomedial and dorsolateral motoneurons responded to acetylcholine (ACh) by generating a rapidly activating inward current. By using selective nicotinic antagonists and a nicotinic positive allosteric modulator, we found that nicotinic ACh receptors present in dorsomedial and dorsolateral motoneurons display distinct pharmacological profiles. Whereas the former are of the heteromeric type, the latter are predominantly of the alpha 7 -containing type. These data were confirmed by light microscopic autoradiography. In young rats, a ligand for heteromeric nicotinic receptors labelled all laminae of the central grey matter, whereas in the ventral part of the central grey, a ligand selective for alpha 7 -containing nicotinic receptors labelled the DL but not the DM.

Among the rodent species studied we can highlight the wide variation in the morphology of the male reproductive system. Thus, considering the ecological importance of rodents, and the large number and geographical representation of this animal, as well as shortages regarding the reproductive anatomy, we developed this study with viscacha, a South American histricomorph rodent. As this species has some very peculiar reproductive features, we described the gross anatomy of the perineal muscles {{and the role of}} copulatory behavior. The perineal region of viscacha is composed of five muscles, three of which are arranged in the superficial genitourinary diaphragm, as Musculus <b>ischiocavernosus,</b> M. bulbocavernosus and M. bulbospongiosus, and the muscles that lie at the pelvic diaphragm, M. levator ani and M. retractor penis.

We conducted an anatomical and histological {{study of the}} perineum of the normal mouse and of a transgenic mouse strain deficient in urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA-/-) that was previously reported to develop {{a high incidence of}} rectal prolapse. We could clearly identify the iliococcygeus (ILC) and pubococcygeus (PC) muscles and anal (SPA) and urethral (SPU) sphincters in male and female mice. The bulbocavernosus (BC), <b>ischiocavernosus</b> (ISC) and levator ani (LA) muscles could be found only in male mice. Histochemical analysis of the pelvic floor muscles revealed a majority of type IIA fibres. Rectal prolapses were observed only in male uPA-/- mice. The most obvious finding was an irreducible evagination of the rectal mucosa and a swelling of the entire perineal region corresponding to an irreducible hernia of the seminal vesicles through the pelvic outlet. The hernia caused stretching and thinning of the ISC, BC and LA. Myopathic damage, with degenerated and centronucleated myofibres, were observed in these muscles. The PC, ILC, SPA and SPU were not affected. This study provides an original description of a model of pelvic floor disorder and illustrates the differences existing between the perineum of humans and that of a quadruped species. In spite of these differences, the histopathologic changes observed in the pelvic floor muscles of uPA-/- mice with rectal prolapse suggest that prolonged muscular stretching causes a primary myopathic injury. This should be taken into account in the evaluation of pelvic floor disorders. status: publishe...|$|E
