40|$|This paper {{describes}} research {{concerned with}} assisting groups in organizations handle their complex, ill-structured policy issues in ways {{which we believe}} are significantly different from many typical policy analysis projects. It is our belief that many systems research, operational research and management science projects have concentrated on ‘objective’, usually quantitative data {{at the expense of}} losing their clients' interest and commitment. Our work is concerned with taking account of intersubjectivity in policy analysis and evaluation. It is orientated to the construction of models that will be owned by our clients because they recognize as legitimate, and explicitly take account of, the subjective and particular knowledge of individuals within organizations. They also explicitly take account of the interaction of shared and individual knowledge as a group comes to define an intersubjective <b>group</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceUsing a {{data set}} of 839 French deals, {{we look at}} the change in {{corporate}} behavior following a leveraged buyout (LBO) relative to an adequately chosen control group. In the 3 years following a leveraged buyout, targets become more profitable, grow much faster than their peer <b>group,</b> <b>issue</b> additional debt, and increase capital expenditures. We then provide evidence consistent with the idea that in our sample, private equity funds create value by relaxing credit constraints, allowing LBO targets to take advantage of hitherto unexploited growth opportunities. First, post-buyout growth is concentrated among private-to-private transactions, i. e., deals where the seller is an individual, as opposed to divisional buyouts or public-to-private LBOs where the seller is a private or a public firm. Second, the observed post-buyout growth in size and post-buyout increase in debt and capital expenditures are stronger when the targets operate in an industry that is relatively more dependent on external finance. These results contrast with existing evidence that LBO targets invest less or downsize...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{literature}} on the issue overlap of Democratic and Republican candidates in campaigns. Scholars investigate {{the extent to which}} candidates talk about the same set of issues, and whether the stakes of the election or the types of issues on the agenda affect such overlap. Less is known, however, on when and how often pro-Democratic and pro-Republican interest groups converge on issue discussion with their candidate and party allies. Are interest groups truly independent in what they talk about in campaigns, or do they follow the cues of candidates and parties? This paper explores the level of issue overlap in political ads between Democratic candidates, parties, and interest groups, and between Republican candidates, parties, and interest groups in the 2000, 2002, and 2004 Senate campaigns. Using a comprehensive dataset of all political ads aired between 2000 and 2004, I show that interest <b>group</b> <b>issue</b> overlap is dependent on the campaign’s negativity, the type of election, and the issue convergence between the two major candidates. In general, the evidence indicates that interest groups are not “loose cannons ” but “loyal foot soldiers ” who shape the content of their public communications to reflect the content of the campaign as waged by the candidates and formal party organizations. ...|$|E
