2500|$|While in Belgrade, Kočić met {{the writer}} Janko Veselinović, whose popular {{short stories and}} novels romanticized Serbian peasant life. Kočić shared several of his poems with Veselinović. The latter {{recommended}} that he focus on prose instead. Kočić's time in Belgrade was marked by dire poverty. [...] "Although Serbian," [...] he wrote, the city was [...] "a foreign world". His behaviour became extremely volatile, as seen in a letter he wrote his childhood friend and future wife Milka Vukmanović, threatening to kill her and then himself if she married another. Letters to his father, pressing for money, also struck an abusive and manipulative tone. The thought of committing suicide began to appear more frequently in his notes. [...] "I will kill myself," [...] he wrote, [...] "to put an end {{once and for all}} to all the sufferings and torments that have pursued me from my birth. My life in Banja Luka was hard and dark, in Sarajevo still worse, and in Belgrade it reached the very climax of suffering." [...] The historian Robin Okey describes such passages as [...] "a reminder of the stresses on young students in this first transition from patriarchalism, particularly without funding, when <b>illness</b> and <b>hunger</b> <b>were</b> recurrent." ...|$|R
50|$|For example, {{imagine a}} fictional segment of {{students}} who received poor testing scores.

Further investigation revealed that late in the day, the students lacked ability to focus. Even further investigation revealed that the reason for the lack of focus <b>was</b> <b>hunger.</b> So, the root cause of the poor testing scores <b>was</b> <b>hunger,</b> remedied by moving the testing time to soon after lunch.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{examined}} {{the implications of}} illness centrality for psychological and physical health among male and female early adolescents with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We interviewed 132 adolescents before or after a routine clinic appointment. We measured {{the extent to which}} they defined themselves in terms of their illness, their views of the illness, psychological well-being, self-care behavior, and metabolic control. RESULTS: Females scored higher on illness centrality than males. <b>Illness</b> centrality <b>was</b> related to poor psychological well-being when the <b>illness</b> <b>was</b> perceived in negative terms, but only for females. For males, <b>illness</b> centrality <b>was</b> unrelated to psychological well-being. <b>Illness</b> centrality <b>was</b> related to poor metabolic control. CONCLUSIONS: The extent to which adolescent females define themselves in terms of their <b>illness</b> <b>is</b> most problematic when the <b>illness</b> <b>is</b> perceived in highly negative terms. Future research should examine how illness centrality and views of illness change over the course of adolescence...|$|R

40|$|It {{has become}} common to say {{psychiatric}} <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> brain diseases. This reflects {{a conception of}} the mental as being biologically based, though it is also thought that thinking of psychiatric illness this way will reduce the stigma attached to psychiatric illness. If psychiatric <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> brain diseases, however, {{it is not clear}} why psychiatry should not collapse into neurology, and some argue for this course. Others try to maintain a distinction by saying that neurology deals with abnormalities of neural structure while psychiatry deals with specific abnormalities of neural functioning. It is not clear that neurologists would accept this division, nor that they should. I argue that if we take seriously the notion that psychiatric <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> mental <b>illnesses</b> we can draw a more defensible boundary between psychiatry and neurology. As mental illnesses, psychiatric illnesses must have symptoms that affect our mental capacities and that the sufferer is capable of being aware of, even if they are not always self-consciously aware of them. Neurological illnesses, such as stroke or multiple sclerosis, may be diagnosed even if they are silent, just as the person may not be aware of having high blood pressure or may suffer a silent myocardial infarction. It does not make sense to speak of panic disorder if the person has never had a panic attack, however, or of bipolar disorder in the absence of mood swings. This does not mean psychiatric <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> not biologically based. Mental <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> <b>illnesses</b> of persons, whereas other <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> <b>illnesses</b> of biological individuals...|$|R

50|$|The {{cause of}} <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> {{distinguished}} into categories {{of natural and}} unnatural <b>illnesses.</b> Natural <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> based on sicknesses derived that involve external conditions.
