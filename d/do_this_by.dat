5|$|Players can gamble. They can <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> visiting casinos, buying chips {{with the}} three major {{currencies}} in the games, and playing either blackjack, slots, or roulette within them. Players can also play a card game called Caravan, which was specifically designed for the game and has its own rules, and can be played with certain people outside of the casinos.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of a}} {{follicle}} {{is surrounded}} by a single layer of follicular cells. When stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), these secrete the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. They <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> transporting and metabolising the thyroglobulin contained in the colloid. Follicular cells vary in shape from flat to cuboid to columnar, depending on how active they are.|$|E
5|$|The major {{function}} of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body's calcium and phosphate levels within a very narrow range, so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly. The parathyroid glands <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> secreting parathyroid hormone.|$|E
25|$|Monoids may {{be given}} a presentation, much {{in the same way}} that groups can be {{specified}} by means of a group presentation. One <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> specifying a set of generators Σ, and a set of relations on the free monoid Σ∗. One <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> extending (finite) binary relations on Σ∗ to monoid congruences, and then constructing the quotient monoid, as above.|$|R

5|$|The normal resting {{heart rate}} {{is called the}} sinus rhythm, created and {{sustained}} by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in {{the wall of the}} right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> creating an action potential. The cardiac action potential is created by the movement of specific electrolytes {{into and out of the}} pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.|$|E
5|$|Zemus is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of the game. He wishes to destroy the human race so that his people can populate the earth. He uses Golbez to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> controlling him and Kain with his psychic powers to activate the Giant of Babil, a huge machine created {{to carry out the}} genocide.|$|E
5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E

5|$|Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, died on 4February 211 at Eboracum (now York) {{while on}} {{campaign}} in Caledonia, {{north of the}} Roman Britannia. Caracalla and his brother, Publius Septimius Antoninus Geta, jointly inherited the throne upon their father's death. Caracalla and Geta ended the campaign in Caledonia after concluding a peace with the Caledonians that returned the border of Roman Britain to the line demarcated by Hadrian's Wall. During the journey back to Rome with their father's ashes, Caracalla and his brother continuously argued with one another, making relations between them increasingly hostile. Caracalla and Geta considered dividing the empire in half along the Bosphorus to make their co-rule less hostile. Caracalla was to rule {{in the west and}} Geta was to rule in the east. They were persuaded not to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> their mother.|$|E
5|$|The Ipswich Town Player of the Year {{award is}} voted for {{annually}} by Ipswich Town's supporters {{in recognition of}} the best overall performance by an individual player throughout the football season. Towards the end of each season, fans are invited to cast their votes for this award. They <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> submitting a paper slip to the club's Portman Road offices, with the winner being the player who polls the most votes. The recipient is awarded a rosebowl trophy, presented on the pitch before one of the last home games of the season.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of several}} species of starfish can {{reproduce}} asexually before they reach maturity. They <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> autotomising some parts of their bodies or by budding. When such a larva senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development. Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.|$|E

Theo Parrish and several others have said that he <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> turning the needle upside down and putting the record on a cylinder so the needle played the underside of the record, although Stacey Collins says that he <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> using a reel-to-reel. Hardy's residence-club The Muzic Box was also known for its very loud sound volume.|$|R
5|$|Wu {{chose to}} <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>by</b> taking {{a sample of}} {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed {{to reduce the amount}} of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this cryogenic work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E

A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more.|$|E
