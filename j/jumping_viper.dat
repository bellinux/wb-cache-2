50|$|The reptile {{house was}} remodeled in 2012 to include taipans, death adders, Chinese {{alligator}}, and alligator snapping turtle. With the renovations the building houses mostly reptiles. The exhibit houses {{many species of}} cobras, rattle snakes, and lizards. There are two large areas where the zoo's Komodo dragons are held. In a building located near the Reptile House the zoo's temporary home for a large adult salt water crocodile and for Slender-snouted crocodile. On {{the outside of the}} Reptile House is the new Gator Swamp Exhibit, which is a large outdoor heated pool housing several adult American alligators. The reptile house received more renovations in 2017 to improve digital interpretive signage and interactive displays. Other species on display in the true reptile house as of 2017 include: Bismark Ringed Python, Asian Water Monitor, Quince monitor, Cottonmouth, Matamata Turtle, Black Mamba, Storr's Pigmy Monitor, Green Anaconda, <b>Jumping</b> <b>Viper,</b> Western Diamondback Rattlesnake, Gila Monster, Grand Caymon Blue Iguana, Rhinoceros Viper, White Lipped Viper, Red Spitting Cobra, and Black Spitting Cobra.|$|E
40|$|Lys 49 -Phospholipase A 2 (Lys 49 -PLA 2) homologues damage {{membranes}} by a Ca 2 +-independent mechanism {{which does}} not involve catalytic activity. We have solved the structure of myotoxin-I, a Lys 49 -PLA 2 homologue isolated from the venom of Bothrops nummifer (<b>jumping</b> <b>viper)</b> at 2. 4 A resolution using molecular replacement techniques. The final model has been refined to a final R-factor of 18. 4 % (R-free = 23. 2 %), and shows excellent geometry. The myotoxin-I from Bothrops nummifer is dimeric in the crystalline state as has been observed for other Lys 49 -PLA 2 homologues. In addition, a continuous electron density in the active site and substrate binding channel could be successfully modeled as a fatty-acid molecule.

25|$|Atropoides is a genus of venomous pitvipers {{endemic to}} Mexico and Central America. Three species are {{currently}} recognized. The common names suggest {{they are able}} to leap at an attacker, but this is likely exaggerated. Common names for the species include jumping pitvipers and <b>jumping</b> <b>vipers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Later, Ogun {{returned}} {{yet again}} this time travelling from host body to host body {{and he even}} tried {{to take over the}} body of Lady Deathstrike. Wolverine found a way to force him out of all available host bodies and into the body of Viper who Wolverine impaled (non-lethally). Panicking, Ogun <b>jumped</b> from <b>Viper's</b> body but having no form to inhabit, seemed to evaporate away.|$|R
50|$|After {{three years}} in the Northern League, the Cracker-Cats joined the Golden Baseball League on October 24, 2007. This {{occurred}} just after the rival <b>Vipers</b> <b>jumped</b> to the league. On June 30, 2008, The 'Cats set a new attendance record of 8,676 fans against the Vipers.|$|R
40|$|Seventy-eight snakes {{collected}} in the Area de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica were necropsied: Boidae (1 species), boa constrictor, Boa constrictor; Colubridae (21 species), Ecuador sipo, Chironius grandisquamis; road guarder, Conophis lineatus; South American forest racer, Dendrophidion percarinatus; speckled racer, Drymobius margaritiferus; mimic false coral snake, Erythrolamprus mimus; blunthead tree snake, Imantodes cenchoa; western tree snake, Imantodes inornatus; banded cat-eyed snake, Leptodeira annulata; striped lowland snake, Leptodrymus pulcherrimus; Cope’s parrot snake, Leptophis depressirostris; yellow-bellied racer, Liophis epinephelus; neotropical whip snake, Masticophis mentovarius; brown vinesnake, Oxybelis aeneus; Cope’s vine snake, Oxybelis brevirostris; green vine snake, Oxybelis fulgidus; Cope’s false coral snake, Pliocercus euryzonus; cloudy snail-eating snake, Sibon nebulata; chicken snake, Spilotes pullatus; western lyre snake, Trimorphodon biscutatus; orange-bellied littersnake, Urotheca guentheri; false fer-de-lance, Xenodon rabdocephalus; Viperidae (6 species), cantil, Agkistrodon bilineatus; <b>jumping</b> pit <b>viper,</b> Atropoides nummifer; terciopelo, Bothrops asper; cascabel, Crotalus durissus; hognosed pit viper, Porthidium nasutum; and slender hognose viper, Porthidium ophryomegas. Gravid nematodes representing 16 known species, Aplectana incerta, Aplectana itzocanensis, Cosmocercoides variabilis, Cruzia rudolphi, Hastospiculum onchocercum, Hexametra boddaertii, Kalicephalus costatus, Kalicephalus inermis, Kalicephalus sublatus, Macdonaldius oscheri, Ophidascaris arndti, Ophidascaris sicki, Physaloptera retusa, Skrjabinelazia intermedia, Terranova caballeroi, Travassosascaris araujoi, 1 new species, Abbreviata costaricae, and larvae of a species of Porrocaecum were found. Twenty-six new host records and 4 new locality records are reported. The nematode species {{found in this study}} are generalist parasites, i. e., infect more than one host species, and a comprehensive review of the hosts of these species is presented...|$|R
