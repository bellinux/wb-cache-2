500|$|Both Motley and Willis {{made the}} team and became two of the first African-Americans to play {{professional}} football in the modern era. The Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League had signed the only other black players in pro football earlier that year: Kenny Washington and Woody Strode. The four men broke football's color barrier a seven months before Jackie Robinson was promoted from the Class AAA Montreal Royals to join the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Motley felt the Browns would likely be his only {{opportunity to make a}} career of football.

[...] Nethercott remarked [...] "I really thought we had lost. [...] In the space of a few seconds I went from the lowest point <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> absolute, unbridled ecstasy." [...] The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said [...] "It was the worst margin to lose by. I just wish I could stop losing these epic races" [...] while the Cambridge coach Williams described the defeat as a [...] "blow to the heart". Wooge was disappointed: [...] "I pull my hat off to Oxford, that was an amazing race." [...] Rankov later revealed [...] "It’s the hardest I’ve ever had to work in an umpiring situation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Blue was {{an almost}} instant {{critical}} and commercial success, peaking in the top 20 in the Billboard Album Charts in September and also hitting the British Top 3. The lushly produced [...] "Carey" [...] was the single at the time, but musically, other parts of Blue departed further from the sounds of Ladies of the Canyon. Simpler, rhythmic acoustic parts allowed a focus on Mitchell's voice and emotions ("All I Want", [...] "A Case of You"), while others such as [...] "Blue", [...] "River" [...] and [...] "The Last Time I Saw Richard" [...] were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment. Her most confessional album, Mitchell later said of Blue, [...] "I have, on occasion, sacrificed myself and my own emotional makeup,... singing 'I'm selfish and I'm sad', for instance. We all suffer for our loneliness, {{but at the time}} of Blue, our pop stars never admitted these things." [...] In its lyrics, the album was regarded as an inspired culmination of her early work, with depressed assessments of the world around her serving as counterpoint to exuberant expressions of romantic love (for example, in [...] "California"). Mitchell later remarked, [...] "At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>to</b> be strong." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{wanted me}} to {{identify}} some one whom I had certainly never seen before <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and <b>to</b> tell you the truth, they were positively rude to me because I could not. Have you ever heard the name of Meysey Hill?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Baron Domiloff is suffering, perhaps, {{from some}} hallucination," [...] Ughtred said, quietly.
