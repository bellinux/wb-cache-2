5|$|After {{the race}} to the South Pole ended in December 1911 with Roald Amundsen's conquest, Shackleton turned his {{attention}} to the crossing of Antarctica <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> sea, via the pole. To this end he made preparations for what became the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–17. Disaster struck this expedition when its ship, Endurance, became trapped in pack ice and was slowly crushed before the shore parties could be landed. The crew escaped by camping on the sea ice until it disintegrated, then by launching the lifeboats to reach Elephant Island and ultimately the inhabited island of South Georgia, a stormy ocean voyage of 720 nautical miles and Shackleton's most famous exploit. In 1921, he returned to the Antarctic with the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, but died of a heart attack while his ship was moored in South Georgia. At his wife's request he was buried there.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientist}} Tolley {{aimed to}} establish the manpower needed to haul the vessels over the isthmus ridge. Assuming that a trireme soaked with water weighed 38 tons including its trolley, and that a man can exert a force of 300N {{over an extended period}} of time, the pulling teams—depending on the slope and the surface of the cart track—must have numbered between 112 and 142 people, with a combined exertion of force of 33 to 42kN, or around 3.8 tons weight. Bringing the trolley up to speed may have required as many as 180 men. Assuming a speed of 2km per hour over an estimated length of 6kilometres, the transfer <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> sea would have taken three hours to complete.|$|E

25|$|Kipling's writing {{continued}} at a frenetic pace; in 1888, he published six collections of short stories: Soldiers Three, The Story of the Gadsbys, In Black and White, Under the Deodars, The Phantom Rickshaw, and Wee Willie Winkie, containing {{a total of}} 41 stories, some quite long.

25|$|The reverse happens {{during the}} winter, when {{the land is}} colder than the sea, {{establishing}} a pressure gradient from land to sea. This causes the winds to blow over the Indian subcontinent toward the Indian Ocean in a northeasterly direction, causing the northeast monsoon. Because the southwest monsoon flows <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> land, it carries more moisture, and therefore causes more rain, than the northeast monsoon. Only part of the northeast monsoon passing over the Bay of Bengal picks up moisture, causing rain in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu during the winter months.|$|E

25|$|Also {{known as}} the thermal theory or the {{differential}} heating of sea and land theory, the traditional theory portrays the monsoon as a large-scale sea breeze. It states that during the hot subtropical summers, the massive landmass of the Indian Peninsula heats up at a different rate than the surrounding seas, resulting in a pressure gradient from south to north. This causes the flow of moisture-laden winds <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> land. On reaching land, these winds rise because of the geographical relief, cooling adiabatically and leading to orographic rains. This is the southwest monsoon.|$|E
25|$|Better {{utilisation}} {{of space}} at TNB resulted {{in two and}} a half times more berthing space than Brani, even though TNB only has a shoreline of 850m (0.5mi). Provision was also made for recreational facilities. Automation was incorporated into the design of TNB to reduce manpower requirements, such as mechanical ramps for the loading and unloading of vehicles and an automatic storage and retrieval system. It also has a floating dock which can lift 600 tonnes and transfer a ship <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> land to facilitate repairs and maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Eppleton Hall {{was built}} in 1914 by Hepple and Company of South Shields, for the Lambton and Hetton Collieries Ltd, and named after the house near Penshaw owned by the Hetton Coal Company.

For sailing ships this saved time, while for larger steam and motor vessels it saved navigation and pilotage costs. She was also used to tow newly built ships out to the North Sea.|$|E

25|$|On May 6, 1981, at 7:16am EDT, the American Legion, {{en route}} from Staten Island to Manhattan with {{approximately}} 2,400 passengers aboard, was rammed in dense fog by the M/V Hoegh Orchid, a Norwegian freighter inbound <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> a berth in Brooklyn. The ferry boat was damaged from below the main deck up to the bridge deck, and 71 passengers were treated for injuries, three of whom were hospitalized. The absence of a gyrocompass, which could have supplemented existing radar capabilities in helping the ferry master to avoid pending collisions, was noted in the February 2, 1982 report by the National Transportation Safety Board.|$|E
25|$|Ongoing {{research}} and archaeology on Offa's Dyke has been undertaken {{for many years}} by the Extra-Mural Department of the University of Manchester. Interviews with Dr David Hill, broadcast in episode 1 of In Search of the Dark Ages (aired in 1979), show support for Noble's idea. Most recently Hill and Margaret Worthington have undertaken considerable research on the Dyke. Their work, though far from finished, has demonstrated {{that there is little}} evidence for the Dyke stretching <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> sea. Rather, they claim that it is a shorter structure stretching from Rushock Hill north of the Herefordshire Plain to Llanfynydd, near Mold, Flintshire, some 64 miles (103km). According to Hill and Worthington, dykes in the far north and south may have different dates, and though they may be connected with Offa's Dyke, there is as yet no compelling evidence behind this. However, not all experts accept this view.|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamic theory}} {{explains}} the monsoon {{on the basis}} of the annual shifts in the position of global belts of pressure and winds. According to this theory, the monsoon is a result of the shift of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) under the influence of the vertical sun. Though the mean position of the ITCZ is taken as the equator, it shifts north and south with the migration of the vertical sun toward the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn during the summer of the respective hemispheres (Northern and Southern Hemisphere). As such, during the northern summer (May and June), the ITCZ moves north, along with the vertical sun, toward the Tropic of Cancer. The ITCZ, as the zone of lowest pressure in the tropical region, is the target destination for the trade winds of both hemispheres. Consequently, with the ITCZ at the Tropic of Cancer, the southeast trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere have to cross the equator to reach it. However, because of the Coriolis effect (which causes winds in the Northern Hemisphere to turn right, whereas winds in the Southern Hemisphere turn left), these southeast trade winds are deflected east in the Northern Hemisphere, transforming into southwest trades. These pick up moisture while traveling <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> land and cause orographic rain once they hit the highlands of the Indian Peninsula. This results in the southwest monsoon.|$|E

500|$|After {{the conquest}} of the South Pole by Roald Amundsen in December 1911 Shackleton, who had sought this {{achievement}} himself, was forced to rethink his polar ambitions. He believed that there remained [...] "one great main objective of Antarctic journeyings—the crossing of the South Polar continent <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> sea." [...] Basing his strategy on plans developed earlier by the Scottish explorer William Spiers Bruce, Shackleton planned to land with his main party {{as far south as}} possible, on the Weddell Sea coast. His transcontinental team would then march southward to the Pole, before continuing across the polar plateau and descending via the Beardmore Glacier (which Shackleton had discovered in 1909) to the Great Ice Barrier. The final stretch would take them across the Barrier to McMurdo Sound on the Ross Sea coast.|$|E

The young fledge about 85 days later in late September and October. This petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by gulls.

500|$|Adam LaClave and Paul Meany {{were the}} primary songwriters for Earthsuit. As Christians, the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message. For example, the song [...] "Said the Sun" [...] is an allegory about God telling Christians to be {{carriers}} of light. [...] "Whitehorse" [...] was written to present {{a different view of}} the return of Jesus, as LaClave stated in an interview, [...] "Most people, when they hear the term [...] "white horse," [...] think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... wanted to bring a different meaning to it, because ... He comes to rescue us in our everyday life [...]" [...] The men's lyrics also reflect experiences they have had. Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write [...] "Gummy Buffalo"; he found himself in a candy store and squeezed a gummy buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song. Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in [...] "Foreign" [...] may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records. The lyrics read [...] "There's no place in your world for me / I've been <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> shining sea / And I can't retain your policies, excuse me / If I'm just hanging around, I'm foreign." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the public}} acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's {{achievements}} during the Nimrod Expedition in 1907–09, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in {{the words of}} British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—"a bit of a floating gent". [...] By 1912 his future Antarctic plans [...] depended {{on the results of}} Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The [...] news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: [...] "The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration". [...] The next work, he said, would be [...] "a transcontinental journey <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> <b>to</b> sea, crossing the pole". He was aware that others [...] were in the field pursuing this objective. [...] On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a [...] base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. [...] In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.|$|E
