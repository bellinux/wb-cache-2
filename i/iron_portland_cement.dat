40|$|<b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> {{is a fine}} powder, gray {{or white}} in color, that {{consists}} of a mixture of hydraulic cement materials comprising primarily calcium silicates, aluminates and aluminoferrites. More than 30 raw materials {{are known to be}} used in the manufacture of <b>portland</b> <b>cement,</b> and these materials can be divided into four distinct categories: calcareous, siliceous, argillaceous, and ferrifrous. These materials are chemically combined through pyroprocessing and subjected to subsequent mechanical processing operations to form gray and white <b>portland</b> <b>cement.</b> Gray <b>portland</b> <b>cement</b> is used for structural applications and is the more common type of <b>cement</b> produced. White <b>portland</b> <b>cement</b> has lower <b>iron</b> and manganese contents than gray <b>portland</b> <b>cement</b> and is used primarily for decorative purposes. <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> manufacturing plants are part of hydraulic cement manufacturing, which also includes natural, masonry, and pozzolanic cement.

40|$|In 2014 {{about four}} billion tonnes of cement were {{produced}} [CEMBUREAU, 2014]. The use of industrial by-products, {{as a source}} of raw materials in the manufacture of <b>portland</b> and blended <b>cements,</b> is a research theme of significant relevance to the construction industry. Such industrial by-products can be employed as constituents of the final product or components of the raw feed in a cement kiln. Due to their hydraulic and/or pozzolanic activity, industrial by-products are utilized worldwide. Such by-products also increase durability and reduce costs for producing blended cements. The use of such by-products as raw mixture component for the cement production has received comparatively little attention by researchers and engineers. There is currently an increasing interest towards searching for new categories of by-products, which would be able to provide reactive calcium, silicon, aluminum, and/or <b>iron</b> oxides, for <b>portland</b> <b>cement</b> clinker manufacture. In this regard, construction and demolition waste (C&DW) is worthy of consideration because, when obtained from a properly selective demolition process, they could be employed as alternative raw material for portland clinker production. The present study deals with the use of two different kinds of C&DW, namely concrete waste (CW) and masonry waste (MW). In this study, C&DW is proposed to be employed as partial or total substitute for limestone and clay, respectively, in the portland clinker generating raw mixture. Four ternary mixtures containing limestone, as well as CW and MW, were subjected to laboratory tests in order to evaluate the clinker raw mixture produced and the performance of the related <b>portland</b> <b>cement.</b> A binary mixture, composed of limestone and clay, was used as a reference.

Group 1 : Polymer-reinforced zinc oxide eugenol with 50 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> (PMZNPC 50 %) Group 2 : Polymer-reinforced zinc oxide eugenol with 25 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> (PMZNPC 25 %) Group 3 : Polymer-reinforced zinc oxide eugenol with 0 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> (PMZNPC 0 %) Group 4 : Zinc oxide eugenol with 50 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> (ZNPC 50 %) Group 5 : Zinc oxide eugenol with 25 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> (ZNPC 25 %) Group 6 : Zinc oxide eugenol with 0 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> (ZNPC 0 %) These samples were further subdivided based on time interval and were tested at 1 hour, 24 hours and at 7 th day. After each period of time all the specimens were tested by vertical CVR loaded frame with capacity of 5 tones/ 0473 - 10 kan National Physical laboratory, New Delhi and the results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Scheffe test. Results: Polymer-reinforced cement with 50 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement,</b> Zinc oxide with 50 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement,</b> Polymer-reinforced cement with 25 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> and Zinc oxide with 25 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> exhibited higher compressive strength when compared to Zinc oxide with 0 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> and Polymer-reinforced cement with 0 % <b>Portland</b> <b>cement,</b> at different periods of time.

STUDY DESIGN: Electronic literature search of scientific papers from January 1993 to January 2009 was carried out on the MEDLINE and Scopus databases using specific key words. In total, 57 papers were identified that dealt with MTA and <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> in a relevant way. RESULTS: The review of 50 papers conforming to the applied criteria showed that MTA and <b>Portland</b> <b>cements</b> have the same clinical, biological and mechanical properties. In animal experiments and technical characterisations both materials seemed to have very similar properties. The only difference is bismuth oxide in MTA added for better radio opacity. It seems likely that MTA materials are based on industrial <b>Portland</b> <b>cements</b> mixed with bismuth oxide. More studies, especially some long-term studies comparing MTA and <b>Portland</b> <b>cement,</b> are necessary.

40|$|High-strength <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> {{concrete}} has a {{high risk}} of spalling in fire. Geopolymer, an environmentally friendly alternative to <b>Portland</b> <b>cement,</b> is purported to possess superior fire-resistant properties. However, the spalling behaviour of geopolymer concrete in fire is unreported. In this paper, geopolymer and <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> concretes of strengths from 40 to 100 MPa were exposed to rapid temperature rises, simulating fire exposures. Two simulated fire tests, namely rapid surface temperature rise exposure test and standard curve fire test, were conducted. In both types of test, no spalling was found in geopolymer concretes, whereas the companion <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> concrete exhibited spalling. This can be attributed to different pore structures of the two concretes. The sorptivity test found that geopolymer concrete had a significantly higher sorption, therefore more connected pores, than <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> concrete when compared at the same strength level. Hence, it is suggested that the water vapour can escape from the geopolymer matrix quicker than in <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> concrete, resulting in lower internal pore pressure. The paper concludes that, when compared at the same strength level, the geopolymer concrete possesses higher spalling resistance in a fire than <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> concrete due to its increased porosity...|$|R
