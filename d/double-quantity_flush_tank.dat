40|$|Assessing in-sewer {{sediment}} accumulation, {{which causes}} {{problems such as}} loss of hydraulic capacity of sewers and pollution consequences when re-suspended by peak flows, is becoming more in concern and is important in urban drainage design and maintenance. An evaluation based on simulations carried out with InfoWorks CS regarding application of a <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> {{as a tool for}} eroding deposited sediments from a simple sewer network is presented. The hydrodynamic modelling is comprised of implementing InfoWorks CS (Wallingford Software, UK) to assess the eroding capability of the generated flush waves regarding sediment removal and transport, applying the model based on the shear stress estimation in the software (the KUL model developed by Bouteligier et al., 2002). The simulations were initially done for a simple network composed of one straight conduit partitioned into 5 pipes with lengths equal to 10 m. Various combinations of pipe diameter, pipe slope, sediment characteristics, and DWF in the network was considered. Regarding the dry weather sediment build-up modelling, it was important to reach an equilibrium condition before any implementation of <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> would be considered. Initially, the effect of flush waves emitted from one <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> implemented at the most upstream manhole on sediment removal was analysed. Various flushing events were assumed (i. e. 1 flush, 7 flushes with 5 min intervals, and 10 flushes with 10 min intervals). After the flushing events occurred in the network, their effects on sediment transport were assessed. Whenever the upstream <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> was found incapable of generating required criterion for sediment erosion and transport through the network, more <b>flush</b> <b>tanks</b> were proposed to be applied in downstream manholes. Next, having implemented more <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> in potentially effective locations, the results for sediment erosion and transport in the network was analysed and the positive and negative outcomes of such applications were assessed. Afterwards, in the second phase, few more pipes (as branches) were added to the initial network and the same analyses were repeated to evaluate the overall effects of added parts on sediment build-up and transport. The final aim was to evaluate whether by implementing <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> in such a simple network, erosion of the settled particles and removing them out of the system could be reached. Whether a <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> was efficient in removing and transporting sediments from a part of the sewer network was related to various parameters such as sediment characteristics and the flush interval. In fact, it was understood that the type of sediments and their characteristics (mainly the particle size and density) and other parameters with relevant effects on the overall hydraulic characteristics of the sewer network need to be carefully considered in sediment transport modelling in order to reach to suitable modelling results. In an overall perspective, the capability of such <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> to produce effective forces for removal of the settled particles in sewer pipes is well accepted. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In flat regions it {{is often}} not {{feasible}} to provide the necessary slope for a sewer system to be selfcleansing (especially in the most upstream parts of the network). The installation of a <b>flushing</b> <b>tank,</b> that <b>flushes</b> the downstream sewer system once the tank is completely filled with runoff water, can be a solution. The present paper discusses the flushing capacity of a <b>flushing</b> <b>tank,</b> based on experiments carried out at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (K. U. Leuven). The <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> (provided by Keramo-Steinzeug, Belgium) consists of a tank of 1 m height, having a diameter of 1200 mm and a volume of about 450 liter, resulting in a flushing discharge inbetween approximately 28 and 18 l/s that lasts for at least 21 seconds. The results are presented in terms of generated shear stresses and flushing lengths, depending on the pipe slope and diameter. The analysis contains both maximum shear stresses that are obtained during a small time interval and minimum shear stresses that are obtained during a larger time interval. Whereas the first are needed to erode the deposited sediment particles, the latter are needed to transport the sediment particles along the conduit. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Prevention of sewer {{sediment}} accumulation, {{which can}} cause major sewer operational problems, is imperative and has been an immense concern for sewer designers. So far, researchers have mostly attempted to investigate the conditions where sewer systems can operate under self-cleansing condition, this way neglecting the essential attention {{that has to be}} addressed to sediment deposition patterns which occur in sewer reaches under various sewer geometrical and hydraulic conditions. To account for the effects of sediment formation in sewer systems, an appropriate sediment transport modelling with the ability to determine the location and depth of sediment deposit is needed. Besides, in order to prescribe proper solutions for the removal of the deposited layers these models need to appropriately analyse the in-sewer sediment transport patterns. In this regards, a validated numerical model incorporating shock-capturing TVD-McCormack scheme, developed in the University of Catania, Italy, is utilized in this research to help determine the sediment accumulation patterns in rectangular sewer channels, and to evaluate the sediment transport capacities that can be reached by implementing flushing devices and in particular the Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> (manufactured in Germany). Initially, the simulations are carried out to obtain the sediment bed deposition along the rectangular flumes (with geometries close to sewers) in stormwater sewer conditions (specifying a particular dry-weather period). This is followed by simulating the sediment heights after erosion by successive flushes in order to inspect the eroded sediment volume from the deposited bed and the cleaned channel lengths achieved by means of the applied flushes. Moreover, the sediment entrainment and bed-load transport due to flushing is also investigated in sewer channels with uniform bed layers under stormwater and combined sewer environments. It is discovered that in channels with widths up to 500 mm and sufficient bed slope (e. g. 20 , which might be the case in quite a number of stormwater sewer networks) 20 to 50 flushes by Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> can lead to the erosion of deposited sediment layers with a length between 50 and 100 m. Besides, 50 successive flushes demonstrated sufficient capacity to completely erode up to (and possibly more than) a length of 20 m of a 4 cm thick uniform bed layer composed of medium grit particles, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 5 mm, in stormwater sewer channels with widths up to 250 mm with minimum inverted slope of 8  or higher. Under the same conditions, a bed composed of coarser particles, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 8 mm, only the upper 2. 5 cm of the 4 cm thick bed will erode. Under combined sewer conditions, 50 successive flushes will erode over a length of at least 20 m a 5 cm uniform bed layer composed of fine combined sewer sediment, d 50 &# 8804; 0. 08 mm, &# 961;s&# 8804; 1600 kg/m 3, in channels with widths up to 500 mm with inverted slope of 5  or higher. In channels of 100 m length or longer, and considering an inverted slope in the range 2  to 8 , 50 successive flushes seem to be deficient in scouring a 2. 5 cm thick sediment bed. In general terms it is discovered that Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> are able to remove over a distance of 50 m the uniform sediment layers with depths below 4 cm in combined sewers with widths smaller than 250 mm. In a subsequent investigation, the InfoWorks CS software (Innovyze Co., UK) is utilized to evaluate the efficiency of the flushes from Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> in increasing the required sediment scouring forces, particularly the bottom shear stresses, in sewer pipes. Initially, the effect of the flushes in long pipe-series is assessed so that an intuition concerning the propagation of the flushes through long distances together with the corresponding shear stress enhancements can be attained. After that, the increase in bottom shear stresses by the flushes along 20, 50, and 100 -m channels is inspected. It is detected that in combined/stormwater sewers with diameters of 250 to 500 mm and inverted slopes smaller than 8 , and considering a sediment-cleansing threshold of 3. 385 N/m 2, the effective flushing lengths are limited to 20 to 42 m (respectively in wider and narrower channels). In sanitary networks (considering a self-cleansing threshold of 2 N/m 2), the sediment-cleansing efficiency is more discernible and given an inverted slope of maximum 8  the flushing length varies between 100 m in narrow channels down to 54 m in wider channels. In brief, Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> are believed to be suitable devices for generating self-cleansing hydraulic forces up to a distance of 50 m in narrow (i. e. width up to 250 mm) combined/stormwater sewers, even exceeding 100 m in narrow sanitary sewers with moderate inverted slopes of maximum 8 . Subsequently, through a novel attempt the most appropriate position of this flushing device in sewer networks for optimum efficiency in terms of self-cleansing maintenance is investigated with the application to a case study, i. e. sewer network of Erpe-Mere in Flanders, Belgium. In the latter attempt, the sediment deposition and erosion is modelled using InfoWorks CS with the double aim to investigate the effect of the flushes on the scour of deposited sediment beds and to discover the lengths along which a specific self-cleansing criterion can be maintained by the discharged flushes. The possible negative impacts in terms of sewer surcharging or manhole flooding is also inspected. The self-cleansing shear stresses were achieved in 61 sewers or in 69. 3 % of the pipes suitable for the installation of a <b>flushing</b> <b>tank,</b> covering a total cleansing length of 5788 m, representing 74. 4 % of total length of the pipes apt to the implementation of <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks.</b> It is deduced that <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> cannot always guarantee self-cleansing prevalence in all parts of a sewer network, even after increasing the number of <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> particularly in locations prone to sedimentation. Moreover, Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> do not guarantee the removal of sediments from places susceptible for sedimentation. For these locations in order to prevent the accumulation of sediments and once deposited for theirerosion the effectiveness of a Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> has to be assessed separately, using an appropriate sediment transport modelling tool. In this accordance, it is agreed that InfoWorks CS is incapable of properly simulating the sediment bed development (deposition phase) and the change in sediment heights during flushing operations in sewer channels. In the end, through an unexampled attempt the two numerical models, i. e. InfoWorks CS being a commercial software and the Catania model as a specialized research-based numerical model, developed for different type of objectives and circumstances, are compared for identical channels with respect to the simulated hydraulic components and sediment deposition patters. Accordingly, the application of the Giehl <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> in this sewer network is evaluated with reference to the sediment deposition results achieved earlier by the Catania numerical model, so that by learning the potential spots with the highest sediment deposition likelihood the implementation of these <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> can be optimized. This would require sediment transport and hydraulic modelling schemes to be integrated. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Many European {{countries}} tend {{to shift}} from constructing combined sewer systems to separate ones, in order to optimise wastewater treatment efficiency and reduce CSO impact on surface waters. An economic design minimises maintenance requirements by aiming at self-cleansing pipes. However, providing the necessary slopes for self-cleansing sanitary sewer pipes often is unfeasible in flat regions, resulting in {{an increased risk of}} loss of hydraulic capacity or blocking. To reduce these risks, <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> can be installed in the sewer system. Where most other researchers contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the hydraulics of flushing, this paper rather tries to formulate a methodology to design and test flushing devices in sanitary sewer systems using standards and hydrodynamic simulations. Therefore, several aspects that require consideration when incorporating flushing devices into a sanitary sewer system are discussed. For instance, when flushing sanitary sewers the increase in discharge has to be explicitly considered. A Belgian case study is used to investigate the suitability of the developed methodology. Although the pipe slopes in the methodology are derived assuming uniform flow, the simulation results comply with it. Furthermore, pressurisation of the conduits due to multiple flushing waves remains within acceptable limits. status: publishe...|$|R

The numerically achieved results show that the distance between two confluences has a very slight influence on the amount of both water volumes and pollution loads washed off in wet weather from the catchment surfaces. On the contrary, as expected and as already known in literature, the capacity of the tanks has the most relevant role on annual basis in terms of both overflow volumes and discharged pollution loads, while a very smaller influence is related to their position.

40|$|Combined sewer {{networks}} {{are designed to}} collect and transport the aqueous and solid wastes originating from domestic, industrial and catchment surfaces for treatment and disposal. One {{of the problems that}} arise is sedimentation of the particles within the collected water while flowing throughout such networks. In fact, many sewer pipes in combined sewer systems experience considerable fluctuations in flows, ranging from high flow during short-term storm events to longer periods of much lower dry weather flows. In low flow periods sewers experience a characteristic diurnal flow variation. In such periods when the pipe filling level is very low, minimum critical velocities might not be satisfied (Bertrand-Krajewski, 2002). Thus, deposition generally occurs during these periods and also during decelerating flows when storm runoff is receding. Although the flow of surface runoff into the sewer network generates considerable rates of shear stresses, this does not guarantee proper sediment transport in downstream sewer pipes due to lack of enough strength of the flow to constantly produce the required shear stresses. Hence deposition is likely to occur, which can generate problems such as hydraulic overloading due to a reduction in flow capacity and increase of the risk of surcharging during storm events. This could result in both surficial flooding and unwanted early operation of combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Thus, the issue of designing sewer systems to be self-cleansing becomes important. This is however not always promising, particularly in flat regions, where the necessary slopes for sewer pipes to be self-cleansing are not available (especially in the most upstream parts of the network) due to the costs of required deep excavations and pumping systems. In this regard, the use of flushing devices that generate controlled flush waves into the downstream sewer system once the tank is completely filled with runoff water could be a proper solution. The effect of such devices as external sources to help remove the settled particles from sewer pipes has been investigated by many researchers (Bertrand-Krajewski et al, 2005; Bouteligier et al, 2006; Campisano et al, 2004; Dettmar et al, 2002). In the paper an evaluation of the proper implementation of <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> for eroding sediments from a combined sewer network in the village Erpe-Mere in Flanders, Belgium, is presented based on experiments and numerical simulations carried out at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (K. U. Leuven). Implementation of these <b>flushing</b> <b>tanks</b> in different locations of a sewer network is studied with regard to subsequent modifications of hydrodynamic components of the flow throughout the network (shear stress, flow discharge, flow velocity). The research takes account of the hydraulic characteristics of the <b>flushing</b> <b>tank</b> (released flow rate as a function of time and the specific effects on in-sewer sediment transport). The methodology consists of utilizing version 7. 5 of InfoWorks CS (Wallingford Software, UK) in order to calculate the resulting spatially distributed shear stresses {{as a function of the}} pipe diameters and slopes to evaluate eroding capabilities of the generated flush waves in an existing combined sewer network. Emphasis is given on verifying whether the simulation-based shear stresses throughout the sewer network satisfy the required self-cleansing conditions reasonably, i. e. generated shear stresses remain high enough for a small time interval. Of particular concern is the proper location of multiple flushing devices all over the combined sewer network with respect to the potential degree of sediment removal and transport, and the possible drawbacks which could occur during such flushing events such as modification of the cross section of the flow and consequent effects on sewer surcharging or flooding. In fact, there are various influencing parameters engaged in the proper installation of these devices such as sewer network characteristics, contributing catchment characteristics, etc. The evaluation results indicate that attaining a minimum shear stress criterion (e. g. 3 N/m 2 for combined sewer networks based on the Flemish sewer design requirements) could not be satisfied in all parts of the considered sewer network and even some undesired effects emerged. Nevertheless, regarding the accomplished modelling analyses, the capability of such devices to produce effective forces for removal of the settled particles in combined sewer networks is well accounted for. status: publishe...|$|R

The evaluators reviewed the Engineering Evaluation Work Plan for Molten Salt Reactor Experiment Residual Salt Removal, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (DOE 2008). The Work Plan (DOE 2008) involves installing a salt transfer probe and new drain line into the Fuel Drain <b>Tanks</b> and Fuel <b>Flush</b> <b>Tank</b> and connecting them to the new salt transfer line at the drain tank cell shield. The probe is to be inserted through the tank ball valve and the molten salt {{to the bottom of the}} tank.

The Evaluation Team reviewed the work plan, interviewed site personnel, reviewed numerous documents on the Molten Salt Reactor (Sects. 7 and 8), and inspected the probes planned to be used for the transfer. Based on several concerns identified during this review, the team recommends not proceeding with the salt transfer via the proposed alternate salt transfer method. The major concerns identified during this evaluation are: (1) Structural integrity of the tanks - The main concern is with the corrosion that occurred during the fluorination phase of the uranium removal process. This may also apply to the salt transfer line for the Fuel <b>Flush</b> <b>Tank.</b> Corrosion Associated with Fluorination in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Fluoride Volatility Process (Litman 1961) shows that this problem is significant. (2) Continued generation of Fluorine - Although the generation of Fluorine will be at a lower rate than experienced before the uranium removal, it will continue to be generated. This needs to be taken into consideration regardless of what actions are taken with the salt. (3) More than one phase of material - There are likely multiple phases of material in the salt (metal or compound), either suspended through the salt matrix, layered in the bottom of the tank, or both. These phases may contribute to plugging during any planned transfer. There is not enough data to know for sure. (4) Probe heat trace - The alternate transfer method does not include heat tracing of the bottom of the probe. There is a concern that this may cool the salt and other phases of materials present enough to block the flow of salt. (5) Stress-corrosion cracking - Additionally, there is a concern regarding moisture that may have been introduced into the tanks. Due to time constraints, this concern was not validated. However, if moisture was introduced into the tanks and not removed during heating the tanks before HF and F 2 sparging, there would be an additional concern regarding the potential for stress-corrosion cracking of the tank walls...|$|R

Access controls and signs have been placed on all but the three official IMUSTs added most recently. An accelerated effort to identify authorization documents and perform unreviewed safety question (USQ) screening has been completed. According to a set of criteria consistent with the safety screening data quality objective (DQO) process, 6 IMUSTs are ranked high related to the hydrogen generation potential safety Issue, 1 is ranked high related to the ferrocyanide potential safety issue, 6 are ranked high related to the flammability potential safety issue, and 25 are ranked high related to the vapor emissions potential safety issue...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} program into {{the quality of}} water supply from rainwater tanks {{over the last decade}} at the University of Newcastle in Australia has provided insights into water quality processes operating in rainwater tanks. A rainwater treatment train has been identified that includes processes in first <b>flush</b> devices, rainwater <b>tanks</b> and hot water services including the action of biofilms and heat death of bacteria in hot water services. The need for continuing scientific endeavour to improve understanding of this important water source is highlighted...|$|R
5000|$|On January 26, 2007 it was {{reported}} that Eddings accidentally burned about a quarter of his office, next door to his house, along with his Excalibur sports car, and the original manuscripts for most of his novels. He was <b>flushing</b> the fuel <b>tank</b> of the car with water when he lit {{a piece of paper and}} threw it into the puddle to test if it was still flammable. When asked to explain it to the firefighter he said [...] "One word comes to mind. Dumb." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe International Maritime Organization {{requires}} {{ballast water}} <b>tanks</b> to be <b>flushed</b> through with three tank volumes to remove aquatic species. We apply a network model for multiply connected compartments to analyse {{the influence of}} internal geometry and inlet–outlet positions on {{how much of the}} initial water of each compartment is flushed in time. A complementary experimental study was undertaken to quantify the flushing from 2 × 2, 3 × 3 and 5 × 4 tank configurations by an optical method. The agreement between the predictions and measurements is good. The results show that the flushing in a multi-compartment tank is generally more efficient than perfect mixing. The 95 % reduction is met after three exchange volumes in all cases. The outlet needs to be positioned far from the inlet to reduce bypassing through the tank. These results are finally discussed in the context of international regulations for <b>flushing</b> ballast <b>tanks...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of coastal Antarctic stations release untreated sewage into the near-shore marine environment. This study examined bacterial reproduction within the temporary sewage-holding tanks of Rothera Research Station (Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula) and monitored sewage {{pollution in the}} local marine environment. By continuously <b>flushing</b> the sewage-holding <b>tanks</b> with cold seawater we inhibited microbial reproduction and decreased the numbers of bacteria subsequently released into the sea by > 90 %. The widespread use of this simplemethod could significantly reduce the numbers of faecal coliform and other non-native microorganisms introduced into the Antarctic marine environmen...|$|R
2500|$|The Italian {{catalyst}} manufacturer Acta {{has proposed}} using hydrazine {{as an alternative}} to hydrogen in fuel cells. The chief benefit of using hydrazine is that it can produce over 200 mW/cm2 more than a similar hydrogen cell without the need to use expensive platinum catalysts. As the fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen. By storing the hydrazine in a tank full of a double-bonded carbon-oxygen carbonyl, the fuel reacts and forms a safe solid called hydrazone. By then <b>flushing</b> the <b>tank</b> with warm water, the liquid hydrazine hydrate is released. Hydrazine [...] has a higher electromotive force of 1.56 V compared to 1.23 V for hydrogen. Hydrazine breaks down in the cell to form nitrogen and hydrogen which bonds with oxygen, releasing water. Hydrazine was used in fuel cells manufactured by Allis-Chalmers Corp., including some that provided electric power in space satellites in the 1960s.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this small-scale simulant mixing {{study was to identify}} the processes within the Hanford Site River Protection Project-Waste Treatment Plant (RPP-WTP) that may generate precipitates and to identify the types of precipitates formed. This information can be used to identify where mixtures of various solutions will cause precipitation of solids, potentially causing operational problems such as fouling equipment or increasing the amount of High Level Waste glass produced. Having this information will help guide protocols for <b>flushing</b> or draining <b>tanks,</b> mixing internal recycle streams, and mixing waste tank supernates. This report contains the discussion and thermodynamic chemical speciation modeling of the raw data...|$|R
