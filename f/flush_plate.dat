40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{the results of}} an investigation on the analysis of <b>flush</b> end <b>plate</b> steel connections by means of finite element method. <b>Flush</b> end <b>plates</b> are a highly indeterminate type of connection, which have a number of parameters that affect their behavior. Because of this, experimental investigations are complicated and very costly. Today, the finite element method provides an ideal method for analyzing complicated structures. Finite element models of these types of connections under monotonic loading have previously been investigated. A numerical model, which can predict the cyclic behavior of these connections, is of critical importance, as dynamic experiments are more costly. This paper summarizes a study to develop a three-dimensional finite element model that can accurately capture the cyclic behavior of <b>flush</b> end <b>plate</b> connections. Comparisons between FEM results and experimental results obtained from full-scale tests have been carried out, which confirms the accuracy of the finite element model. Consequently, design equations for this connection have been investigated and it is shown that these predictions are not precise in all cases. The effect of end plate thickness and bolt diameter on the overall behavior of this connection is discussed. This research demonstrates that using the appropriate configuration, this connection has the potential to form a plastic hinge in the beam-desirable in seismic behavior...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeismic {{design of}} steel {{structures}} {{is an essential}} part of the design process. Egyptian loading code development process continues in a high rate to catch up with emerging new concepts and standards. Steel design codes (ASD and LRFD) are not developing in the same speed, which prevents the full utilization and application of loading code. The above reason leads to the need for evaluating <b>flush</b> end <b>plate</b> connections from prequalification point of view according to international standards. Due to the lack of sufficient experimental data on flush end-plate connections, an experimental program was conducted to investigate this topic. Six flush end-plate samples were designed according to the Egyptian code for steel construction (ECP 205 ASD) using different beam and column sections, bolt diameters and grades. A cyclic loading pattern defined by international standards was used in the testing process, and the performance was evaluated accordingly. Evaluation of M–Φ curves showed that in some cases <b>flush</b> end <b>plate</b> connections satisfy the strict requirements for prequalification. However, beam sections having limited depth fail to achieve prequalification criteria for the connections. Reduced web may be used to enhance the connection status and is investigated in one of the samples to evaluate its impact on connection performance and the failure mode. The proposed staggered hole configuration showed a promising performance...|$|R

The major problem in such studies is decreasing total drag. In this study experimental results of flow control over a cylindrical configuration by means of an EHD actuators represented. Wire-plate actuators were investigated in this study. This study performed by placing a cylindrical cross section in a wind tunnel and measuring pressures in several positions. Results are given in two ground electrode arrangements, In the first case whole surface of cylinder is covered with a flush mounted electrode as ground electrode and one or two wires electrodes positioned at distance from cylinder, In the second case, only 30 degrees of cylinder used as ground electrode. In all cases the wire electrode was set up in three different degrees from leading edge (i. e., 0, 50, 100) and three radial distance from the surface of the cylinder (i. e., h = 10, 20, 30 mm). The electrical fields were produced by means of a DC constant high voltage power supply. In this study experiments are limited to laminar flow around the cylinder with Reynolds number less than 1000. The experimental results show that, total drag reduction in the partly <b>flush</b> mounted <b>plate</b> electrode has better performance than the case which electrode covers all surface of the cylinder.

40|$|This thesis reports work on {{two aspects}} of framed structures: part I is {{concerned}} with sway frames and part II with the ductility of composite <b>flush</b> end <b>plate</b> connections. Part I has investigated the effect of adopting standardised end plate connections as the method of providing the load path between the structural members of a steelwork sway frame. Practical low to medium rise multi-storey frame geometries have been designed in accordance with limit state principles {{in conjunction with the}} Wind-Moment Method. Each frame was analysed by undertaking a second-order elastic-plastic computer analysis to ascertain their structural performance, with particular emphasis directed towards problems associated with stability and sway deflections. The computer simulation necessitated the formulation of a prediction equation that modeled the initial stiffness characteristics of the standard connections. This model has been verified by comparison with full scale experimental test results, mainly taken from the literature. The investigation confirms that standardised end plate connections provide levels of stiffness and resistance which enable unbraced steel frames to be safely designed by the Wind-Moment method. There are however certain frame geometries where serviceability considerations dictate that stiffening to the frame would be necessary, if the standardised end plate connections were used. Part II has investigated the ductility of five major axis composite <b>flush</b> end <b>plate</b> connections that incorporate nominally identical amounts of reinforcement in conjunction with either 457 or 533 serial size Universal Beams. Other variable parameters include end plate thickness and horizontal spacing of the rebars. The work was undertaken experimentally and the results analysed in the context of connection performance. The results have shown that it will not prove difficult to ensure virtually rigid behaviour of the overall composite connection, despite the use of relatively thin end plates. Moreover, the experiments also show that the rotation capacity of composite connections in which 1...|$|R

In this system, precast “green concrete” (GC) slabs associated with reduced CO 2 emissions during their manufacture are attached compositely to the steel beam via pre-tensioned bolted shear connectors that are readily deconstructed at the life-end of the building.

The use of semi- continuous connection results substantial savings in steel weight of the overall construction. Extended endplate and <b>Flush</b> end <b>plate</b> connections are the widely used type of connections in steel frame construction. To understand the real behavior of semi- continuous connection, full scale laboratory test is the most accurate approach, but it is time consuming and costly to undertake. Therefore other methods were developed to predict the capacity of connections. Thus, in this study three EEP and three FEP connections were analyzed using two standards (BS 5950 Part 1 : 2000 and EC 3 – with UK national application document). A method proposed by Steel Construction Institute (SCI) was taken into account for analyzing.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of 2 -D composite semi-rigid joints {{has been}} researched since the seventies, including experimental work, numerical models, analytical models and practical methods of analysis.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{engineering}} structures for deconstructability {{can reduce the}} energy and cost required for their demolition and the disposal of their construction waste, and it also enhances the sustainability of a building by allowing for easy dismantling and the reuse or recycling of structural components and construction materials {{at the end of}} the service life of the building. In addition, using high performance materials such as High Strength Steel (HSS) can improve the sustainability of a structure by providing for higher design stresses and accordingly reducing the self-weight of the structure. This paper describes the results of four full-scale beam-to-column deconstructable composite joints with HSS S 690 <b>flush</b> end <b>plates.</b> The structural behaviour of the new system in conjunction with application of post-installed friction-grip bolted shear connectors for developing deconstructable composite floors is investigated.

40|$|The {{results of}} a series of five tests on {{composite}} beam-to-column connections are reported. The steelwork part of the connection used an end plate, welded to the beam and bolted to the column flange. For comparison, a sixth test was on a bare steel connection of the same type. Increasing the amount of reinforcement caused a rise not only in moment resistance but also in the rotation capacity of the composite connection. A similar result was obtained by replacing a <b>flush</b> end <b>plate</b> by an extended one. Increase in the depth of the steel section decreased rotation capacity. Plastic analysis of the composite connections, with forces in tension bolts predicted by Annex J of Eurocode 3, provides satisfactory prediction of moment resistance. Good rotation capacity in hogging bending is associated with a plastic neutral axis for the composite beam being in the top flange of the steel section. Large deformation of the lower part of this section by local buckling is the preferable failure mode, because no sudden drop in resistance occurs. A simple spring model can be used to predict satisfactorily a bilinear approximation of the moment-rotation curve, provided account is taken of the deformation of the shear connection...|$|R
40|$|To help {{practitioners}} {{to find the}} most economical design of braced frames, this paper proposes a classification of joints in `simple' (e. g. web cleated connections), 'moderate' (e. g. <b>flush</b> end <b>plated</b> connections) and 'complex' (e. g. stiffened extended end plate connections) with respect to the fabricational complexity (low, medium and high costs). Different types of joints are classified into the three aforementioned classes in a table format. This enables a practitioner to simply read the class of a given joint from the table, without calculation. For each class, recommendations are given what strength and what stiffness should be used during the conceptual design stage of the frame. Furthermore, the paper shows that, during the final design of the braced frame, the recommended stiffness values can be used safely without further checks. In other words, {{there is no need to}} determine the 'actual' stiffness of the joint during final design, which lightens the design task dramatically. What remains is a check of the strength and, in case of plastic frame analysis, the rotation capacity. A comparison of frame alternatives is included, which demonstrates that application of moderate joints compared to simple joints may be economical due to savings in beam cost...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, steel joints are {{calculated}} by the calculation rules {{described in the}} Eurocode 3 : NEN-EN 1993 - 1 - 8. Effective lengths are important parameters to determine the different resistances of the components in the steel joint.

Specialised software is developed to determine the stresses and corresponding strains in the plate elements of the joints by the Finite Element Method (FEM). This thesis reports on a comparative study of the traditional calculation method and a method which is using partial FEA for determining the resistance of joints. The approach, assumptions and principles used for these calculations are explained in this report. It will be investigated whether the same components of a joint are decisive for each method {{and if there are}} differences in joint resistances.

40|$|Abstract — The {{study of}} {{connections}} in any structure is of primary importance because, {{it is always}} desirable the structural member to fail first instead of the connection. If the structural connection fails before {{the failure of the}} member it is always a brittle failure and catastrophic. Present study is focused out to determine the structural performances of various beam–columns with bolted moment connections on cold formed light gauge steel sections by analytical, FEM analysis and experimental tests. The analysis included four types of beam column connections with gusset plate. The number of bolts required for basic connection are determined from BS 5950 - 5 1998. Based on proposed four types of connection configuration, they are modeled in pro-e. Further, this modeled connection is analyzed in hypermesh, then experimental test have been carried out on the same connections. The relations between moment-rotation, moment resistance, model factor and various modes of failure were observed. From the experimental and FEM analysis it has been observed that there is always torsional buckling failure of beam section and distortion of gusset plate and from result model factor of proposed model is 0. 731 and moment resistance of connection archives 32 % to that of moment resistance of cold form steel section.

The effects of jet speed on the streamwise development of the vortices were investigated. The flow had an upwash region in between the vortices that were embedded in the turbulent boundary layer. The upwash was produced by the vortices and the interaction between diametrically opposed secondary, near-wall flows.

The use of partial strength or semi-rigid connections for composite has been adviced by codes and studies doe to few researches doing on this field.

The design concept usually based on connections, where simple method {{associated}} with pinned-jointed, semi-continuous method associated with semi-rigid joints or partial strength, and continuous construction associated with rigid-joint. Partial strength joints are considered using moment resistance of connections in plastic hinge analysis of the frame. Semi-continuous design method is used instead of simple design method. This makes it achieve many benefits, for example, shallow and lighter beams, and the connections are geometrically simple, thereby producing more robust frames. The method is expected to save frame weight. This study introduces the design of multi-storey steel frame {{of a series of}} two-storey, four-storey, six-storey and eight-storey with three-bays for each case. A comparison is made between simple design and semi-continuous design using (BS 5950 : 2000 Part 1) and (BS EN 1993 - 1 - 1 : 2005). This is intended to show the economic benefits of multi-storey braced steel frame design, based on weight saving in the choice of beams and columns. It is assumed that they have slight influence on the total weight of frame. Their weight is identical for all frames. I and H Rolled cross-sections are adopted for beam and column respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} five main areas as follows: 1. Braced steel frames {{designed}} for semi-continuous construction were studied to determine savings in both cost and weight. Various frame parameters {{such as the}} number of bays, use of grade S 355 steel, beam spans, types of connection, and selection of beam size were investigated. The investigation confirmed that semicontinuous construction contributes to worthwhile percentage savings on both cost and weight. 2. Analysis and design of steel unbraced frames bending on both axes were performed with emphasis on stability and deflection checks. Rules are proposed to improve the stability and stiffness. For connections to the minor axis, a proposed joint detail is presented. The performance of the frames was checked for collapse load level at ULS; deflection limits at SLS were also checked; in both cases using first and second order analysis. The investigation demonstrated that the frames should be restricted to less than four storeys. 3. A study on minor axis joints was carried out for <b>flush</b> end <b>plate</b> connections connected to the column web. Previous experimental results of moment and stiffness were compared with predicted values. Moment values were predicted using Gomes' formulae. The stiffness due to the column web was predicted using finite element analysis. The results showed good agreement between experimental and predicted values. The study on the connections was extended to their suitability in steel frames bending about the minor axis; the investigation confirmed that the connections were not suitable for unbraced wind-moment frames. An equation for prediction of initial stiffness was nevertheless established for the connection. 4. Steel frames with composite beams designed for minimum wind combined with maximum gravity load were studied for their performance, taking into account cracking along the beams. The investigation showed that the frames meet the requirements of deflection and sustain a load level of 1. 0 for ULS. For frames studied for maximum wind combined with minimum gravity load, the moment capacity of the joints governed the design which resulted in a deeper beam section. 5. Seven tests were carried out for a new type of shear connector system installed by compressed air. The aim of the tests was to study the shear capacity and ductility of the studs.

These microorganisms {{come from}} dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) -thus potentially including opportunistic pathogens, or from patients -thus potentially including human pathogens. Aim: To investigate {{the association between}} levels and quality of contamination of air samples and DUWLs during professional toothcleaning, thus providing information regarding the nature of air contamination produced by ultrasonic scaler use. Material and methods: Before treating the first patient of the day, 100 mL of water was aseptically collected from the DUWL designated for the ultrasonic scaler, water was not disinfected or <b>flushed.</b> Aliquots were <b>plated</b> on Plate Count Agar to determine total viable flora (TVF) and Charcoal-Yeast Extract Agar supplemented with a Growth Supplement to determine Legionella. Two sets of settle plates {{were placed on the}} tray in front of the patient, one before and another during patient treatment to determine TVF and Legionella. The association between TVF and Legionella levels and prevalence in DUWLs and in air samples was assessed using correlation coefficients. Results. 82 testing occasions were performed. The mean TVF levels in DUWLs and air were 21. 2 (95 % confidence interval, 95 CI, 13. 8 - 32. 6) CFU/mL and 12. 4 (95 CI, 9. 7 - 15. 8) CFU/plate/h, respectively. The mean Legionella detection rates were 1. 2 % (DUWLs) and 0 % (air). Correlations between air and water TVF and Legionella were not significant. Conclusion: Air contamination during ultrasonic scaler use was frequent and high, but it was not associated with DUWL contamination, suggesting that airborne microorganisms could come from patients and be potentially pathogens for humans. © 2013 Medicinski fakultet Niš...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a detailed {{experimental study of}} the laminar and turbulent oscillatory boundary layer developed under the action of waves {{for the purpose of}} evaluation of bottom energy dissipation. The measurements were conducted on hydraulically smooth and immobile rough beds and under both monochromatic conditions and a spectrum of waves in a 50 m long wave flume. Bottom friction was measured in two different ways: (i) by a <b>flush</b> mounted shear <b>plate,</b> developed as part of the project and set {{at the bottom of the}} flume, (ii) by using the momentum integral equation and the measured velocity profile within the boundary layer. The velocity profile within the boundary layer was measured using a Laser Doppler Anemometer. The roughness geometry was chosen to simulate both rough flat and rippled beds. With respect to the dissipation under a spectrum of waves, the results show that a spectrum of waves and a monochromatic wave whose maximum bottom velocity is 1. 88 times the root mean square of the bed velocity of the spectrum, dissipate the same amount of energy. As a consequence, measurements of energy dissipation for monochromatic waves can be related to spectral conditions. The results for monochromatic waves were found to be in good agreement with the existing formulae for the bottom friction factor, which have mainly been based on experimental results in water tunnels or over oscillating trays. Therefore, it was concluded that the secondary effects due to the nonuniformity of the bed velocity in the horizontal direction, which can be observed under real waves, does not have substantial influence on the bed friction factor. In addition, it was concluded that the nonlinearity of waves in finite depth water does not significantly affect the results. No Full Tex...|$|R

The main objective of these tests {{was to investigate the}} effects of three practical fire-protection schemes as alternatives to full fire protection of the entire joint assembly. The three alternative methods of fire protection were: (1) protecting a segment, instead of the entire length, of the beams; (2) unprotected bolts and (3) protecting the columns only. The main results of these tests are: (1) if all the steel work (excluding the bolts) in the joint assembly was protected, whether or not protecting the bolts had very little effect on temperatures in the protected steelwork other than the bolts. The bolt temperatures were higher if they were not protected than if they were protected, but the unprotected bolt temperatures in a joint with fire protection to other steelwork were much lower than bolt temperatures in a totally unprotected joint; (2) as far as joint temperatures are concerned, protecting a segment of 400 mm of the beam was sufficient to achieve full protection and (3) if only the column was protected, only the joint components that were in the immediate vicinity of the column (such as welds) developed noticeably lower temperatures than if the joint assembly was unprotected, but due to heat conduction from the unprotected steel beams, these temperature values were much higher than if the joint assembly was protected.
