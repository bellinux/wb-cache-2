Birds found in Phou Hin Poun NBCA include the grey peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron bicalcaratum), the hill myna (<b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa),</b> red-collared woodpecker (Picus rabieri), the sooty babbler (Stachyris herberti), and the wreathed hornbill (Rhyticeros undulatus).|$|R
2500|$|Research upon avian vocal motor neurons {{finds that}} they {{perceive}} their song {{as a series}} of articulatory gestures as in humans. Birds that can imitate humans, such as the Indian hill myna (<b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa),</b> imitate human speech by mimicking the various speech formants, created by changing the shape of the human vocal tract, with different vibration frequencies of its internal tympaniform membrane. [...] Indian hill mynahs also imitate such phonetic characteristics as voicing, fundamental frequencies, formant transitions, nasalization, and timing, through their vocal movements are made in a different way from those of the human vocal apparatus.|$|R
40|$|Avian haemosporidian, Haemoproteus sp., {{which was}} a common avian blood parasite, was {{examined}} in 30 Hill Mynahs <b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa</b> intermedia. Asexual reproduction found in avian host consisted of schizogony in the tissues and gametocytes which were the only stage found in the red blood cells of birds. The mature gametocyte encircled the erythrocyte nucleus to form a halter-shaped appearance. Results showed that {{there were only three}} infected birds. Both macrogametocytes and microgametocytes were recognized. However, further studies on taxonomy of both parasite and vector, together with the relationships among host, vector and parasite are necessary. The finding from this study is hoped to urge a serious investigation of haemosporidian parasites in tropical birds...|$|R
40|$|Study of the {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} 749 living Hill Mynahs (<b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa)</b> from throughout Thailand revealed a cline between distinct {{populations of the}} two subspecies recognized in this area (G. r. intermedia, G. r. religiosa). A previous study classified morphological variants into five groups, including one that matched each recognized subspecies and three that showed intermediate characteristics. Mean values of most morphological measurements increased toward the south between 5 o and 20 oN. Studies of mating behavior in nature and in captivity showed that interbreeding occurred among all morphological groups. The morphological variation of Hill Mynahs in Thailand indicated that two distinct subspecies evolved {{at a time when}} they were separated from each other by geographical barriers.

5000|$|The common {{hill myna}} (<b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa),</b> {{sometimes}} spelled [...] "mynah" [...] and formerly simply known as hill myna, is the myna most commonly seen in aviculture, {{where it is}} often simply referred to by the latter two names. It {{is a member of}} the starling family (Sturnidae), resident in hill regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia. The Sri Lanka hill myna, a former subspecies of G. religiosa, is now generally accepted as a separate species G. ptilogenys. The Enggano hill myna (G. enganensis) and Nias hill myna (G. robusta) are also widely accepted as specifically distinct, and many authors favor treating the Southern hill myna (G. indica) from the Nilgiris and elsewhere in the Western Ghats of India as a separate species.|$|R
40|$|To study vocal mimicry in captive Hill Mynah <b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa,</b> four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine 1) factors of development influenced the ability of learning 2) prior residence determined the ability of producing vocal mimicry 3) vocalization manipulated the social dominance. It showed that birds were able to well imitate if were hand-reared individually when they were less than five weeks old. No matter how good birds could do vocal mimicry after learning, if they were put into the resident aviaries, they almost stopped producing vocal mimicry. Dominance, through the prior residence played the important roles in this matter. Prior residence effect overcame other factors in the case that even resident birds produced fewer times of vocal mimicry, they still dominated the newcomers {{which used to be}} fluently vocal mimicry producers. Nevertheless, in initial grouping, with unfamiliar birds, ones which originally produced more times in vocal mimicry, had more advantage to get dominant position in captivity. These suggested that although prior residence overrode vocal mimicry ability, vocalization, anyhow, which led birds to gain dominance...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{classified}} morphological {{variants of}} Hill Mynahs in Thailand into five groups, including two well-recognized subspecies <b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa</b> intermedia, the northern group and G. r. religiosa, the southern group and three new groups that represented intermediate characteristics. The degree of morphological variation among Hill Mynah population was studied {{in order to}} detect population dynamics of this species. Hill Mynahs were enumerated at 233 feeding trees of 93 study sites in 31 provinces throughout Thailand. Three new groups were found, intermingled with the northern and the southern groups, between 6 ° and 16 ° N which denoted the contact zone of the two original subspecies found in Thailand. The three new groups which were the interbred outcomes comprised 40 % of the studied population and outnumbered their northern and southern counterparts which were 36 and 24 %, respectively. Prior to 2002, the morphological variation of this species has never been investigated. If the interbreeding uninterruptedly continues, {{the population of the}} northern and the southern groups would tend to be eventually replaced. The trend of the population dynamics of this species in Thailand will change...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa</b> {{is one of}} the {{channels}} to understand vocal learning in birds. Experiments were designed in order to study the critical period and social interaction affecting this learning behaviour. The variations of learning ability depended upon subspecies, sexes and sex hormone levels were also investigated. The studies were divided into five experiments. The results showed that the hand-reared nestlings in individual cages, after learning Thai words and phrases before six months of age for a year, were the most effective group to show vocal imitation (18 times/h). Meanwhile, wild birds older than six months, though reared and trained in individual cages, did not produce vocal imitation. The variations of vocal imitation between subspecies and sexes were not found. However, male birds with high vocal imitation efficiency (15 times/h) had higher testosterone levels than those with lower vocal imitation efficiency. Estradiol levels were high in female birds with high vocal imitation. The critical period of vocal imitation was {{the first six months of}} age and social contact with a trainer was required, without interacting with other hill mynahs. It seems likely that endocrine states, social interactions and vocal imitation output are correlated. ]]...|$|R
40|$|Two {{subspecies}} of Hill Mynah (<b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa)</b> {{occur in}} Thailand, the northern race (G. r. intermedia) {{and the southern}} race (G. r. religiosa). The southern race {{is larger than the}} northern race and has two separate patches of yellow wattle on the ear-coverts, whereas the northern race has a yellow connection between the anterior and posterior wattles. The variation in morphology was investigated by measuring eleven external morphological characteristics of 749 live birds from different habitats throughout Thailand. Birds from different latitudinal zones of Thailand were studied in five equal-interval zones from 5 ° 30 ` to 20 ° 30 ` N. A descriptive analysis of morphological variables for birds from each latitudinal zone indicated that the average head area, bill size, body size, wing length and tarsus length increased toward the south. One-way analysis of variance among the zones for all morphological parameters showed significant F-ratios. All morphological measurements were negatively correlated with latitude except for tail length which had a positive coefficient. Comparison of morphological variation with climatic variation especially with relative humidity suggests that climatic adaptation may account for subspecific variation in the morphology of this species...|$|R
40|$|Hill Mynah <b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa</b> is a {{monomorphic}} bird {{of which}} the discrimination of sex is a crucial problem in captive breeding programs. In the past ten years, the wild population of the two subspecies found in Thailand, G. r. intermedia and G. r. religiosa, have drastically decreased due to the demand of the pet market to trade them as talking birds. Sexing Hill Mynah {{will be an important}} part in breeding them in captivity. Various methods had been experimented to sex them. Best of all was to obtain sex chromosomes from feather pulp. Male is the homogametic sex (ZZ) whereas female is the heterogametic sex (ZW). To identify Z and W chromosomes in Hill Mynah is undoubtedly an easy task since Z chromosome is nearly twice the size of W chromosome. It is subtelocentric and medium in size of macrochromosomes or the same size as pairs 4, 5, 6 while W chromosome is submetacentric and smaller, the same size as pairs 7, 8, 9. The diploid chromosome number of Hill Mynah was found to be 80. The karyotype consisted of ten pairs of macrochromosomes, nine pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosome and thirty pairs of microchromosomes. Captive breeding of Hill Mynahs in Thailand is no longer perplexed when sex identification is ultimately possible...|$|R
40|$|The study aims at {{quantifying}} trade {{scale of}} some economically wild birds and describing captured trends {{which have been}} practised by wild bird catchers. The {{study was conducted in}} Tanah Grogot, Paser District, East Kalimantan Province, from September to December 2008, by surveying wild bird market and interviewing catchers and sellers. We measured two main attributes of market dynamics; first, each species availability in the market as the percentage of market days sampled where the species appeared; second, daily abundance of a species as the monthly average number of each bird per day for all days sampled. Seven wild bird species that have been traded commodities for years were White-rumped Shama Copsychus malabaricus (25. 41 %; 602. 25 + 70. 79 individuals per month), Yellow-vented Bulbul Pycnonotus goiavier (11. 47 %; 111. 25 + 12. 50 individuals per month), Crested Myna Acridotheres cristatellus (12. 30 %; 73. 25 + 10. 44 individuals per month), Spotted Dove Streptopelia chinensis (5. 73 %; 22. 00 + 12. 83 individuals per month), Hill Myna <b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa</b> (12. 30 %; 12. 00 + 0. 82 individuals per month), Greater Green Leafbird Chloropsis sonneratii (7. 38 %; 11. 75 + 2. 50 individuals per month) and Magpie Robin Copsychus saularis (6. 56 %; 8. 75 + 1. 71 individualsper month).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a report}} of neuroethological investigations of the vocal and cognitive behavior of the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). Budgerigars were trained, via an interactive modeling technique, to reproduce English words and phrases. Budgerigars' abilities to use their acquired English vocalizations were then assessed. Budgerigars produced English vocalizations in three main ways: (1) enmeshed in warble song; (2) in response to presented objects; and (3) alone, neither enmeshed in warble song nor in response to presented objects. Budgerigars also formed functional categories of their English vocalizations and used them in a context-dependent manner. Budgerigars' English vocalizations and contact calls were subjected to acoustic analyses and found to contain nonlinear amplitude modulation. A comparison with the sounds produced by humans and other speech-producing birds (Grey parrots, Psittacus erithacus, and mynahs, <b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa)</b> revealed that budgerigars produce speech in a fundamentally different manner. Ibotenic acid lesions {{were placed in the}} vocal control nucleus, NLc, and the effects on budgerigars' contact calls and English vocalizations assessed. NLc lesions affected production of, but not memory for, budgerigar vocalizations. Specifically, the amplitude of the carrier signal of amplitude- modulated vocalizations was disrupted. No abnormalities were detected in the frequencies that budgerigars produced post-lesion. The implications of these findings regarding the presence of amplitude modulation and the effects of NLc lesions with respect to past and future studies of the acoustic, physical and neural mechanisms underlying budgerigar vocal production are discussed, and a working model for the function of the budgerigar syrinx presented...|$|R
40|$|Nesting {{habitats}} of Hill Mynah <b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa</b> {{were studied}} {{in order to}} gain a perspective of habitat features which were favoured by natural selection. A total of 76 nest trees and 310 neighbour trees of northern Hill Mynah (G. r. intermedia) and 25 nest trees and 136 neighbour trees of southern Hill Mynah (G. r. religiosa) were studied in eight provinces of Thailand between 6 and 20 N from 1991 to 1999. Nest characteristics including nest height, nest size, nest depth, cavity entrance, angle of nest cavity and cavity entrance were recorded. The characters of nest trees, including condition types, the height, canopy and trunk were studied. Habitat characteristics were measured within a square plot of 20 x 20 m around nest trees. Number and the characters of neighbour trees around each nest tree, distance from nest trees to the nearest neighbour trees were recorded. The results showed that Hill Mynah nest trees were taller, bigger and had thicker canopies than their neighbour trees. Their nests were higher and farther from the tree boles in dense canopies. Nest trees were live and solitary in the areas with foliage cover. Habitats of successful nests were different from unsuccessful ones in the term of higher first branches, bigger canopies, more surrounding trees and farther from neighbour trees. Although the natural selection successfully shapes the form of Hill Mynah nesting habitats to avoid natural predators and unfavourable climates, heavy human interference is the major cause of nesting failure in this species...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} bird similarity, {{diversity}} and density {{were carried out}} at Tung Salang Luang National Park during March 2004 - February 2005, in 3 sites of seasonal evergreen forest, one site in a restricted area (SE 1) and two sites in tourist areas (SE 2 and SE 3). Three sites were located in the same forest structure. The point count and line transect methods were used for data collection. The results revealed the following information: 133 species, 34 families and 11 orders of birds in SE 1 (102 species), SE 2 (100 species) and SE 3 (89 species) were observed. Seven species of birds in all sites i. e. Criniger pallidus, Hypsipetes propinquus, Pycnonotus melanicterus, Irena puella, Garrulax leucolophus, Yuhina zantholeuca and <b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa</b> were the co-dominant species in this forest {{that will be used}} indicator for future investigation. Base on similarity, tourist activities may be disturbed some bird groups in tourist area such as carnivorous and omnivorous (SE 2 and SE 3) and nectarivorous (SE 3); base on densities, carnivorous (SE 3), nectarivorous (SE 2 and SE 3) and garnivorous (SE 3) were decreased 46 - 78 % in tourist sites compared with restricted site (SE 1). Moreover, bird diversity index in restricted area was higher value than tourist area. This phenomenon indicated that some bird groups in tourist area at the seasonal evergreen forest had negative effect correlation with human activities and similarity, diversity and density indices were a proper indicator for further impact investigation for conservation and management strategies of avifauna. Finally, this result was the first report about avifauna dynamic of Tung Salang Luang National Park...|$|R

40|$|Hill Mynas Gracula have a wide {{distribution}} range {{covering all}} of Southeast Asia. They became a popular cage bird {{due to their}} ability to mimic human speech. Massive demand had a tragic impact on the wild populations of Hill Mynas throughout their range. Since the first description of the species there have been significant discrepancies in the classification. Continuous pressure on the wild populations caused an urgent need of conservation attention in many places, which was hindered by taxonomical uncertainties. Decades of specialists disagreements caused crossbreeding of mynas from different areas and thus disappearance of their typical characteristics. The only possible way for taxonomic revision has become a field research. This research was focused on the taxonomic revision of the Common Hill Myna <b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa</b> in Sumatra and its nearby islands, where the highest diversity of the genus taxa occurs. The aim was to evaluate the current situation of the wild populations and to collect the largest possible set of morphometric information. The analyses uncovered that studied taxa are all clearly distinguishable. Taxon miotera from the island of Simeulue, oftenly overlooked in literature, showed the largest differences as well as taxon robusta from Nias. If taxon robusta is recognised a full species, miotera should be upgraded to a species level as well. Mynas from the additional two locations show differences too and are both clearly distinguishable from the others. The differences dont show such significance to treat these taxa as species without further combination of morphometry and genetics. A surviving population of the Nias Hill Myna Gracula (r.) robusta, last recorded by scientists in 1939 was found during this research as well as acoustic evidence of taxon miotera from Simeulue which was also identified as possibly extinct...|$|R
40|$|The Indian Hill Mynah (<b>Gracula</b> <b>religiosa)</b> was {{studied in}} the field in Assam in {{north-east}} India. The aims of the study were two-fold: (i) to understand better this bird's exceptional ability in captivity to imitate human speech; and (ii) to provide background understanding to studies of the importance of early auditory experience and of vocal imitation in the development of normal song patterns in birds. First is given {{a brief description of the}} distribution, general behaviour, and breeding biology of this arboreal, sexually isomorphic, semi-gregarious species. The remainder of the monograph deals with vocalizations; these were either tape-recorded in the field, or transcribed directly using a written notation developed for the purpose. Any wild adult Mynah of either sex possesses four categories of vocalizations: (i) 'Chip-call'; a loud piercing squeak made in contexts which include alarm. (ii) 'Um-sound'; a soft grunt, acting in close range social contexts, and (like chip-calls) common to all individuals. (iii) 'Whisper-whistles': several soft sounds of types unique to the individual. (iv) 'Calls': several loud noises, of extremely varied patterns. The bulk of the monograph deals with 'calls', as defined thus. Calls were compared quantitatively with one another by a method developed which measured the degree of overlap of one sonogram with a tracing of a second sonogram. Both by this method and by ear, calls were divided into discrete types, without intermediates. Birds of either sex have a repertoire of usually between five and twelve such call types, some of which are produced much more commonly than others. Repertoires tend to be larger in birds which call more frequently, or which have mates with large repertoires. The repertoire of a given bird stays largely constant from year to year in size. composition, and proportions. No bird shares any of its call types with its mate, but it shares several of them with near neighbours of the same sex. There is a progressive change of dialect with distance, such that birds nesting more than about 14 km apart have no call types in common. No general characteristics of call structure could be found which were indicative of the sex of the caller, but in a known locality the call type made immediately reveals the sex of the bird producing it. Call types are learnt by selective imitation of neighbouring individuals during a young bird's first several months. A call type common in the repertoire of one bird tends also to be common in the repertoire of a neighbour, except at the edge of the limited range of that call type. Which particular call type a calling bird selects from among those in its repertoire is discussed. Few call types could be related to non-auditory contexts. A bird is likely to repeat the call type last made, and also tends to standardize the order in which it produces its different call types; this standard order tends to be the same as that of its neighbours. A birdtends also to reply at once and to standardize the call type it makes in immediate reply to a particular call type of its mate; again, neighbouring pairs of birds tend to use the same standardized call and reply types. The length of the interval between a particular call and its reply tends to be constant in a given pair of birds, and approximately the same in neighbouring pairs. These are all further aspects of extensive but selective vocal imitation by Mynahs of adult birds; other species are not imitated. Information on calling when in contact with other pairs came mainly from playback experiments, when single calls were presented to nesting pairs of Mynahs. Response strength was measured by the incidence of flight, number of subsequent vocalizations, latency of response, and proportion of playbacks ignored. When presented with playbacks of calls of familiar types (of neighbours) and of unknown types (of strangers), birds responded more strongly to the familiar than to the unknown call types. They did, however, respond somewhat to the unknown call types, which were of patterns never previously heard by them, presumably recognizing these as being Mynah calls by their sound quality. Mynahs responded as strongly to playbacks of neighbours' calls which were not in their own repertoire as to playbacks of neighbours' calls which were. A bird tends to match at once the call last heard (either from a tape recorder or from a wild neighbour), itself producing the same call type at once, if it possesses it in its own repertoire. That call type, and others associated with it, also occurs more frequently thereafter. Thus calls heard affect calls made, and vice-versa since other individuals nearby behave similarly. A change of nearest neighbours in successive years was shown to affect one pair's repertoire proportions. Further playback experiments showed that Mynahs were able to distinguish between a single call made by their neighbours and a single call of the same call type made by their mates. Small but consistent differences were found in the sonograms of such calls of the same type made by different birds. The structure of a single call type may change gradually with distance. The development of vocalizations with age is briefly described. In the final discussion sections, the ways in which, and the extent to which, Mynahs are able to determine the species, home locality, sex and individual identity of other Mynahs are outlined. There follow consideration, and comparison with other species: (i) of various aspects of repertoires; (ii) of the distribution of call types among different individuals; (iii) of the dynamic aspects of calling, and a scheme is proposed which accounts for the selection for utterance of a particular call type from the repertoire; and (iv) of the organization and coordination of calling. The lack of imitation of other species in the wild is discussed, and contrasted with the several ways in which wild Mynahs imitate one another in various aspects of their calling...|$|R
