5|$|The first {{prototype}} pylon {{was developed}} by Martin Jehart of Bellutti Protection Systems, an Austrian engineering firm specializing in the manufacturing of technical materials and tarpaulin. They initially used a latex balloon for crash tests and aerodynamic studies and after many tests and research settled {{on the use of}} a combination of different materials, the crucial component being spinnaker ripstop nylon, an extremely lightweight and <b>flexible</b> <b>material</b> used for making sails for boats. This would prove to be a breakthrough {{in the development of the}} Air Gates producing a pylon that would rip instantaneously when hit by a plane. Over 70 tests of the pylon were carried out on the ground using a car with a wing strapped on the roof before they were ready to undergo tests with a real plane. Eight different cars were used in these tests as well as a trailer and truck. Hungarian pilot, PÃ©ter Besenyei worked closely with the team and attempted the first deliberate pylon hit in early 2003 with positive results. The first Air Gates, which were cylindrical, were finally ready to be used at the very first Red Bull Air Races held in Austria and Hungary later that year.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{manufacture}} of aerogel 'blankets' began {{around the year}} 2000, combining silica aerogel and fibrous reinforcement that turns the brittle aerogel into a durable, <b>flexible</b> <b>material.</b> The mechanical and thermal properties of the product may be varied based upon the choice of reinforcing fibers, the aerogel matrix and opacification additives included in the composite.|$|E

25|$|Ballet {{shoes are}} soft, pliable shoes made of canvas or leather, with either {{continuous}} or two-part sole (also called split-sole), used for ballet dancing. The sole is typically made of leather, with thicker material under {{the ball and}} heel of the foot, and thinner and thus more <b>flexible</b> <b>material</b> under the arch so that the foot can be easily pointed. They are typically secured by elastics {{across the top of}} the foot.|$|E
25|$|The rectangular, curved shield {{is held by}} {{the left}} arm and raised above the men's head. It was most {{probably}} made of leather or other <b>flexible</b> <b>material,</b> given that it is bent on the long sides. Furthermore, internally it is framed with wooden twigs, whereas the external part is characterized by an embossed rim all along the perimeter. The shield appears to be fixed, on the internal side, to an armband decorated with chevron patterns, worn at the elbow of the left arm.|$|E
500|$|Leading {{into the}} character's {{next phase of}} publication, the Anarky limited series, [...] "Metamorphosis", was {{published}} in 1997. Coinciding with Alan Grant's transition from the philosophy of anarchism to Neo-Tech, Grant chose to re-characterize Anarky accordingly. Norm Breyfogle also {{took the opportunity to}} redesign Anarky's costume, excising the head extender with the explanation that the character had grown up and filled out his costume. The golden mask was also redesigned as a reflective but <b>flexible</b> <b>material</b> that wrapped around Anarky's head, allowing for the display of facial movement and emotion which had previously been impossible due to the inflexible metal that the first mask was made of.|$|E

500|$|Anarky's second costume {{was used}} during the 1999 ongoing Anarky series. It {{retained}} the red jumpsuit, gold mask, and hat, but excised the character's red robes. New additions to the costume included a red cape, a utility belt modeled after Batman's utility belt, and a single, large circle-A across the chest, akin to Superman's iconic [...] "S" [...] shield. The golden mask was also redesigned as a reflective, but <b>flexible</b> <b>material</b> that wrapped around Anarky's head, allowing for the display of facial movement and emotion. This had previously been impossible, as the first mask was made of inflexible metal. Being a relatively new creation, Breyfogle encountered no editorial resistance in the new character design: [...] "Because [...] doesn't have 50 years of merchandising behind him, I can change his costume whenever I want..." [...] Within the Anarky series, secondary costumes were displayed in Anarky's base of operations. Each was slightly altered in design, but followed the same basic theme of color, jumpsuit, cloak, and hat. These were designed for use in various situations, but only one, a [...] "universal battle suit", was {{used during the}} brief series. These suits were also intended {{to be seen in}} the unpublished ninth issue of the series.|$|E

Spring and/or spiral steel is preferred for stronger and generally better quality corsets. Other materials used for boning have included ivory, wood, and cane.

2500|$|The megaphone, {{a simple}} cone made of paper or other <b>flexible</b> <b>material,</b> {{is the oldest}} and {{simplest}} acoustic horn, used prior to loudspeakers as a passive acoustic amplifier for mechanical phonographs and for the human voice; it is still used by cheerleaders and lifeguards. Because the conic section shape describes {{a portion of a}} perfect sphere of radiated sound, cones have no phase or amplitude distortion of the wavefront. [...] The small megaphones used in phonographs and as loudhailers were not long enough to reproduce the low frequencies in music; they had a high cutoff frequency which attenuated the bottom two octaves of the sound spectrum, giving the megaphone a characteristic tinny sound.|$|E
2500|$|In the March 2005 {{issue of}} Science, Dr. Mary Higby Schweitzer {{and her team}} {{announced}} the discovery of <b>flexible</b> <b>material</b> resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex leg bone of specimen MOR 1125 from the Hell Creek Formation in Montana. The seven collagen types obtained from the bone fragments, compared to collagen data from living birds (specifically, a chicken), suggest that older theropods and birds are closely related.The soft tissue allowed a molecular comparison of cellular anatomy and protein sequencing of collagen tissue published in 2007, both of which indicated that T. rex and birds are {{more closely related to}} each other than either is to Alligator. A second molecular study robustly supported the relationship of birds to dinosaurs, though it did not place birds within Theropoda, as expected. This study utilized eight additional collagen sequences extracted from a femur of the [...] "mummified" [...] Brachylophosaurus canadensis specimen MOR 2598, a hadrosaur. However, these results have been very controversial. No other peptides of a Mesozoic age have been reported. In 2008, it was suggested that the presumed soft tissue was in fact a bacterial microfilm. In response, it was argued that these very microfilms protected the soft tissue. Another objection was that the results could have been caused by contamination. In 2015, under more controlled conditions safeguarding against contamination, the peptides were still identified. In 2017, a study found that a peptide was present in the bone of the modern ostrich that was identical to that found in the Tyrannosaurus and Brachylophosaurus specimens, highlighting the danger of a cross-contamination.|$|E

40|$|Random {{copolymers}} of propylene with ethylene, butene, and hexene comonomers {{have been}} prepared with different metallocene catalysts. The used catalysts have allowed a precise control of concentration of stereodefects and high degree of comonomer incorporation while maintaining high molecular mass and random distribution of comonomers. Incorporation of ethylene, butene, and hexene produces great enhancement of ductility, flexibility, and toughness, as compared to highly isotactic polypropylene, but with important differences in the values of elastic modulus and strength depending on the comonomer. In propylene-ethylene copolymers, the values of elastic modulus, ductility, toughness, and strength can be tuned by changing the concentrations of rr stereodefects and ethylene units, so that stiff and fragile plastics, highly <b>flexible</b> <b>materials,</b> and elastomers can be obtained. Propylene-butene copolymers behave as highly <b>flexible</b> <b>materials</b> with remarkable ductility and toughness and contemporary high strength and stiffness. Propylene-hexene copolymers are highly <b>flexible</b> <b>materials</b> with plastic resistance and strength that decrease with increasing hexene content.
