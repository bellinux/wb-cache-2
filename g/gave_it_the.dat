5|$|Living giraffes were {{originally}} classified as one species by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. He <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> binomial name Cervus camelopardalis. Morten Thrane Brünnich classified the genus Giraffa in 1772. The species name camelopardalis is from Latin.|$|E
5|$|British {{ichthyologist}} Charles Tate Regan described Spheroides liosomus in 1909 from specimens {{collected in}} Melbourne, Hobart, Flinders Island and Port Phillip. He noted {{its lack of}} spines compared with specimens of Tetrodon hamiltonii, and hence {{argued that it was}} a distinct and separate species. Australian biologist Gilbert Whitley equated Regan's description with Fréminville's original naming and <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> combination Spheroides glaber in 1955, and later Gastrophysus glaber in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{explorer}} David Thompson {{first recorded}} the Native American {{name of the}} Snake River as Shawpatin {{when he arrived at}} its mouth by boat in 1800.

5|$|During World War II, several {{properties}} on Park Lane {{were hit}} by bombs. Dudley House, at No.100, suffered major structural damage, including {{the destruction of the}} ballroom and gallery, though the building was partially restored. However, the strength of construction of the Dorchester Hotel <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> reputation of being one of London's safest buildings, and it was a safe haven for numerous luminaries. General Dwight D. Eisenhower took a suite on the first floor in 1942, and later made it his headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Early European explorers in North America, {{who were}} {{familiar}} with the smaller red deer of Europe, thought that the larger North American animal resembled a moose, and consequently <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> name elk, which is the common European name for moose. The word elk is related to the Latin alces, Old Norse elgr, Scandinavian elg/älg and German Elch, all of which refer to the animal known in North America as the moose.|$|E

5|$|From the 1860s through 1871, early {{forms of}} the {{periodic}} table proposed by Dmitri Mendeleev contained a gap between molybdenum (element42) and ruthenium (element44). In 1871, Mendeleev predicted this missing element would occupy the empty place below manganese and have similar chemical properties. Mendeleev <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> provisional name ekamanganese (from eka-, the Sanskrit word for one) because the predicted element was one place down from the known element manganese.|$|E

5|$|In his research, Chadwick {{continued}} {{to probe the}} nucleus. In 1925, the concept of spin had allowed physicists to explain the Zeeman effect, but it also created unexplained anomalies. At {{the time it was}} believed that the nucleus consisted of protons and electrons, so nitrogen's nucleus, for example, with a mass number of 14, was assumed to contain 14 protons and 7 electrons. This <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> right mass and charge, but the wrong spin.|$|E

Lord Camden denounced the treatment of Wilkes as a contravention of Magna Carta. Thomas Paine, in his Rights of Man, would disregard Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights {{on the grounds that}} they were not a written constitution devised by elected representatives.|$|E
5|$|Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander, after {{collecting}} {{a specimen}} at Botany Bay in 1770 {{on the first}} voyage of Captain James Cook, {{was the first to}} write of this species.

5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{was first}} scientifically described in 1859 by William Orville Ayres, the first Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences.

5|$|The creek whaler was {{described}} by Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley in a 1943 volume of Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. He assigned the new species to the subgenus Uranganops of the genus Galeolamna, and <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> specific epithet fitzroyensis because the type specimen, a 1.2-m-long female, was collected from Connor's Creek in the Fitzroy River estuary. Subsequent authors have synonymized Galeolamna with Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{specimen}} {{of the black}} dogfish was collected near Julianehåb in Greenland and described by Danish zoologist Johannes Reinhardt in his 1825 Ichthyologiske bidrag. Reinhardt <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> name Spinax fabricii in honor of missionary and naturalist Otto Fabricius, who pioneered the study of Greenlandic fishes. German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle, in their 1839–41 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, created the new genus Centroscyllium for this species.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the Portuguese dogfish was published by Portuguese zoologists José Vicente Barbosa du Bocage and Félix António de Brito Capello, in an 1864 issue of Proceedings of the General Meetings for Scientific Business of the Zoological Society of London. They created the new genus Centroscymnus for this shark, and <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> specific epithet coelolepis, derived from the Greek koilos ("hollow") and lepis ("fish scale") and referring {{to the structure of}} the dermal denticles. The type specimen, caught off Portugal, has since been destroyed in a fire.|$|E
