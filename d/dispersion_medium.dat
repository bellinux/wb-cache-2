Their malignant derivatives (pyBHK) induced by polyoma virus, after dissociation with trypsin, aggregate equally well in medium with either calcium or magnesium ions. When EDTA is used for dissociation of cells from culture on a substrate, neither BHK 21 nor pyBHK cells require addition to the medium of divalent cations for rapid aggregation. Trypsin-dissociated BHK 21 cells become aggregative in medium without divalent cations, when they are incubated for 60 min in <b>dispersion</b> with <b>medium</b> containing calcium ions before aggregation. In the case of pyBHK cells, incubation in <b>dispersion</b> in the <b>medium,</b> with calcium or magnesium ions is effective in this respect.
