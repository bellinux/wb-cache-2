25|$|The {{format of}} the {{examinations}} within the PSLE has been revised consistently throughout its history to suit the Ministry of Education's policy.

25|$|In addition, {{there are}} {{international}} treaty procedures, {{such as the}} procedures under the European Patent Convention (EPC) , that centralize some portion of the filing and <b>examination</b> <b>procedure.</b> Similar arrangements exist among the member states of ARIPO and OAPI, the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine CIS member states that have formed the Eurasian Patent Organization. A key international convention relating to patents is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, {{the principles of the}} convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim priority: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Another key treaty is the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), administered by WIPO and covering more than 140 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference in}} fictional literature {{to the potential}} identification of a typewriter as having produced a document was by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who wrote [...] "A Case of Identity" [...] in 1891. [...] In non-fiction, the first document examiner to describe how a typewriter might be identified was William E. Hagan who wrote, in 1894, [...] "All typewriter machines, even when using {{the same kind of}} type, become more or less peculiar by use as to the work done by them". Other early discussions of the topic were provided by A. S. Osborn in his 1908 treatise, Typewriting as Evidence, and again in his 1929 textbook, Questioned Documents.

2500|$|In the United States, the {{registration}} process includes several steps. First, the trademark owner files an application {{to register the}} trademark. About three months after it is filed, the application is reviewed by an examining attorney at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The examining attorney checks for compliance with {{the rules of the}} Trademark Manual of <b>Examination</b> <b>Procedure.</b> This review includes procedural matters such as making sure the applicant's goods or services are identified properly. It also includes more substantive matters such as making sure the applicant's mark is not merely descriptive or likely to cause confusion with a pre-existing applied-for or registered mark. If the application runs afoul of any requirement, the examining attorney will issue an office action requiring the applicant to address certain issues or refusals prior to registration of the mark. If the examining attorney approves the application, it will be [...] "published for opposition." [...] During this 30-day period third parties who may be affected by {{the registration}} of the trademark may step forward to file an Opposition Proceeding to stop the registration of the mark. If an Opposition proceeding is filed it institutes a case before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to determine both the validity of the grounds for the opposition as well as the ability of the applicant to register the mark at issue. Finally, provided that no third-party opposes the registration of the mark during the opposition period or the opposition is ultimately decided in the applicant's favor the mark will be registered in due course.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the good}} qualities of a world class {{university}} is their high standard <b>examination</b> <b>procedures.</b> This paper attempts to optimize the <b>examination</b> <b>procedures</b> in a potential world class university by minimizing the major variables: time, cost and human resources involved in the examination conduct. Covenant University, the best private university in Nigeria, {{is used as a}} case study. The <b>examination</b> <b>procedures</b> covering conduct of examination at Covenant University, were modelled as a linear programming with time, cost and human resources as our decision variables. The constraint, including the nonnegativity constraint, were carefully formed. The standard form of the model is solved using Simplex method {{with the aid of a}} computer software - LIP Solver, which was used to evaluate the feasible solutions from the initial tableau. It was observed that some of the decision variables such as time to correct examination questions and address examination misconducts must be deemphasized, while decision variables such as time to admit students into the examination hall and time to verify students’ identity in order to admit them into the examination hall should be given priority in order to optimize the resources related to the examination conduct at Covenant University...|$|R

The inteviews were transcribed and open-coded, which led to the sorting information into categories by theme. As a method of stakeholder analysis a "quick" analysis of stakeholders was used in order to identify the main stakeholders of the issues under investigation. Overall, the analysis of interviews shows that each faculty has different strategies and preferences for selecting students during the entrance procedure. Hence, possible consensus of entrance <b>examination</b> <b>procedures</b> in similar fields across the three faculties is not entirely likely, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background The International Standard ISO 15189 is {{recognized}} as a valuable guide in ensuring high quality clinical laboratory services and promoting the harmonization of accreditation programmes in laboratory medicine. <b>Examination</b> <b>procedures</b> must be verified in order to guarantee that their performance characteristics are congruent with the intended scope of the test. The aim {{of the present study}} was to propose a practice model for implementing procedures employed for the verification of validated <b>examination</b> <b>procedures</b> already used for at least 2 years in our laboratory, in agreement with the ISO 15189 requirement at the Section 5. 5. 1. 2. Methods In order to identify the operative procedure to be used, approved documents were identified, together with the definition of performance characteristics to be evaluated for the different methods; the <b>examination</b> <b>procedures</b> used in laboratory were analyzed and checked for performance specifications reported by manufacturers. Then, operative flow charts were identified to compare the laboratory performance characteristics with those declared by manufacturers. Results The choice of performance characteristics for verification was based on approved documents used as guidance, and the specific purpose tests undertaken, a consideration being made of: imprecision and trueness for quantitative methods; diagnostic accuracy for qualitative methods; imprecision together with diagnostic accuracy for semi-quantitative methods. Conclusions The described approach, balancing technological possibilities, risks and costs and assuring the compliance of the fundamental component of result accuracy, appears promising as an easily applicable and flexible procedure helping laboratories to comply with the ISO 15189 requirements...|$|R
