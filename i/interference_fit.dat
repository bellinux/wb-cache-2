2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} some {{years before the}} accident, the bush at Station 143 had been pushed upwards so the chamfer and 0.055-inch (1.40mm) of the parallel-sided portion protruded beyond the upper surface of the boom. [...] The exposed end of the bush was then struck with a conical tool applied to the bore. [...] This action slightly flared the exposed end and left the external diameter 0.0038 inch (0.097mm) oversize. The bush was then pushed upwards {{out of the hole}} and re-inserted from the lower surface. [...] As the bush was being re-inserted its flared end broached the anodised material and a small amount of aluminium from the wall of the hole. [...] This broaching action scored the wall of the hole and left its diameter slightly oversize so the bush was not an <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> anywhere except at its flared end. [...] Scoring of the wall of the hole and the absence of an <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> left the inner lower boom vulnerable to developing fatigue cracks at Station 143.|$|E
2500|$|The {{removal and}} fitting of {{cylinder}} liners in large engines requires {{the use of}} dry ice to chill and thus shrink the liner so that it freely slides into the engine block. When the liner then warms up, it expands, and the resulting <b>interference</b> <b>fit</b> holds it tightly in place. [...] Similar procedures may be used in fabricating mechanical assemblies with a high resultant strength, replacing the need for pins, keys or welds.|$|E
2500|$|British Aircraft Corporation {{carried out}} {{multiple}} tests {{in which a}} bush was slightly flared with a conical tool and pressed into a hole in a test piece of the same aluminium alloy as the inner lower boom.

2500|$|The fatal {{fatigue crack}} in the inner lower boom had {{initiated}} at a bolt hole at Station 143, the rearmost of five bolt holes for attachment of the inner engine nacelle to the lower boom.

[...] A cadmium-plated steel bush of length 1 ⅝ inch (4.13cm), chamfered at one end, was pressed into each hole.

40|$|AbstractAdvancing {{activities}} in lightweight construction, for example, {{in the area}} of electro mobility and the automotive industry more generally, require new material combinations as well as new manufacturing and joining techniques. For such technologies to be confidently applied, fundamental principles for design and estimation are necessary. In the past few years, knurled <b>interference</b> <b>fits</b> have become established in industrial applications because of their potential utility. However, established fundamental principles have been missing. This paper describes numerical investigations of the joining process of knurled <b>interference</b> <b>fits</b> and its influence on the load characteristics of the material combination 100 Cr 6 /AlMgSi 1. The described investigations include the influence of the shaft chamfer angle, the hub diameter ratio and the geometric interference.

40|$|<b>Interference</b> <b>fits</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in aircraft structural joints {{because of their}} improved fatigue performance. Recent advances in analysis of these joints have increased understanding of the nonlinear load-contact and load-interfacial slip variations in these joints. Experimental work in these problems is lacking due to difficulties in determining partial contact and partial slip along the pin-hole interface. In this paper, an experimental procedure is enumerated for determining load-contact relations in interference/clearance fits, using photoelastic models and applying a technique for detecting progress of separation/contact up to predetermined locations. The study incorporates a detailed procedure for model making, controlling interference, locating break of contact up to known locations around the interface, estimating optically the degree of interference, determining interfacial friction and evaluating stresses in the sheet. Experiments, simulating joints in large sheets, were carried out under both pin and plate loads. The present studies provide load-separation behavior in interference joint with finite interfacial friction...|$|R
