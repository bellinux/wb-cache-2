40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{estimation}} of left ventricular (LV) contractility is {{difficult in the}} presence of significant mitral regurgitation (MR). Prediction of LV performance after MR repair is even more problematic. The intraoperative Doppler-derived LV rate of pressure rise (LV <b>delta</b> P/delta <b>t)</b> analyzed before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was presumed to be a useful predictive parameter for LV performance. Therefore, its relation to perioperative inotropic requirements (PIR) necessary for separation from CPB after surgical MR repair was investigated. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients scheduled for surgical MR repair fulfilled the selection criteria. Pre-CPB LV <b>delta</b> P/delta <b>t,</b> pre-CPB echocardiographic LV fractional area change (LV FAC), and pre-CPB thermodilution-derived cardiac index (CI) were recorded. After MR repair, separation from CPB was performed with regard to standardized guidelines. PIR during the first 60 minutes following separation were recorded. RESULTS: Pre-CPB LV <b>delta</b> P/delta <b>t</b> could be assessed in 22 patients. Pre-CPB LV <b>delta</b> P/delta <b>t</b> was 882 +/- 450 mmHg/sec, pre-CPB LV FAC was 49 % +/- 9 %, and pre-CPB CI was 2. 0 +/- 0. 2 L/kg/min. Pre-CPB LV <b>delta</b> P/delta <b>t</b> was significantly correlated with pre-CPB LV FAC (r = 0. 56), and with pre-CPB CI (r = 0. 72). Inotropic support was necessary in 16 patients (73 %), and was best predicted by the pre-CPB LV <b>delta</b> P/delta <b>t,</b> by means of logistic regression (p = 0. 026). CONCLUSIONS: Doppler-derived LV <b>delta</b> P/delta <b>t</b> was assessable in most patients with severe chronic MR, and was the best intraoperative predictive parameter of post-CPB inotropic requirements after surgical MR repair...|$|R

25|$|The {{increase}} in pressure produced by a single stage {{is limited by the}} relative velocity between the rotor and the fluid, and the turning and diffusion capabilities of the airfoils. A typical stage in a commercial compressor will produce a pressure increase of between 15% and 60% (pressure ratios of 1.15–1.6) at design conditions with a polytropic efficiency in the region of 90–95%. To achieve different pressure ratios, axial compressors are designed with different numbers of stages and rotational speeds. As a rule of thumb we can assume that each stage in a given compressor has the same temperature rise (<b>Delta</b> <b>T).</b> Therefore, at the entry, temperature (Tstage) to each stage must increase progressively through the compressor and the ratio (Delta T)/(Tstage) entry must decrease, thus implying a progressive reduction in stage pressure ratio through the unit. Hence the rear stage develops a significantly lower pressure ratio than the first stage.|$|E

2500|$|A T cell, or T {{lymphocyte}}, {{is a type}} of lymphocyte (a subtype {{of white}} blood cell) that plays a central role in cell-mediated immunity. [...] T cells can be distinguished from other lymphocytes, such as B cells and natural killer cells, by the presence of a T-cell receptor on the cell surface. They are called T cells because they mature in the thymus from thymocytes (although some also mature in the tonsils). The several subsets of T cells each have a distinct function. The majority of human T cells rearrange their alpha and beta chains on the cell receptor and are termed alpha beta T cells (αβ T cells) and are part of the adaptive immune system. Specialized gamma <b>delta</b> <b>T</b> cells, (a small minority of T cells in the human body, more frequent in ruminants), have invariant T-cell receptors with limited diversity, that can effectively present antigens to other T cells and are considered {{to be part of the}} innate immune system.|$|E

The potent V gamma 9 V <b>delta</b> 2 <b>T</b> cell reactivity 1) against certain cancer cells or 2) induced by infectious agents indicates that therapeutic augmentations. of V gamma 9 V <b>delta</b> 2 <b>T</b> cell activities may be clinically beneficial. The functional characteristics of V gamma 9 V <b>delta</b> 2 <b>T</b> cells from Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus monkey) {{are very similar to}} those from Homo sapiens. We have found that the i. v. administration of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate or pyrophosphomonoester drugs into cynomolgus monkeys combined with s. c. low-dose (6 X 10 (5) U/animal) IL- 2 induces a large pool of CD 27 (+) and CD 27 (-) effector/memory T cells in the peripheral blood of treated animals. The administration of these drugs in the absence of IL- 2 is substantially less effective, indicating the importance of additional exogenous costimuli. Shortly after the costimulatory IL- 2 treatment, only gamma delta (but not alpha beta) T cells expressed the CD 69 activation marker, indicating that V gamma 9 V <b>delta</b> 2 <b>T</b> lymphocytes are more responsive to low-dose IL- 2 than aJ 3 T cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human V gamma 9 /V <b>delta</b> 2 <b>T</b> {{lymphocytes}} recognize nonpeptidic antigens in {{a manner}} distinct from the classical antigen recognition by alpha beta T cells. The apparent lack of major histocompatibility (MHC) restriction and antigen processing allows very fast responses against pathogenic insults. To address the potential functional requirement for accessory molecules, we investigated {{the roles of the}} CD 2 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA) - 1 T-cell co-receptors in antigen-induced activities of human V gamma 9 /V delta 2 T-cell clones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human peripheral blood V gamma 9 /V <b>delta</b> 2 <b>T</b> lymphocytes were cloned and their cytotoxicity against Daudi lymphoma was measured by a standard 51 Cr-release assay. The responses of V gamma 9 /V <b>delta</b> 2 <b>T</b> lymphocytes to nonpeptidic antigens were assessed using DNA synthesis and cytokine ELISA assays. Monoclonal antibodies specific for various molecules with potential T-cell accessory functions were utilized in blocking assays. RESULTS: All of our V gamma 9 /V delta 2 T-cell clones displayed the Th 1 phenotype. The anti-LFA- 1 antibody strongly inhibited the cytotoxicity of V gamma 9 /V <b>delta</b> 2 <b>T</b> cells against Daudi B-cell lymphoma; whereas, it had no influence on the antigen-induced cytokine release or proliferation. In contrast, antibodies against CD 2 and LFA- 3 had no effect on the lytic activity of V gamma 9 /V <b>delta</b> 2 <b>T</b> cells, but strongly inhibited the cytokine release and proliferation. However, the CD 2 -LFA- 3 interaction was not an absolute requirement for the cytokine release and the DNA synthetic activity of antigen-stimulated V gamma 9 /V <b>delta</b> 2 <b>T</b> cells, since the inhibitory effect could be reversed by addition of exogenous interleukin 2 (IL- 2). CONCLUSIONS: These novel observations indicate that the signals generated by different accessory molecules and IL- 2 can contribute in an integrated fashion to the regulation of V gamma 9 /V <b>delta</b> 2 <b>T</b> cells. These interactions may be important for the effectiveness of V gamma 9 /V delta 2 T-cell responses...|$|R
