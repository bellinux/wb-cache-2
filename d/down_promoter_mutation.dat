40|$|Transcription {{initiation}} {{is a key}} step {{at which}} gene expression can be regulated. The sigma subunit of RNA polymerase provides the enzyme {{with the ability to}} recognize promoter sequences and initiate transcription at specific sites on the chromosome. The molecular basis of sigma function is not well known. It has been suggested that sigma factors confer promoter specificty by making direct contacts to the promoter DNA (Losick and Pero, 1981). To test this idea, suppressors of <b>promoter</b> <b>down</b> <b>mutations</b> were sought that affected the promoter recogniton properties of the σ 70 subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase. Four such sigma mutants were obtained, two of which are allele-specific. One of these mutants has a change at a position in the predicted helix-turn-helix DNA binding structure which lies in a conserved region of the protein (region 4). This mutant specifically suppresses <b>promoter</b> <b>down</b> <b>mutations</b> in the - 35 region of the promoter. The other mutant has a change at a residue that lies in a predicted α-helix of conserved region 2. This mutant specifically suppresses <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in the - 10 region of the promoter. These data support the idea that regions 2 and 4 of sigma interact with the - 10 and - 35 regions of the promoter, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{recognition}} of promoter region - 10 nucleotide sequences in prokaryotes {{is believed to}} be mediated by a segment of alpha-helix in a region of RNA polymerase sigma factors called 2. 4. Earlier genetic studies implicated Thr- 100 in region 2. 4 of the Bacillus subtilis sigma factor sigma H in the {{recognition of}} the G. C base pair at position - 13 in the - 10 region (GAAT) of a cognate promoter. In confirmation of this assignment, we now show that a change-of-specificity mutant of sigma H in which Thr- 100 was replaced with isoleucine suppresses a G. C [...] A. T nucleotide substitution at position - 13 but not other "promoter down mutations" (causing impaired promoter activity) at positions - 13, - 12, and - 11. We also show that a loss-of-contact mutant created by the replacement of Thr- 100 with alanine (having a short side chain) enables sigma H to tolerate three different <b>promoter</b> <b>down</b> <b>mutations</b> at position - 13 but not down mutations at other positions. Finally, we suggest the identification of an additional amino acid involved in base-pair recognition by the demonstration that the replacement of Arg- 96 with alanine specifically suppresses an A. T [...] G. C <b>promoter</b> <b>down</b> <b>mutation</b> at position - 12. The identification of amino acids that are four residues apart that are involved in the recognition of adjacent base pairs may fix the orientation of region 2. 4 (its NH 2 terminus being proximal to the promoter transcription start site) and is consistent with a model in which the recognition of promoter region - 10 nucleotide sequences is mediated by an alpha-helix in which residues involved in base-pair contact are separated by one turn and clustered on one face of the helix...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} on 303 gliomas we show the highest {{frequency}} of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in gliobastomas (80 %) followed by oligodendrogliomas (70 %) and astrocytomas (39 %).

Tumors with TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> {{compared to those}} without showed increased TERT transcription; we also showed difference in the transcription levels due to the two main mutations. Tumors with TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> had shorter telomeres than those without. The patients with only TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> showed worst survival (median survival 14. 6 months) and patients with both IDH and TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> showed best survival (246. 5 months). In patients with astrocytoma, the TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> only associated with poor survival (P < 0. 0001); IDH mutations and 1 p/ 19 q deletions associated with increased survival (P = 0. 0004).

The aim of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to add further information regarding the prevalence of the BRAF V 600 E and TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in Chinese PTC and their clinicopathological associations. We detected the BRAF V 600 E <b>mutation</b> and TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in 455 Chinese PTC patients and analyzed the association of these mutations with several clinicopathological features. The BRAF V 600 E mutation was detected in 343 (75. 4 %) of 455 cases and was significantly associated with older age (p< 0. 001) and conventional subtype (p = 0. 003).

40|$|AbstractIntroductionMutation in {{the core}} {{promoter}} of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene {{was determined to be}} a frequent event in malignant melanoma and other cancers. However, the role of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutation</b> in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) remains largely unknown. MethodsGenomic DNA samples from the tumor tissue of 195 HCCs were analyzed for TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutation</b> at 2 hotspots (− 124 and − 146 bp from the ATG start site, g. 1, 295, 228 and g. 1, 295, 250, respectively) through direct sequencing. ResultsThe TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutation</b> was identified in 57 of the 195 HCCs (29. 2 %) and was associated with old age (P =  0. 0122), presence of anti-hepatitis C (HCV; P =  0. 0048), and absence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg; P =  0. 0007). However, the TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutation</b> did not correlate with serum α-fetoprotein levels, liver cirrhosis, tumor size, tumor grade, tumor stage, early tumor recurrence, β-catenin mutation or p 53 mutation. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the absence of hepatitis B infection is an independent factor associated with TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutation.</b> Furthermore, among HCC patients infected with hepatitis C, those with concomitant hepatitis B infection exhibited infrequent TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutation</b> (P =  0. 0435). Remarkably, patients presenting with TERT promoter mutation-positive and -negative HCCs exhibited similar disease-free and overall survival rates. ConclusionsOur study indicated that the TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutation</b> frequently occurred in HCV-associated HCCs. The absence of Hepatitis B infection was significantly associated with the TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutation.</b> These findings suggest that various etiological factors may be involved in differing mechanisms to preserve telomeres during the carcinogenesis of HCCs...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{details of}} liver {{histology}} {{of patients with}} precore and core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> are still not clear. Aim: To determine the role of precore and core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in liver histology in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B. Patients and methods: Intrahepatic hepatitis B virus DNA (by COBAS Amplicor hepatitis B virus Monitor test) and precore and core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> (by a line probe assay) were measured in 54 chronic hepatitis B patients. Expression of hepatitis B core antigen, hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B surface antigen was determined by immunohistological staining. Histological activity index was scored according to Knodell's criteria. Results: Compared with patients without core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations,</b> patients with core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> had more severe intrahepatic inflammation and fibrosis, and more cytoplasmic expression of hepatitis B core antigen (P = 0. 028). No such {{differences were found in}} patients with and without precore mutations. Logistic regression showed that core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were independently associated with cytoplasmic expression of hepatitis B core antigen (P = 0. 026). Intrahepatic hepatitis B virus DNA levels correlated with serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels (r = 0. 71, P < 0. 001) and the percentage of hepatitis B core antigen-positive hepatocytes (r = 0. 37, P = 0. 047), but had no correlation with serum alanine aminotransferase levels nor the degree of inflammation and fibrosis. Conclusions: Patients with core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> had more severe inflammation and fibrosis, and more frequent cytoplasmic expression of hepatitis B core antigen.

40|$|Activating {{mutations}} in the TERT promoter were recently identified {{in up to}} 71 % of cutaneous melanoma. Subsequent studies found TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in {{a wide array of}} other major human cancers. TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> lead to increased expression of telomerase, which maintains telomere length and genomic stability, thereby allowing cancer cells to continuously divide, avoiding senescence or apoptosis. TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in cutaneous melanoma often show UV-signatures. Non-melanoma skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, are very frequent malignancies in individuals of European descent. We investigated the presence of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in 32 basal cell carcinomas and 34 cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas using conventional Sanger sequencing. TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were identified in 18 (56 %) basal cell carcinomas and in 17 (50 %) cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. The recurrent mutations identified in our cohort were identical to those previously described in cutaneous melanoma, and showed a UV-signature (C. T or CC.

40|$|Hotspot <b>mutations</b> in the <b>promoter</b> of the {{telomerase}} {{reverse transcriptase}} (TERT) gene have been recently reported in human cancers and proposed as a novel mechanism of telomerase activation. To explore TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in tumors originating from {{the adrenal gland}} and extra-adrenal paraganglia, a set of 253 tumors (38 adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs), 127 pheochromocytomas (PCCs), 18 extra-adrenal paragangliomas (ea PGLs), 37 head and neck PGLs (HN PGLs), and 33 peripheral neuroblastic tumors) was selected along with 16 human neuroblastoma (NBL) and two ACC cell lines to assess TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> by the Sanger sequencing method. All mutations detected were confirmed by a SNaPshot assay. Additionally, 36 gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) were added to explore an association between TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> and SDH deficiency. TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were found in seven out of 289 tumors and in three out of 18 human cell lines; four C 228 T mutations in 38 ACCs (10. 5 %), two C 228 T mutations in 18 ea PGLs (11. 1 %), one C 250 T mutation in 36 GISTs (2. 8 %), and three C 228 T mutations in 16 human NBL cell lines (18. 75 %). No mutation was detected in PCCs, HN PGLs, neuroblastic tumors as well as ACC cell lines. TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> preferentially occurred in a SDH-deficient setting (P= 0. 01) being present in three out of 47 (6. 4 %) SDH-deficient tumors vs zero out of 171 (0 %) SDH-intact tumors. We conclude that TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> occur in ACCs and ea PGLs. In addition, preliminary evidence indicates a potential association with the acquisition of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in SDH-deficient tumors...|$|R
30|$|Recently, {{the impact}} of {{telomere}} dysregulation on aggressive behavior {{has been reported in}} many malignancies (Shay and Bacchetti 1997; Horn et al. 2013; Koelsche et al. 2013; Landa et al. 2013; Nault et al. 2013; Akaike et al. 2015; Saito et al. 2016). Two mechanisms are involved in telomere dysregulation: telomerase activation and ALT. Telomerase function can be activated by recurrent hot spot mutations (C 228 T and C 250 T) in the promoter region of TERT (Reddel 2014), resulting in an increase in TERT transcriptional activity. Therefore, we first examined the frequency of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in GISTs. To date, three research teams have reported information on TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in GISTs (Campanella et al. 2015; Killela et al. 2013; Vinagre et al. 2013). Two of the three studies could not identify any TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in their small cohorts (Killela et al. 2013; Vinagre et al. 2013). Campanella et al. (2015) examined the frequency of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in a large series of GISTs, and they found somatic mutations at a frequency of 3.8  % (5 / 130). In this study, we analyzed TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> (C 228 T and C 250 T) as well as expression of both DAXX and ATRX by immunohistochemistry in 92 cases of GISTs. Two of the 92 cases (2.2  %) had heterozygous C 228 T TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations.</b> This frequency is very similar to that reported in a previous large study (Campanella et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|The trfA and trb operons, {{encoding}} genes {{essential for}} replication and conjugative transfer of broad host range plasmid RK 2, are transcribed divergently. Deletion analysis presented here indicates that trfAp and trbAp are arranged as {{face to face}} promoters. The presence of the korA gene, whose product is known to repress seven operons on RK 2, including the trfA operon, is shown here to stimulate trbAp. The effect of korA on trbAp is mimicked by the trfAp- 1 <b>promoter</b> <b>down</b> <b>mutation,</b> suggesting that {{a reduction in the}} activity of trfAp is required for derepression of trbAp activity. The trfAp- 1 mutation reduces RNA polymerase binding and open complex formation at trfAp but does not stimulate melting at trbAp in vitro. Therefore, the inhibition of trbAp is most probably due to forward transcription initiated at trfAp. The simultaneous inhibition/stimulation by KorA is seen even {{in the presence of the}} other repressors KorB and TrbA, which act at this region, thus providing a dominant mode of coordinating plasmid replication and transfer. This may be one of the keys to understanding how the maintenance and spread of promiscuous plasmids are balanced in different environments...|$|R

TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> (C 228 T and C 250 T) and the BRAF V 600 E mutation were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing. ResultsThe CC 228229 TT mutation in the TERT promoter was detected in BCPAP cells and the C 250 T mutation was found in 8505 C cells. No TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutation</b> was observed in Cal- 62 or ML- 1 cells. The C 228 T mutation was found in only 1 of 35 (2. 8 %) PTCs and no C 250 T mutations were detected {{in any of the}} study subjects. The BRAF V 600 E mutation was found in 20 of 35 (57. 1 %) PTCs. One patient with the C 228 T TERT mutation also harbored the BRAF V 600 E mutation and developed a recurrence.

40|$|The {{reactivation}} or reexpression of telomerase (TERT) is {{a widespread}} feature of neoplasms. TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were recently reported that were hypothesized to result from UV radiation. In this retrospective study, we assessed TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in 196 cutaneous basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), including 102 tumors from X-irradiated patients, 94 tumors from patients never exposed to ionizing radiation treatment, and 116 melanomas. We sought to evaluate the effects of UV and X-ray irradiation on TERT mutation frequency. TERT mutations were detected in 27 % of BCCs from X-irradiated patients, 51 % of BCCs from nonirradiated patients, and 22 % of melanoma patients. TERT mutations were significantly increased in non-X-irradiated BCC patients compared with X-irradiated BCC patients; the mutations also presented a different mutation signature. In nonirradiated patients, TERT mutations were more frequent in BCCs of sun-exposed skin, supporting a possible causative role of UV radiation. In melanoma, TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were generally restricted to intermittent sun-exposed areas and were associated with nodular and superficial spreading subtypes, increased thickness, ulceration, increased mitotic rate, and BRAFV 600 E mutations.

40|$|We {{screened}} promoter {{region of}} the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) for activating somatic mutations in 188 tumors from patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Twelve tumors (6. 4 %) carried a mutation within the core promoter {{region of the}} gene. The mutations were less frequent in high grade tumors compared to low grade tumors [odds ratio (OR) = 0. 15, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 03 - 0. 72, p= 0. 02]. Multivariate analysis for cause specific survival showed statistically significant poor outcome in patients with TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> [hazard ratio (HR) = 2. 90, 95 % CI= 1. 13 - 7. 39, p= 0. 03]. A common polymorphism (rs 2853669) within the locus seemed {{to act as a}} modifier of the effect of the mutations on patient survival as the noncarriers of the variant allele with the TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> showed worst survival (HR= 3. 34, 95 % CI= 1. 24 - 8. 98, p= 0. 02). We also measured relative telomere length (RTL) in tumors and difference between tumors with and without the TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> was not statistically significant. Similarly, no difference in patient survival based on RTL in tumors was observed. Our study showed a relatively low frequency of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in ccRCC. Nevertheless, patients with the mutations, particularly {{in the absence of the}} rs 2853669 variant showed the worst disease-specific survival. Thus, it is possible that the TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> define a small subset of tumors with an aggressive behavior. What's new? The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains genomic integrity. Activating somatic <b>mutations</b> in the <b>promoter</b> region of the TERT gene have been reported in many cancers. Here, the authors describe new TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Although present only in a proportion of the tumors, the TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were independently associated with poor patient survival. The effect was enhanced by a common polymorphism within the core TERT promoter. The TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> may thus define a small subset of tumors with an aggressive behavior...|$|R
40|$|Activating {{mutations}} {{in the core}} promoter of the TERT gene have been described in many different tumor entities.

Since only few data on molecular alterations of early-onset bladder tumors exist, we assessed the frequency of TERT core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in early-onset bladder cancer. Two cohorts of bladder tumors (early-onset patient group; n= 144 (age of onset of disease ≤ 45 years); unselected, consecutive group; n= 125) were examined for TERT core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations.</b> After microdissection and extraction of DNA the corresponding hot-spot-regions in the TERT core promoter were examined by Sanger-sequencing or a SNaPshot approach. A significantly lower frequency of TERT core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> was found in tumors from the early-onset cohort compared to the consecutive cohort (57, 6 % vs. 84, 8 %, p< 0, 001). Among the early-onset cohort cases younger than the cohort’s median age of 39 years at disease onset showed a significant reduced number of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> (31 / 67, 46, 3 %) than cases aged between 39 and 45 years (52 / 77, 67, 5 %; p= 0, 012).

We conclude that in tumors from early-onset bladder cancer patients TERT core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> are not as frequent as in bladder tumors from consecutive cases, but seem {{to play an important role}} there as well. In patients below 39 years of age TERT core <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> are a more infrequent event, suggesting different mechanisms of tumorigenesis in these young patients...|$|R

These mutations result in an upregulation of the telomerase complex activity and thus constitute a relevant mechanism for immortalization of tumor cells. Knowledge of the TERT promoter status in tumors {{is likely to be}} of interest for molecular classification and as a potential target for therapy. We, therefore, performed a systematic analysis of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in 1, 515 tumors of the human nervous system and its coverings including 373 pediatric and 1, 142 adult patients. We detected a total of 327 <b>mutations.</b> TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were exceedingly rare in tumors typically encountered in pediatric patients. In entities typically encountered in adult patients TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were strongly associated with older age (p <  0. 0001). Highest mutation frequencies were detected in gliosarcomas (81  %), oligodendrogliomas (78  %), oligoastrocytomas (58  %), primary glioblastomas (54  %), and solitary fibrous tumors (50  %). Related to other molecular alterations, TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were strongly associated with 1 p/ 19 q loss (p <  0. 0001), but inversely associated with loss of ATRX expression (p <  0. 0001) and IDH 1 /IDH 2 mutations (p <  0. 0001).

Objectives:Weaimed toevaluate the frequencyofTERTpromotermutations in thyroid lesions and to investigate the prognostic significance of such mutations in a large cohort of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs). Design: This was a retrospective observational study. Setting and Patients:We studied 647 tumors and tumor-like lesions. A total of 469 patients with FCDTC treated and followed in five university hospitals were included. Mean follow-up (SD) was 7. 8 5. 8 years. Main Outcome Measures: Predictive value of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> for distant metastasiza-tion, disease persistence at the end of follow-up, and disease-specific mortality. Results: TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were found in 7. 5 % of papillary carcinomas (PTCs), 17. 1 % of follicular carcinomas, 29. 0 % of poorly differentiated carcinomas, and 33. 3 % of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Patients with TERT-mutated tumors were older (P. 001) and had larger tumors (P. 002). In DTCs, TERTpromotermutationswere significantly associatedwith distantmetastases (P. 001) and higher stage (P. 001).

The advanced clinico-pathological and patient survival association with SDHD mutation and/or expression in cutaneous melanoma remains controversial. To evaluate the presence of SDHD <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> and SDHD protein expression in a melanoma series and its possible association with prognosis and survival of the patients. We assessed SDHD promoter status in cutaneous melanomas (CM), ocular melanomas (OM) and melanoma cell lines, and the expression of SDHD protein by immunohistochemistry in CM and OM, and by western blot in melanoma cell lines. We explored the putative association between SDHD protein expression and clinico-pathological and prognostic parameters of melanoma. We detected 2 % of SDHD <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in CM, but none in OM and cell lines. SDHD protein expression was present in all CM, in OM and in all CM and OM derived cell lines analysed. A significant association between lower SDHD mean protein expression and presence of ulceration and higher pT stage was found.

40|$|We {{have found}} a cII-dependent promoter, PaQ, within the Q gene of {{bacteriophage}} lambda. Transcription experiments and abortive initiation assays performed in vitro showed that the promoter strength and the cII affinity of PaQ were comparable to the other cII-dependent lambda promoters, PE and PI. The location and leftward direction of PaQ suggests a possible role in the delay of lambda late-gene expression by cII protein, a phenomenon that has been called cII-dependent inhibition. We have constructed a <b>promoter</b> <b>down</b> <b>mutation,</b> paq- 1, by changing a single base pair in the putative cII binding site of the promoter by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. The paq- 1 mutant promoter required about 4 -fold higher cII concentrations for maximal activation compared to the wild-type PaQ. We tested the hypothesis that PaQ is responsible in part for the delay of lambda late-gene expression by recombining the paq- 1 mutation into a phage showing severe cII-dependent inhibition. We found that the paq- 1 mutation relieved the cII-dependent growth defect of this phage. The paq- 1 mutation (in combination with lambda cI 857) resulted in a clear-plaque phenotype at the permissive temperature of 32 degrees C. The role of the PaQ-initiated antisense transcript in the control of lambda development is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Telomerase is a {{ribonucleoprotein}} {{with its}} catalytic subunit telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) {{as a key}} component, lengthening telomeres. In differentiated human cells, telomerase is silent due to the transcriptional repression of the TERT gene, but activated in oncogenesis. Telomerase activation/TERT induction is essential to unlimited proliferation of cancer cells via telomere lengthening, whereas recent evidence also suggests that TERT may be a master contributor of cancer hallmarks. It is thus important to define regulatory mechanisms underlying cancer-specific TERT expression, and to delineate oncogenic effects of TERT. This thesis is designed {{to address these issues}} with the following specific aims: (1) The association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TERT gene and cancer susceptibility and (2) Biological/translational implications of cancer-specific TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations.</b> The TERT SNP association with cancer risk has been extensively investigated, most studies being focused on rs 2736100 and rs 2736098. The rs 2736100 _CC genotype {{has been shown to be}} associated with higher risk for a number of cancer types. Consistently, we observed that male individuals carrying the rs 2736100 _CC exhibited greater susceptibility to myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), clonal diseases with myeloid cell origin (PAPER I). Furthermore, a comparison between Swedish and Chinese populations revealed a significantly higher fraction of rs 2736100 _CC in Swedes, coupled with a higher MPN incidence (compared to that in China). In addition, we made the same genotyping in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The rs 2736100 _AC genotype was associated with reduced UTUC risk compared to the rs 2736100 _AA and CC carriers (PAPER II), while there were no significant differences in the rs 2736100 or rs 2736098 genotype distribution between HCC patients and healthy individuals (PAPER III). Collectively, male/female and ethnical groups may harbor different germline TERT variants, thereby contributing to different incidences and susceptibility dependent on origins of malignancies. The recurrent TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations,</b> recently identified in different human malignancies, stimulate TERT transcription and activate telomerase. To explore the biological and clinical implication of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations,</b> we sequenced the TERT promoter region in tumor specimens derived from patients with UTUC, bladder cancer (BC) and HCC (PAPERS III and IV), and mutations were observed in 65 / 220 (30 %) UTUC, 41 / 70 (59 %) BC and 57 / 190 (30 %) of HCC patients, respectively. In UTUC, the presence of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> was significantly correlated with metastases, whereas for HCC, there was a significant difference in rs 2736098 and rs 2736100 genotypes between wt and mutant TERT promoter-bearing tumors. The cancer risk genotype rs 2736100 _CC was significantly associated with a reduced incidence of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations,</b> while the rs 2736098 _CT genotype was significantly higher in HCCs with TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations.</b> Thus, the germline TERT genetic background may substantially affect the incidence of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in HCCs. As TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> are absent in normal cells, we evaluated the mutant TERT promoter as a urinary biomarker for non-invasive detection of UTUC and BC. The mutant TERT promoter was indeed detectable in urine from the mutation-positive UTUC and BC patients using Sanger sequencing, but the sensitivity was only 60 %. To improve it, we developed a Competitive Allele-Specific TaqMan PCR (castPCR), and achieved an overall sensitivity of 89 % and specificity of 96 %. Thus, castPCR assays of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> may be useful tools for non-invasive, urine-based diagnostics of UTUC and BC. In summary, our findings gain new insights into the association of TERT SNPs with cancer risk and TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations.</b> These results will hopefully contribute to the rational development of a TERT-based strategy for precision oncology...|$|R

Herein, we searched for the presence and clinicopathological association of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in genomic DNA from 130 bona fide GISTs. We found TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in 3. 8 % (5 / 130) of GISTs.

Main Outcome Measures: Predictive value of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> for distant metastasization, disease persistence at the end of follow-up, and disease-specific mortality. Results: TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were found in 7. 5 % of papillary carcinomas (PTCs), 17. 1 % of follicular carcinomas, 29. 0 % of poorly differentiated carcinomas, and 33. 3 % of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Patients with TERT-mutated tumors were older (P <. 001) and had larger tumors (P =. 002). In DTCs, TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were significantly associated with distant metastases (P <. 001) and higher stage (P <. 001). Patients with DTC harboring TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were submitted to more radioiodine treatments (P =. 009) with higher cumulative dose (P =. 004) and to more treatment modalities (P =. 001). At the end of follow-up, patients with TERT-mutated DTCs were more prone to have persistent disease (P =. 001). TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were significantly associated with disease-specific mortality [in the whole FCDTC (P <. 001) ] in DTCs (P <. 001), PTCs (P =. 001), and follicular carcinomas (P <. 001). After adjusting for age at diagnosis and gender, the hazard ratio was 10. 35 (95 % confidence interval 2. 01 – 53. 24; P =. 005) in DTC and 23. 81 (95 % confidence interval 1. 36 – 415. 76; P =. 03) in PTCs. Conclusions: TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> are an indicator of clinically aggressive tumors, being correlated with worse outcome and disease-specific mortality in DTC. TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> have an independent prognostic value in DTC and, notably, in PTC. We acknowledge GENZYME for funding our work through a research project.

40|$|SETTING: Western Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{potential}} {{association between the}} evolution of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and mutations in the inhA promoter or the katG gene. DESIGN: Analysis of the frequency distribution of isoniazid (INH) resistance conferring mutations in a population sample of drug-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis. RESULTS: In the Western Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces, the percentage of isolates exhibiting inhA <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> increased significantly from respectively 48. 4 % and 62. 4 % in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates to 85. 5 % and 91. 9 % in XDR isolates. Data from the Western Cape revealed that significantly more XDR-TB isolates showed mutations in the inhA promoter than in katG (85. 5 % vs. 60. 9 %, P < 0. 01), while the respective proportions were equal for INH-resistant non-MDR-TB isolates (∼ 30 %). CONCLUSIONS: inhA <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> are strongly associated with XDR-TB in South Africa. We suggest that {{this is due to}} the dual resistance to ethionamide and (low-dose) INH conferred by inhA <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations.</b> The use of molecular probe assays such as the Geno-Type® MTBDRplus assay, which allows the detection of inhA <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations,</b> could enable treatment regimens to be adjusted depending on the pharmacogenetic properties of the mutations detected. © 2011 The Union.

40|$|Acral lentiginous {{melanoma}} (ALM) is {{the less}} common subtype with singular characterization. TERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> have being described as recurrent in melanomas and infrequent in ALM, but their real incidence and clinical relevance is unclear. The objectives {{of this study}} were to describe the prevalence of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in ALM, and correlate with the molecular profile of other drive genes and clinical features. Sixty-one samples from 48 patients with ALM were analyzed. After DNA isolation, the mutation profiles of the hotspot region of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and TERT genes were determined by PCR amplification followed by direct Sanger sequencing. KIT, PDGFRA, and VEGFR 2 gene amplification was performed by quantitative PCR. Clinical information such as survival, clinical stage, and Breslow tumor classification were obtained from medical records. TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> were found in 9. 3 % of the cases, BRAF in 10. 3 %, NRAS in 7. 5 %, KIT in 20. 7 %, and PDGFRA in 14. 8 % of ALM. None of the cases showed KIT, PDGFRA, or VEGFR 2 gene amplification. We found an association between KIT mutations and advanced Clark level (IV and V, P= 0. 043) and TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> with low mitotic index. No other significant associations were observed between mutation profile and patients' clinical features nor survival rates. Oncogenic TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> are present in a fraction of ALMs. No relevant associations were found between TERT mutation status and clinical/molecular features nor survival. Mutations of KIT and PDGFRA are the most common genetic alterations, and they can be therapeutic targets for these patients.

40|$|Telomerase (TERT) {{activation}} is {{a fundamental}} step in tumorigenesis. By maintaining telomere length, telomerase relieves a main barrier on cellular lifespan, enabling limitless proliferation driven by oncogenes. The recently discovered, highly recurrent <b>mutations</b> in the <b>promoter</b> of TERT are found in over 50 cancer types, and {{are the most common}} mutation in many cancers. Transcriptional activation of TERT, via <b>promoter</b> <b>mutation</b> or other mechanisms, is the rate-limiting step in production of active telomerase. Although TERT is expressed in stem cells, it is naturally silenced upon differentiation. Thus, the presence of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> may shed light on whether a particular tumor arose from a stem cell or more differentiated cell type. It is becoming clear that TERT mutations occur early during cellular transformation, and activate the TERT promoter by recruiting transcription factors that do not normally regulate TERT gene expression. This review highlights the fundamental and widespread role of TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> in tumorigenesis, including recent progress on their mechanism of transcriptional activation. These somatic <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations,</b> along with germline variation in the TERT locus also appear to have significant value as biomarkers of patient outcome. Understanding the precise molecular mechanism of TERT activation by <b>promoter</b> <b>mutation</b> and germline variation may inspire novel cancer cell-specific targeted therapies for a large number of cancer patients.

30|$|In conclusion, TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> {{were rare}} in Japanese GISTs, {{similar to what}} has been {{previously}} shown in a European study (Campanella et al. 2015). Telomere dysregulation defined as either TERT <b>promoter</b> <b>mutations</b> or loss of ATRX/DAXX expression was frequently observed in GISTs of extra-gastric origin, but this phenotype was not associated with patient prognosis. These findings suggest that telomere maintenance by telomerase activation and ALT might not {{play an important role in}} tumor progression of GISTs. However, much larger number of cases by multicenter studies are required to conclude the frequency of telomere dysregulation and its prognostic impacts in GISTs.|$|R
