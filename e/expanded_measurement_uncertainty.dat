The original aim of this work was to develop and to validate a new reference function for Au/Pt thermocouples which reflects the properties of presently commercially available Au and Pt wires. The thermoelectric properties of 16 Au/Pt thermocouples constructed at different National Metrological Institutes by using wires from different suppliers and 4 commercially available Au/Pt thermocouples were investigated. Most of them exhibit significant deviations from the current reference function of Au/Pt thermocouples caused by the poor performance of the Au-wires available. Thermoelectric homogeneity was investigated by measuring immersion profiles during freezes at the freezing point of silver and in liquid baths. The thermoelectric inhomogeneities were found to be one order of magnitude larger than those of Au/Pt thermocouples of the Standard Reference Material® (SRM®) 1749. The improvement of the annealing procedure of the gold wires is a key process to achieve thermoelectric homogeneities in the order of only about (2 – 3) mK, sufficient to replace the impracticable HTSPRTs as interpolation instruments of the ITS- 90.

40|$|The {{latest version}} of liquid {{chromatography}} is ultra-high performance (or pressure) chromatography (UHPLC). In the technique, short and narrow-bore columns with particle sizes below 3 µm are used. The extremely high pressure used results in very short analysis times, excellent separation, and good resolution. This makes UHPLC {{a good choice for}} steroidal analysis. Steroids are a highly interesting area of study; they can be recognized as biomarkers for several diseases and are a relevant topic in doping testing. In this thesis articles on the topic ‘steroid analysis with UHPLC’, published prior to April 2017, are reviewed. UHPLC is always combined with mass spectrometry (MS) for steroid analysis. The MS utilized is usually of multi-dimension: quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) or triple quadrupole (QqQ). The instrumentation is suitable for both untargeted and targeted analysis. In untargeted studies, the study of changes in the human metabolome has been especially interesting. The articles on targeted studies are usually focused on doping control and quantification of identified biomarkers. The analysis with UHPLC-MS/MS usually provide reliable results with fast analysis time, without complicated sample preparation. Typically, the sample preparation processes can include only protein precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction. UHPLC is also a valuable tool in simple and routine analysis. The separation efficiency is increased by the small plate height and the analysis time can thus be reduced. In this thesis work the technique was utilized for the analysis of food additives. For validation of an UHPLC method the repeatability, trueness, bias, <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and other factors need to be assessed. The experimental part of the thesis is dedicated to describe the development and validation of a method for analysis of five food additives and caffeine.

P - 25 [Disponível em: [URL] Carotenoid {{determination}} in food is {{a complex}} analytical process involving several mass transfer steps (extraction, evaporation, saponification, etc.). For consistent interpretation of an analytical method result {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the confidence that can be placed in it; this can be provided by the quantification of its accuracy (trueness and precision) {{in the form of a}} <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> estimate. The Guide to the expression of <b>Uncertainty</b> in <b>Measurement</b> issued by the International Organization for Standardization 1 establishes rules for evaluating and expressing uncertainty. Although it is a very powerful tool 2, it is even more complex when analytical methods include mass transfer steps that lack descriptive models for the behaviour of the analyte in the analytical system. The guide was interpreted for analytical chemistry by EURACHEM, whose second edition 3 already includes the possibility of using interlaboratory information and also the use of information obtained from analytical methods inhouse validation. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Analytical <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> was estimated based on intralaboratory data, studies of precision and analytical process performance, and on contribution of standard stock solution concentration not covered by precision data (bottom-up approach). After estimation of all sources of uncertainty the combined standard uncertainty (uc) was calculated according to their laws of combination 3. The expanded uncertainty (Uc) was calculated as Uc = k uc, where k is the coverage factor 3. This methodology was applied to different food matrices of fruits and vegetables. RESULTS. Relative <b>measurement</b> <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> was mainly between 0. 10 - 0. 31, higher values were found for measurements near instrumental quantification limits (ex. 0. 75 for 8 -cryptoxanthin, and 0. 99 for lutein, in pear) or when sample chromatograms presented interferences with the analyte peak (ex. 0. 44 for;- carotene in orange). Lower relative <b>measurement</b> <b>expanded</b> <b>uncertainty</b> values (0. 028 - 0. 13) were obtained for food matrices not requiring the saponification step. Trueness studies showed good laboratory performance. CONCLUSIONS. Analytical <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of food carotenoid determination was 10 - 30 % of the final result in the great majority of cases. The saponification step should be avoided if food carotenoids are not present in the ester form. Carotenoid values included in Food Composition Data Bases should be expressed taking into account the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> to give correct information on data accuracy. 1 ISO.

The lower level of the working range of the method was determined by the limits of quantification of the individual analytes, and the upper level was equal to 5. 0 μg kg- 1. The limit of detection and quantification of the four PAHs ranged from 0. 06 μg kg- 1 to 0. 12 μg kg- 1 and 0. 13 μg kg- 1 to 0. 24 μg kg- 1. Recoveries of more than 84. 8 % wereachieved for all four PAHs at two concentration levels (2. 5 and 5. 0 μg kg- 1), and <b>expanded</b> relative <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> were below 20 %. The performance of the validated method was in all aspects compliant with provisions set in EU legislation for the performance of {{analytical method}}s employed in the official control of food. The applicability of the method to routine samples was evaluated based on a limited number of commercial edible oil samples. JRC. F. 5 -Food and Feed Complianc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{performance}} of the calibration results obtained by 21 laboratories using digital pressure calibrator as an artifact in the pressure range 7 - 70 MPa. National Physical Laboratory (NPLI), New Delhi has coordinated this programme and also acted as a reference laboratory. The program started in May, 2006 and completed during May, 2008. The comparison was carried out at 10 equally spaced pressure points i. e. 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63 and 70 MPa throughout the entire pressure range of 7 - 70 MPa. The calibration results thus obtained were analyzed as per ISO/IEC GUM document. The 92. 7 % measurement results are found in agreement with the results of NPLI. The relative deviations between laboratories values and reference values are well within the 0. 05 % for 123 measurement points, 0. 1 % for 162 measurement points and 0. 25 % for 177 measurement points. The difference of the laboratories values with reference values are found almost well within the uncertainty band of the reference values at 68. 0 % measurement results, within their reported expanded uncertainty band at 81. 5 % measurement results and within the combined <b>expanded</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> band at 92. 7 % measurement results. Overall, the results are considered to be reasonably good being the first proficiency testing for most of the participating laboratories...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} film {{thickness}} standards have been developed, manufactured and investigated - for X-ray reflectometry (XRR), X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRR), electron probe microanalysis (EMPA) {{on the one}} hand, and ellipsometry on the other. Metrological characterisation of both specific kinds of material measures and investigation results achieved are reported. The standards for XRR, XRF, EMPA consist of quarts substrate coated with Pt resp. a C-Ni-C-layer-system with a nominal metal layers thickness of 10 nm alternatively 50 nm. An established process for manufacture of X-ray mirrors was used for coating. XRR {{proved to be the}} dominant investigation method. Apart from film thickness characteristics like film thickness variances, interdiffusion between substrate and film have been analysed. In conclusion it can be estimated that the <b>expanded</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of the film thickness for XRR applications is less than 0. 5 nm. The standards for calibration of ellipsometer used for film thickness determination consist of an S i-substrate and an SiO 2 -film. They are provided with an additional topographic structure making a topographic film thickness determination (approximately) possible. The nominal values of film thicknesses are between 6 nm and 900 nm. Film thickness determinations were effected by XRR, Scanning Force Microscopy in combination with Transmission Electron Microscopy as well as various ellipsometrical t echniques. The consistency of results found by different measurement techniques is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of the {{proficiency}} testing (PT) accomplished for 17 laboratories, accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration of Laboratories (NABL). The measurements were performed in the pressure range 10 - 70 MPa using pressure dial gauge as an artifact. Only laboratories having best measurement capabilities 0. 25 % or coarser than 0. 25 % of full-scale pressure were included in this PT. The program started in May 2006 and completed during October, 2007. The comparison was carried out at 10 arbitrarily chosen pressure points i. e. 10, 20, 30, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 MPa. The results thus obtained show that out of the total 159 measurement results, 135 (84. 91 %) are found in good agreement with {{the results of}} the reference laboratory. The relative deviations between laboratories values and reference values are well within 0. 15 % for 75 measurement points, 0. 25 % for 108 measurement points and 0. 50 % for 148 measurement points. The difference of the laboratories values with reference values are found almost well within the uncertainty band of the reference values at 71. 07 % measurement results, within their reported expanded uncertainty band at 62. 26 % measurement results and within the combined <b>expanded</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> band at 84. 91 % measurement results.

In calibration reports, {{the magnitude of}} the uncertainty is often taken as an indication {{of the quality of the}} laboratory, and smaller uncertainty values generally are of higher value and of higher cost. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has produced a suite of standards addressing various aspects of <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> ASME B89.7.3.1, Guidelines for Decision Rules in Determining Conformance to Specifications addresses the role of <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> when accepting or rejecting products based on a measurement result and a product specification. ASME B89.7.3.2, Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dimensional <b>Measurement</b> <b>Uncertainty,</b> provides a simplified approach (relative to the GUM) to the evaluation of dimensional <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> ASME B89.7.3.3, Guidelines for Assessing the Reliability of Dimensional <b>Measurement</b> <b>Uncertainty</b> Statements, examines how to resolve disagreements over {{the magnitude of the}} <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> statement. ASME B89.7.4, <b>Measurement</b> <b>Uncertainty</b> and Conformance Testing: Risk Analysis, provides guidance on the risks involved in any product acceptance/rejection decision.|$|R
40|$|Abstract − This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} a <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> assessment guideline applicable to laboratory assessors. <b>Measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is a relevant subject for all laboratories as well as for accreditation bodies since it consists in an elementary requirement for ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation. Therefore, it is crucial to assure that all technical assessors have an adequate level of knowledge about <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and know how to proper assess it. Researching the literature, it is possible to observe that all <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> guidelines are focused on the laboratory perspective, to help them implement GUM’s concepts. This work, on the other hand, was focused on {{the implementation of a}} new <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> guideline intended exclusively to help laboratory assessors improve their knowledge about this subject and better prepare them to carry out laboratory assessments. The guideline was implemented in Rede Metrológica RS (RMRS), a regional accreditation body from southern Brazil. Simultaneously to this <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> assessment guideline, it was also prepared a <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> check-list to help assessors conduct their laboratory assessments. As a result, an improvement on the level of knowledge about <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> was observed among RMRS assessors. The improvement was possible to verify through the application of written exams about <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> before and after the training on the new guideline. Exams showed the improvement of assessors’ knowledge, demonstrating the relevance of this innovative work...|$|R
