50|$|Particular <b>information</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>reproduction</b> of G. abbotti is scarce. Gonocephalus dragons {{in general}} are seldom bred in captivity. The {{majority}} of the dragons {{are caught in the}} wild. Most of the Gonocephalus species can breed year around and are also considered territorial lizards. Therefore, it is recommended to only have one or a pair if kept as a pet. They are egg laying lizards producing approximately one to seven eggs. The better condition the female is in, the more eggs she can lay. They reproduce sexually and reach sexual maturity from the ages of two to three. It is typical in Gonocephalus that the male is larger than the female. Also, the male can be reddish-brown to green, whereas the females and juveniles are typically green (Langerwerf, 2006, pp. 105-109).|$|E
40|$|The {{available}} <b>information</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>reproduction,</b> ontogeny, behavioral {{patterns and}} social relationships in all species of extant and some extinct were analysed cladistically. The character set was optimized on the phylogeny of the Hominoidea, {{and the particular}} common ancestors were reconstructed. The study reveals that all common ancestors (excluding the common ancestor of Pan spp.) showed more or less gorilla-like patterns of behavior and social system. The major outcome {{of this study is}} the finding that humans, despite universal assumptions, are (in terms of behavior and sociobiology) rather slightly derived gorillas than substantially derived chimpanzees...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{monograph}} was {{to prepare}} the text portion of the topic ornamental grasses, outline their origins, {{to deal with the}} selected properties of grasses, whether environmental, horticultural or compositional. Furthermore, the search for <b>information</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>reproduction,</b> significance and possible recommendations on the use of grasses. Drafted was both a literary review, and the results of the discussions that are new valuable for practical application. At selected model areas were conducted annual observations in the 14 -day interval in 100 selected taxa of ornamental grasses in order to evaluate the properties of selected grasses on which there has been redefined and graphic arts habitual types. Results and discussion therefore engaged a total of five subchapters. The first is the phenology ornamental grasses, as well as evaluation of selected properties of grasses, habitual types of ornamental grasses, compositionally interesting combination of ornamental grasses with other horticultural plant groups and recommendations for the use of ornamental grasses in practice. The author has created a work based on the annual observation of ornamental grasses valuable material, which in this way has not yet been processed. Growth and development phases are highly traceable, based on photographs taken on their own, which is part of taxa cards. At the end, the author generalized conclusions {{based on the results of}} chapters and discussion...|$|E
40|$|The {{freshwater}} crayfish Cherax quaricarinatus has been recently introduced {{in several countries}} world-wide. From a practical point of view {{there is a growing}} interest in the biology of this species. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of scientific <b>information</b> <b>concerning</b> the <b>reproduction</b> of this species and the effects of environmental factors which occur during ovarian maturation (Sagi et al., 1996). In tropical crustacean species, the reproduction cycle is very short compared to the European crayfish native species and it occurs several times per year [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In their {{comprehensive}} {{treatment of}} the bats of Trinidad, Goodwin and Greenhall (1961) reported 58 species from the island. Subsequent authors (Goodwin and Greenhall, 1962, 1964; Genoways et al., 1973 a; LaVal, 1973 a, 1973 b) have added some species to the list and changed the status of others so that the known chiropteran fauna of Trinidad now comprises 64 species: five emballonurids, one noctilionid, four mormoopids, 36 phyllostomids (see Handley, 1980, for family-group names), one natalid, one furipterid, one thyropterid, seven vespertilionids, and eight molossids. Among the phyllostomids, the subfamilies Phyllostominae (15) and Stenodermatinae (14) are the best represented, whereas only a few species {{of the other three}} subfamilies Glossophaginae (four), Carolliinae (one), and Desmodontinae (two) -are present. In this paper, we report additional data on 55 species. These data add to the available <b>information</b> <b>concerning</b> distribution, <b>reproduction,</b> and molt. Where appropriate, we have included taxonomic comments on the status of Trinidadian populations. Material reported here is the result of three collecting trips to Trinidad led by R. J. Baker...|$|R
