40|$|AbstractThe {{presented}} paper {{describes the}} experimental determination of fatigue crack growth parameters for <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>low-alloy</b> <b>steel</b> 42 CrMo 4. The experiments were performed {{according to the}} ASTM E 647 standard and {{the parameters of the}} Paris equation (C and m) were determined. Test specimens were subjected to impulsive cyclic tensile loading on a testing machine. During that the fatigue crack propagation was monitored as a function of elapsed fatigue cycles. Taking these experimental results into account the fatigue crack growth rates at different stress-intensity factor ranges was determined. To consider the variable material properties of the slewing bearing ring trough depth, specimens of different hardnesses were tested. Beside the experimental result a 2 D contact fatigue crack propagation model is also presented. This model can be used for the simulation of surface initiated contact fatigue crack propagation on the roller slewing bearing’s raceway. As a computational example the results of a finite element method contact fatigue crack propagation simulation are presented...|$|E

In this technique, a sample {{is supported by}} a holder which is ultrasonically decoupled from the sample. A pulsed laser is used to generate an acoustic pulse. After the pulse has mode converted and scattered sufficiently to fully insonify the sample, the decrease in the noise-like ultrasonic signal is recorded as a function of time using a laser-interferometer. A joint time 2 ̆ 013 frequency analysis technique is used to extract an absorption spectrum from the signal. In this paper, the technique is demonstrated in a frequency bandwidth ranging from 1 to 7 MHz, and in a dynamic range of 0. 003 to 0. 3 dB 3 ̆bcs 2 ̆ 2121.

40|$|Medium {{carbon steel}} {{structural}} grades {{of the hot}} rolled plates and sheets are commonly used for deep drawing applications [1]. Cracking on the bend faces of steel is a major defect, which usually causes rejection of the sufficient volumes of steel. Crack resistance during deep drawing, depends of multiple metallurgical factors. Some of these parameters are: steel chemistry and thickness, microstructure and cleanliness, strength level and degree of restraint, etc. In some cases, cracks also initiated, upon bending a sheared or burned edge. Usually this is not considered as a fault of the steel, but rather {{a function of the}} induced cold work or heat-affected zone [2, 3]. Article present results of susceptibility to cracking, on medium carbon mechanically capped (MCD), and silicon semi-killed (SSK) grades of hot rolled Q_BOP steel in gages up to 0. 5 " (12. 5 mm), shipped as coils or plates, processed through the heavy gage shear line (HGSL) or Temper Mill. SAMPLING PROCEDURE To characterize steel susceptibility to cracking, samples of processed plates were collected from the outside, inside and middle wrap of the processed coils.

40|$|Nitriding {{and shot}} peening are surface {{treatments}} widely {{used to improve}} the fatigue strength of mechanical and structural components. Both treatments enhance the mechanical properties of the surface layer of material: nitriding mainly by means of chemical transformations and formation of a very hard case, shot peening mainly due to compressive residual stress field in the sub-surface layer of material. The combined application of nitriding and shot peening has not been adequately investigated in literature and the known data do not allow to define a general criterion to assess if and when shot peening application after nitriding can be useful. In this paper the effect of nitriding plus shot peening on fatigue <b>strength</b> of a <b>low-alloy</b> <b>steel</b> is investigated by means of experimental tests carried out on specimens containing a micro-hole, acting as a pre-crack. To analyse {{the role played by}} shot peening induced residual stresses, a series of specimens was heat-treated after shot peening, being the aim the partial removal of residual stresses without strongly modifying the mechanical properties of the surface layer of material. After a critical discussion of the results in terms of residual stress, micro-hardness trend and fatigue strength, an original fracture mechanics based approach is proposed to predict the threshold value of the stress intensity factor of nitrided and shot peened steels.
