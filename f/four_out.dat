50|$|An inside {{straight}} draw, or gutshot draw or belly buster draw, is a {{hand with}} {{four of the}} five cards needed for a straight, but missing one in the middle. For example, 9-x-7-6-5. An inside straight draw has <b>four</b> <b>outs</b> (<b>four</b> cards to fill the missing internal rank). Because straight draws including an ace only have <b>four</b> <b>outs,</b> they are also considered inside straight draws. For example, A-K-Q-J-x or A-2-3-4-x. The probability of catching an out for an inside straight draw is half that of catching an out for an outside straight draw.|$|R

5|$|In June 2010, the EyeTV HD {{product for}} {{recording}} high-definition {{cable and satellite}} programming was introduced. Because cable and satellite signals are encoded, the device must be connected to a tuner from a television provider.

A review in Laptop Magazine gave EyeTV HD 3.5 out of 5 stars. It said the interface was intuitive and the video quality was good, but noted it was only compatible with Macs.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with <b>four</b> <b>out</b> of eight US cases at peace. Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
