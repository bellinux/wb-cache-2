50|$|<b>Enilospirone</b> (CERM-3,726) is a {{selective}} 5-HT1A receptor agonist of the azapirone class.|$|E
50|$|The anxiolytics {{are also}} {{classified}} as azapirones {{due to the}} azaspirodecanedione moiety in their structures. 1-PP is a common metabolite of {{most or all of}} the listed agents. Alnespirone, binospirone, and <b>enilospirone,</b> despite being azapirones, are not piperazines and therefore do not metabolize to 1-PP, and while perospirone and tiospirone are piperazines, they are instead benzothiazole-substituted piperazines and do not metabolize to 1-PP either.|$|E
