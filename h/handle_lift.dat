40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>lifting</b> boxes without <b>handles,</b> pulling long distances, {{carrying}} dif-ferent size boxes, combining three <b>handling</b> tasks, and <b>lifting</b> with extended hor-izontal reach were studied using a psychophysical methodology. Six male indus-trial workers performed 42 variations of lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling, and carrying tasks. <b>Lifting</b> boxes without <b>handles</b> produced consistent decreases (me-dian, 16 %) in maximum acceptable weights {{when compared with}} <b>lifting</b> boxes with <b>handles.</b> <b>Lifting</b> with extended horizontal reach (approximately 48 cm) pro-duced consistent decreases (median, 48 %) in maximum acceptable weights when compared with lifting close to the body (approximately 17 cm). No significant heart rate or oxygen consumption differences occurred in either of these variables. No significant differences in maximum acceptable weight of carry were observed among box sizes; however, the maximum acceptable force of pulling was lower for longer (15. 2 m) pulling tasks. The maximum acceptable weight for combination tasks {{was similar to that}} of the limiting component...|$|R

40|$|Exposure to {{vibration}} both {{hand-arm vibration}} (HAV) and whole-body vibration (WBV) involves mechanical energy {{transferred to the}} human body. These mechanical oscillations also cause noise. Thus workers exposed to vibrations are also exposed to noise. Furthermore workers exposed to WBV and HAV are often simultaneously exposed to other ergonomic stressors, such as awkward postures and manual material <b>handling</b> (<b>lifting)</b> [1]. In {{a study of the}} Swedish workforce from a survey conducted in 1999, 2001 and 2003 by Statistics Sweden, we found that when the exposure factors lifting and frequent bending were added to a multivariate analysis, there was surprisingly a low magnitude of association between low back symptoms and whole body vibration exposure [2]. Interestingly, the relation between whole body vibratio...|$|R

60|$|When, at length, it was full, he {{took hold}} of the <b>handles,</b> and <b>lifted</b> away upon it. He found it very heavy. He made another desperate effort, and succeeded in raising it from the ground a little; but unluckily, as wheelbarrows are very apt to do when the load is too heavy for the workman, it tipped down to one side, and, though Rollo exerted all his {{strength}} to save it, it was in vain.|$|R

50|$|A rigid chain actuator, known {{variously}} as {{a linear}} chain actuator, push-pull chain actuator, electric chain actuator or column-forming chain actuator, is a specialized mechanical linear actuator used in window operating, push-pull material <b>handling</b> and <b>lift</b> applications. The actuator is a chain and pinion device that forms an articulated telescoping member to transmit traction and thrust. High-capacity rigid chain lifting columns (jacks) can move dynamic loads exceeding 10 tonnes (US 20,000 pounds) {{over more than}} 7 metres (20 feet) of travel.|$|R

5000|$|... "Selectorized" [...] {{dumbbells}} are adjustable dumbbells whose {{number of}} plates (i.e. weight) {{can be easily}} changed when resting in the dumbbell stand. This is achieved by adjusting the number of plates that follow the <b>handle</b> when <b>lifted,</b> e.g. by turning a dial or moving a selector pin — rather than manually adding or removing plates. This makes it very easy to change {{the weight of the}} dumbbell between exercises, and the stand typically doubles as storage for the additional weights not being used for a particular exercise.|$|R
40|$|Background: Self-reported {{low back}} pain (LBP) has been {{evaluated}} in relation to material <b>handling</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks, but little {{research has focused on}} relating quantifiable stressors to LBP at the individual level. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Composite Lifting Index (CLI) has been used to quantify stressors for lifting tasks. A chemical exposure can be readily used as an exposure metric or stressor for chemical risk assessment (RA). Defining and quantifying lifting nonchemical stressors and related adverse responses is more difficult. Stressor–response models appropriate for CLI and LBP associations do not easily fit in common chemical RA modeling techniques (e. g., Benchmark Dose methods), so different approaches were tried. Methods: This work used prospective data from 138 manufacturing workers to consider the linkage of the occupational stressor of material lifting to LBP. The final model used a Bayesian random threshold approach to estimate the probability of an increase in LBP as a threshold step function. Results: Using maximal and mean CLI values, {{a significant increase in the}} probability of LBP for values above 1. 5 was found. Conclusion: A risk of LBP associated with CLI values> 1. 5 existed in this worker population. The relevance for other populations requires further study...|$|R
