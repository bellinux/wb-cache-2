During the following day seventy suspects were rounded up, but no evidence of their involvement could be found. In response to the attack, the British imposed a road curfew from 18:00 to 06:00 each night and all cafes, restaurants and public entertainment venues in Tel Aviv were closed between 20:00 and 05:00. However this was not enough for {{some members of the}} division, who attacked Jewish houses in Qastina and Be'er Tuvia, injuring some of the occupants. Those involved were later punished by the British Army.|$|E

25|$|No.107 Squadron's patrols were {{intensified}} {{after the}} German submarine U-862 sank the American Liberty Ship Robert J. Walker off Moruya on 25December 1944. The squadron flew five sorties {{a day for}} the next week in search of the submarine. On 29December one of the squadron's Kingfishers attacked what its pilot believed was a submarine periscope near the point at which Robert J. Walker had been sunk. However, by this time U-862 was in the Tasman Sea near New Zealand. This was the only <b>deliberate</b> <b>attack</b> made by a RAAF Kingfisher during the war.|$|E
25|$|The stings are {{not part}} of a <b>deliberate</b> <b>attack,</b> but are mainly the result of {{brushing}} against the spines. However, many species whose larvae are armed with such hairs have behavioral patterns adapted to present the urticating hairs as a defensive threat and to inflict them on any perceived attackers. For example, many larvae in the family Lasiocampidae bear dense bands of short stinging hairs across their thoracic segments. The hairs are normally retracted into a shallow fold in the skin, but if the caterpillar is disturbed, it everts the folds and displays the hairs, which are usually of a contrasting color.|$|E

In August, another staff member, 65-year-old Frank Lane, who had also worked at the zoo since its opening like Barnett, was killed in a much publicised accident. Lane had just fed a young elephant, Kassala, and was climbing back through the rails between the stalls when Jamuna swung her trunk knocking him into the wall and killing him instantly. Barnett had been Jamuna's regular keeper and it was reported she had been upset since his death.

25|$|The Yemen {{civil war}} has {{resulted}} in a severe lack of food and vegetation. Agricultural production in the country has suffered substantially leaving Yemen to face the threat of Famine. Yemen is currently under blockade by land, sea and air which has disrupted the delivery of many of the countries resources. In country where 90% of the food requirements are met through imports this blockade has had serious consequences concerning the availability of food to its citizens. It is reported that out of the population of 24 million in Yemen, everyday 13 million are going hungry and 6 million are at risk of starvation. Contributing to this scarcity in food is the <b>deliberate</b> <b>attack</b> on the country’s agricultural resources. According to reports there is strong evidence suggesting that Yemen’s agricultural sector is being deliberately destroyed, exacerbating the food shortage and leaving the country dependent solely on imports to meet the food requirements of its citizens.|$|E

25|$|After {{the failure}} to capture Tobruk off the march, Comando Supremo and OKW agreed that Tobruk should be {{captured}} and supplies accumulated, before the advance into Egypt was resumed. Rommel thought that Tobruk could only be taken by a <b>deliberate</b> <b>attack,</b> which could not begin until support units {{had arrived in the}} area and the Luftwaffe had been reinforced, particularly with transport aircraft to carry ammunition, fuel and water. On 27 April, Major-General Friedrich Paulus a Deputy Chief of the General Staff, arrived from Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) in Berlin, to question Rommel on his intentions, impress on him that there was little more help available and to forecast the defensive possibilities of the area, if Sollum was lost. Paulus refused to allow an attack planned for 30 April, until he had studied the situation and on 29 April, allowed the attack to go ahead, as did Gariboldi who had arrived on 28 April. Nothing more ambitious than securing the Axis hold on the Egyptian frontier, from Siwa Oasis north to Sollum was envisaged.|$|E

The Squadron suffered increasing casualties as the battle wore on. Squadron Leader Badger baled out on 30 August wounded and later died on 30 June 1941. On 7 September 1940 Frank was lunching with other pilots at Tangmere's mess that afternoon while the Adjutant took pictures of the semi-formal gathering sitting in deck chairs and drinking from tankards. That same after noon, Caesar Hull and two other pilots were killed when the Luftwaffe began its first <b>deliberate</b> <b>attack</b> on London, initiating The Blitz. Morale sank and the squadron was sent north to Newcastle to rest on 8 September. Thomas Dalton-Morgan took command of 43 Squadron at Newcastle and Carey flew again {{for the first time}} on 23 September 1940 and was promoted to Flight commander, but the squadron remained in the north until the end of the Battle of Britain in October 1940.

500|$|The BBC's own website {{regarded}} Quatermass II unfavourably when reviewing its DVD {{release in}} 2005. [...] "The script {{is too often}} let down by the production's rougher edges. Your heart will break halfway through episode six as it all falls apart. And then there's Monica Gray [...] — less an actress than a finishing school on legs." [...] Writing in The Times in 2006, Morgan Falconer claimed to find racist undertones in the serial. [...] "Quatermass, for instance, often seemed to have an unhealthy preoccupation with blackness, a barely veiled commentary on racial change in Britain. In one scene in Quatermass II, the Professor stands outside a pub and watches the sky fill with dark asteroids. 'They’re coming in their thousands,' he says, 'this is it.'" [...] However, this interpretation of the serial is not widespread, and is undermined in episode five where an Irish immigrant helps Quatermass sabotage the aliens' food supply system.

40|$|Introduction BGP, {{the current}} inter-domain routing protocol, is a {{critical}} piece responsible for {{the functioning of the}} Internet. Two essential components which are missing from BGP are: security and predictability. Lack of Security: BGP's resilience against attack is essential for the security of the Internet. BGP currently enables peers to transmit route announcements over authenticated channels, so that adversaries cannot impersonate the legitimate sender of a route announcement. This approach, which verifies who is speaking but not what they say, leaves the current infrastructure extremely vulnerable to both unintentional misconfigurations and <b>deliberate</b> <b>attacks.</b> While misconfigurations are a known occurrence, routers are surprisingly vulnerable to deliberate attackers.

500|$|Attached to US forces, 1 RAR would {{primarily}} {{be employed}} in search and destroy operations using the newly developed doctrine of airmobile operations, utilising helicopters to insert light infantry and artillery into an area of operations, and to support them with aerial mobility, fire support, casualty evacuation, and resupply. The battalion commenced operations in late June 1965 and initially focussed on defeating the Viet Cong's wet season offensive. During this time US 173rd Brigade, including 1 RAR, conducted a number of operations into War Zone D—a major communist base area at the junction of Phuoc Long, Long Khanh, Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces—as {{well as in the}} Iron Triangle, formed by the confluence of the Saigon and Thi Tinh rivers and Route 7, where they fought a number of significant actions including the Battle of Gang Toi on 8 November. Meanwhile, Brumfield was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece, after an old football injury forced his evacuation to Australia in mid-November. During the period 21 November to 16 December 1 RAR was involved in Operation New Life in the La Nga Valley, [...] north-east of Bien Hoa in an attempt to deny the Viet Cong access to the rice harvest. On 24 November D Company, 1 RAR carried out a <b>deliberate</b> <b>attack</b> on the fortified village of Duc Hanh which had been occupied by the Viet Cong, killing 10 and wounding four without loss.

As planned, at 07:00, 3 RAR was ordered to move through Yongju towards Sukchon to link up with US 187 RCT and close the gap between the two forces. C Company, 3 RAR under Captain Archer Denness subsequently passed through the burning town mounted on M4 Sherman tanks from D Company, US 89th Tank Battalion. Now leading the brigade, at 09:00 the Australians came under small arms and light mortar fire from a North Korean rearguard position in an apple orchard on their right flank, having moved just [...] The Australians had driven into the rear of the North Korean 239th Regiment as it was forming up for a final assault on US 3/187 RCT. The strong North Korean force of approximately 1,000 men subsequently allowed C Company, 3 RAR and the battalion's tactical headquarters group to pass before engaging them. The North Korean-held features lay between the advancing Australians and the American paratroopers, blocking any relief attempt. Yet rather than preparing a <b>deliberate</b> <b>attack</b> and potentially allowing the North Koreans time to organise their defences, Green chose to force his leading company through at once in order to seize the initiative and continue the pursuit.

The network planner selects the new lines to be built accounting for the vulnerability of the transmission network against a set of credible intentional outages. The vulnerability of the transmission network is measured in terms of the expected load shed. An instance of the previously reported terrorist threat problem is solved to generate the set of credible <b>deliberate</b> <b>attacks.</b> The proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program for which efficient solvers are available. Results from a case study based on the IEEE Two Area Reliability Test System are provided and analyzed.
