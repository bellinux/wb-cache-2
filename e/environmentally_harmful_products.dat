40|$|A price-setting {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate whether a proposed governmental subsidy system to reduce sales and production of <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>products</b> would maintain competition, as required by EU regulations. Dyads of participants {{played the role of}} producers, independently setting unit prices for their products in a sequence of trials with feedback. In experimental conditions a subsidy was paid for unsold units, a system which had previously been found to raise prices and reduce the number of units sold. For half of the dyads in each condition the payoffs were individual, in the other half they were split equally to motivate cooperation. Substantiating that the subsidy did not eliminate competition, the prices were set lower and incomes were lower when the payoffs were individual than when they were split equally. The participants also adjusted their prices to increase their own payoff, taking into account the prices set by the others when the payoffs were individual—which they did not when the payoffs were split equally. The results support the claim that the proposed subsidy system is effective in raising prices so that sales and production of <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>products</b> can be reduced without eliminating competition. ...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{turbine engines}} {{are widely used}} to provide {{propulsion}} in aircraft and for power generation on land and sea. Currently, engine manufacturers are working to reduce the emission of <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmful</b> combustion <b>products</b> by operating these engines under lean conditions (with more air than is needed for complete combustion). However, such operating conditions can make the combustion process unstable, resulting in large, potentially damaging pressure and heat release oscillations, which need to be understood. This project is aimed at improving our understanding of this unstable process by making experimental measurements in a model annular combustor (modern gas turbines almost exclusively use annular architecture). The thesis work involves controlling a number of loudspeakers and the analysis of pressure measurements (using LabVIEW and MATLAB) to determine the modes and amplitudes of oscillation in an annular combustion chamber. The thesis therefore {{is a mix of}} experimental, analytical and computational work. Recent research has shown that combustion instabilities in annular combustion chambers can lead to a mixture of standing and spinning azimuthal modes. The nature of these modes is not yet fully understood. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the excitation of standing, spinning and mixed modes in a cold, flow-less combustion chamber and {{to gain a better understanding}} of their nature. Moderate control over the sound field in the annular system is demonstrated in the present work. While the excitation of standing waves is relatively simple, spinning modes could only partially be generated. It should be pointed out, however, that the methods applied seem to be promising if explored further and refined...|$|R

40|$|A multi-trial duopoly price-setting {{game was}} used to {{investigate}} the potential effectiveness of a subsidy system aimed at reducing sales and thereby production of <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>products.</b> In real life it is however likely that a subsidy level will never remain fixed, either nominally or in real value. Producers may also have unreliable perceptions of the subsidy level {{even if it does}} not change. Therefore, a subsidy, either fixed and known, varying randomly, or varying systematically across trials, was investigated. The results showed that both fixed and known, as well as varying subsidy levels led to higher prices and thus reduced sales compared to without a subsidy. Knowledge of a fixed subsidy level or expectations about a subsidy level based on previous trials, appeared to make participants refrain from setting lower prices than the subsidy level. Furthermore, the results indicated that participants attempted to maximize their profit by selling to the lowest price, thus they stayed competitive and did not exploit the subsidy...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} effects of an {{environmental}} policy, with the focus on producers’ decision making, which {{may be used as}} a means to decrease the production of <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>products.</b> A subsidy system reimbursing a reduction in sales and/or production is with this aim experimentally investigated by simulating a market. In Study I, a price competition between pairs of participants was designed to test effects of a high and a low level of a subsidy, as compared to no subsidy. It was shown that the subsidy led to higher prices and reduced sales, and also inhibited the start of price wars. The results were dependent on the level of the subsidy, suggesting that participants used the subsidy and the opponent’s previous price as reference values to guide their behavior. Increased risk taking and/or risk aversion may also have influenced the participants’ behavior. In Study II, an experiment was performed to determine whether the subsidy decreased competition. The results showed that participants in competitive conditions did not behave collusive or cooperatively and that the effects f the subsidy were the same, yielding increased prices and reduced sales. Since EU prohibits coalitions or cartels {{it is important that the}} subsidy system reduced prices and sales while preserving cometitiveness. To test the hypothesis that a subsidy makes participants more risk taking, in Study III additional experiments were performed focusing on individual production decisions with certain (subsidy) or uncertain sales outcomes. The results showed that participants displayed inconsistent risk taking in that they preferred to diversify between a risky saes prospect and a guaranteed subsidy. Diversifying alternatives were thus rated as more preferable and more attractive, despite not maximizing expected values. The results are explained by that participants make trade‐offs between certainty ‐ a guaranteed outcome, and a potential ‐ the highest possible outcome. Taken together, this thesis suggests that although there is a need for refinements and additional studies of the subsidy system, the results are promising in showing that introducing certainty in decision making under uncertainty may be used as part of a echanism to influence producers to reduce production of <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>products.</b> Keywords: Certainty, Environmental Policy, Experiment, Individual Decision Making, Interdependent Decision Making, Risk Taking, Subsidy, Uncertaint...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{comparative analysis}} of environmental funds in Belarus and the Republic of Moldova {{based on the}} results of the Environmental Performance Reviews of the two countries. Environmental Funds in the two countries have a very different structure of their revenues. In Belarus, majority of revenues come from the pollution charges. In the Republic of Moldova, pollution charges constitute only a small part of the total revenues of the Fund, while tax on imported fuel and the tax on <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>products</b> are the main sources. Expenditures from the funds in the two countries suffer from similar problems. Among those are lack of clear priorities, insufficient transparency of the process of project selection, frequent absence of assessment of the environmental and other benefits of accomplished projects and their cost-effectiveness. Insufficient capacity of the management staff of the funds, particularly at the local level, is one of the main reasons for these problems. However, environmental funds play important role in solving environmental problems. The paper outlines recommendations for their improvement in both countries using both international and domestic experience. When you are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|E

40|$|With {{the global}} community's growing {{awareness}} of the need for environmental protection, a significant number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) have been created. Some among them mandate or allow the parties to impose trade-restrictive measures for environmental purposes, such as for regulating international trade in <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>products</b> and endangered species, for eliminating economic incentives that encourage environmentally destructive activities, or for ensuring member compliance with and encouraging non-member accession to the MEAs. However, when a trade restrictive measure under a certain MEA is imposed by one World Trade Organization (WTO) member against another, it raises a question about consistency with relevant WTO agreements, regardless of whether the targeted WTO member is a party to the MEA. So far, no specific case concerning WTO consistency of a trade restrictive measure under an MEA has been brought to the WTO dispute settlement proceedings. However, such a case is quite likely to occur in the future with the increasing usage of the kinds of measures mentioned above. Based on this concern, the "relationship between existing WTO rules and specific trade obligations set out in MEAs" has been included in the agenda for the Doha Round negotiations under the WTO (Doha Development Agenda). When such a case goes to the WTO dispute settlement proceedings, what status should be given to the MEA in question? Is it a valid scenario for WTO panels and the Appellate Body to give priority to a specific MEA over WTO agreements in accordance with the MEA's conflict of law rules or public international law, thereby confirming the WTO consistency of trade restrictive measures under that MEA? Academics have discussed at length whether MEAs and other non-WTO international law can become the applicable law in the WTO dispute settlement proceedings. This paper considers this problem by comparing and analyzing in detail the arguments of Joost Pauwelyn (Duke University Faculty of Law), who affirmatively answers this problem and of Joel Trachtman (The Fletcher School, Tufts University) who answers negatively. From the perspective of supporting the coherence of international law, this paper concludes by siding with Pauwelyn's argument. ...|$|E
