25|$|The Battle of the Nablus Plain {{ranks with}} Ludendorff's Black Days of the German Army in {{the effect that}} it had on the {{consciousness}} of the Turkish General Staff. It was now apparent to all but the most diehard nationalists that the Turks were finished in the war. In spite of the great victories in Armenia and in Azerbaijan, Turkey was now in an indefensible condition, which could not be remedied with the resources on hand. It was also apparent that the disintegration of the Bulgarian Army at Salonika and the dissolution of the Austro–Hungarian Army spelled disaster and defeat for the Central Powers. <b>From</b> <b>now</b> <b>until</b> the Armistice, the focus of the Turkish strategy would be to retain as much Ottoman territory as possible.|$|E

500|$|... "All the Lovers" [...] was {{acclaimed}} {{by music}} critics and fans alike. Fraser McAlpine from BBC Chart Blog rated the single {{five out of}} five stars and applauded its chorus, calling it a [...] "dancing/crying/loving feeling [...] applied to everyone in a universal gesture of affection and regret." [...] The critic praised the electropop influences of the song and Minogue's vocal delivery. Nick Levine from Digital Spy also rewarded [...] "All the Lovers" [...] a perfect five-star score and called it a [...] "shimmering midtempo electro-disco tune with a lovely arms-in-the-air chorus." [...] He found the song similar to [...] "I Believe in You". Entertainment Weekly critic Adam Markovitz opined that [...] "All the Lovers" [...] was not a [...] "full-on dance track production-wise", but predicted the song would attain [...] "near-ubiquity in gyms, gay clubs, and clothing stores." [...] Robbie Daw from Idolator felt its production stayed true to Minogue's roots, labelling the song [...] "100% pure Kylie", and found it comparable to [...] "I Believe in You." [...] Daily Mirror critic Gavin Martin gave [...] "All the Lovers" [...] a {{four out of five}} rating and complimented the song's production and mixing, saying they [...] "ensure Kylie's pint-size pop queen status is consolidated." [...] Martin also enjoyed Minogue's [...] "generously sensual" [...] vocal performance. Chris Ryan from MTV Buzzworthy termed the song [...] "classic Kylie", praising its subtle production and the chorus for being [...] "ecstatic, breathtaking." [...] MuuMuse editor Bradley Stern commended Minogue's breathy delivery and felt that its instrumentation and Minogue's vocals were reminiscent of [...] "I Believe in You". Stern rated it five out of five stars and concluded that [...] " [...] a sing-along track, it's sad disco, it's everything you've been waiting for." [...] The Popjustice review of the song was also positive; they pointed out that it would please fans of the singer and become the [...] "sound of dancefloor stampedes <b>from</b> <b>now</b> <b>until</b> the end of time" [...] due to its mature style. Rob Harvilla from The Village Voice wrote that the song features Minogue at her peak form and labelled it a [...] "pleasingly vapid synth-cheese jam." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{official}} release of Destiny in September 2014, Bungie declared that {{a major component of}} the game would be a continuous release of new content. Bungie Director of Production Jonty Barnes said: [...] "We're going to continuously update the game <b>from</b> <b>now</b> <b>until</b> the end of time. That's always {{going to be part of}} the philosophy of Destiny. We always wanted to build a new universe but keep building upon it, rather than to do a complete and utter restart periodically." [...] By the time of Destinys launch, two planned packs of downloadable content (DLC) had been officially announced: The Dark Below and House of Wolves. From the launch of Destiny, players could purchase the Destiny Expansion Pass, which included the first two expansions at a discounted price versus buying them separately. Players also received an exclusive sparrow (EV-30 Tumbler) if they purchased the Expansion Pass or The Dark Below by January 15, 2015. At E3 2015, Bungie officially announced a new expansion called The Taken King. A new, large expansion was confirmed in February 2016; its title, , was revealed in June 2016.|$|E

6000|$|At {{the first}} hospital, whither he was {{immediately}} carried, {{they said it}} was a rupture, reduced the swelling, gave him some vaseline to rub on it, kept him four hours, and told him to get along. But he was not on the streets {{more than two or three}} hours when he was down on his back again. This time he went to another hospital and was patched up. But the point is, the employer did nothing, positively nothing, for the man injured in his employment, and even refused him [...] "a light job now and again," [...] when he came out. As far as Ginger is concerned, he is a broken man. His only chance to earn a living was by heavy work. He is now incapable of performing heavy work, and <b>from</b> <b>now</b> <b>until</b> he dies, the spike, the peg, and the streets are all he can look forward to in the way of food and shelter.

60|$|La Fayette {{had called}} the huge giant of popular force from its squalid lurking-places, and now he trembled before its presence, and fled from it shrieking, with averted hands. Marat thrust swords into the giant's half-unwilling grasp, and plied him with bloody {{incitement}} to slay hip and thigh, and so filled the land with a horror that has not faded from out of men's minds to this day. Danton instantly discerned that the problem was to preserve revolutionary energy, and still to persuade the insurgent forces to retire once more within their boundaries. Robespierre discerned this too, but he was paralysed and bewildered by his own principles, as the convinced doctrinaire is so apt to be amid the perplexities of practice. The teaching of Rousseau was ever pouring like thin smoke among his ideas, and clouding his view of actual conditions. The Tenth of August produced a considerable change in Robespierre's point of view. It awoke him to the precipitous steepness of the slope down which the revolutionary car was rushing headlong. His faith in the infallibility of the people suffered no shock, {{but he was in}} a moment alive to the need of walking warily, and his whole march <b>from</b> <b>now</b> <b>until</b> the end, twenty-three months later, became timorous, cunning, and oblique. His intelligence seemed to move in subterranean tunnels, with the gleam of an equivocal premiss at one end, and the mist of a vague conclusion at the other.|$|E
6000|$|Although Harry Warrington was {{the least}} envious of men, and did honour to his brother as in all respects his chief, guide, and superior, yet no wonder a certain feeling of humiliation and {{disappointment}} oppressed the young man after his deposition from his eminence as Fortunate Youth and heir to boundless Virginian territories. Our friends at Kensington might promise and vow that they would love him all the better after his fall; Harry made a low bow and professed himself very thankful; {{but he could not}} help perceiving, when he went with his brother to the state entertainment with which my Lord Castlewood regaled his new-found kinsman, that George was all in all to his cousins: had all the talk, compliments, and petits soins for himself, whilst of Harry no one took any notice save poor Maria, who followed him with wistful looks, pursued him with eyes conveying dismal reproaches, and, as it were, blamed him because she had left him. [...] "Ah!" [...] the eyes seemed to say, [...] "'tis mighty well of you, Harry, to have accepted the freedom which I gave you; but I had no intention, sir, that you should be so pleased at being let off." [...] She gave him up, but yet she did not quite forgive him for taking her at her word. She would not have him, and yet she would. Oh, my young friends, how delightful {{is the beginning of a}} love-business, and how undignified, sometimes, the end! What a romantic vista is before young Damon and young Phillis (or middle-aged ditto ditto) when, their artless loves made known to each other, they twine their arms round each other's waists and survey that charming pays du tendre which lies at their feet! Into that country, so linked together, they will wander <b>from</b> <b>now</b> <b>until</b> extreme old age. There may be rocks and roaring rivers, but will not Damon's strong true love enable him to carry Sweetheart over them? There may be dragons and dangers in the path, but shall not his courageous sword cut them down? Then at eve, how they will rest cuddled together, like two pretty babes in the wood, the moss their couch, the stars their canopy, their arms their mutual pillows! This is the wise plan young folks make when they set out on the love journey; and--O me!--they have not got a mile when they come to a great wall and find they must walk back again. They are squabbling with the post-boy at Barnet (the first stage on the Gretna Road, I mean), and, behold, perhaps Strephon has not got any money, or here is papa with a whacking horsewhip, who takes Miss back again, and locks her up crying in the schoolroom. The parting is heart-breaking; but, when she has married the banker and had eight children, and he has become, it may be, a prosperous barrister,--it may be, a seedy raff who has gone twice or thrice into the Gazette; when, I say, in after years Strephon and Delia meet again, is not the meeting ridiculous? Nevertheless, I hope no young man will fall in love, having any doubt in his mind as to the eternity of his passion. 'Tis when a man has had a second or third amorous attack that he begins to grow doubtful; but some women are romantic to the end, and from eighteen to eight-and-fifty (for what I know) are always expecting their hearts to break. In fine, when you have been in love and are so no more, when the King of France, with twenty thousand men, with colours flying, music playing, and all the pomp of war, having marched up the hill, then proceeds to march down again, he and you are in an absurd position.|$|E
