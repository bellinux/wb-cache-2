5000|$|One of {{the most}} often used term in case of network {{security}} and in particular <b>distributed</b> <b>firewall</b> is policy. It is essential to know about policies.

This feature addresses the need to maximize network security resources by enabling policies to be centrally configured, deployed, monitored, and updated. From a single workstation, <b>distributed</b> <b>firewalls</b> can be scanned to understand the current operating policy and to determine if updating is required.|$|R

5000|$|Both {{types of}} {{firewalls}} are excellent at rejecting connection requests for inappropriate services. Conventional firewalls drop the requests at the border; distributed firewalls {{do so at}} the host. A more interesting question is what is noticed by the host attempting to connect. Today, such packets are typically discarded, with no notification. A <b>distributed</b> <b>firewall</b> may choose to discard the packet, {{under the assumption that}} its legal peers know to use IPSEC; alternatively, it may instead send back a response requesting that the connection be authenticated, which in turn gives notice of the existence of the host. Firewalls built on pure packet filters cannot reject some [...] "stealth scans" [...] very well. One technique, for example, uses fragmented packets that can pass through unexamined because the port numbers aren't present in the first fragment. A <b>distributed</b> <b>firewall</b> will reassemble the packet and then reject it. On balance, against this sort of threat the two firewall types are at least comparable.|$|E

50|$|Many {{firewalls}} detect attempted intrusions. If that functionality is to {{be provided}} by a <b>distributed</b> <b>firewall,</b> each individual host has to notice probes and forward them to some central location for processing and correlation. The former problem is not hard; many hosts already log such attempts. One can make a good case that such detection {{should be done in}} any event. Collection is more problematic, especially at times of poor connectivity to the central site. There is also the risk of coordinated attacks in effect causing a denial-of-service attack against the central machine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Distributed</b> <b>firewalls</b> are host-resident {{security}} software applications that protect the enterprise network's servers and end-user machines against unwanted intrusion. They offer {{the advantage of}} filtering traffic from both the Internet and the internal network. This enables them to prevent hacking attacks that originate from both the Internet and the internal network. This is important because the most costly and destructive attacks still originate from within the organization.They are like personal firewalls except they offer several important advantages like central management, logging, and in some cases, access-control granularity. These features are necessary to implement corporate security policies in larger enterprises. Policies can be defined and pushed out on an enterprise-wide basis. A feature of <b>distributed</b> <b>firewalls</b> is centralized management. The ability to populate servers and end-users machines, to configure and [...] "push out" [...] consistent security policies helps to maximize limited resources. The ability to gather reports and maintain updates centrally makes distributed security practical. <b>Distributed</b> <b>firewalls</b> help in two ways. Remote end-user machines can be secured. Secondly, they secure critical servers on the network preventing intrusion by malicious code and [...] "jailing" [...] other such code by not letting the protected server {{be used as a}} launch pad for expanded attacks.|$|R
50|$|Usually {{deployed}} {{behind the}} traditional firewall, {{they provide a}} second layer of defense. They work by enabling only essential traffic into the machine they protect, prohibiting other types of traffic to prevent unwanted intrusions. Whereas the perimeter firewall must take a generalist, common denominator approach to protecting servers on the network, <b>distributed</b> <b>firewalls</b> act as specialists.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Firewall is {{a device}} {{or set of}} {{instruments}} designed to permit or deny network transmissions based upon {{a set of rules}} and regulation is frequently used to protect networks from unauthorized access while permitting legitimate communications to pass or during the sensitive data transmission. <b>Distributed</b> <b>firewalls</b> allow enforcement of security policies on a network without restricting its topology on an inside or outside point of view. Use of a policy language and centralized delegating its semantics to all members of the networks domain support application of firewall technology for organizations, which network devices communicate over insecure channels and still allow a logical separation of hosts in- and outside the trusted domain.

50|$|With {{the spread}} use of {{distributed}} object-oriented systems like CORBA, client-side use of Java and weaknesses in mail readers {{and the like}} {{there is a wide}} variety of threats residing in the application and intermediate level of communication traffic. Firewall mechanisms at the perimeter can come useful by inspecting incoming e-mails for known malicious code fingerprints, but can be confronted with complex, thus resource-consuming situations when making decisions on other code, like Java.Using the framework of a <b>distributed</b> <b>firewall</b> and especially considering a policy language which allows for policy decision on the application level can circumvent some of these problems, under the condition that contents of such communication packets can be interpreted semantically by the policy verifying mechanisms. Stateful inspection of packets shows up to be easily adapted to these requirements and allows for finer granularity in decision making. Furthermore, malicious code contents may be completely disguised to the screening unit at the network perimeter, given the use of virtual private networks and enciphered communication traffic in general and can completely disable such policy enforcement on conventional firewalls.|$|E
30|$|In this context, {{the main}} {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is an architecture for network security based on self-protection, named Self-Adaptive <b>Distributed</b> <b>Firewall</b> (SADF).

30|$|The {{discussion}} on centralized and distributed firewalls {{is well established}} in the literature [2, 18]. One of its first implementation proposals has been presented by Ioannidis [1], in which kernel extensions {{have been developed for}} the OpenBSD distribution, together with a policy definition language (named KeyNote) and use of IPsec for secure traffic amongst the hosts of the network. More recently [19] introduces a <b>distributed</b> <b>firewall</b> system for Linux platform that works upon Iptables/Netfilter for IPv 6 networks with IPsec support. A <b>distributed</b> <b>firewall</b> architecture was proposed in order to improve performance, handling the additional costs of encryption of packages with IPsec.|$|E
50|$|<b>Distributed</b> <b>firewalls</b> are host-resident {{security}} software applications that protect the enterprise network's critical endpoints against unwanted intrusion that is, its servers and end-user machines. In this concept, the security policy is defined centrally and {{the enforcement of}} the policy takes place at each endpoint (hosts, routers, etc.). Usually deployed behind the traditional firewall, they provide a second layer of protection.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{firewall}} architecture that treats port numbers {{as part of}} the IP address.

5000|$|Since all {{the hosts}} {{on the inside}} are trusted equally, {{if any of these}} {{machines}} are subverted, they can be used to launch attacks to other hosts, especially to trusted hosts for protocols like rlogin.

30|$|<b>Distributed</b> <b>firewall</b> systems {{emerged with}} the {{proposal}} of protecting individual hosts against attacks originating {{from inside the}} network. In these systems, firewall rules are centrally created, then distributed and enforced on all servers that compose the firewall, restricting which services will be available. However, this approach lacks protection against software vulnerabilities that can make network services vulnerable to attacks, since firewalls usually do not scan application protocols. In this sense, from the discovery of any vulnerability until the publication and application of patches there is an exposure window that should be reduced. In this context, this article presents Self-Adaptive <b>Distributed</b> <b>Firewall</b> (SADF). Our approach is based on monitoring hosts and using a vulnerability assessment system to detect vulnerable services, integrated with components capable of deciding and applying firewall rules on affected hosts. In this way, SADF can respond to vulnerabilities discovered in these hosts, helping to mitigate the risk of exploiting the vulnerability. Our system was evaluated {{in the context of}} a simulated network environment, where the results achieved demonstrate its viability.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{method for}} {{protecting}} networks {{today is to}} use a firewall: a boundary separating the protected network from the untrusted Internet.

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 A perimeter firewall {{is the first}} line of defense that stops unwanted packets (based on defined firewall policies) entering the organization that deploys it. In the real world, every organization maintains a perimeter firewall between internet (which could be untrusted) and its own network (private network). In addition, organizations maintain internal firewalls to safeguard individual departments and data center servers based on various security and privacy requirements. In general, if we consider firewall setup in multinational organization's network environment, every branch has perimeter firewall and a set of internal firewalls. Every branch has its own security policies defined based on its specific security requirements, type of information, information processing systems, location-based compliance requirements, etc. As the branches of the multinational organizations span across the globe, managing the policies at every branch and ensuring the compliance and consistency of security policies are quite complex. Any misconfiguration of firewall policies even at a single branch may pose risk to the overall organization in terms of financial loss and reputation. In this dissertation, we present our framework to automate the policy management of <b>distributed</b> perimeter <b>firewalls</b> of a multi-national organization. We introduce new categories of policies to support centralized management of <b>distributed</b> <b>firewalls</b> and to ensure consistency and compliance of organizational and location-based policies.

40|$|The <b>distributed</b> <b>firewall</b> is an {{important}} new line of net-work defense. It provides fine-grained access control to augment the protections afforded by the traditional perime-ter firewall. To be effective, though, a <b>distributed</b> <b>firewall</b> must satisfy two critical requirements. First, it must em-brace a protection model that acknowledges that every-thing behind the firewall may not be trustworthy. The mali-cious insider with unobstructed access the network can still mount limited attacks. Second, the firewall must be tamper-resistant. Any firewall that executes on the same untrusted operating system that it is charged to protect begs the ques-tion: who is protecting whom? This paper presents a new distributed, embedded firewall that satisfies both require-ments. The firewall filters Internet Protocol traffic {{to and from the}} host. The firewall is tamper-resistant because it is independent of the host’s operating system. It is imple-mented on the host’s network interface card and managed by a protected, central policy server located elsewhere on the network.

50|$|Given {{the natural}} {{view of a}} {{conventional}} firewall on the networks topology as consisting of an inside and outside, problems can arise, once one or more members of the policy network domain have been compromised. Perimeter firewalls can only enforce policies between distinct networks and show no option to circumvent problems which arise in the situation discussed above.Given a <b>distributed</b> <b>firewalls</b> independence on topological constraints supports the enforcement of policies whether hosts are members or outsiders of the overall policy domain and base their decisions on authenticating mechanisms which are not inherent characteristics of the networks layout. Moreover, compromise of an endpoint either by a legitimate user or intruder will not weaken the overall network {{in a way that}} leads directly to compromise of other machines, {{given the fact that the}} deployment of virtual private networks prevents sniffing of communication traffic in which the attacked machine is not involved.On the other side, on the end-point itself nearly the same problems arise as in conventional firewalls: Assuming that a machine has been taken over by an adversary must lead to the conclusion that the policy enforcement mechanisms them self may be broken. The installation of backdoors on this machine can be done quite easily once the security mechanisms are flawed and in the lack of a perimeter firewall, there is no trusted entity anymore which might prevent arbitrary traffic entering or leaving the compromised host.Additionally use of tools like SSH and the like allow tunneling of other applications communication and can not be prevented without proper knowledge of the decrypting credentials, moreover given the fact that in case an attack has shown up successfully the verifying mechanisms in them self may not be trusted anymore.At first glance, the biggest weakness of <b>distributed</b> <b>firewalls</b> is their greater susceptibility to lack of cooperation by users. What happens if someone changes the policy files on their own? <b>Distributed</b> <b>firewalls</b> can reduce the threat of actual attacks by insiders, simply by making it easier to set up smaller groups of users. Thus, one can restrict access to a file server to only those users who need it, rather than letting anyone inside the company pound on it. It is also worth expending some effort to prevent casual subversion of policies. If policies are stored in a simple ASCII file, a user wishing to, for example, play a game could easily turn off protection. Requiring the would-be uncooperative user to go to more trouble is probably worthwhile, even if the mechanism is theoretically insufficient.For example, policies could be digitally signed, and verified by a frequently-changing key in an awkward-to-replace location. For more stringent protections, the policy enforcement can be incorporated into a tamper-resistant network card.|$|R
