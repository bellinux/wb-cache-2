5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required {{one of the two}} pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

5|$|Garista, the {{strategist}} for the Niren Corps, attempts to dissuade Niren {{but to no}} avail. The investigation in the fortress {{turns out to be}} more dangerous as the aer begins to turn the fortress into a living weapon to attack the knights. The knights make their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the fortress, where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer. Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer, but a backlash is caused by the sudden ceasing of aer flow, and the blastia explodes, destroying the barrier blastia that keeps Shizontonia safe, knocking out Chastel, and causing the fortress to begin to crumble. As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety, the floor beneath him crumbles. Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer. Despite Yuri's attempts to save him, due to a wound he received during the investigation, Niren is unable to pull himself to safety. Leaving his blastia with Yuri, Niren has the knights leave without him.|$|E
5|$|In Fairport, NY250 follows South Main Street down a large {{hill that}} levels {{off at the}} {{southern}} edge of the village's business district. Here, NY250 intersects Church Street (NY31F) and passes by the First Baptist Church of Fairport, located on the northwestern corner of the junction. The route continues north <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the village, passing by several small businesses and Fairport Village Landing—the largest shopping plaza in the village—before crossing over the Erie Canal by way of a lift bridge and becoming North Main Street.

5|$|In Mexico, tens of {{thousands}} of tourists and residents were evacuated from the beach resorts in and around Cancún, the Riviera Maya, and Cozumel. Hotel guests were evacuated on Saturday afternoon, and staff on Sunday afternoon. Though some hotel guests in second floor rooms and above were given the option to be bussed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Cancun to safe houses and shelters or to stay and wait out the storm in only the modern built hotels and resorts. Most of the remaining guests were restricted to their rooms and were not allowed out on the beach areas. No alcohol was sold in Cancun for 36hours prior to the arrival of the storm, in an attempt to avoid drunken tourists being injured during the night. Two helicopter pilots were killed when their aircraft crashed while evacuating offshore oil platforms operated by Pemex. A German resident was electrocuted while on his roof in Playa del Carmen.|$|E

F-32 separates to turn west and M-33/M-72 turns eastward. The trunkline continues to Fairview where M-33 turns north, leaving the M-72 concurrency to continue northward. M-33 crosses into the Mackinaw State Forest and passes through Comins. North of that unincorporated community, the highway curves northeast, east and back north to cross into Montmorency County. Before reaching M-32, M-33 crosses the Thunder Bay River. After the river, M-33 turns westward along M-32 to the community of Atlanta. The highway passes near the Atlanta Municipal Airport as it enters the community. In the middle of town, M-33 turns back north. The highway provides access to the Clear Lake State Park in northern Montmorency County before crossing into Presque Isle County.|$|E
5|$|North of Haskinville, NY21 {{takes on}} a more northerly course through the county that {{eventually}} brings it {{to the village of}} Wayland, where it intersects I-390 at exit3 south of the village.

5|$|Early on October8, {{after turning}} west-southwestward {{away from the}} Greater Antilles, Iris began {{strengthening}} again, with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear. The NHC predicted peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) before the storm would hit Belize. It rapidly intensified with the favorable conditions, intensifying from 95mph (150km/h) to 140mph (225km/h) in a 12-hour period on October8, making Iris a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale; in the same duration, the minimum central pressure dropped 38mbar (1.12inHg). While intensifying, the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls, with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7mi (11km). For comparison, the smallest known eye diameter on record for an Atlantic hurricane was about 3mi (5km), during Hurricane Wilma in 2005. With such a small eye, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Iris, and shortly after the flight, the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the Honduras coastline just offshore. This resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle, but {{within a few hours}} Iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145mph (230km/h) just off Belize. At 02:00UTC on October9, it made landfall at peak intensity in Monkey River Town in the southern portion of Belize.|$|E

50|$|The unique black {{coloration}} of T. eques is thermally beneficial, {{contributing to}} the species’ shorter larval development time compared to the light- colored desert grasshoppers. T. eques has also developed behavioral thermoregulatory mechanisms for sunlight exposure. Flanking occurs when the grasshopper orients its body perpendicular to sunlight, maximizing thoracic heat gain. The sun-side hind leg is lowered, the shade-side hind leg is raised, and the abdomen is lowered to reduce wing shading. Moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> bushes allows for shading to limit sun exposure at midday to prevent overheating.|$|R
5|$|For three days, {{beginning}} on September 26, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed planes into the hurricane {{as part of}} Project Stormfury, the fourth hurricane {{to be a part}} of the weather control experiment. The plane dropped silver iodide <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the hurricane, although there was no effect due to Ginger's large eye and diffuse nature; this was the last seeding done by the project. By September 28, Ginger was moving northwestward toward North Carolina and was steadily intensifying. At around 06:00 UTC the next day, the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h), which it maintained for about 18 hours. Afterward, Ginger slowly weakened, and late on September 30 it made landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). It quickly deteriorated over land, weakening first to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression by late on October 1. Ginger turned to the north, entered southern Virginia, and later turned to the east. On October 3, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while crossing Hampton Roads into the Atlantic Ocean. The remnants of Ginger continued east-southeastward until being absorbed by a cold front on October 5.|$|E
5|$|The mercenaries pursue Zangurak to Lazulis Island. Lowell is fatally {{injured by}} a Gurak warrior. Zael finds Calista with Zangurak, who has used her Arganan {{blood and the}} Gurak half of the Outsider to anoint his right arm. After the group defeats Zangurak, he rips off his right arm and sends it to use the full power of the Outsider to revive him. However, Dagran kills Zangurak's arm so he can use the Arganan blood and Outsider half on it for himself. He reveals that he murdered Asthar because he learned that Asthar had {{commanded}} the Lazulis knights who killed his family. He has been collaborating with Zangurak with {{the ultimate goal of}} using the Outsider to remake the world so the mercenaries have a better life. Finding he is still not powerful enough to defeat the group, Dagran tries to absorb the Lazulis half of the Outsider <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> his body, giving Zael an opening to kill him. Dagran reconciles with the group before dying, then his spirit uses the Outsider's energy to resurrect Lowell. Zael and Calista reunite the two halves of the Outsider, which leaves the planet after explaining that its true purpose is to collect scattered energy in outer space and use it to create life on new worlds. Humans and Gurak begin coexisting, sharing their technology and using Lazulis as a neutral land where the two races freely interact. Therius decides to train new knights in the empire while leaving Lazulis in Zael's care, Zael and Calista are married in her ancient family home, the mercenaries hold a funeral for Dagran, and Zael is finally made a knight by Calista.|$|E
