40|$|Abstract Background <b>Enteric</b> <b>Redmouth</b> (ERM) <b>disease</b> {{also known}} as Yersiniosis is a {{contagious}} disease affecting salmonids, mainly rainbow trout. The causative agent is the gram-negative bacterium Yersinia ruckeri. The disease can be diagnosed by isolation and identification of the causative agent, or detection of the Pathogen using fluorescent antibody tests, ELISA and PCR assays. These diagnostic methods are laborious, time consuming and need well trained personnel. Results A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed and evaluated for detection of Y. ruckeri the etiological agent of enteric red mouth (ERM) disease in salmonids. The assay was optimised to amplify the yruI/yruR gene, which encodes Y. ruckeri quorum sensing system, {{in the presence of}} a specific primer set and Bst DNA polymerase at an isothermal temperature of 63 °C for one hour. Amplification products were detected by visual inspection, agarose gel electrophoresis and by real-time monitoring of turbidity resulted by formation of LAMP amplicons. Digestion with Hph I restriction enzyme demonstrated that the amplified product was unique. The specificity of the assay was verified by the absence of amplification products when tested against related bacteria. The assay had 10 -fold higher sensitivity compared with conventional PCR and successfully detected Y. ruckeri not only in pure bacterial culture but also in tissue homogenates of infected fish. Conclusion The ERM-LAMP assay represents a practical alternative to the microbiological approach for rapid, sensitive and specific detection of Y. ruckeri in fish farms. The assay is carried out in one hour and needs only a heating block or water bath as laboratory furniture. The advantages of the ERM-LAMP assay make it a promising tool for molecular detection of enteric red mouth disease in fish farms. </p...|$|R

All challenges of fish immunized for 4 months indicated that the vaccine had induced an immune response against columnaris disease. Two polyvalent vaccine studies were conducted to investigate the effect that combining of parenterally administered antigens had on immune responses of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri).

In one study, formalin-killed cells of F. columnaris, Aeromonas salmonicida, and the causative agent (bacterium) of <b>redmouth</b> <b>disease</b> were mixed in all possible combinations and administered to different groups of fish. Responses of fish to antigens administered in the trivalent vaccine and the three divalent vaccines were monitored monthly for 3 months and compared with responses of fish injected with the corresponding monovalent vaccines.

40|$|International audienceYersinia ruckeri is the causative {{agent of}} <b>enteric</b> <b>redmouth</b> <b>disease</b> of fish that causes {{significant}} economic losses, particularly in salmonids. Bacterial pathogens differentially express proteins {{in the host}} during the infection process, and under certain environmental conditions. Iron is an essential nutrient for many cellular processes and is involved in host sensing and virulence regulation in many bacteria. Little is known about proteomics expression of Y. ruckeri in response to iron-limited conditions. Here, we present whole cell protein identification and quantification for two motile and two non-motile strains of Y. ruckeri cultured in vitro under iron-sufficient and iron-limited conditions, using a shotgun proteomic approach. Label-free, gel-free quantification was performed using a nanoLC-ESI and high resolution mass spectrometry. SWATH technology was used to distinguish between different strains and their responses to iron limitation. Sixty-one differentially expressed proteins were identified in four Y. ruckeri strains. These proteins were involved in processes including iron ion capture and transport, and enzymatic metabolism. The proteins were confirmed to be differentially expressed {{at the transcriptional level}} using quantitative real time PCR.

40|$|Yersinia ruckeri is the causative {{agent of}} <b>enteric</b> <b>redmouth</b> (ERM) <b>disease</b> in farmed salmonids. ERM disease is {{traditionally}} associated with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss¸ Walbaum), but {{the incidence of}} the disease in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has increased in recent years. Historically, motile (biotype 1), serotype O 1 isolates of Y. ruckeri have been mostly responsible for ERM in rainbow trout worldwide but non-motile (biotype 2), serotype O 1 isolates have become increasingly prevalent in this species over wide geographic areas since their first isolation in the UK in the 1980 s. Yersinia ruckeri isolates responsible for infection of salmon have been less well characterised than those from rainbow trout and {{little is known about}} their diversity. The emergence of new pathogenic strains, together with vaccine breakdown in the field, has emphasised the need for greater knowledge about strain diversity which may lead to the development of improved vaccines for both species. In the present study, a unique and extensive strain collection encompassing 135 isolates of Y. ruckeri were characterised using complementary phenotypic, proteomic and genomic approaches. In the initial part of this thesis, 135 isolates recovered over a 14 year period in the UK from infected Atlantic salmon (109 isolates) and rainbow trout (26 isolates) were phenotypically characterised through biotype, serotype, and outer membrane protein (OMP) -type analysis. Atlantic salmon isolates represented a wider range of O-serotypes and associated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) types, and had more diverse OMP profiles than those from rainbow trout. Most significantly, a new O-serotype/LPS type was identified in 56 Atlantic salmon isolates; other Atlantic salmon isolates were represented by serotypes O 1 (five isolates), O 2 (34 isolates) and O 5 (14 isolates). This new LPS type comprises a core polysaccharide region similar to that of serotype O 1 but has a unique, previously unidentified O-antigen region. Atlantic salmon isolates could be assigned to one of four major OMP-types and to one of 11 OMP-sub types. Isolates recovered from rainbow trout were represented by the same non-motile clone that is responsible for the majority of ERM outbreaks in this species within the UK. This clone was not associated with any infected salmon. However, two isolates of the novel serotype O 1 /O 5 were recovered from rainbow trout in 2010 and 2011. These data suggest that different Y. ruckeri strains are specifically adapted to cause disease in either Atlantic salmon or rainbow trout. The efficacy of current vaccine formulations against different clonal groups must be examined. Subsequently, an in-depth characterisation of the outer membrane (OM) proteome of isolates recovered from Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout was conducted. Outer membrane proteins are at the interface of host pathogen interactions, with important roles in adherence, evasion of host immune response, and transport. Using a bioinformatic prediction pipeline and four publicly available genomes, 141 proteins were confidently predicted to be OM associated. Subsequently, the OM proteomes of eight representative isolates (four from rainbow trout; four from Atlantic salmon) were analysed using a combination of gel-based and gel-free proteomic approaches. In total, 66 OMPs were identified through this combined approach, of which 28 were unique to the gel-free approach and 13 were unique to the gel-based approach. Further to this, the OM proteomes of these eight representative isolates were examined when cells were grown under conditions that aimed to mimic the in vivo and environmental conditions of Y. ruckeri. These included growing cells aerobically at 22 °C and 28 °C, anaerobically, under iron-depletion and in an artificial seawater medium at 22 °C. In total, 76 OMPs were identified in all eight isolates under these growth conditions. Finally, a phylogenetic study was undertaken whereby the genomes of 16 representative isolates encompassing a range of biotypes, serotypes, host species (eight from rainbow trout, seven from Atlantic salmon and one from European eel), geographic locations and dates of isolation were considered. A phylogenetic species tree based on the concatenated sequences of 19 housekeeping genes revealed host specific lineages suggesting an earlier host-associated evolutionary split within Y. ruckeri. Subsequent analysis of the presence, absence and variation of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the 141 predicted OMPs revealed high levels of conservation (with 120 OMPs showing less than 1...|$|R

This mortality was significantly higher than that seen in fish challenged with Y. ruckeri only (4. 6 x 107 organisms/ 20 g fish). The highest mortality was demonstrated in fish receiving both TBM and Y. ruckeri. The use of aminoglycoside antibiotics for treatment of fish diseases appears to be contraindicated due to their toxicity. Further in vitro and in vivo testing of developed antimicrobial agents against fish bacterial pathogens is proposed...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{presence}} and effects of pharmaceutical drugs in aquatic ecosystems has received increasing attention from the scientific community. The increasing use of pharmaceutical drugs, such as antibiotics, is cause of concern due to their potential biochemical and physiological deleterious effects. Antibiotics are particularly important because they include a variety of substances widely used in medical and veterinary practice, livestock production and aquaculture. These compounds, such as oxytetracycline (OXY), may act not only on cultured organisms, but also in non-target species. OXY is tetracycline, being used worldwide in aquacultures, due to its high efficacy against bacterial diseases (e. g. vibriosis, <b>enteric</b> <b>redmouth,</b> and also furunculosis). The present study aimed to assess the toxic effects of OXY in the freshwater fish Oncorhynchus mykiss. Fish were exposed during 96 h to OXY in concentrations of 0. 005, 0. 050, 0. 500, 5. 00 and 50. 0 mg/L. In order to evaluate OXY effects in the rainbow trout, biochemical markers were analyzed, include those focused on oxidative stress parameters [catalase (CAT), total glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GRed), and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) activities); lipid peroxidation levels (TBARS levels), in liver and gills]; and neurotransmission, (acetylcholinesterase AChE, in muscle and eyes). The here-obtained data showed the occurrence of oxidative stress, reflected by an increased activity of GPx, GRed and GSTs (in gills) and increase of TBARS levels in liver. Additionally, {{it was possible to}} observe significant alterations in AChE activities, with decreases in the eyes and increases in muscle. Short-term effects of antibiotics were observed indicating that physiological impairment in fish may occur, with the involvement of multiple organs and biochemical pathways. The global significance of the entire set of results is discussed, giving emphasis to the ecological relevance of the responses...|$|R
40|$|Yersinia ruckeri is a {{pathogen}} {{that has}} an impact on aquaculture worldwide. The disease caused by this bacterial species, yersiniosis or <b>redmouth</b> <b>disease,</b> generates substantial economic losses due to the associated mortality and veterinary costs. For predicting outbreaks and improving control strategies, it is important to characterize the population structure of the bacteria. The phenotypic and genetic homogeneities described previously indicate a clonal population structure as observed in other fish bacteria. In this study, the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi locus sequence typing (MLST) methods were used to describe a population of isolates from outbreaks on French fish farms. For the PFGE analysis, two enzymes (NotI and AscI) were used separately and together. Results from combining the enzymes showed the great homogeneity of the outbreak population with a similarity[*]>[*] 80. 0 % but a high variability within the cluster (cut-off value[*]=[*] 80. 0 %) with a total of 43 pulsotypes described and an index of diversity[*]=[*] 0. 93. The dominant pulsotypes described with NotI (PtN 4 and PtN 7) have already been described in other European countries (Finland, Germany, Denmark, Spain and Italy). The MLST approach showed two dominant sequence types (ST 31 and ST 36), an epidemic structure of the French Y. ruckeri population and a preferentially clonal evolution for rainbow trout isolates. Our results point to multiple types of selection pressure on the Y. ruckeri population attributable to geographical origin, ecological niche specialization and movements of farmed fis...|$|R
