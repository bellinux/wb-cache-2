40|$|Many {{houses are}} at risk of being <b>destroyed</b> by wildfires. While {{previous}} studies have improved our understanding of how, when and why houses are <b>destroyed</b> by wildfires, little attention has been given to how these fires started. We compiled a dataset of wildfires that <b>destroyed</b> houses in New South Wales and Victoria and, by comparing against wildfires where no houses were <b>destroyed,</b> investigated the relationship between the distribution of ignition causes for wildfires that did and did not <b>destroy</b> houses. Powerlines, lightning and deliberate ignitions are the main causes of wildfires that <b>destroyed</b> houses. Powerlines were 6 times more common in the wildfires that <b>destroyed</b> houses data than in the wildfires where no houses were <b>destroyed</b> data and lightning was 2 times more common. For deliberate- and powerline-caused wildfires, temperature, wind speed, and forest fire danger index were all significantly higher and relative humidity significantly lower (P < 0. 05) on the day of ignition for wildfires that <b>destroyed</b> houses compared with wildfires where no houses were <b>destroyed.</b> For all powerline-caused wildfires the first house <b>destroyed</b> always occurred on the day of ignition. In contrast, the first house <b>destroyed</b> was after the day of ignition for 78 % of lightning-caused wildfires. Lightning-caused wildfires that <b>destroyed</b> houses were significantly larger (P < 0. 001) in area than human-caused wildfires that <b>destroyed</b> houses. Our results suggest that targeting fire prevention strategies around ignition causes, such as improving powerline safety and targeted arson reduction programmes, and reducing fire spread may decrease the number of wildfires that <b>destroy</b> houses...|$|R
