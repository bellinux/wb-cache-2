40|$|With {{the notion}} of {{evolving}} current Extended Reach Drilling, this master thesis examines if drilling 20 – 40 km is feasible. Several reservoirs offshore in the area outside of Lofoten {{in the northern part}} of Norway are reachable by 20 – 40 km in horizontal displacement. The term for these excessive lengths is Ultra Extended Reach Drilling (UL–ERD) and is the foundation for this master thesis. To solve this task a "‘Well Path and Drilling Software"’ (WP&D software) is developed to simulate the drilling operation with regard to well path, drilling, running of casing/liner and well service using wire line. Three–dimensional well path design, analysis of loads and stresses experienced, torque and drag calculation and hydraulic calculation used in the software are presented in this master thesis. Attaining UL-ERD demands innovation in all areas of drilling technology. This thesis addresses this by simulating different scenarios in the software, presenting and discussing the results. The well path designed needs least possible dog–legs and azimuthal change to avoid increased frictional forces and contribution from the capstan effect. Drilling with different drill pipe materials like steel, titanium and composite shows the advantage of using lighter materials to reduce torque and drag. The hydraulic requirements to pump down the string is overcome by having 700 bars of working pressure available on mud pumps and the use of large inner diameter of drill pipe. High <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Circulating</b> <b>Densities</b> (ECD) are handled by Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and its Applied Back Pressure (ABP). The flow rate used to maintain a constant annular velocity is valid if hole cleaning is fulfilled throughout the well. Larger inner diameter requires larger outer diameter which leads to excessive ECDs in small holes. Large diameter drilled holes with corresponding casing/linerOD sizes in parenthesis; 36 "(30 "), 26 "(20 "), 17 1 / 2 "(13 3 / 8 "), 17 1 / 2 "(13 3 / 8 " and 12 1 / 4 "(95 / 8 "). Expandable casing is used to have two lengths of 13 3 / 8 " liner intervals giving the ability of using large inner and outer diameter drill pipe. Setting of casing/liner is performed conventionally using casing/liner filled with mud and unconventionally with fully evacuated casing/liner with nitrogen or casing/liner with mud over nitrogen. The snubbing unit is assumed dimensioned to handle 100 tonnes to get casing/liner down. Rotation of the liner is possible when the absolute density is close to the mud weight in the hole, giving a reduced buoyant weight. Different simulation of inner and outer diameter dimension of drill pipe concludes that an 8 "outer diameter and 7 " inner diameter is the best option for UL-ERD in this thesis. This, incombination of a lighter material such as composite, leads to 40882 meters Measured Depth(MD) at 2506 meters True Vertical Depth (TVD), Horizontal Displacement (HD) of 39501 meters and a Step–Out–ratio of 15, 7. It also has a slight azimuthal change in the well path. The mud pumps deliver 700 bars and the proper flow rate to clean the wellbore using MPD. The casing/liner reaches setting depth and it is possible to run composite wire line with welltractor to perform well service, through the production tubing. Torque and drag calculationsare valid for the specified Make-Up Torque (MUT) of approximately 85 kN. The max limit of 100 kN MUT can be handled by using a tapered drill string. 5 7 / 8 " drill pipe with either steel, titanium or composite can be used to drill multiple wells and join them together to achieve one UL–ERD well. Steel drill pipe is be most preferable with regard to availability and cost. Larger tubular with light drill string material is beneficial when it comes to reducing torque and drag and hydraulic issues in these shorter wells. Obtaining UL–ERD wells in this way requires less modification with regard to the drilling process, since lengths drilled are shorter. The disadvantage is that in a somewhat pristine area as Lofoten, the Health Safety Environment (HSE) issues with drilling offshore is a valid obstacle for not choosing this solution here. This thesis recommends that when having solved the issues with torque and drag, hydraulicrequirement and available equipment, reaching UL–ERD can be performed by drilling fromone location on land, or with multiple wells from several locations on and off land joined into one well. An 8 " composite drill pipe with 7 " inner diameter could be used, lightening the casing/liner to get to setting depth and use composite wire line to perform well service. Recommendations are made on the basis of mud pumps delivering sufficient pump pressure,stronger snubbing units, use of expandable casing, torque and drag is being handled, large hole diameters, larger inner and outer diameters of tubular, the use of a tapered drill string,development and innovation of equipment found vital for the task. </p...|$|R

40|$|More {{extended}} reach wells, highly deviated and ultra deep {{are being}} drilled {{to meet the}} world&# 146;s continuously increasing energy demand. Hole cleaning {{remains one of the}} greatest challenges throughout drilling operations, as material from the formation is generated during the entire drilling process. Depending on several parameters like rate of penetration, flow rate and mud rheology, the cuttings concentration will fluctuate throughout the wellbore. Insufficient hole cleaning may result in a number of drilling problems. Satisfactory cuttings transport is therefore essential to avoid problems associated with poor hole cleaning, and it is important to reduce non-productive time associated with downhole failures and wellbore integrity. The objective {{of the present study was}} to observe and estimate an effect from cuttings on <b>equivalent</b> <b>circulating</b> <b>density,</b> and to find the amount of cuttings in the vertical part of the wellbore at a certain time. This was attempted by calculating the length of displacement of generated cuttings from the horizontal part within each section, and the amount of time required for these cuttings to be transported upwards the annulus, to the vertical part of the wellbore. This has been done for both observed and theoretical values. The effects of cuttings on <b>equivalent</b> <b>circulating</b> <b>density</b> have been observed and estimated, based on data from the drilling operation of well NO- 34 / 10 -C- 47 in the North Sea. Twenty different cases were chosen, and standpipe pressure information was gathered from real time drilling data. The cuttings concentrations were then calculated. The same procedure was then performed theoretically, where data from the Final Well Report were used. The results of observations and estimations were compared to evaluate the quality of the results. Also, extensive research of published knowledge has been made, along with interpretation of already existing cuttings transport models.

30|$|Due to {{the slim}} {{hole at the}} lower part of the ultra-deep and deep wells, the {{eccentricity}} and rotation of drill string and drilling fluid properties have great effects on the annular pressure drop. This leads to the fact that conventional computational models for predicting circulating pressure drop are inapplicable to hydraulics design of deep wells. With the adoption of helical flow theory and H-B rheological model, a computational model of velocity and pressure drop of non-Newtonian fluid flow in the eccentric annulus was established for the cases where the drill string rotates. The effects of eccentricity, rotation of the drill string and the dimensions of annulus on pressure drop in the annulus were analyzed. Drilling hydraulics was given for an ultra-deep well. The results show that the annular pressure drop decreases with an increase in eccentricity and rotary speed, and increases with a decrease in annular flow area. There is a great difference between static mud density and <b>equivalent</b> <b>circulating</b> <b>density</b> during deep well drilling.|$|E

In this study, the Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model was used to examine the influence of Yield Power Law fluid rheological properties on cuttings transport in eccentric horizontal narrow annulus. The flow was assumed as fully developed, laminar, and transient state. The present simulation model was validated against experimental data, where a mean percent error of − 1. 2 % was recorded. Results revealed an increase in the radial distribution of cuttings transport velocity in the wide annular region as the consistency index, K, and the flow behavior index, n, increase. Nonetheless, increasing the yield stress, τo, had insignificant effect on the cuttings transport velocity. Three-dimensional profiles showed how cuttings preferred to travel in less resistant flow area, whereas cuttings concentration builds up in the narrow annular region.

In highly depleted reservoirs, extremely low-density fluids, such as foams or aerated mud, are used to achieve <b>circulating</b> <b>densities</b> lower than the pore pressure. In such cases, the induced modification of the in situ stresses has to be supported mainly by the rock, with little contribution from the drilling fluid pressure. The application of underbalanced drilling depends on the mechanical stability of the drilled formation, among other factors. In general, poorly consolidated, depleted formations are not suited for that technology. In this paper, 23 UBD worldwide cases have been analyzed; {{two of which are}} from Egyptian fields and the others are from Iran, Algeria, Kuwait, Oman, Texas, Mexico, Indonesia, Canada, Libya, Middle East, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Lithuania. From these analyses, the reasons of failure or success have been stated.
