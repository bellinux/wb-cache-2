5|$|Volvariella bombycina is a {{saprobic}} species. Fruit bodies grow singly or {{in small}} groups on trunks and decayed stumps of dead hardwoods. Favored species include sugar maple, red maple, silver maple, magnolia, mango, beech, oak, and elm. It is often found in clefts and knotholes of dead or living tree trunks. It has been noted to fruit in the same location for several years. Despite its preference for hardwoods, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> growing on rare instances on coniferous wood. An uncommon species with a wide distribution, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> from Asia (China, India, Korea, Pakistan), the Caribbean (Cuba), Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.

5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> that following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010.), Russian submarines {{have been able to}} travel past the UK in international waters, but they could not be tracked {{because of the lack of}} suitable aircraft.
