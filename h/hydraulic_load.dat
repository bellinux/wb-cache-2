5000|$|In principle, {{provided}} {{the environment is}} aerobic, the longer the wastewater remains inside the filter, the greater the BOD5 and COD removal efficiency will be, but {{at the expense of}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loading.</b> Wastewater requires sufficient contact time with the biofilm to allow for the adsorption, transformation, and reduction of contaminants. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>loading</b> rate is an essential design parameter and equates to the volume and of wastewater that a vermifilter can reasonably treat in a given time. For a given system, higher <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loading</b> rates will cause hydraulic retention time to decrease and therefore reduce level of treatment. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>loading</b> rate may depend on parameters such as structure, effluent quality and bulk density of filter packing, along with method of effluent application. Common Hydraulic retention time values in vermifiltration systems range from 1 to 3 hours. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>loading</b> rates commonly vary between 0.2 m3 m−2 day−1, 3.0 m3 m−2 day−1 [...] or 10-20 g L−1. Organic loading rate is defined as the application of soluble and particulate organic matter (as BOD5) per unit area per unit time.|$|R
50|$|The cell uses {{conventional}} piston and cylinder arrangement. The piston {{is placed}} in a thin elastic diaphragm. The piston doesn't actually {{come in contact with}} the load cell. Mechanical stops are placed to prevent over strain of the diaphragm when the loads exceed certain limit. The load cell is completely filled with oil. When the load is applied on the piston, the movement of the piston and the diaphragm results in an increase of oil pressure. This pressure is then transmitted to a hydraulic pressure gauge via a high pressure hose. The gauge's Bourdon tube senses the pressure and registers it on the dial. Because this sensor has no electrical components, it is ideal for use in hazardous areas. Typical <b>hydraulic</b> <b>load</b> cell applications include tank, bin, and hopper weighing. By example, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>load</b> cell is immune to transient voltages (lightning) so these type of load cells might be a more effective device in outdoor environments. This technology is more expensive than other types of load cells. It is a more costly technology and thus cannot effectively compete on a cost of purchase basis.|$|E

This report summaries the literature on the topic of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loading</b> rates of on-site sewage systems.

Three folds stable surface flow {{wetlands}} (FSSFWs) were operated {{at different}} hydraulic loadings of 0. 80, 0. 53 and 0. 27 m 3 / (m 2 •d) {{to treat the}} decentralized domestic sewage.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} in the previous section, feed flow rate {{is one of the}} crucial parameters to be controlled to achieve high efficient output. Centrifuge performance is sensitive to feed flow rate. Even though increasing the feed flow rate can prevent from blocking the screens, it is mentioned that wetter solids is achieved. This is due to increase in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>load</b> on the centrifuge when higher feed rate is applied, while differential rotation speed between the cone and scroll, and retention time within dewatering zone of the basket are fixed. In addition, higher feed rate leads to a surge in the effective thickness of the bed since it is dragged down by the scroll.|$|E

5000|$|The {{testing machine}} is 47 ft long and weighs some [...] It works horizontally, the load applied by a {{hydraulic}} cylinder and ram. The working fluid is water not oil. The load {{is measured by}} a weighing system consisting {{of a number of}} levers with the final one carrying a jockey weight. The operator lets water into the hydraulic cylinder and as the pressure and hence load on the test piece increases the jockey weight is wound along to balance the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>load.</b> As it is wound it moves along a graduated scale and when the object under test fails the number on this scale is noted and multiplied by the weight to give the failure load. The weight can be varied in increments of 50 lb using slotted plates on a hanger. On the lower scale this reads up to 150 lb, and up to 1000 lb can be put onto the hanger. A separate jockey weight system above this one allowed the machine to measure loads of up to 1000000 lb.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>load</b> on {{this type}} of {{spillway}} gate (Tainter gate) is transmitted from the cylindrical skin plate, which is {{in contact with the}} reservoir, through a number of struts to a convergence at the trunnion hub. The hub collects the load from the struts and transfers it across an interface to the trunnion pin, which is stationary and is connected to the dam. When the gate is operated, the hub rotates around the pin. The struts are primarily compression members, but friction at the pin-hub interface induces a bending stress during gate operation. Typically, and in this case, the struts are oriented such that the trunnion friction stress is applied to the weak axis of the struts (see Section modulus). In order to better handle these loads, the struts are connected with diagonal braces that take the stress as axial loads. At Folsom Dam, increasing corrosion at the pin-hub interface had raised the coefficient of friction and, therefore, the bending stress in the strut and the axial force in the brace. The capacity of the brace connection was exceeded and it failed. This caused the load to redistribute and the failure progressed, eventually buckling the struts.|$|E
