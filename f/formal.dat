5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} <b>formal</b> work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, <b>formal</b> employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the <b>formal</b> sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|All Noh plays {{are divided}} by their themes into the {{following}} five categories. This classification is considered the most practical, and is still used today in <b>formal</b> programming choices today. Traditionally, a <b>formal</b> 5-play program is composed of a selection {{from each of the}} groups.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these are}} not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable {{compounds}} with <b>formal</b> oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, <b>formal</b> oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N2, cannot be isolated in condensed form, but B2F4 and B4Cl4 are well characterized.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Bangkok docked in Singapore on May 6, Kalākaua {{had had enough of}} <b>formal</b> events, turning down the offer of {{accommodations}} at Government House in favor of the simplicity of a hotel. Nevertheless, Governor Frederick Weld held a <b>formal</b> reception and state dinner for him.|$|E

5|$|However, {{on certain}} collar days {{designated}} by the Sovereign, members attending <b>formal</b> events may wear the Order's collar over their military uniform, <b>formal</b> wear, or other costume. They will then substitute the broad riband of another order to which they belong (if any), since the Order of the Thistle {{is represented by the}} collar.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the <b>formal</b> theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. <b>Formal</b> theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of <b>formal</b> rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E

5|$|One {{of those}} {{attending}} the 1906 ceremonies at the Kansas monument was A. T. Hill, {{a resident of}} Logan, Kansas. Hill had no <b>formal</b> training as an archaeologist—indeed, his <b>formal</b> education had ended in the fourth grade. However, he had developed {{a strong interest in}} the history and archaeology of the Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|Other {{traditions and}} customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have <b>formal</b> hall {{six times a}} week, but in others this only happens occasionally. At most colleges these <b>formal</b> meals require gowns to be worn, and a Latin grace is said.|$|E
5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a <b>formal</b> approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a <b>formal</b> account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide <b>formal</b> definitions of language are commonly used in <b>formal</b> logic, in <b>formal</b> theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other <b>formal</b> logicians.|$|E
5|$|The PHP {{language}} evolved {{without a}} written <b>formal</b> specification or standard until 2014, leaving the canonical PHP interpreter as {{a de facto}} standard. Since 2014 work {{has gone on to}} create a <b>formal</b> PHP specification.|$|E
5|$|The first {{display of}} the new queen's {{authority}} was the <b>formal</b> act of homage of the Lower Austrian Estates to her on 22November 1740. It was an elaborate public event which served as a <b>formal</b> recognition and legitimation of her accession. The oath of fealty to Maria Theresa was taken {{on the same day}} in the Hofburg.|$|E
5|$|The <b>formal</b> {{establishment}} of the Colony of New South Wales did not occur on 26 January as is commonly assumed. It did not occur until 7 February 1788, when the <b>formal</b> proclamation of the colony and of Arthur Phillip's governorship were read out. The vesting of all land in the reigning monarch King George III also dates from 7 February 1788.|$|E

5|$|The grounds {{were laid}} out in the mid 18th century by Pitt and Lancelot Brown; and they include early-20th-century <b>formal</b> gardens {{designed}} by Peto. The <b>formal</b> gardens are listed, Grade II, on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a proof is formalized {{in the field of}} {{mathematical}} logic. A <b>formal</b> proof is written in a <b>formal</b> language instead of a natural language. A <b>formal</b> proof is defined as sequence of formulas in a <b>formal</b> language, in which each formula is a logical consequence of preceding formulas. Having a definition of <b>formal</b> proof makes the concept of proof amenable to study. Indeed, the field of proof theory studies <b>formal</b> proofs and their properties, for example, the property that a statement has a <b>formal</b> proof. An application of proof theory is to show that certain undecidable statements are not provable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Formal</b> {{logic is}} the study of {{inference}} with purely <b>formal</b> content. An inference possesses a purely <b>formal</b> content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. The works of Aristotle contain the earliest known <b>formal</b> study of logic. Modern <b>formal</b> logic follows and expands on Aristotle. In many definitions of logic, logical inference and inference with purely <b>formal</b> content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no <b>formal</b> logic captures all of the nuances of natural language.|$|E
25|$|When a <b>formal</b> {{system is}} used to {{represent}} <b>formal</b> logic, only statement letters are represented directly. The natural language propositions that arise when they're interpreted are {{outside the scope of}} the system, and the relation between the <b>formal</b> system and its interpretation is likewise outside the <b>formal</b> system itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Formal</b> theorems {{consist of}} {{formulas}} of a <b>formal</b> {{language and the}} transformation rules of a <b>formal</b> system. Specifically, a <b>formal</b> theorem is always the last formula of a derivation in some <b>formal</b> system each formula {{of which is a}} logical consequence of the formulas that came before it in the derivation. The initially accepted formulas in the derivation are called its axioms, and are the basis on which the theorem is derived. A set of theorems is called a theory.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{sciences}}, the <b>formal</b> sciences are {{not concerned}} with the validity of theories based on observations {{in the real world}} (empirical knowledge), but rather with the properties of <b>formal</b> systems based on definitions and rules. Methods of the <b>formal</b> sciences are, however, essential to the construction and testing of scientific models dealing with observable reality, and major advances in <b>formal</b> sciences have often enabled major advances in the empirical sciences.|$|E
25|$|What makes <b>formal</b> theorems {{useful and}} of {{interest}} {{is that they can}} be interpreted as true propositions and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of the truth of the resulting expression. A set of <b>formal</b> theorems may be referred to as a <b>formal</b> theory. A theorem whose interpretation is a true statement about a <b>formal</b> system is called a metatheorem.|$|E

25|$|The Board draws a {{distinction}} between <b>formal</b> and informal settlements, i.e., those that call for issuance of a <b>formal</b> Board order {{and those that do}} not. A party unhappy with the Regional Director's settlement of its unfair labor practice charges can appeal a <b>formal</b> settlement to the Board itself, which must approve any <b>formal</b> settlement in any case, but can only appeal an informal settlement to the General Counsel.|$|E

25|$|Frock coats {{worn with}} {{waistcoat}} and <b>formal</b> striped trousers {{are still very}} occasionally worn as daytime <b>formal</b> wear, especially to weddings, {{as an alternative to}} morning coats, in order to give the wedding attire a Victorian flavour. They are today usually only worn by the wedding party, where elements of historical costume are more acceptable, and even this practice is unusual, as its role as a <b>formal</b> ceremonial coat in daytime <b>formal</b> wear has been long supplanted in modern dress code by the morning coat. Like morning coats, frock coats are only worn for daytime <b>formal</b> events before 5p.m. and no later than until around 7p.m.|$|E
25|$|Trinity College {{undergraduate}} gowns {{are readily}} {{distinguished from the}} black gowns favoured by most other Cambridge colleges. They are instead dark blue with black facings.

25|$|On November 14, 2013, GSA {{opened a}} <b>formal</b> process for {{selecting}} {{the site of}} a new FBI headquarters. The agency said it received 38 informal proposals from area governments and developers, which demonstrated enough interest from viable projects that it should move ahead with a <b>formal</b> relocation. The agency set a deadline of December 17, 2013, for <b>formal</b> proposals, and said it would choose one or more of locations for additional discussion in early 2014. A single location and development partner was likely to be chosen by mid-2014, and a <b>formal</b> agreement signed in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Logic is {{generally}} considered <b>formal</b> when it analyzes and represents the form of any valid argument type. The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the <b>formal</b> grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in <b>formal</b> inference. Simply put, formalising simply means translating English sentences into the language of logic.|$|E
25|$|The {{dress code}} at the modern inaugural {{ceremony}} is traditional, <b>formal</b> Filipino clothing, which is otherwise loosely termed Filipiniana. Ladies must wear terno, baro't saya (the <b>formal</b> wear of other indigenous groups is permissible), while men don the Barong Tagalog. Non-Filipinos {{at the ceremony}} may wear their respective versions of <b>formal</b> dress, but foreign diplomats have often been seen donning Filipiniana as a mark of cultural respect.|$|E
