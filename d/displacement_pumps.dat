25|$|The digging of the {{foundation}} of the Covington tower commenced in September 1856 and went smoothly. A foundation was set consisting of 13 layers of oak beams, each layer set perpendicular to the one beneath it, bolted with iron hardware, and finally all cemented into place. On the Cincinnati side, work was delayed from the start. The construction crews could not pump water out of the excavating pit fast enough. They were attempting to dig to bedrock {{in the middle of a}} flowing river. After months of a virtual stand-still, Roebling decided against buying costly machinery or bigger engines for his pumps and, quite last minute, designed his own square positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> from three-inch (76mm) pine planks. He built them locally in about forty-eight hours and ran them off of one of Amos Shinkles' tugboats, the Champion No.1. The homemade pumps displaced forty gallons of mud and clay in each cycle.|$|E

50|$|A {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> {{must not}} operate against a closed valve on the discharge {{side of the}} pump, because it has no shutoff head like centrifugal <b>pumps.</b> A positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> operating against a closed discharge valve continues to produce flow and the pressure in the discharge line increases until the line bursts, the pump is severely damaged, or both.|$|R
40|$|Static {{and dynamic}} {{characteristics}} of an axial piston variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> with pressure regulator are studied. The governing equations of the pump complete unit are derived and analysis is performed by computer simulation through which significant {{parameters of the}} pump complete unit are identified. A standard variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> is simulated and the results show good agreement with the manufacturer's dynamic operating curves...|$|R
50|$|Positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> unlike {{centrifugal}} or roto-dynamic pumps, theoretically {{can produce}} the same flow at a given speed (RPM) {{no matter what the}} discharge pressure. Thus, positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are constant flow machines. However, a slight increase in internal leakage as the pressure increases prevents a truly constant flow rate.|$|E
50|$|Positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> - {{such as the}} Roots, Twin Screw (Lysholm), and TVS (Eaton) blowers.|$|E
50|$|A {{practical}} {{difference between}} dynamic and positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{is how they}} operate under closed valve conditions. Positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> physically displace fluid, so closing a valve downstream of a positive displacement pump produces a continual pressure build up that can cause mechanical failure of pipeline or pump. Dynamic pumps differ in {{that they can be}} safely operated under closed valve conditions (for short periods of time).|$|E

While originally designed for filling creams, gels and lotions these fillers also handle water thin and heavy paste products. Some of the products this machine easily fills are cosmetic creams, heavy sauces, thick shampoo and hair conditioners, honey, hair gels, paste cleaners, and car wax.|$|R

40|$|The {{technology}} in wind turbines has developed very rapidly {{but there are}} still a lot that can be improved also regarding new technologies. One example is wind turbine with hydraulic transmission. At the beginning low power wind turbines are in view. First of all the wind energy is meant to be used by isolated users for household and garden equipment or pumping water. Later, if results will be as expected, and wind potential satisfactory, such systems could be connected to electric grid. In our research laboratory we must build an experimental setup. The simulation for wind turbine and fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> coupled to it will be realized using a variable <b>displacement</b> piston <b>pump.</b> As the variable wind speed has as a result variations of the pump flow, the variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> from the test rig may reproduce a similar variation law.

50|$|As with {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> the base pressure will be reached when leakage, outgassing, and backstreaming equal the pump speed, but now minimizing leakage and outgassing {{to a level}} comparable to backstreaming becomes much more difficult.|$|E
50|$|Endless-piston {{principle}} is a dispensing variation of rotating positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> Their operating principle {{can be compared}} with an endless piston that conveys the product from the suction side to the discharge side, building up a differential pressure in the process.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{metering}} pumps are piston-driven. Piston pumps are positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{which can be}} designed to pump at practically constant flow rates (averaged over time) against {{a wide range of}} discharge pressure, including high discharge pressures of thousands of psi.|$|E
50|$|A {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> makes a fluid move by trapping a fixed {{amount and}} forcing (displacing) that trapped volume into the discharge pipe.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump).</b> Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump)</b> backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump. There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|R
50|$|A {{piston pump}} {{is a type}} of {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> where the high-pressure seal reciprocates with the piston. Piston pumps can be used to move liquids or compress gases.|$|R
50|$|Centrifugal pump {{impellers}} have specific speed values ranging from 500 to 10,000 (English units), with {{radial flow pumps}} at 500-4000, mixed flow at 2000-8000 and axial flow pumps at 7000-20,000. Values of specific speed less than 500 are associated with positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hydraulic {{pumps are}} used in {{hydraulic}} drive systems and can be hydrostatic or hydrodynamic.A hydraulic pump is a mechanical source of power that converts mechanical power into hydraulic energy (hydrostatic energy i.e. flow, pressure). It generates flow with enough power to overcome pressure induced by the load at the pump outlet. When a hydraulic pump operates, it creates a vacuum at the pump inlet, which forces liquid from the reservoir into the inlet line to the pump and by mechanical action delivers this liquid to the pump outlet and forces it into the hydraulic system.Hydrostatic pumps are positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> while hydrodynamic pumps can be fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> in which the displacement (flow through the pump per rotation of the pump) cannot be adjusted, or variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> which have a more complicated construction that allows the displacement to be adjusted. Although, hydrodynamic pumps are more frequent in day-to-day life. Hydrostatics pump which are of various types works {{on the principle of}} Pascal's law. It states that the increase in pressure at one point of the enclosed liquid in equilibrium of rest is transmitted equally to all other points of the liquid, unless the effect of gravity is neglected.(in case of statics) ...|$|E
50|$|Pumps can be {{classified}} by their method of displacement into positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> impulse pumps, velocity pumps, gravity pumps, steam pumps and valveless pumps. There are two basic types of pumps: positive displacement and centrifugal. Although axial-flow pumps are frequently classified as a separate type, they have essentially the same operating principles as centrifugal pumps.|$|E
50|$|The Powerplus is {{a design}} of {{supercharger}} {{that was used}} to boost the performance of car engines in the 1930s. It is a mechanically driven positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump,</b> operating on the sliding-vane principle.|$|R
50|$|The flow is pulsed, {{particularly}} at low rotational speeds. Therefore, these pumps are less suitable where a smooth consistent flow is required. An alternative type of positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> should then be considered.|$|R
50|$|A {{variable}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> is {{a device}} that converts mechanical energy to hydraulic (fluid) energy. The displacement, or amount of fluid pumped per revolution of the pump's input shaft can be varied while the pump is running.|$|R
50|$|These {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> have {{an expanding}} cavity on the suction {{side and a}} decreasing cavity on the discharge side. Liquid flows into the pumps as the cavity on the suction side expands and the liquid flows out of the discharge as the cavity collapses. The volume is constant given each cycle of operation.|$|E
50|$|This is the {{simplest}} of rotary positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> It consists of two meshed gears that rotate in a closely fitted casing. The tooth spaces trap fluid and force it around the outer periphery. The fluid does not travel back on the meshed part, because the teeth mesh closely in the center. Gear pumps see wide use in car engine oil pumps and in various hydraulic power packs.|$|E
50|$|Positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{the most}} {{effective}} for low vacuums. Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction {{with one or two}} positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are the most}} common configuration used to achieve high vacuums. In this configuration the positive displacement pump serves two purposes. First it obtains a rough vacuum in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures. Second the positive displacement pump backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum pump. Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions. Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums. Pumps also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, sealing material, pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.|$|E
5000|$|An {{axial piston}} pump is a {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> that {{has a number of}} pistons in a circular array within a cylinder block. It {{can be used as a}} stand-alone pump, a hydraulic motor or an automotive air conditioning compressor.|$|R
50|$|In a {{momentum}} transfer pump, gas molecules are accelerated from the vacuum {{side to the}} exhaust side (which is usually maintained at a reduced pressure by a positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pump).</b> Momentum transfer pumping is only possible below pressures of about 0.1 kPa. Matter flows differently at different pressures based on the laws of fluid dynamics. At atmospheric pressure and mild vacuums, molecules {{interact with each other}} and push on their neighboring molecules in what is known as viscous flow. When the distance between the molecules increases, the molecules interact with the walls of the chamber more often than with the other molecules, and molecular pumping becomes more effective than positive <b>displacement</b> <b>pumping.</b> This regime is generally called high vacuum.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{precisely}} controlling {{the position of}} a hydraulic actuator using an on/off valve is developed. Since valves exhibit little power loss when they are fully open or fully closed, the proposed system is more efficient than throttling valve control and can achieve flow variation without the expense or bulk of a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> Mating a pulse-width-modulated (PWMed) on/off valve with a fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and a smoothing accumulator creates a software enabled variable <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> A drawback of using digital valve control for hydraulic systems is that the relatively low speed of the currently available switching valves results in a significant ripple in the pressure and flow rate. We propose a solution to this problem by using a throttling valve to shield the actuator from the ripple in the output. This creates an effective load sensing system with the throttling valve used only to provide a small known pressure drop between the supply and the load. This approach is significantly more efficient than the conventional technique of using throttling to vary the full flow. This paper presents an averaged model of the system and a nonlinear controller to achieve position control of an actuator. ...|$|R
