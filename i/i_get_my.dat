While both versions address sexual intercourse, the publication noted that in the original version, Cher [...] "sings romantically about 'makin' love'" [...] while Ellis-Bextor sings [...] "more aggressive" [...] lyrics such as [...] "only fair <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> way".

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Dark" [...] was {{directed}} by Ethan Lader. Dev enlisted Lader to make the video as he regularly makes videos for her and The Cataracs. Lader originally contacted her with ideas for the clip, and she soon replied with what she would want in the video. She said, [...] "So we did that back and forth, which he always does with me until <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> point across. ... and then we met up and we got both of our ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially we went in thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E

2500|$|Austin Nichols portrays Julian Baker, Peyton's ex-boyfriend from Los Angeles. [...] "The {{funny thing}} about Austin {{is that there was}} {{initially}} much resistance from the folks who have to OK our casting choices. Which is not rare, by the way," [...] commented Schwahn. [...] "When that happens, I {{pick up the phone and}} try to rationalize with everyone, or pout or bitch or whine and eventually <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> way (and probably get called an ass****) and this leads to Austin Nichols killing it as Julian, just as I suspected he would in the first place." [...] Schwahn added, [...] "This is not to say that there aren't good people and good allies working on my show at both the studio and network, just that the fans would be surprised at how things work behind the scenes." [...] A regular from season 7, Julian initially comes to Tree Hill to win Peyton back. He offers to produce a film based on Lucas's first book. At first, Peyton does not reveal to Lucas that Julian is her ex-boyfriend, but she is forced to do so when the plans of the movie take shape. Brooke rebuffs his advances until Peyton gives her blessing when she sees that Brooke has a serious interest in Julian. After Brooke opens up to Julian, they begin a relationship.|$|E

2500|$|On 4 April, England were {{up against}} Sri Lanka, and {{struggling}} at 133–6, chasing 236 to win. Nixon {{came to the}} crease and crashed 42 off just 44 deliveries, with two 4s and a superb 6, sharing an 87 run partnership with Ravi Bopara off just 15.2 overs, before skying a Lasith Malinga delivery to Mahela Jayawardene. This {{turned out to be}} the best seventh wicket partnership of the whole competition. His 6 came in the form of a fantastic reverse sweep off the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan. Renowned as one of the best players of the shot, Nixon remarked after the match, [...] "I've probably hit 20 sixes like that in county cricket – if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> timing right, it's going to go out of the ground". He had taken England to the brink of victory, having arrived at the crease with the team all but defeated. Bopara was left with the task of hitting 3 runs off the last delivery, but was clean bowled by Dilhara Fernando, as Sri Lanka sneaked a 2 run victory. After this innings, Nixon had a World Cup average of 63 – second highest in the England team to Paul Collingwood, but still better than renowned big hitters Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff. The figure placed him in the top twenty batsmen – in terms of average – at the World Cup at this stage, ahead of fellow wicket keepers, Brendon McCullum, Adam Gilchrist, Mark Boucher and Kumar Sangakkara.|$|E
