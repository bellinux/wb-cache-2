40|$|The world-wide {{electricity}} sector {{reforms have}} led to a search for alternative and innovative <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>to</b> promote efficiency improvement in the natural monopoly electricity networks. A number of countries have used incentive regulation models based on efficiency benchmarking of the electricity network utilities. While most regulators have opted adopted parametric and non-parametric frontier-based methods of benchmarking some have used engineering designed ‘reference firm’ or ‘norm’ models for the purpose. This paper examines the incentive properties and other related aspects of the norm model NPAM used in regulation of distribution networks in Sweden and compares these with those of frontier-based benchmarking methods. We identify a number of important differences between the two <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulation</b> benchmarking that are not readily apparent and discuss their ramifications for the regulatory objectives and process.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{argues that}} social {{reporting}} {{can be an}} important form of New Governance <b>regulation</b> <b>to</b> achieve stakeholder account-ability. Current social reporting practices, however, fall short of achieving stakeholder accountability and actually may work against it. By exam-ining the success and failures of other transparency programs in the United States, we can identify key factors for ensuring the success of social reporting over the long term. These factors include increasing the benefits-to-costs ratios of both the users of the information and the disclosers, and recognizing the importance of the involvement of third-party intermediaries. There is a significant and growing interest in the legal academy in exploring new ways to regulate corporations and, in particular, an interest in a shift from <b>regulation</b> <b>to</b> governance. Conventional models, such as command-and-control regulation, operate under a deterrence <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulation</b> (Malloy 2003), which is generally adversarial and punitive (Ruhnka and Boerstler 1998). Although this traditional <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulation</b> has provided many benefits to society (e. g. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{regulation}} has become critical to recent {{debates about the}} nature of restructuring in geographical and economic contexts. This paper is an exploration of the theoretical implications of viewing regulation as social practice as opposed to economic imperative. Emphasis is placed on French regulation theory and those attempting to reconstruct an understanding of regulation from within a hermeneutic - interpretive framework. By definition, these two approaches represent contrasting points of view. However, the author warns against setting the context of regulation within such oppositional parameters. The commentary is not about providing a definitive <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulation,</b> but, rather, is an exploration of the methodological and epistemological issues arising from the divergent <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulation</b> that have emerged in the literature. The author draws heavily on the debate between interpretivists and legal positivists and argues that this domain provides a new and exciting avenue for research on the nature of regulation in the spatial sciences. ...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis, many countries have embarked on fundamental reviews of their regulatory systems {{in an attempt to}} identify the causes of the near collapse in financial systems and {{to pave the way for}} a new <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulation.</b> The focus of this paper concerns the intellectual assumptions on which previous regulatory approaches have largely been built, both in the UK and in a number of other countries. We examine the analysis provided by the UK’s Turner Review (2009) which follows the “market failure” <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>regulation</b> and we contrast this with the alternative “state failure” approach. Both approaches only offer partial and polarised views into the causes of the crisis. We offer a synthesis and argue that a new conceptual <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the management of financial markets is required. The essence of this new approach is the recognition that the state and regulation are not external to the market. While this paper largely relates to the UK, it provides potentially important lessons for many other countries...|$|R
