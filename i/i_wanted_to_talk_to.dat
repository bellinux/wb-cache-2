500|$|After Beyoncé {{finished}} her {{concert at the}} Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year. I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I {{looked out the window and}} there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the DVD. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the DVD.|$|E
500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} is not {{essentially}} experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line {{to see a movie}} with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to personally correct the man's errors. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, [...] "mental subtitles" [...] convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip Inside Woody Allen—depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from Snow White. Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the [...] "fourth wall" [...] is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable [...] "wish-fulfillment." [...] Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, [...] "because I felt many {{of the people in the}} audience had the same feelings and the same problems. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them directly and confront them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'The papers,' said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, 'are in {{a canvas}} bag, {{in a hole}} a little way up the chimney in the top front-room. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, my dear. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Considering {{that she}} had started him as a topic, I thought this pretty unjust. <b>I</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of Harold. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about myself.|$|R
60|$|Merely that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. And Robert Boulger, being a {{youth of}} {{somewhat}} limited intelligence, seemed in the way.|$|E
6000|$|EILEEN (sits down). <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. (She {{raises her}} face with a pitiful smile. Nicholls hurriedly moves {{back to his own}} chair.) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you again," [...] she said. [...] "I {{am tired of}} all these people. Tell me, Mr. Brand, {{how long will you}} stay on in Theos?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{supposed}} to be a very natural one {{in the case of a}} man," [...] said Laura. [...] "You can smoke if you like. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R

60|$|FANNY. I hate tact. [Newte laughs.] We {{could have}} had such a jolly little lunch together. I'm all alone till the evening. There were ever so many things <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, he {{flew into}} a fury, called me an--" [...] Hastily I caught myself. [...] "Well, {{he said if}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him any more {{not to speak of}} you. He was sure unreasonable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Twelve-thirty train," [...] {{said the}} captain, looking shrewdly {{from one to}} the other. [...] "I’m just off home; there are one or two matters I must attend to before I go, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|E
60|$|ELLIE [rising]. That {{means that}} you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tell Mr Randall {{the story about the}} tiger. Come, Captain: <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my father; and you had better come with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "A wrap!" [...] she murmured. [...] "How absurd! Come {{and let us}} sit {{under the}} cedar tree. Those young people seem to have wandered off, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R

6000|$|Thirlwell {{looked puzzled}} and Allott resumed: [...] "You haven't opened your mail yet and I didn't suggest it, because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you first. I wonder {{whether it will}} be a shock to hear that Sir James is dead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad they}} have gone," [...] she said. [...] "You see, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, but the dew is commencing to settle and I must go in soon. That is insisted on, though I don't think it matters." ...|$|E
6000|$|The old soldier laughed {{until his}} merriment startled the clerks in the counting-house. [...] "Be jabers!" [...] he said, In a wheezy voice, [...] "d'ye think I came five miles to do that? No, sir, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{you about your}} son." ...|$|E

60|$|MRS GEORGE [coming to {{the hearth}} and {{addressing}} Reginald] Mr Bridgenorth: will you oblige me by leaving {{me with this}} young man. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him like a mother, on YOUR business.|$|R
6000|$|You will infallibly suspect me {{of having}} chosen them thus on purpose. No, honor bright!--I chose simply the {{greatest}} men,--those <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about.

6000|$|Mrs. Chudleigh {{smiled at}} him. [...] "That's very nice of you, {{and while the}} {{sunshine}} lasts it's pleasant here. I often think an English wood, with the varied colours of the trunks and mosses showing, is most beautiful on a bright winter day. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. There's a favour I must ask." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go, I must go," [...] {{went on the}} dreadful, {{familiar}} voice, in a cry of despair.

6000|$|... "I {{doubt if}} I did help much, {{but after the}} horse knocked me down I went to the {{homestead}} and Jardine was kind. Now <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him; he's a good rancher." ...|$|R
