50|$|In early December 2002, an Ottawa {{entrepreneur}} named Timothy Kimber {{discovered the}} unique ride-on toy {{as he was}} shopping in an Ottawa shopping center. It was then called the <b>Fun</b> <b>Car,</b> and was {{on display at the}} mall, free for children to test drive. Kimber, fascinated with the product, located the Asian distributor and proceeded to ask questions regarding the <b>Fun</b> <b>Car.</b> Kimber discovered that while the <b>Fun</b> <b>Car</b> sold well in China, it had virtually no presence in Canada or the United States. Surprised by the news, Kimber sought out to bring the <b>Fun</b> <b>Car</b> to North America because of its marketing potential. After much conversation with the distributor, Kimber negotiated to assume distribution and marketing rights for the <b>Fun</b> <b>Car</b> in North America.|$|E

Within a month, Kimber had created a company name (PlaSmart - pronounced Play Smart), website, and provided marketing materials for the <b>Fun</b> <b>Car,</b> including a demo video. More importantly, he decided to change the product name from the <b>Fun</b> <b>Car</b> (deemed too generic and dull) to the PlasmaCar, a name he borrowed {{from the world of}} consumer electronics where the hottest [...] "toy" [...] for adults was the Plasma TV. The name change caught the attention of customers and retailers, and the PlasmaCar became a popular item at trade shows.

One model, the Saphier, was a wedge-shaped coupe, whose upper body section opened completely {{for access to the}} cockpit; it was offered in a variety of configurations. The basic model was built on a VW Beetle floor plan with a turbo-charged Volkswagen Golf engine, while at {{the upper end of the}} lineup was a mid-engine model with monocoque construction, and a tuned 5-liter Ford V8. There were also heavily tuned conversions of the Italian De Tomaso Pantera with a Catalytic converter, double turbocharger, and five valves per cylinder, producing up to [...] The company also built a prototype V12 coupe reminiscent of the Lamborghini Countach, but with insignificant funds to finish the prototype Jehle folded.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{the number}} of low-volume <b>cars,</b> such as <b>fun</b> <b>cars</b> increased. The batch size for these cars is {{in the range of}} 5, 000 up to 100, 000. Common deep drawing tools for the mass {{production}} of car body panels are made of steel or cast iron. They can be used for more than 1 million parts but their manufacturing is time-consuming and costly. The reason for this project was the lack of low-cost and less time-consuming manufacturing concepts for small batch production deep drawing tools. The method of resolution was based on one category of rapid tooling technology which involves the application of advanced polymers to fabricate metal forming dies. Despite their advantages in production and cost reductions, polymer dies for sheet metal forming application have several drawbacks. Due to their lack of strength compared to steel or cast iron, the use of polymer dies was limited to a production rate below 1, 000 parts. The intention of this project was a significant durability improvement of polyurethane made deep drawing tools. PVD coating and thermal coating (flame spraying and plasma spraying) have been investigated as well as the modification of polyurethane by tribological favourable additives. In fact of extensive efforts on the area of PVD coating and thermal coating was the result dissatisfying. The adhesive strength of the coatings was basically and essentially unsound, therefore the activities with this coatings have been quit. In terms of durability improvement the modified polyurethane performed very well. On this base tooling concepts have been developed and tested. These toolings are capable for a small batch size production of car body panels. Dependent on the sheet thickness, work piece material and geometry the tool life will be in a range from 3, 000 to 20, 000 parts. Compared to the common dies, made of steel or cast iron, the polyurethane dies have considerable advantages in manufacturing time and price as well as in repairing and modifying. The tool cost reduction is the outcome of less time for manufacturing and a significant smaller effort for the smooth finishing operation. (orig.)

50|$|The {{area has}} been {{completely}} remodeled {{and covered with a}} layer of topsoil, in order to recover the ancient morphology and create new hills and wooded habitats. They were planted about 1500 trees including 562 oaks, Quercus pubescens 566, 196 maples, willows 96, 65 Quercus fastigiata, about 280 oak trees to cespuglioni and several species of shrubs such as gorse, privet, myrtle, and cysts, selected to rebuild in a natural environment quickly. To facilitate the complete re-naturalization of the places were implanted whole clods of complete vegetation topsoil (ecocelle), taken from the nearby estate of Castel di Guido. Two kilometers of trails, bordered by rows of trees and equipped with a fitness trail, through the woods. The green area, with a children's play, whose main attraction is a <b>fun</b> cable <b>car</b> suitable for both children and adults, is equipped with tables and wooden benches. The park has an important function for the housing settlement, because it improves the livability and environmental quality of the entire territory, characterized by the presence of industrial plants and a high concentration of mining activities.|$|R
