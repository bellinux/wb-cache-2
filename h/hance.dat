5|$|Black tells Bletcher about Richard Alan <b>Hance</b> (Jeremy Roberts), {{a serial}} killer Black had helped to {{apprehend}} twenty years before. <b>Hance</b> was a disturbed Vietnam War veteran who marked his kills with half a playing card, a custom he picked up during his tours of duty. Black {{was one of a}} number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who responded to an anonymous tip, leading them to Hance's location — however, the tip was called in by <b>Hance</b> himself and the raid became an ambush. Three agents were killed, and Black was cornered by <b>Hance,</b> who cut open his palm and nearly took Black's life before the young Black was able to overpower and arrest him.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Bush {{ran for the}} House of Representatives from Texas's 19th congressional district. The {{retiring}} member, George H. Mahon, {{had held}} the district for the Democratic Party since 1935. Bush's opponent, Kent <b>Hance,</b> portrayed him as {{out of touch with}} rural Texans, and Bush lost the election with 46.8 percent of the vote to Hance's 53.2 percent.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the {{combined}} {{enrollment in the}} Texas Tech University System was greater than 42,000 students—a 48% increase since 2000.

5|$|In the present, Black {{realizes that}} the current murderer must be Hance's former cellmate Jacob Tyler (Scott Heindl). Black visits <b>Hance</b> in prison, and upon {{speaking}} to <b>Hance,</b> realizes that Tyler believes himself Hance's reincarnation, aspiring to follow his methods exactly. Meanwhile, Tyler calls the police and leaves an anonymous tip, telling them that the liquor store murderer is hiding in an abandoned building. Black accompanies a SWAT team encircling the building, but the officers come under sniper fire from a construction site across the street. Black and Bletcher separate as they search for Tyler, who gets the drop on Black. Black disarms Tyler, attempting to talk him into surrendering. Tyler empties a handgun at Black, but misses; when Bletcher confronts him, Tyler points the gun and Bletcher instinctively shoots and kills him.|$|E

25|$|MD 272 {{begins at}} an {{entrance}} to Elk Neck State Park at the trailhead for the Turkey Point Light, which {{lies at the}} end of the namesake peninsula between the Elk River to the east and the Chesapeake Bay to the west. The state highway heads north as two-lane Turkey Point Road through a residential area before returning to the state park property. MD 272 passes through several curves and passes by access roads to campgrounds and the other features of the park and by the park headquarters. The state highway emerges from the state park and passes by the Rodney Scout Reservation before curving north at its intersection with Elk River Lane in the hamlet of Elk Neck. MD 272's roadway widens and parallels Arrants Road and Old Log Cabin Road; along the latter highway, the state highway passes between Sandy Cove Camp and the Black Hill unit of Elk Neck State Forest. The route crosses <b>Hance</b> Point Creek and parallels <b>Hance</b> Point Road across Ford Run and by North East Little League Park to where the roads meet on the edge of Chesapeake Bay Golf Club at North East.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Bush announces he {{will run}} for Congress to {{represent}} Texas' 19th district. At a barbecue, Bush meets his future wife, Laura Lane Welch.

Bush does poorly in the debate and loses the election, but with {{the highest number of}} votes for a Republican candidate in the state's history.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of chrysotile asbestos veins in the Bass Formation was first noted in early {{exploration of the}} Grand Canyon by the Powell expedition. Shortly after 1890, mining claims were filed on these asbestos deposits. Later in the early 1900s, William Wallace Bass mined asbestos in the Shinumo Creek-Hakatai Canyon area and John <b>Hance</b> mined asbestos in Asbestos Canyon. Although these deposits had good quality asbestos, little asbestos, at most a few tons, was produced from them because these deposits were fairly small and difficult to access. These asbestos mines are now abandoned and protected as historical sites.|$|E

25|$|Many {{conservative}} Southern Democrats {{defected to}} the Republican Party, {{beginning with the}} passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the general leftward shift of the party. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, Kent <b>Hance</b> and Ralph Hall of Texas, and Richard Shelby of Alabama are examples of this. The influx of conservative Democrats into the Republican Party is often cited as a reason for the GOP's shift further to the right during the late 20th century, as well as the shift of its base from the Northeast and Midwest to the South.|$|E
25|$|The base of {{both the}} Bass Formation and Unkar Group in eastern Grand Canyon is marked by the Hotauta Member of the Bass Formation. It is a {{prominent}} discontinuous, conglomerate, initially named the Hotauta Conglomerate and later redesignated the Hotauta Member. This conglomerate consists of rounded, pebble to cobble-sized clasts of chert, granite, quartz, plagioclase crystals, and micropegmatites in a quartz sand matrix. About 80% of the gravel-size clasts consist of granite and quartzite. The quartzite gravel lacks any local equivalents in the Grand Canyon, indicating a distant source. Excellent exposures of the Hotauta Member occur at the Colorado River level near <b>Hance</b> Rapids (river mile 77) and along the South Kaibab and North Kaibab Trails.|$|E

500|$|Under {{the younger}} Caspersen's leadership, Beneficial {{expanded}} into credit finance and offered credit cards through its People's Bank and Trust subsidiary. It purchased Parliament Leasing in 1977, and First Texas Financial Corp., a {{savings and loan}} firm, in 1978. In 1977, Beneficial entered the reinsurance business through subsidiaries, but these endeavors led to significant financial losses in the 1980s. Beneficial later downsized its reinsurance holdings and restructured to emphasize its second mortgage business. According to Charles [...] "Sandy" [...] <b>Hance,</b> former {{senior vice president and}} general counsel of Beneficial, Caspersen was a [...] "pioneer in second mortgages, which later evolved into home equity loans", and that he [...] "saw this trend developing at a very early stage".|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between the characters of Jacob Tyler and Richard Allen <b>Hance</b> {{seems to have been}} based on that of Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris, two convicts whose time in prison together formed the basis of a partnership that saw them torture and kill several young women in 1979. Tyler's delusional visions of his victims consenting to be murdered may stem from West German serial killer Waldemar Szczepinski, who chose his victims based on their response to him ringing their doorbells—those who answered he deemed to have given their permission to be killed and their houses burgled; those who did not were simply left alone. The character also draws inspiration from American serial killer Herbert Mullin, who likewise felt that his victims had offered him permission to kill them. Mullin claimed that their last words were often [...] "I understand".|$|E
