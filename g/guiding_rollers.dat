5000|$|ST-26 (ST {{stands for}} saperniy tank or [...] "{{engineer}} tank") — engineer tank; a bridge-laying tank {{based on the}} twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 chassis. According to the [...] "System of armoured engineering armament of the Red Army", the ST-26 was developed by designers from the Academy of Military Engineering (chief engineer of the project - Gutman) {{in the beginning of}} 1932. The ST-26 had only one shortened turret {{in the middle of the}} hull armed with a DT tank machine gun with 1,008 rounds; arc of fire was 211°. Special equipment consisted of a metal tracked bridge 7.35 m long and weighing 1100 kg, supports for the bridge (a front frame with two forks and two <b>guiding</b> <b>rollers,</b> lower forks with a hoisting mechanism and a roller, a rear frame with mounts and two rollers) and a cable winch (driven by the tank engine with the use of the reversing gear) inside the vehicle. The ST-26 was intended to provide for crossing of trenches and streams 6 - 6.5 m wide and barriers up to 2 m high by T-27, T-26 and BT light tanks: the bridge had a maximum load rating of 14 t. The bridge could be laid with the help of the cable winch in 25-40 seconds without crew exit; the raising operation took 2-3 min and a commander needed to come out from the vehicle in order to control the process. The ST-26 with its cable system for bridge laying was tested in the summer of 1932.|$|E
40|$|High {{recording}} density with the home-use digital VCRs requires {{the use of}} narrow tracks, short recording wavelength, and thin magnetic tapes. Knowledge of Young’s modulus of the tape is essential for the precise positioning of the tape on the rotating drums and then a stable tape-to-head interface. The magnetic tapes usually show different Young’s moduli for the machine direction (MD) and the transverse direction (TD) [1]. The anisotropy develops mainly in the base film of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) through the partial crystallization and the crystallite orientation alignment during the stretching process on the tapes [2], while the original PET sheet, from which the tapes are cut, shows much less anisotropy. This situation requires the determination of Young’s moduli for both MD and TD of the tape. The tapes on play are straightened by tensile loads, which should be controlled with Young’s modulus for the MD. Too much load may distort the recorded tracks or damage the tape. Besides, the vertical load is applied onto both edges of the running tape by the <b>guiding</b> <b>rollers.</b> Again, too much load may induce the tape buckling. Critical load is proportional to the Young’s modulus in the TD. Large moduli are desirable for both directions...|$|E

25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the <b>guide</b> <b>rollers</b> due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|R
