40|$|The {{vertebrate}} lens is {{a tissue}} composed of terminally differentiated fiber cells and anterior lens epithelial cells. The abundant, preferential {{expression of the}} soluble proteins called crystallins creates a transparent, refractive index gradient in the lens. Several transcription factors such as Pax 6, Sox 1, and L-Maf {{have been shown to}} regulate lens development. Here we show that mice lacking the transcription factor c-Maf are microphthalmic secondary to <b>defective</b> <b>lens</b> formation, specifically from the failure of posterior lens fiber elongation. The marked impairment of crystallin gene expression observed is likely explained by the ability of c-Maf to transactivate the crystallin gene promoter. Thus, c-Maf is required for the differentiation of the vertebrate lens...|$|E
40|$|The role of A. C. IOL {{in modern}} implant surgery has become {{somewhat}} debatable, since, the choice procedure to day is undoubtedly an ECCE with a PC lens implant preferably in the capsular bag. Even so, anterior chamber lens implantation has its definite indications. As such {{it is necessary}} for the implant surgeon to be familiar with the latest technique in this modality of surgery as well. Many of the complications of earlier rigid model AC IOLs were mainly due to <b>defective</b> <b>lens</b> design. With the advent of new generation flexible one-piece PMMA AC lenses, many of these complications have been eliminated. A. C. IOL implantation, although less frequently done now, has its own legitimate place in modern IOL surgery...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVertebrate lens {{development}} {{depends on}} a complex network of signaling molecules to coordinate cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. In this study, we have investigated the role of heparan sulfate in lens specific signaling by generating a conditional ablation of heparan sulfate modification genes, Ndst 1 and Ndst 2. In this mutant, N-sulfation of heparan sulfate was disrupted after the lens induction stage, resulting in reduced lens cell proliferation, increased cell death and <b>defective</b> <b>lens</b> fiber differentiation in later lens development. The loss of Ndst function also prevented the assembly of Fgf/Fgfr complexes on the lens cell surface and disrupted ERK signaling within the lens. We further demonstrated that Ndst mutation completely inhibited the FGF 1 and Fgf 3 overexpression phenotypes, but Kras reactivation was sufficient to reverse the Ndst deficient lens differentiation defect. The epistatic relationship between Ndst and FGF–Ras signaling demonstrates that FGF signaling is the predominant signaling pathway controlled by Ndst in lens development...|$|E
40|$|To {{ascertain}} {{the prevalence of}} defects in disposable contact lenses, an Optimec JFC contact lens analyser (× 16 magnification) {{was used to examine}} 150 Acuvue, 150 NewVues, and 150 SeeQuence lenses, all - 3. 00 D in power. The percentage of each lens type found to be defective was: Acuvue 75 %, NewVues 5 %, and SeeQuence 9 %. A single-center, simultaneously-controlled, double-masked, randomized study was conducted to determine whether such defects compromise ocular integrity. Each of 29 subjects wore a <b>defective</b> Acuvue <b>lens</b> in one eye and a non-defective Acuvue (control) lens in the other eye on an extended-wear basis for one week. Lenses with defects {{visible to the naked eye}} were excluded. Although there was no significant difference in vision, subjective sensation, or bulbar conjunctival hyperemia between eyes wearing <b>defective</b> vs. control <b>lenses,</b> a significantly greater ocular response was observed in eyes wearing <b>defective</b> <b>lenses</b> in the form of corneal epithelial microcysts (p = 0. 04), corneal staining (p = 0. 02), and conjunctival staining (p = 0. 04). Two cases of peripheral corneal infiltrates were observed; both cases were unilateral and occurred in eyes wearing <b>defective</b> <b>lenses.</b> Such compromise may predispose the eye to more serious complications such as infection and corneal ulceration...|$|R
40|$|Tomography {{is like a}} {{photograph}} that was taken by a camera with blurred and <b>defective</b> <b>lenses</b> that deform the shapes and colours of objects. Reporting quantitative parameters derived from tomographic inversion is not always adequate because tomographic results are often strongly biased. To quantify the results of tomographic inversion, we propose a forward modelling and tomographic inversion (FM&TI) approach that aims to find a more realistic solution than conventional tomographic inversion. The FM&TI scheme {{is based on the}} assumption that if two tomograms derived from the inversion of observed and synthetic data are identical, the synthetic structure may appear to be closer to the real unknown structure in the ground than the inversion result. However, the manual design of the synthetic velocity distribution is usually time-consuming and ambiguous. In this study, we propose an approach that automatically searches for a probabilistic model. In this approach, a synthetic model is iteratively updated while taking into account the bias of the model in previous stages of the FM&TI performance. Here, we present an example of synthetic modelling and real data processing for an active source refraction data set corresponding to a marine profile across the subduction zone in Chile at about 32 °S latitude. A key feature of the model is a low-velocity channel above the subducted oceanic crust, which was defined in the synthetic model and expected in the real case. The conventional first arrival traveltime tomography was barely able to resolve this channel. However, after several iterations of the FM&TI modelling, we succeeded in reconstructing this channel clearly. In the paper, we briefly discuss the nature of this low-velocity subduction channel, and we compare the results with other studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{homeobox}} gene Six 3 regulates forebrain development. Here {{we show that}} Six 3 is also crucial for lens formation. Conditional deletion of mouse Six 3 in the presumptive lens ectoderm (PLE) disrupted lens formation. In the most severe cases, lens induction and specification were <b>defective,</b> and the <b>lens</b> placode and lens were absent. In Six 3 -mutant embryos, Pax 6 was downregulated, and Sox 2 was absent in the lens preplacodal ectoderm. Using ChIP, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and luciferase reporter assays, we determined that Six 3 activates Pax 6 and Sox 2 expression. Misexpression of mouse Six 3 into chick embryos promoted the ectopic expansion of the ectodermal Pax 6 expression domain. Our results position Six 3 {{at the top of}} the regulatory pathway leading to lens formation. We conclude that Six 3 directly activates Pax 6 and probably also Sox 2 in the PLE and regulates cell autonomously the earliest stages of mammalian lens induction...|$|R
40|$|Human {{congenital}} cataract and ocular anterior segment dysgenesis both demonstrate extensive {{genetic and}} phenotypic heterogeneity. We identified a family where ocular developmental abnormalities (cataract, anterior segment dysgenesis and microphthalmia) co-segregated with a translocation, t(5; 16) (p 15. 3;q 23. 2), in both balanced and unbalanced forms. We hypothesized that this altered {{the expression of}} a gene of developmental significance in the human lens and ocular anterior segment. Cloning the 16 q 23. 2 breakpoint demonstrated that it transected the genomic-control domain of MAF, a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, first identified as an oncogene, which is expressed in vertebrate lens development and regulates the expression of the eye lens crystallins. The homozygous null mutant Maf mouse embryo demonstrates <b>defective</b> <b>lens</b> formation and microphthalmia. Through mutation screening of a panel of patients with hereditary congenital cataract we identified a mutation in MAF in a three-generation family with cataract, microcornea and iris coloboma. The mutation results in the substitution of an evolutionarily highly conserved arginine with a proline at residue 288 (R 288 P) in the basic region of the DNA-binding domain of MAF. Our findings further implicate MAF/Maf in mammalian lens development and highlight the role of the lens in anterior segment development. The 16 q 23. 2 breakpoint transects the common fragile site, FRA 16 D, providing a molecular demonstration of a germline break in a common fragile sit...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{total of}} 104 eyes and 43 resected corneal discs from {{patients}} with failed intraocular lens implants (IOL) received {{over a period}} of 35 years were subjected to histopathological analysis. Eyes collected at necropsy from 18 people with clinically successful implants were also examined. Corneal decompensation leading to bullous keratopathy was the most frequent reason for failure, followed by glaucoma and intraocular inflammation. Of 18 cases in which inflammation was the principal clinical cause of failure 12 presented as infectious endophthalmitis, but minor degrees of sterile uveitis were fairly common. Retinal detachment was seen in seven cases. The interval between IOL implantation and the onset of serious complications varied from one month to 29 years, indicating that the presence of prosthesis will always entail a latent risk of an adverse tissue response, albeit slight. From rather shaky beginnings the principles and techniques of intraocular lens (IOL) implantation have developed to the level that replacement of the <b>defective</b> <b>lens</b> with a prosthesis is now seen to be the preferred way of dealing with eyes undergoing cataract surgery. Other than in children the limita-tions on the use of 1 OLs {{have more to do with}} availability and economic restraints than with surgical considerations, and yet there is a significant morbidity associated with their insertion which should not be ignored. Already a substantial number of histopatho-logical reports of the untoward effects of 1 OLs has been reported and have been well reviewed by Apple and his colleagues. ' McDonnell, Green, and Champion 2 identified at least 25 complications in eyes that had undergone apparently successful IOL inser-tion. The object of the present report is to describe our experience at the Institute of Ophthalmology in the University of London with reference to eyes wherein the prosthetic insertion was mostly unsuccessful...|$|E
40|$|PAX 77 + mice {{were shown}} to express about 150 % of {{wild-type}} Pax 6 levels of corneal epithelial Pax 6 and displayed abnormally small corneas due to a failure of postnatal growth {{and development of the}} cornea.   The proliferative component of the corneal epithelium was normal, cell cycle progression appears unaffected and there are no abnormal apoptotic events.   Cytokeratin- 12 expression was down regulated in the PAX 77 + corneal epithelia, implying differentiation is incomplete, and the corneas of PAX 77 + were found to display increased fragility in comparison to wild-types. PAX 77 + corneas displayed sever wound healing abnormalities which in contrast to Pax 6 +/- can not be rescued by EGF addition.   Both Pax 6 +/- and PAX 77 + corneal epithelia show no improvement in wound healing with addition of Shh peptide or all-trans retinoic acid (in contrast to wild-type), however in the PAX 77 + wound healing abnormalities do not lead to corneal opacity which is seen in Pax 6 +/-.   Both Pax 6 +/- and PAX 77 + corneal epithelia have increased basal levels of retinoic acid signalling in their corneal epithelium when compared to wild-type littermates.   Topical application of Shh increased RA signalling in the corneal epithelium. As described above a severe reduction in corneal size was observed in the PAX 77 + mouse: <b>defective</b> <b>lens</b> signalling as a result of Pax 6 dosage was postulated to lead to this.   The lens is highly sensitive to Pax 6 dosage.   Mouse/chick secondary chimeras were produced, through the grafting of PAX 77 + and wild-type mouse lenses into a chicken eye, to investigate the role of altered Pax 6 dosage in the lens on anterior eye development.   PAX 77 + mouse/chick secondary chimeras, remarkably recapitulated the anterior eye phenotype seen in PAX 77 + mice. This supports the role of altered Pax 6 dosage in the lens resulting in the corneal abnormalities of the PAX 77 + model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine {{selective}} attention and distractibility within the visual modality in children with Down syndrome as compared to children of normal intelligence matched for mental age. Selective attention was defined as the children's abilities to identify and respond to a target stimulus on a forced choice reaction time task. Distractibility was considered to be the extent to which the children's performances on the task were interfered with by extraneous stimuli in the visual field. Conditions on the task varied with regard to the presence or absence and location (close and far) of distracting stimuli and the presence or absence and size (small, medium and large) of boundary cues. Participants included 10 children with Down syndrome and 10 children of normal intelligence matched for mental age. The primary finding {{of this study was}} that the performance of children with Down syndrome was more adversely affected by the presence of distractors than that of the children of normal intelligence. This finding indicates that children with Down syndrome suffer from selective attention deficits and increased distractibility. The selective attention of children with Down syndrome is characterized as distractor-controlled as a result of a <b>defective</b> attentional (zoom) <b>lens</b> that "wanders" in visual space...|$|R
