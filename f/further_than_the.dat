5|$|Burundi {{participated in}} the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing, China from 8 to 24 August 2008. It was Burundi's fourth {{appearance}} in the summer Olympics since its debut in 1996. The Burundi team included three athletes: runners Joachim Nshimirimana and Francine Niyonizigiye, as well as swimmer Elsie Uwamahoro. Niyonizigiye, a marathon runner, was flag bearer for the opening ceremony. None of the Burundi athletes progressed <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> qualifying round.|$|E
5|$|Gambia {{took part}} in the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing, China from 8 to 24 August 2008. It was Gambia's seventh {{appearance}} in the summer Olympics since its debut in 1984. The Gambia team included three athletes; runners Suwaibou Sanneh and Fatou Tiyana as well as boxer Badou Jack.

None of the Gambia athletes progressed <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> qualifying heats.|$|E
5|$|In the Local Supercluster it is {{possible}} to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the Local Group (see Cepheids). However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> most distant star cluster previously observed.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United {{ended the}} season as runners-up to Portsmouth in the Football League First Division, and reached the semi-final stage of the FA Cup. Arsenal progressed no <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> fourth round of the cup competition, and {{finished}} sixth in the league. The two clubs next faced {{each other in the}} Charity Shield in 1993, when Manchester United won the inaugural Premier League title, and Arsenal were FA Cup winners in the 1992–93 season.|$|E
5|$|The Second World War devastated {{much of the}} East End, {{with its}} docks, {{railways}} and industry forming a continual target for bombing, especially during the Blitz, leading to dispersal of the population to new suburbs and new housing being built in the 1950s. Many East Enders went <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> eastern suburbs, leaving London altogether, notably to the Essex new towns of Basildon and Harlow {{and a number of}} expanded towns in south Essex and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The Sounders won the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup {{three times}} in a row (2009–2011) and reached a fourth {{consecutive}} Open Cup final appearance in 2012. In 2014, Seattle won their fourth U.S. Open Cup title. The Sounders won the Supporters' Shield 2014, also completing their double. In 2016, Seattle won their first MLS Cup. The Sounders have competed in the CONCACAF Champions League four times (with a fifth appearance due in 2017), but have not advanced <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> semi-final round.|$|E

5|$|Benin {{took part}} in the 2008 Summer Olympics, which were held in Beijing, China from 8 to 24 August 2008. The country's {{participation}} at Beijing marked its eighth consecutive appearance in the summer Olympics since its debut in 1972, and its ninth Olympic appearance ever. The Benin delegation included five athletes in 2008, participating in three sports: athletics, swimming and taekwondo. Fabienne Feraez, a sprinter, was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. None of the Benin athletes progressed <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> heat round.|$|E

5|$|During the Han, {{the empire}} {{was divided into}} large {{administrative}} units of kingdoms and commanderies; within a commandery there were counties, and within counties there were districts that contained at least several hamlets. An average hamlet contained about a hundred families and usually was enclosed by a wall with two gates. At the center of social life in the hamlet was the religious altar (built in honor of a local deity) where festivities could be staged. Each district and county also had an official religious altar. The official reach of government extended no <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> district level, where county-appointed officials included {{the chief of police}} who maintained law and order and the district tax collector. However, the government was able to control local society at the hamlet level with their bestowal of twenty ranks.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{numerous}} {{proposals were}} put forward to salvage Titanic. However, all fell afoul of practical and technological difficulties, {{a lack of}} funding and, in many cases, {{a lack of understanding}} of the physical conditions at the wreck site. Charles Smith, an architect from Denver, proposed in March 1914 to attach electromagnets to a submarine which would be irresistibly drawn to the wreck's steel hull. Having found its exact position, more electromagnets would be sent down from a fleet of barges which would winch Titanic to the surface. An estimated cost of $1.5 million (£ today) and its impracticality meant that the idea was not put into practice. Another proposal involved raising Titanic by means of attaching balloons to her hull using electromagnets. Once enough balloons had been attached, the ship would float gently to the surface. Again, the idea got no <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> drawing board.|$|E

5|$|Like {{several other}} chalk figures {{carved into the}} English countryside, the Cerne Abbas Giant is often thought of as an ancient creation. However, as {{with many of the}} other figures, its history cannot be traced back <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> late 17th century, making an origin during the Celtic, Roman or even Early Medieval periods {{difficult}} to demonstrate. Medieval sources refer to the hill on which the giant is located as Trendle Hill – possibly in reference to the nearby landmark known as the Trendle. Joseph Bettey noted that none of the earlier sources for the area, including a detailed 1617 land survey, refer to the giant, suggesting that it might not have been there at the time. In contrast, the Uffington White Horse {{has been shown to be}} 3,000 years old, and there are references to it across the ages.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{victory over}} Sunderland in the 1992 FA Cup Final {{qualified}} {{them for the}} 1992–93 European Cup Winners' Cup, but this campaign was short-lived, as they were eliminated {{in the second round}} by Russian side Spartak Moscow. Liverpool finished no higher than sixth in the Premier League during the next two seasons, thus failing to qualify for European competition. In the 1995–96 season, they entered the UEFA Cup, but again progressed no <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> second round, this time losing to Brøndby of Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{had become}} one of the UK's best-known millionaires, and earned a knighthood, {{on the back of the}} highly {{successful}} Sinclair Research range of home computers in the early 1980s. He hoped to repeat his success in the electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. The C5 emerged from an earlier project to produce a small electric car called the C1. After a change in the law, prompted by lobbying from bicycle manufacturers, Sinclair developed the C5 as an electrically powered tricycle with a polypropylene body and a chassis designed by Lotus Cars. It was intended to be the first in a series of increasingly ambitious electric vehicles, but in the event the planned development of the follow-up C10 and C15 electric cars never got <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> drawing board.|$|E

5|$|Swaziland competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, {{which was}} held from 27 July to 12 August 2012. The country's {{participation}} at London marked its ninth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its debut at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The delegation included two track and field athletes: Sibusiso Matsenjwa and Phumlile Ndzinisa, and one swimmer, Luke Hall; the first two competitors qualified for the Games through wildcard places while Hall was awarded an universality place by FINA. Hall {{was selected as the}} flag bearer for the opening ceremony and Matensjwa held it for the closing ceremony. All three competitors did not advance <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> heat stages of their respective events.|$|E
5|$|The broad head is {{distinct}} from the neck, and the snout is blunt in profile with {{the rim of the}} top of the head extending forwards slightly <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> mouth. Substantial cranial plates are present, although the parietal plates are often fragmented, especially towards the rear. A loreal scale is absent. Six to 9 supralabials and eight to 12 infralabials are seen. At midbody, there are 23–27 rows of dorsal scales. All dorsal scale rows have keels, although those on the lowermost scale rows are weak. In males/females, the ventral scales number 130-145/128-144 and the subcaudals 38-54/36-50. Many of the latter may be divided.|$|E
5|$|The solar wind, {{a stream}} of charged {{particles}} flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is {{the point at which}} pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out {{to the edge of the}} scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.|$|E
