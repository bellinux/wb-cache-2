A PDP 1 1 / 23 performed the calculations. There were four stages: 1.) A bandpass filter attenuated noises; 2.) the <b>data</b> <b>input</b> <b>program</b> digitized the signal every 55 μsec. If the signal exceeded a threshold, 12 samples of the signal and the time were written onto the disk; 3.) the pulse discriminating program recognized an action potential by fitting the 12 points with this function: v(t) = (a + bt + ct²) exp(-t/Ƭ). For each pulse the computer determined values of the parameters giving the best fit through use of the least squares technique. For acceptance, the total pulse height and the position of the zeroes of v(t) must fall within limits; 4.) occasionally a pulse may be missed or an extra one recorded.

The 3 -D wing analysis program VORLAT also received an updated interface. The JETFLAP source program no longer resided on the NPS mainframe and was reconstructed from an original source tape and program listing.
