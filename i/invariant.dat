(The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E
40|$|Taubes has {{recently}} defined Gromov <b>invariants</b> for symplectic four-manifolds and related {{them to the}} Seiberg-Witten <b>invariants.</b> Independently, Ruan and Tian defined symplectic <b>invariants</b> based on ideas of Witten. In this note, we show that Taubes' Gromov <b>invariants</b> are equal to certain combinations of Ruan-Tian <b>invariants.</b> This link allows us to generalize Taubes' <b>invariants.</b> For each closed symplectic four-manifold, we define a sequence of symplectic <b>invariants</b> Gr_δ, δ= 0, 1, 2, [...] The first of these, Gr_ 0, generates Taubes' <b>invariants,</b> which count embedded J-holomorphic curves. The new <b>invariants</b> Gr_δ count immersed curves with δ double points. In particular, these results give an independent proof that Taubes' <b>invariants</b> are well-defined. They also show {{that some of the}} Ruan-Tian symplectic <b>invariants</b> agree with the Seiberg-Witten <b>invariants.</b> Comment: AMS-LaTeX, 11 page...|$|R
50|$|Differential <b>invariants</b> are {{contrasted with}} {{geometric}} <b>invariants.</b> Whereas differential <b>invariants</b> can involve a distinguished choice of independent variables (or a parameterization), geometric <b>invariants</b> do not.

5|$|Einstein {{contributed to}} these {{developments}} by linking {{them with the}} 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature {{to be derived from}} one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic <b>invariant.</b> Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic <b>invariant</b> as the action variable of classical mechanics.|$|E
25|$|We {{could also}} define a Lie algebra {{structure}} on Te using right <b>invariant</b> vector fields instead of left <b>invariant</b> vector fields.

25|$|Another of Hilbert's problems, Hilbert's 18th problem, {{concerns}} (among other things) polyhedra that tile space. Every such polyhedron {{must have}} Dehn <b>invariant</b> zero.

50|$|The <b>invariants</b> {{most often}} {{considered}} are polynomial <b>invariants.</b> These are polynomials constructed from contractions such as traces.

40|$|Loop <b>invariants</b> play a {{major role}} in program {{verification}} and drastically speed up processes like automatic test case generation. Though various techniques have been applied to automatic loop <b>invariants</b> generation, most interesting ones often generate only candidate <b>invariants.</b> Thus, a key issue, to take advantage of these <b>invariants</b> in a verification process, is to check that these candidate loop <b>invariants</b> are actual <b>invariants.</b> This paper introduces an original technique based on constraint programming for automatic verification of inductive loop <b>invariants.</b> This new approach is efficient to detect spurious <b>invariants</b> and nicely performs verification of valid <b>invariants</b> under boundedness restrictions.

We show that the ordinary <b>invariants</b> of all quotients {{are determined by the}} equivariant <b>invariants</b> of the covering manifold. In the case where the Bauer-Furuta <b>invariants</b> can be identified with the Seiberg-Witten <b>invariants,</b> this implies relations between the <b>invariants</b> in Galois covering situations, and these can be illustrated through elliptic surfaces.

These <b>invariants</b> explore some geometric features of knots embedded in the solid torus. We characterize these <b>invariants</b> and interpret them {{on the level of}} the knot projection. We also find some relations among some of these <b>invariants.</b> Moreover, we give lower bounds for some of these <b>invariants</b> using Vassiliev <b>invariants</b> of type one. We connect our <b>invariants</b> to the bridge number in the solid torus.

The <b>invariants</b> {{are based on}} measurements, given by inner product of predesigned functions and the image. We build on steerable filters and adopt a Lie theoretical approach that is applicable to any dimensionality. A complete characterization of Lie measurement <b>invariants</b> of a general irreducible component of the group, termed block <b>invariants,</b> is provided. We show that <b>invariants</b> for the entire group can be taken as the union of the <b>invariants</b> of its components. The system is completed by deriving <b>invariants</b> between components of the group, termed cross <b>invariants.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{theory of}} knot <b>invariants</b> of finite type (Vassiliev <b>invariants)</b> is described. These <b>invariants</b> {{turn out to}} be at least as {{powerful}} as the Jones polynomial and its numer-ous generalizations coming from various quantum groups, and it is conjectured that these <b>invariants</b> are precisely as powerful as those polynomials. As <b>invariants</b> of finite type are much easier to define and manipulate than the quantum group <b>invariants,</b> it is likely that in attempting to classify knots, <b>invariants</b> of finite type will play a more fundamental role than the various knot polynomials...|$|R

In some cases, GW <b>invariants</b> agree with classical enumerative <b>invariants</b> of algebraic geometry.
