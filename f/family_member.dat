40|$|Objective To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between <b>family</b> <b>members</b> and mental health care workers {{to learn more about}} the support available to <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of mental health patients. Methods Eighteen interviews were conducted with <b>family</b> <b>members,</b> seven with professionals and two with patients. Observations were performed at a long-term hospital ward and at family and client council meetings. Results <b>Family</b> <b>members</b> perform an important carer role which greatly affects their lives. They need support from mental health professionals in order to cope. However, communication between mental health care workers and <b>family</b> <b>members</b> is problematic. <b>Family</b> <b>members</b> report a lack of information, consultation and support. Conclusion <b>Family</b> <b>members</b> and mental health care workers frame the role of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> in the care process differently. Practice implications Since the role of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> in the care process can be beneficial for all actors including the mental health patient it is important that mental health professionals acknowledge this and provide support to <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> Considering relatives as fellow carers (reframing their role) could be the way to do this...|$|R

The residence forms are classified into "All <b>family</b> <b>members</b> remain", Part of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> moved out", and "All <b>family</b> <b>members</b> moved out" in this paper. The main conclusions are as follows. 1) It is, "All <b>family</b> <b>members</b> movod out" many of the types of {{the transformation of the}} residence forms. It occupies about the entire half. As for "Part of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> moved out", a little over 20 %, "All <b>family</b> <b>members</b> remain" become a little less than 20 %. 2) Most of the households of "All <b>family</b> <b>members</b> remain" and "Part of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> moved out" improve their residence environment by rebuilding. The enlargements of their residence scale enable them to continue living, and the enlarged scale of "All <b>family</b> <b>members</b> remain" is bigger that "Part of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> moved out". 3) The households of "Part of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> moved out" improve their residence environment by move-out of child generation while continuing their store through parent generation continuing living in house with store. 4) Most of the households of "All <b>family</b> <b>members</b> moved out" rent their land, and most of them move out to where adjacent to the central city area...|$|R
40|$|Background and aim: Brucellosis is an infectious, {{contagious}} and {{zoonotic disease}} that occurs worldwide. The <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of an index case of brucellosis {{may be especially}} susceptible, due to sharing the same source of infection and similar risk factors for brucellosis. In this study, we propose to screen pediatric and adult <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of brucellosis index cases for detecting additional unrecognized infected <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> Materials and methods: 114 <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of 41 pediatric patients with brucellosis were evaluated. All <b>family</b> <b>members</b> completed a brief questionnaire and were tested by a standard tube agglutination test (STA). Results: The majority of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> (n =  96, 84. 2 %) were children. Among the 114 <b>family</b> <b>members,</b> 42 (36. 8 %) were seropositive, and 15 (35. 7 %) were symptomatic. The majority of the symptomatic seropositive <b>family</b> <b>members</b> (n =  12, 80 %) had STA titers (≥ 1 : 640) higher than asymptomatic seropositive <b>family</b> <b>members</b> (n =  9, 33 %; p =  0. 004). Conclusion: The routine screening of both pediatric and adult <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of index cases is a priority in endemic areas. Using this screening approach, unrecognized <b>family</b> <b>members</b> who are seropositive for brucellosis will be identified earlier {{and be able to}} receive prompt treatment...|$|R

This study examines the impact of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> on oncology interviews. Particular attention is given to how absent <b>family</b> <b>members</b> are referenced, by patients and doctors, and when co-present actually participate in interactions during routine clinical encounters. Family members' involvements during oncology interviews are important for three primary reasons. First, patients do not typically go through cancer alone. Second, doctors realize that patients routinely bring in <b>family</b> <b>members</b> during consultations. Finally, caregiving by <b>family</b> <b>members</b> is a prominent public health problem, but has not been examined as social activities occurring in the clinic. This research examines 44 instances of how patients and physicians reference <b>family</b> <b>members</b> as well as the contributions that co-present <b>family</b> <b>members</b> make during oncology interviews...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjective:To {{determine}} if screening <b>family</b> <b>members</b> {{of patients with}} acute brucellosis will enhance the detection rate of brucellosis and also to determine the relationship between symptoms and brucella serology. Materials and methods:Family members from patients with acute brucellosis were interviewed and serologically screened. All seropositive <b>family</b> <b>members</b> were clinically and serologically followed for six months. Results:Twenty-five acute brucellosis patients and their 178 <b>family</b> <b>members</b> were enrolled from January 2001 to February 2002. Of the 178 <b>family</b> <b>members,</b> 40 (23 %) manifested various symptoms, 138 (77 %) were asymptomatic, with an overall seroprevalence rate of 34 (19 %). The rate of seropositivity among the symptomatic <b>family</b> <b>members</b> was 23 (58 %) and for the asymptomatic was 11 (8 %) (P< 0. 001). The majority of the symptomatic <b>family</b> <b>members</b> (13 (57 %)) had a high Brucella titer in comparison to one (9 %) of the asymptomatic group (P< 0. 001). Acute brucellosis was diagnosed and treated in 18 (78 %) of the symptomatic seropositive <b>family</b> <b>members</b> and in four (36 %), of the asymptomatic seropositive <b>family</b> <b>members</b> with an acute brucellosis prevalence rate of 22 (12 %).

40|$|Abstract Background Receiving {{a cancer}} {{diagnosis}} affects <b>family</b> <b>members</b> {{as well as}} the person diagnosed. <b>Family</b> <b>members</b> often provide support for the sick person in daily life out of duty and love, and may not always think of their own vulnerability to illness. To individualise support for them, <b>family</b> <b>members</b> who are most at risk for becoming ill must be identified. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of patients with advanced lung or gastrointestinal cancer 3 to 15 [*]months after diagnosis. Methods Data on mental and physical dimensions of HRQOL were collected from <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of these patients in this prospective quantitative study. Five assessments using the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF- 36) and EuroQol (EQ- 5 D) were conducted during a 1 -year period starting 3 [*]months after diagnosis. Thirty-six <b>family</b> <b>members</b> completed the study, i. e. participated in all five data collections. Results No statistically significant changes in physical or mental HRQOL within the study group appeared over the 1 -year follow-up. Compared with norm-based scores, <b>family</b> <b>members</b> had significantly poorer mental HRQOL scores throughout the year as measured by the SF- 36. <b>Family</b> <b>members</b> also scored statistically significantly worse on the EQ- 5 D VAS in all five assessments compared to the norm-based score. Findings showed that older <b>family</b> <b>members</b> and partners were at higher risk for decreased physical HRQOL throughout the 1 -year period, and younger <b>family</b> <b>members</b> were at higher risk for poorer mental HRQOL. Conclusions It is well known that ill health is associated with poor HRQOL. By identifying <b>family</b> <b>members</b> with poor HRQOL, those at risk of ill health can be identified and supported. Future large-scale research that verifies our findings is needed before making recommendations for individualised support and creating interventions best tailored to <b>family</b> <b>members</b> at risk for illness. </p...|$|R

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that persons who use drugs (PWUD) in Vietnam {{who are also}} HIV-positive may face additional challenges in psychosocial outcomes, and these challenges may extend to their <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> In this study, we examined depressive symptoms, stigma, social support, and caregiver burden of HIV-positive PWUD and their <b>family</b> <b>members,</b> compared to the outcomes of HIV-negative PWUD and their <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> Baseline, 3 -month, and 6 -month assessment data were gathered from 83 PWUD and 83 <b>family</b> <b>members</b> recruited from four communes in Phú Thọ Province, Vietnam. For PWUD, although we observed a general decline in overall stigma over time for both groups, HIV-positive PWUD consistently reported significantly higher overall stigma for all three periods. Depressive symptoms among <b>family</b> <b>members</b> in both groups declined over time; however, <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of HIV-positive PWUD reported higher depressive symptoms across all three periods. In addition, <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of HIV-positive PWUD reported lower levels of tangible support across all three periods. Caregiver burden among <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of HIV-positive PWUD increased significantly over time, whereas the reported burden among <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of HIV-negative PWUD remained relatively unchanged. The findings highlight the need for future interventions for PWUD and <b>family</b> <b>members,</b> with targeted and culturally specific strategies {{to focus on the}} importance of addressing additional stigma experienced by PWUD who are HIV-positive. Such challenges may have direct negative impact on their family members' depressive symptoms, tangible support, and caregiver burden...|$|R
