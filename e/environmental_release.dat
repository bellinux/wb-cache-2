A further <b>environmental</b> flow <b>release</b> of 7 % MANF will be reliant on cost savings by irrigators west of the great-dividing range. The <b>environmental</b> flow <b>releases</b> will be {{delivered}} to the Snowy River downstream of Jindabyne Dam to improve the physical and ecological integrity of the river. The first <b>environmental</b> flow was <b>released</b> from the Mowamba Weir on 28 August 2002.
