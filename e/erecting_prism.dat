40|$|Introduction Display {{devices for}} mixed reality systems are {{expected}} to produce synthesized images of high quality in real-time. We have been developing displays with a capability of correct occlusion phenomena between real and virtual images, which is important to make synthesized images convincing. Among two major types of see-through displays, optical one is hard to represent mutual occlusion phenomena since virtual objects become transparent due to a half mirror and the real image is always visible through the virtual image (ghost problem). However, we chose an optical approach because they preserve real images' intrinsic quality while video see-through approach inevitably degrades the real images in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. We attacked the ghost problem by novel optics that has two convex lenses of same focal length and an <b>erecting</b> <b>prism,</b> thereby making a kind of telescope of one magnification [1]. Then by locating an LCD panel between the lenses, any portion of...|$|E
50|$|In a {{roof prism}} without a phase-correcting coating, s-polarized and p-polarized light each acquire a {{different}} geometric phase {{as they pass}} through the upper prism. When the two polarized components are recombined, interference between the s-polarized and p-polarized light results in a different intensity distribution perpendicular to the roof edge as compared to that along the roof edge. This effect reduces contrast and resolution in the image perpendicular to the roof edge, producing an inferior image compared to that from a porro <b>prism</b> <b>erecting</b> system. This roof edge diffraction effect may {{also be seen as}} a diffraction spike perpendicular to the roof edge generated by bright points in the image.|$|R
50|$|In {{binoculars}} with roof prisms {{the light}} path is {{split into two}} paths that reflect {{on either side of}} the roof prism ridge. One half of the light reflects from roof surface 1 to roof surface 2. The other half of the light reflects from roof surface 2 to roof surface 1. This causes the light to become partially polarized (due to a phenomenon called Brewster's angle). During subsequent reflections the direction of this polarization vector is changed but it is changed differently for each path in a manner similar to a Foucault pendulum. When the light following the two paths is recombined the polarization vectors of each path do not coincide. The angle between the two polarization vectors is called the phase shift, or the geometric phase, or the Berry phase. This interference between the two paths with different geometric phase results in a varying intensity distribution in the image reducing apparent contrast and resolution compared to a porro <b>prism</b> <b>erecting</b> system. These unwanted interference effects can be suppressed by vapor depositing a special dielectric coating known as a phase-correction coating or P-coating on the roof surfaces of the roof prism. This coating corrects for the difference in geometric phase between the two paths so both have effectively the same phase shift and no interference degrades the image.|$|R
