40|$|Witness {{testimony}} {{in a trial}} is a first-person narrative (Olsson 2004) or sub-narrative (Tiersma 1999) which is elicited by the <b>direct</b> <b>examiner,</b> and precedes the prosecution lawyer’s cross-examination. The present investigation quantitatively and qualitatively examines a corpus of a dozen transcripts (1844 - 1887) of the trial proceedings of female prisoners charged with the offence of birth concealing. The transcripts were selected from The Old Bailey Proceedings Online, a fully searchable website providing accounts of all the trials of crimes committed in London and Middlesex between 1674 and 1834. Direct and indirect speech are used alternatively in the narratives by the witnesses {{in an attempt to}} reproduce the actual dialogues that occurred at the time in which the offence was discovered and the dead body of a newborn was found. Indirect speech is a rephrasing or paraphrasing of original speech and is generally acknowledged as a more complex communicative strategy than direct speech, which is usually a mere mimicking of the original words through which reporters act out the role of the reported speaker providing a vivid and dramatic presentation (Li in Coulmas, 1986, p. 40). On the other hand, as Tannen (in Coulmas, 1986, p. 320) underlines, the attribution of “exact fidelity” to quoted dialogue can be considered “naïve to the point of absurdity”. Applying the notion of “speaker commitment” to appraise veracity in language (Olsson, 2004, p. 123), the present study tries to ascertain whether indirect speech can be considered as an example of “distancing language”, testifying witnesses’ resolve to distance themselves from their statements, in juxtaposition with quoted dialogue as an instance of “associative language”, showing witnesses’ commitment and emotional involvement in reporting the event and their readiness to add precision in order to enhance their credibility. ...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{supervisory}} {{agencies have}} streamlined the bank examination process {{to focus attention}} on identified risk areas rather than the full scope of bank operations (Board of Governors, 1997). If supervisors can identify the potential risks, they can recommend preventive measures and respond more quickly to actual banking problems when they arise. Because of this shift to risk-focused supervision, off-site surveillance of banks has become much more important. Supervisory economists and staff who gather and interpret bank and economic data must <b>direct</b> <b>examiners</b> to areas of heightened risks. Historical experience in the financial services industry demonstrates that institutions exposed to serious risk can run into trouble quickly. Many commercial banks were exposed to fluctuations in commercial real estate markets {{in the latter half of}} the 1980 s. A sharp decline in real estate prices caused several hundred banks to fail (FDIC, 1997). In addition, agricultural bank failures represented a large share of the banks that failed from 1984 to 1987. These failures occurred within a few years after the peak in farmland prices, reflecting the inability of agricultural banks to absorb the losses accruing from falling farm incomes (Kliesen and Gilbert, 1996). Because these banks were not diversified in terms of geography or industry, the losses eventually overwhelmed the equity accumulated during the prosperous years. If exposure to these risks had been targeted as potential problems earlier, they might have been addressed sooner and their negative impacts dampened. Andrew P. Meyer is an economist, and Timothy J.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Ten states concentrated in the western, midwestern, and southeastern United States [...] all areas where the housing market had experienced strong growth in the prior decade [...] experienced 10 or more commercial bank or thrift (bank) failures between 2008 and 2011. The failures of the smaller banks (those with less than $ 1 billion in assets) in these states were largely driven by credit losses on commercial real estate (CRE) loans. The failed banks also had often pursued aggressive growth strategies using nontraditional, riskier funding sources and exhibited weak underwriting and credit administration practices. Fair value accounting also has been cited as a potential contributor to bank failures, but between 2007 and 2011 fair value accounting losses in general {{did not appear to}} be a major contributor, as over two-thirds of small failed banks' assets were not subject to fair value accounting. During the course of our work, some state banking associations said that the magnitude of the credit losses were exacerbated by federal bank examiners' classification of collateral-dependent loans and evaluation of appraisals used by banks to support impairment analysis of these loans. Federal banking regulators noted that regulatory guidance on CRE workouts issued in October 2009 <b>directed</b> <b>examiners</b> not to require banks to write down loans to an amount less than the loan balance solely because the value of the underlying collateral had declined, and that examiners were generally not expected to challenge the appraisals obtained by banks unless they found that underlying facts or assumptions about the appraisals were inappropriate or could support alternative assumptions. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: One of {{the methods}} used for {{standard}} setting is the borderline regression method (BRM). This study aims to assess the reliability of BRM when the pass-fail standard in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) was calculated by averaging the BRM standards obtained for each station separately. Materials and Methods: In nine stations of the OSCE with <b>direct</b> observation the <b>examiners</b> gave each student a checklist score and a global score. Using a linear regression model for each station, we calculated the checklist score cut-off on the regression equation for the global scale cut-off set at 2. The OSCE pass-fail standard was defined as the average of all station′s standard. To determine the reliability, the root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated. The R 2 coefficient and the inter-grade discrimination were calculated to assess the quality of OSCE. Results: The mean total test score was 60. 78. The OSCE pass-fail standard and its RMSE were 47. 37 and 0. 55, respectively. The R 2 coefficients ranged from 0. 44 to 0. 79. The inter-grade discrimination score varied greatly among stations. Conclusion: The RMSE of the standard was very small indicating that BRM is a reliable method of setting standard for OSCE, which has the advantage of providing data for quality assurance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The present {{dilemma in}} {{providing}} dental {{services to the}} indigent and Medicaid recipients throughout this nation has generated considerable controversy as {{to the evolution of}} the problem. Most states recognize that there are deficiencies in the provision of dental services to these populations and are seeking resolutions. While state licensing board practices and dental professional society politics have been the object of criticism as contributing to if not causing of this problem, other rational and statistically valid explanations for the current difficulty exist. As an explanation for access to care issues, this paper explores the decline in the national numbers of dental practitioners and concomitant dental productivity. Furthermore, it relates those parameters to the dramatic rise in the utilization and demand for dental services resulting from a robust economy, population growth trends, and changes in state and federal Medicaid legislation that increase numbers of Medicaid-eligible recipients. While these general trends are national in scope and application, the state of North Carolina and its experience will be used to fully explore the impact of these trends {{at the state and local}} level.

Research, books, and articles have been published on the analysis and interpretation of bloodstain patterns We present a case study of a road traffic accident in which bloodstain {{pattern analysis}} helped us to solve the discrepancy between reports produced by forensic examiners and by the forensic biology department. The case was of a 22 -year-old man who died immediately and a 31 - year-old woman who survived a road traffic accident. They were both found outside their overturned car and it was impossible to ascertain from initial observations which of the victims was driving the car at the time of the accident. An external examination of the man revealed multiple injuries, and the cause of his death was severe brain injury. The woman survived with a fracture of the forearm, dislocated clavicle bone, and other minor injuries. After initial examination of the car and based on the pattern of injuries the deceased received, forensic examiner concluded that the man was the driving the car at the time of accident. On the other hand, the forensic DNA analysis of bloodstains obtained from the driver's seat matched that of the woman, suggesting that she was the driver. This apparent discrepancy <b>directed</b> the forensic <b>examiner</b> to carry out a bloodstain pattern analysis on the driver's seat.

40|$|Attention {{impairments}} {{are well}} documented {{in children with}} autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Under associative accounts of early word learning, the attention impairments in children with ASD preclude them from developing effective learning strategies. In this study we examined whether children with ASD utilize the same attention cues for learning as their unaffected receptive-vocabulary mates. In a word-learning task, we asked: 1) whether hearing novel and attention-grabbing words cued children to shift {{their attention to the}} speaker, and 2) whether the children followed the gaze of the speaker to determine the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s focus of attention. We taught novel words in two conditions. One condition provided maximal social-attention scaffolding; the examiner followed the focus of the child 2 ̆ 7 s attention. The other was less scaffolded; the <b>examiner</b> <b>directed</b> the child 2 ̆ 7 s attention to the target using eye gaze. We manipulated the number of objects present during teaching, two versus four, to examine the effect of non-social attention scaffolding with scaffolding here defined as a reduction in distractions. Fifteen-children with ASD (ages 36 - 91 months) were matched to fifteen unaffected children (ages 16 - 92 months) on the basis of receptive vocabulary (RVM group). The ASD group 2 ̆ 7 s performance differed from the RVM group 2 ̆ 7 s performance on one measure: shifting attention to the speaker upon hearing a novel or attention-grabbing word on the initial trial. On all other measures, the ASD group 2 ̆ 7 s performance did not significantly differ from the RVM group 2 ̆ 7 s performance. Although there was not a significant effect of condition, closer analysis revealed that in the RVM and ASD groups, only the consistent-gaze followers 2 ̆ 7 performed better than chance on the word-learning tasks. We hypothesize that, when all else is equal, providing a label does not make the target distinct enough to support word-referent pairings for children who are not consistently attending to the speaker. Overall, the ASD group demonstrated greater within group variability in their attention than the RVM group. Gaze following was variable across (and within) the ASD group. The within subject variability suggests some children with ASD are slow to appreciate eye gaze cues in unfamiliar contexts...|$|R
40|$|Background: Objective {{structured}} {{clinical examination}} (OSCE), {{an important tool}} for assessment of clinical skills, introduced more than 4 decades ago. KIST Medical College, a new medical school of Nepal, affiliated to Tribhuvan University Institute of Medicine, has made learning of physical examination skills structured and integrated with greater involvement of different clinical science departments. Students learn physical examination skills in second year MBBS {{as a part of}} early clinical exposure. Objective: To share the experiences regarding implementation of integrated OSCE. Materials and Methods: At the end of clinical posting of learning of physical examination skills, assessment was done with OSCE. Fifteen OSCE stations including each of 5 minutes were developed and arranged. Standardized patients and validated checklist were used. OSCE was conducted in novel way. Prior to the OSCE session: Suitable venue was selected, assessors were identified, standardized patients were selected, running order of the stations in circuit was developed, list of equipments/instruments required was prepared, and tasks, checklists, feedback questionnaires were printed. The day before the OSCE session: OSCE stations were inspected and clearly labeled, condition of required equipments/instruments was checked, a pack of the documents for each OSCE station were made available, and signs were displayed at proper places. On the day of the OSCE session: Reliable stop watch and loud manual bell were used, support staffs were placed to <b>direct</b> the candidates, <b>examiners,</b> and standardized patients (SPs), assessors explained SPs, students were briefed, supervisors observed the session, and feedback were taken from students, assessors, and SPs. At the end of the OSCE session: Checklists and feedback questionnaires were collected, token money was paid to SPs, and a contribution of everyone was appreciated. After the OSCE session: Score was compiled and result declared, and feedback questionnaires data compiled and shared with academic team. Results: Ninety eight percent of the students attended the OSCE session. All agreed that standardized patient were co-operative, 93 % found the faculty′s presentation as non-threatening where as 99 % found the overall OSCE environment conducive. Most (92 %) of the faculties found the selection of simulated patients appropriate, and all were satisfied with student′s approach towards SP. All expressed satisfaction with the overall management. Only 250 US dollars expended for conducting session. Conclusion: Integrated OSCE session was organized in novel way and cost effectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationships between age, sex, eye-hand coordination, the time it takes individuals to learn how to manipulate dental floss between all of their teeth, and the time it takes individuals to learn how to effectively clean their teeth with dental floss. The subjects consisted of 117 elementary students from two schools in Lebanon, Oregon. Twenty-eight eight year olds, 27 ten year olds, 32 nine year olds, and 30 eleven year olds were selected from Queen Anne's and Santiam Schools. The second and fourth grade classes were selected from Santiam School, while the third and fifth grade classes were chosen from Queen Anne's School. The eye-hand coordination skills of the student were examined by using a speed and accuracy marble manipulation test called the Moore Eye-Hand Coordination Test. The scores on the test not only indicated each individual's eye-hand coordination ability, but also helped differentiate the students within the sample population so that they could be compared to other groups of elementary students. A student's ability to manipulate the dental floss between all of the teeth was determined by <b>direct</b> observation. <b>Examiners</b> observed the students while they attempted the flossing techniques and noted whether they could manipulate the floss between all of the interproximal surfaces. The amount of plaque left on one and one-half millimeter wide sections of 12 predetermined surfaces of six teeth was measured by the Flossing Performance Index. Plaque buildup was rated from zero to three, zero indicating no plaque formation while a score of three indicated that the plaque covered the entire one and one-half millimeter wide section. To pass the Flossing Performance Index a student would have had to achieve at least a 50 percent reduction in plaque from a pretest rating, and a score of 13 or less on the same index. Each student was required to practice the flossing technique until he could pass the Flossing Performance Index. Four general hypotheses were considered: Hypothesis I: There is a significant relationship between age and eye-hand coordination, flossing manipulation skill, and flossing effectiveness, Hypothesis II: There is a significant relationship between sex and eye-hand coordination, flossing manipulation skill, and flossing effectiveness. Hypothesis III: There is a significant relationship between eye-hand coordination and flossing manipulation skill, and flossing effectiveness. Hypothesis IV: Age, sex and eye-hand coordination scores, separately or in combination, are good predictors of flossing manipulation skill and flossing effectiveness. Two null hypotheses were also tested. Hypothesis V: There is no significant difference between males and females at the eight, nine, ten, and eleven year old age levels in regard to eye-hand coordination, flossing manipulation skill, and flossing effectiveness. Hypothesis VI; There is no significant difference between any of the four age groups (eight, nine, ten, and eleven year olds) in reference to eye-hand coordination, flossing manipulation skill, and flossing effectiveness. In summary, the following conclusions were made: 1. Eye-hand coordination, sex and age are related to the time it takes a student to learn how to manipulate dental floss between all of the teeth, and the time it takes a student to learn how to effectively floss his or her teeth. 2. Eye-hand coordination and age are the most critical variables in relation to the time it takes a student to learn how to manipulate dental floss between all of the teeth, and the time it takes a student to learn how to effectively floss his or her teeth. 3. The variables of eye-hand coordination, sex and age will not predict, at the 95 percent level of confidence, the exact number of days it takes a student to learn how to manipulate dental floss between all of the teeth, and the time it takes a student to learn how to effectively floss his or her teeth. 4. All eight, nine, ten and eleven year old elementary students in this investigation were able to learn how to effectively clean their teeth with dental floss within ten, seven, six, and five days, respectively. 5. Hypotheses II and IV were rejected while hypotheses I and III were not rejected. Null hypothesis V was rejected for the eight year olds on the time it took students to learn how to manipulate floss between all of the teeth, and for eleven year olds on eye-hand coordination, and on the time it took students to effectively clean the teeth with dental floss. Null hypothesis VI was rejected only for the following age groups: eight and nine, eight and ten, eight and eleven, and nine and eleven...|$|R
40|$|SHARING ONLINE LABORATORIES AND THEIR COMPONENTS A new {{learning}} experience KJELL O. JEPPSON, PER LUNDGREN, JESUS A. DEL ALAMO*, JAMES L. HARDISON*, DAVID ZYCH* Chalmers University of Technology, MC 2, SE- 41296 Göteborg,Sweden, *Massachussetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA 1. INTRODUCTION In this paper {{we report on}} the use of the online MIT Weblab system [1] for characterization of semiconductor devices in three qualitatively rather diverse microelectronic device courses offered by Chalmers University of Technology, including junior undergraduate courses as well as extension courses. In particular we will focus on the learning situation and the impact of class size. Since the laboratory equipment is available online 24 hours-a-day every day during the course, new opportunities for integrating laboratories into the learning process have become available. In particular, we will discuss the role of assignment formulation to support this new learning situation. In this paper we will describe our experiences from using the MIT online laboratory to shift student focus from instrument handling to data analysis, parameter extraction, and model fitting. This can be done through rather open lab assignments where the students themselves can organize the details of their specific task within the context of the overall objective of the laboratory exercise. 2. ABOUT WEBLAB In a topic like microelectronic device physics the student {{learning experience}} can be substantially enhanced by hands-on characterization of diodes and transistors. However, for a variety of practical and economic reasons universities have found it more and more difficult to include such a laboratory component. A remote laboratory available over the internet solves many of these concerns while largely preserving, or even enhancing, the educational experience. Online remote laboratories not only offer the possibility to perform traditional laboratory exercises in a more cost effective way, but they also make available to students more advanced instruments than have traditionally been affordable. Many institutions in different fields have explored this concept of an online laboratory. One such joint European remote laboratory network is presently being developed within the EU Socrates/ Minerva framework [2]. Over the last few years, MIT has been experimenting with a system called the MIT Microelectronics WebLab. This system allows microelectronic device characterization through the world wide web. Through WebLab, students can take current-voltage measurements on transistors and other microelectronics devices in real time from anywhere and at any time. The basic architecture of the system and its use in a variety of educational settings was reported in [3]. The user interface for WebLab is a Java applet which duplicates the essential functionality of the analyzers console, see Fig. 1, allowing the user to set up a measurement for one of the devices that is currently connected to the system (the necessary information about these devices is provided by the server when the applet loads). When the user is ready to execute a measurement, the applet sends the measurement specifications to the server. More details of the WebLab system and its graphical interface are given elsewhere [4]. 3. SHORT DESCRIPTION OF CHALMERS COURSES AND MISSION TASK The WebLab has so far been used remotely in three different courses offered by Chalmers University. Following two small test runs (one in an elective graduate course (eight users) and one in a extension course offered to professionals working in local industry (six users), WebLab was employed in a large compulsory junior undergraduate course with about 330 students during the spring of 2003. In all courses students were given a clear objective of the laboratory task and what was expected of them. A simple instruction was given that advanced technology transistors of four different types were available through MIT WebLab. Examination of the lab assignment in the undergraduate course was performed through group meetings where an <b>examiner</b> <b>directed</b> individual questions to the lab group members who were to respond with the help of a whiteboard. Individual credits were rewarded to the group members according to performance in this oral examination. The communication between MIT WebLab administration and Chalmers course management was conducted by e-mail and for the two small courses the planning could be settled with some ten mails and replies. 4. EVALUATION The online laboratory experiments were evaluated through detailed discussions Fig. 1. Screen-shot of WebLab graphical interface: the main window. with students in the graduate courses and through written review questionnaires handed in by students in the undergraduate course. The overall impression on the use of online laboratories among engineering program students was generally very positive. A summary of the evaluation regarding system access and stability, user friendliness, and educational value is shown in Fig. 2. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 M iserable Poor OK H igh Outstanding Responses A cce ssib ility and stability Use r friendliness Educa tional value Fig. 2. Summary outcome of evaluation questionnaire. Students appreciated most that they could decide themselves when to do the laboratory exercises. This was perceived as less stressful [than traditional evening laboratory classes]. They also appreciated the graphical interface, because you could see the graphs clearly and it was excellent when analysing data. The most severe drawbacks were the system instabilities. The system was instable when many students were logged on simultaneously: First you could not access the home-page at all, and then once you managed to log in it kept on crashing. 5. OUTCOME: THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE OF A LARGE STUDENT CLASS The use of WebLab in the undergraduate course at Chalmers was the largest and most ambitious deployment of WebLab to date. On Feb 25, 2003, there were 134 characterization experiments executed in a single hour (on average that means a job every 27 seconds). An experiment this scale was bound to result in the identification of new problems that had never been seen before when operating at lighter loads. Two kinds of problems were encountered. First, there was a handful of system blackouts during which WebLab was unavailable for measurements. Second, the system returned an error message in response to a valid experimental setup. The origin of both types of errors was identified and corrected. 6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In our experiment with online laboratories we had an explicit purpose to get away from traditional closed-form laboratories. In that type of laboratory students devote most of their time to handling of the instruments to collect device data following a step-by-step instruction manual, frequently asking the teaching assistant for help to find a short-cut to the next step. In an online computer-based laboratory, instrument handling can be minimized through the WebLab graphical user interface. Thereby, the student focus can be shifted to data analysis, parameter extraction, and model fitting. In essence, online laboratories enables the students to take a more active role in defining the scope of the assignment  they can do measurements when they feel ready for them and re-do them when and if need arises [5]. However, new opportunities also mean new challenges, for instance when it comes to finding a text book to support the new learning process. Traditionally, most text books do not contain detailed experimental sections. One exception is the book by Pierret [6] that contains an excellent description of experimental diode setups, but it leaves the readers on their own when it comes to transistor characterization. One wonders who will become the first text book author to include a description of the transistor parameter analyzer in their book? Some problems encountered in the course of this experiment had a more negative impact on the overall experience of the undergraduate students at Chalmers University when compared to MIT students using WebLab in MIT courses. There are two reasons for this. First, at Chalmers students worked in groups, while at MIT students assignments were of an individual nature. This is relevant because at Chalmers, students had to make an appointment to work together on their lab assignments at a specific time. If the system was not available or if the system did not operate properly at that very time, students were forced to reschedule leading to frustration and possible project delay. In an individual assignment, a student has a lot more flexibility to schedule their work and the consequences of system malfunction are much less severe. The second reason for the negative impact of systems problems in the overall educational experience of the Chalmers students is the time zone difference between Chalmers and MIT. As a consequence, several hours could pass between the occurrence of a system problem and its satisfactory resolution, this even if the problem was of a trivial nature and its solution would only take a few seconds. 7.
