As Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi help to {{evacuate}} Midgar, which {{is about to be}} destroyed by Sephiroth's Meteor spell, Vincent finds the body of Professor Hojo slumped at the controls of the Sister Ray cannon. After a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning,</b> Hojo's body seems to disappear, and before Vincent can investigate, the cannon explodes, forcing Vincent to escape with Yuffie.|$|E
5|$|The goddesses {{find and}} restore Osiris's body, {{often with the}} help of other deities, {{including}} Thoth, a deity credited with great magical and healing powers, and Anubis, the god of embalming and funerary rites. Osiris becomes the first mummy, and the gods' efforts to restore his body are the mythological basis for Egyptian embalming practices, which sought to prevent and reverse the decay that follows death. This part of the story is often extended with episodes in which Set or his followers try to damage the corpse, and Isis and her allies must protect it. Once Osiris is made whole, Isis conceives his son and rightful heir, Horus. One ambiguous spell in the Coffin Texts may indicate that Isis is impregnated by a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning,</b> while in other sources, Isis, still in bird form, fans breath and life into Osiris's body with her wings and copulates with him. Osiris's revival is apparently not permanent, and after this point in the story he is only mentioned as the ruler of the Duat, the distant and mysterious realm of the dead. Although he lives on only in the Duat, he and the kingship he stands for will, in a sense, be reborn in his son.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the day had}} dawned {{clear and}} fine, as the knights and their entourages {{struggled}} to organise the parade the sky began to darken. Just {{at the moment when}} the parade was finally arranged— just as Lady Somerset, the Queen of Beauty, was heralded by trumpets— there was a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning,</b> a great crash of thunder, and the black clouds of Ayrshire let loose with a sudden and violent rainstorm.|$|E
25|$|Anaximander {{attributed}} some phenomena, such as {{thunder and}} lightning, {{to the intervention}} of elements, rather than to divine causes. In his system, thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other; the loudness of the sound is proportionate {{with that of the}} shock. Thunder without lightning {{is the result of the}} wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to produce a sound. A <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls, allowing a less active fire to break free. Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow.|$|E
25|$|On one stormy night, the landlord, Huang Shiren, {{and several}} of his other {{servants}} come to the temple to worship and provide offerings. Their trip is stopped by the thunderstorm. It just so happens that Xi'er is now in the temple too, and by the light of a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning,</b> the landlord sees her—with her long white hair and shabby clothes that have been weathered to nearly white. He thinks it is the reincarnation of a goddess who has come to punish him for his mistreatment of Xi'er and other despotisms. He is so frightened that he is literally paralyzed. Xi'er recognizes that it is her arch-enemy and seizes the opportunity to take further revenge. She picks up the brass incense burner and hurls it against the landlord. The landlord and his gang flee.|$|E

25|$|Within a {{considerable}} radius {{from the surface}} of the nuclear fireball, 0–3kilometers—largely depending on the explosion's height, yield and position of personnel—ducking and covering would offer negligible protection against the intense heat, blast and prompt ionizing radiation following a nuclear explosion. Beyond that range, however, many lives would be saved by following the simple advice, especially since at that range the main hazard is not from ionizing radiation but from blast injuries and sustaining thermal flash burns to unprotected skin. Furthermore, following the bright flash of light of the nuclear fireball, the explosion's blast wave would take from first light, 7 to 10 seconds to reach a person standing 3km {{from the surface of}} the nuclear fireball, with the exact time of arrival being dependent on the speed of sound in air in their area. The time delay between the moment of an explosions flash and the arrival of the slower moving blast wave is analogous to the commonly experienced time delay between the observation of a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> and the arrival of thunder during a lightning storm, thus at the distances that the advice would be most effective, there would be more than ample amounts of time to take the prompt countermeasure of 'duck and cover' against the blast's direct effects and flying debris. For very large explosions it can take 30 seconds or more, after the silent moment of flash, for a potentially dangerous blast wave over-pressure to arrive at, or hit, your position.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the reception for Crane's poetry, The Red Badge of Courage was welcomed with acclaim after its publication by Appleton in September 1895. [...] For the next four months the book was in the top six on various bestseller lists around the country. [...] It arrived on the literary scene [...] "like a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> out of a clear winter sky", according to H. L. Mencken, who was about 15 at the time. [...] The novel also became popular in Britain; Joseph Conrad, a future friend of Crane, wrote that the novel [...] "detonated... with the impact and force of a twelve-inch shell charged with a very high explosive." [...] Appleton published two, possibly three, printings in 1895 {{and as many as}} eleven more in 1896. [...] Although some critics considered the work overly graphic and profane, it was widely heralded for its realistic portrayal of war and unique writing style. [...] The Detroit Free Press declared that The Red Badge would give readers [...] "so vivid a picture of the emotions and the horrors of the battlefield that you will pray your eyes may never look upon the reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whilst {{the style}} of Giorgione's {{painting}} clearly relates to that of his presumed master, Giovanni Bellini, his subject matter makes {{him one of the}} most original and abstruse artists of the Renaissance. One of his paintings, of a landscape known as The Tempest, with a semi-naked woman feeding a baby, a clothed man, some classical columns and a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning,</b> perhaps represents Adam and Eve in their post-Eden days, or perhaps it does not.

2500|$|Helios was a {{child of}} Zeus by Euryphaessa. [...] He was also called [...] "the son of Earth and starry Heaven," [...] {{and the son of}} Hyperion. Dionysus was dithyrambus, [...] "he who entered life by a double door." [...] His first birth took place prematurely. His mother, Semele, died when Zeus {{appeared}} to her in a <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning,</b> and so Zeus opened his own flesh and enclosed the infant. [...] In time, Dionysus was born [...] "perfect" [...] from Zeus' thigh. [...] Dionysus Zagreus was important in Orphic theology. In Protrepticus ii. 14 ff. by Clement of Alexandria, this child had the form of a bull. [...] Zeus intended to make him the ruler of the universe but the jealous Titans lured the child away, tore him to pieces, cooked him and ate him. [...] Athena preserved his heart, however, which Zeus swallowed. [...] According to Boslooper, Clement omitted one part of the myth that forms a connection between his account and the Theban legend of Dionysus. [...] Because Zeus swallowed the heart of Dionysus Zagreus, when Semele bore Dionysus the new god was Zagreus reborn.|$|E
2500|$|Late in the {{day they}} heard , the Big Giant, approaching. [...] His {{footsteps}} shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink.

[...] The twins shouted back, [...] "What beautiful Big Thing is walking about? [...] And how shall we kill it?" [...] , the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly , the Wind, called [...] "Akóóh! Beware! Jump!" [...] and suddenly the twins found themselves standing {{on the end of a}} rainbow, just as , the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them. The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet. [...] , the Wind, whispered [...] "Keep low now!" [...] and [...] hurled his great blue knife. [...] It passed over them. [...] The Wind said, [...] "Jump to the right!" [...] and the great yellow knife of [...] passed just to their left. [...] "This is his last weapon," [...] whispered the Wind. [...] "Jump to the left. Now!" [...] The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them." [...] The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding <b>flash</b> <b>of</b> <b>lightning</b> came out of the sky and struck [...] the Giant on the side of the head. [...] The heavens shook with the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet. [...] Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at [...] [...] The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again. [...] The second brother then shot an arrow of sheet lightning which struck the giant in the chest. [...] He fell to both knees and began to fall forward, catching himself with his hands. [...] Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head. [...] fell face down on the ground. [...] Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and , the Wind said, [...] "Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!" [...] The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.|$|E
