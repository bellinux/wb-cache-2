500|$|Helicopter rotor and bamboo-copter: The {{use of a}} {{helicopter}} rotor for vertical flight has existed since 400 BC {{in the form of}} the bamboo-copter, an ancient Chinese toy. The bamboo-copter is spun by rolling a stick attached to a rotor. The spinning creates lift, and the toy flies when released. The Jin dynasty philosopher and politician Ge Hong's book the Baopuzi (Master Who Embraces Simplicity), written around 317, describes the apocryphal use of a possible rotor in aircraft: [...] "Some have made flying cars (feiche) with wood from the inner part of the <b>jujube</b> <b>tree,</b> using ox-leather (straps) fastened to returning blades so as to set the machine in motion." [...] British scientist and sinologist Joseph Needham concludes that this is a description of {{a helicopter}} top, because [...] "'returning (or revolving) blades' can hardly mean anything else, especially in close association with a belt or strap." [...] The Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci designed a machine known as an [...] "aerial screw" [...] with a rotor based on a water screw. The Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov developed a rotor based on the Chinese toy. The French naturalist Christian de Launoy constructed his rotor out of turkey feathers. The English aerospace engineer and inventor Sir George Cayley, inspired by the Chinese top in his childhood, created multiple vertical flight machines with rotors made of tin sheets. French engineer and inventor Alphonse Pénaud would later develop coaxial rotor model helicopter toys in 1870, powered by rubber bands. One of these toys, given as a gift by their father, would inspire the American inventors the Wright brothers to pursue the dream of modern flight.|$|E

40|$|In {{intercropping}} systems (growing > 1 {{species in}} a field), interactions between species affect {{the performance of}} plants and the overall yield. These interactions lead to plastic responses in plant traits due to the specific environmental conditions typical for intercrops, especially in agroforestry in which the understory crop is strongly shaded by the trees. To quantify the extent to how physiological plasticity is driven by inter-specific competition, field experiments with mixtures of cotton and <b>jujube</b> <b>trees</b> grown in strips were conducted in 2012 and 2013 in Hetian, Xinjiang, China. Cotton was grown at three levels of inter-specific competition, represented by {{the distance between the}} adjacent cotton and tree rows without change in plant density. The highest cotton yield was attained farthest away from the trees, i. e. at the lowest level of inter-specific competition, with a higher proportion of fiber in the bolls as well as a higher boll density compared to plants grown at higher inter-specific competition. Low inter-specific competition also increased maximum leaf area index (LAI), total light interception and dry matter accumulation. However, light-use efficiency was higher at high levels of inter-specific competition especially in the rows close to the tree line, associated with a higher fraction of diffuse radiation.

Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus, pH, and electrical conductivity were determined for all soil samples, and data were analyzed by the classic and geostatistical methods. Classic statistics showed that soil organic carbon, TN, total phosphorus, and electrical conductivity had moderate variability, and pH had low variability. Soil organic carbon and TN in the lower position were significantly greater than in the upper and middle positions (P < 0. 01), whereas pH in the middle slope was significantly greater than the other positions (P < 0. 01). The geostatistical statistics results showed that the soil chemical properties were defined by the exponential or spherical models. The nugget-to-sill ratios indicated that all soil chemical properties had moderate dependences. The results of cross-validation showed that spatial prediction maps from ordinary kriging method were reliable in the study slope (the kriged reduced mean square error higher than 0. 99 and the kriged average error close to 0).

As the Teacher says: [...] "The kite (bird) flies higher and higher spirally, and then only needs to stretch its two wings, beating the air no more, in order to go forward by itself. This is because it starts gliding (lit. riding) on the 'hard wind' 罡炁. Take dragons, for example; when they first rise they go up using the clouds as steps, and after they have attained a height of forty li then they rush forward effortlessly (lit. automatically) (gliding)." [...] This account comes from the adepts 仙人, and is handed down to ordinary people, but they are not likely to understand it.Needham concludes that Ge Hong was describing helicopter tops because [...] "'returning (or revolving) blades' can hardly mean anything else, especially in close association with a belt or strap"; and suggests that [...] "snakes", [...] "dragons", and [...] "oxen" [...] refer to shapes of man-lifting kites.

There, local ambient NO 2 concentrations originate from enhanced biogenic NO emission of intensively managed soils. Our target oasis "Milan" {{is located at}} the southern edge of the Taklimakan desert, very remote and well isolated from other potential anthropogenic and biogenic NO x sources. Four observation sites for MAX-DOAS measurements were selected, at the oasis centre, downwind and upwind of the oasis, and in the desert. Biogenic NO emissions in terms of (i) soil moisture and (ii) soil temperature of Milan oasis (iii) different land-cover type sub-units (cotton, <b>Jujube</b> <b>trees,</b> cotton/Jujube mixture, desert) were quantified by laboratory incubation of corresponding soil samples. Net potential NO fluxes were up-scaled to oasis scale by areal distribution and classification of land-cover types derived from satellite images using GIS techniques. A Lagrangian dispersion model (LASAT, Lagrangian Simulation of Aerosol Transport) was used to calculate the dispersion of soil emitted NO into the atmospheric boundary layer over Milan oasis. Three-dimensional (3 -D) NO concentrations (30 m horizontal resolution) have been converted to 3 -D NO 2 concentrations, assuming photostationary state conditions. NO 2 column densities were simulated by suitable vertical integration of modelled 3 -D NO 2 concentrations at those downwind and upwind locations, where the MAX-DOAS measurements were performed. Downwind–upwind differences (a direct measure of Milan oasis' contribution to the areal increase of ambient NO 2 concentration) of measured and simulated slant (as well as vertical) NO 2 column densities show excellent agreement. This agreement is considered as the first successful attempt to prove the validity of the chosen approach to up-scale laboratory-derived biogenic NO fluxes to ecosystem field conditions, i. e. from the spatial scale of a soil sample (cm 2) to the size of an entire agricultural ecosystem (km 2) ...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to increaseour understanding of the relationship between leaf and fruit water relations of jujube plants under dif-ferent irrigation conditions during fruit maturation, paying special attention to analysing whether fruitsize depends on fruit turgor. For this, adult <b>jujube</b> <b>trees</b> (cv. Grande de Albatera) were subjected to fiveirrigation treatments. Control plants (T 0) were irrigated daily above their crop water requirements inorder to attain non-limiting soil water conditions in 2012 and 2013. T 1 plants were subjected to deficitirrigation throughout the 2012 season, according to the criteria frequently used by the growers in thearea. T 2 (2012), T 3 and T 4 (2013) were irrigated as T 0 except during fruit maturation, in which irrigationwas withheld for 32, 17 and 24 days, respectively. The results indicated that the jujube fruit maturationperiod was clearly sensitive to water deficit. During most of this stage water could enter the fruits viathe phloem rather than via the xylem. From the beginning of water withholding to when maximumwater stress levels were achieved, fruit and leaf turgor were maintained in plants under water deficit. However, a direct relation between turgor and fruit size was not found in jujube fruits, which could bedue to an enhancement of a cell elasticity mechanism (elastic adjustment) which maintains fruit turgorby reducing fruit cells size or to the fact that jujube fruit growth depends on the fruit growth-effectiveturgor rather than just turgor pressure.

40|$|Effect of Goat Digestive Tractus on the Seeds Germination of Zizyphus mauritiana Lam. The <b>jujube</b> <b>tree</b> (Zizyphus mauritiana Lam.), a plant of {{numerous}} uses, native of Africa is threatened to extinction.

The results showed that isolated seeds obtained after breaking endocarpe gave the highest germination rate (88 %). In this case, seeds germinated sooner, five days after sowing. The fruits which have passed in transit in the digestive tube of goat presented germination rate (69 %) significantly more important than those of intact fruits (61 %). However, the germination rate of ingested fruits was, in average, more important {{than those of the}} seeds with endocarpe and no ingested (65 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Southern Xinjiang is a {{ecological}} vulnerable area, It mainly reflects in tree aspects: desertification, serious drought, saline-alkali, srong {{wind and}} dusty. <b>Jujube</b> <b>tree</b> can resist on drought, wind and dusty, saline-alkali, {{so we should}} develop jujube industry vigorously. This thesis description the natural ecological environment of Southern Xinjiang from geography environment, solar-thermal resource, water and land resource, and advantage {{of the development of}} jujube industry in Southern Xinjiang,analyses the existing problems during jujube industry development, puts forward solutions,so this thesis has a big guide meaning to healthy and sustainable development of jujube industry in Southern Xinjiang.

5000|$|The bowls for {{the stones}} are {{shaped like a}} {{flattened}} sphere with a level underside. The lid is loose fitting and upturned before play to receive stones captured during the game. Chinese bowls are slightly larger, {{and a little more}} rounded, a style known generally as Go Seigen; Japanese Kitani bowls tend to have a shape closer to that of the bowl of a snifter glass, such as for brandy. The bowls are usually made of turned wood. Mulberry is the traditional material for Japanese bowls, but is very expensive; wood from the Chinese <b>jujube</b> date <b>tree,</b> which has a lighter color (it is often stained) and slightly more visible grain pattern, is a common substitute for rosewood, and traditional for Go Seigen-style bowls. Other traditional materials used for making Chinese bowls include lacquered wood, ceramics, stone and woven straw or rattan. The names of the bowl shapes, [...] "Go Seigen" [...] and [...] "Kitani", were introduced {{in the last quarter of}} the 20th century by the professional player Janice Kim as homage to two 20th-century professional Go players by the same names, of Chinese and Japanese nationality, respectively, who are referred to as the [...] "Fathers of modern Go".|$|R
5|$|According to Hindu legend, god Vishnu sat in {{meditation}} at this place, keeping {{away from}} Thuling, {{a place in}} the Himalayas which was corrupted by meat-eating monks and unchaste people. During his meditation, Vishnu was unaware of cold weather. Lakshmi, his consort, protected him {{in the form of the}} Badri <b>tree</b> (<b>jujube</b> or Indian date). Pleased by the devotion of Lakshmi, Vishnu named the place Badrika Ashram. According to Atkinson (1979), the place used to be a jujube forest, which are not found there today. Vishnu in the form of Badrinath is depicted in the temple sitting in the padmasana posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by a sage, who saw Vishnu's consort Lakshmi massaging his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for a long time in padmasana.|$|R
