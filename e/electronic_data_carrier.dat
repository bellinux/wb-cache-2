Smartcards offer one means to this end {{in the form of}} a personal mobile security device. Personal data can be stored in a mobile personal environment instead of in a central database, and processor smartcards additionally provide a sort of pocket PC that can perform security functions at a higher level of security than an ordinary PC. Interoperability of different smartcards with different smartcard readers and data terminals is very important; therefore, standards exist for the structure of data objects on the card and for coding the commands sent to the card. Biometric user- authentication is becoming increasingly important for smartcards as an alternative to the previously used PIN or password authentication. Additional convenience for the user can be provided by contactless cards...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{documentation of}} footwear and tyre impressions in snow offers {{an opportunity to}} capture additional fine detail for the identification as present photographs. For this approach, up to now, different casting methods have been used. Casting of footwear impressions in snow {{has always been a}} difficult assignment. This work demonstrates that for the three-dimensional documentation of impressions in snow the non-destructive method of 3 D optical surface scanning is suitable. The new method delivers more detailed results of higher accuracy than the conventional casting techniques. The results of this easy to use and mobile 3 D optical surface scanner were very satisfactory in different meteorological and snow conditions. The method is also suitable for impressions in soil, sand or other materials. In addition to the side by side comparison, the automatic comparison of the 3 D models and the computation of deviations and accuracy of the data simplify the examination and delivers objective and secure results. The results can be visualized efficiently.

30|$|Decision {{feedback}} and smoothing information: using {{the maximum amount}} of <b>data</b> <b>carriers</b> to derive the channel estimate results in the best performance. However, this also leads to a higher computational complexity overhead. A possible technique to reduce this computational complexity is to lower the amount of used <b>data</b> <b>carriers.</b> This results in a degradation of the accuracy of the channel estimation though. To achieve a significant decrease in computation complexity, the amount of <b>data</b> <b>carriers</b> has to be lowered {{in such a way that}} the corresponding performance decrease is unacceptable. Therefore, it is chosen to use all <b>data</b> <b>carriers</b> when estimating the channel based on decision {{feedback and}} smoothing information.|$|R
