5|$|<b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> all {{the people}} who see us will be happy in knowing that we, despite being prisoners, {{we were able to do}} this. Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E
5|$|I'll be {{offering}} my vision when my campaign begins. And {{it will be}} comprehensive and sweeping. And <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> it will be compelling enough to draw people toward it. I feel that it will be. But it will emerge from my dialogue with the American people. I've traveled to every part of this country during the last six years. During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward {{a whole range of}} initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

25|$|When Fisher (First Sea Lord) and Churchill (First Lord of the Admiralty) {{both had}} to leave office (May 1915) after their quarrel over the Dardanelles, Jellicoe wrote to Fisher: “We owe you a debt of {{gratitude}} for having saved the Navy from a continuance in office of Mr Churchill, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> never again will any politician be allowed to usurp the functions that he took upon himself to exercise”.|$|E
25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E

25|$|Runs did not flow; {{they were}} grafted from a pitch which kept the batsman hopping around as {{delivery}} after delivery tickled their ribs. Colin was icily superb. For four hours his concentration never wavered...he stroked the ball through {{the cover and}} mid-wicket gaps in the field. Shooters became more frequent, but Colin dug them out. When I joined him at the wicket he was a run short of his maiden Test century: a goal he achieved with a scampered single. If he ever scored a better hundred <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> I am there to see it.|$|E

In January 2015, he joined Orphans in Need, an international NGO, as a Global Brand Ambassador and carried the charity's logo on his bat. Speaking after his stint at the crease, Moeen Ali said, “I enjoy {{coming back to the}} community where I grew up playing tapeball cricket. It keeps you grounded. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that,</b> as an ambassador for the charity, I can pass on some useful advice and help inspire children like the ones here today involved in StreetChance.|$|E

25|$|The P.A.B.C. {{initiative}} (Public Art Building Communities), {{has allowed}} me to make a bridge between the community, the Restaurant Mama Ayesha’s, the arts and all the people who have made this mural a reality. This could not be done without the support of all the community and the help of the DC Commission and the Restaurant and all the entities who funded the project. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> this mural will become a teaching tool of the History of the Presidents for schools, children and the public in general. This is a gift to the City of Washington DC to celebrate this historical moment in American History and will remain open to the public to see for generations to come. This is fulfilling the idea that mural art is available for the public and for the masses.|$|E
25|$|Why did I take my own life? Well, {{when you}} {{committed}} two double murders you would too. Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I think it should go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{reasoned}} {{conclusion of}} this study... that the sense of guilt created by the Vietnam war {{in the minds of}} many Americans is not warranted and that the charges of officially, condoned illegal and grossly immoral conduct are without substance. Indeed, detailed examination of battlefield practices reveals that the loss civilian life in Vietnam was less great than in World War II and Korea and that concern with minimizing the ravages of the war was strong. To measure and compare the devastation and loss of human life caused by different war will be objectionable to those who repudiate all resort to military force as an instrument of foreign policy and may be construed as callousness. Yet as long as wars do take place at all it remains a moral duty to seek to reduce the agony caused by war, and the fulfillment of this obligation should not be disdained. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> this book may help demonstrate that moral convictions are not the exclusive possession of persons in conscience opposed to war, and that those who in certain circumstances accept the necessity and ethical justification of armed conflict also do care about human suffering.|$|E

25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
