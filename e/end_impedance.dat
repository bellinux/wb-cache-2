The blading action on the flow through the compressor and turbine of an engine generates discrete frequency noise which, it is found, is enhanced by the response of the combustion zone in between. Ducted combustor experiments verify the predicted resonant type noise, the amplitude and frequency of which are strongly influenced by the duct dimensions and <b>end</b> <b>impedance.</b> A convergent exit nozzle results in stronger internal resonant noise oscillations but also generates a higher jet velocity, with the attendant jet noise which exceeds noise from inside the duct at jet Mach numbers near unity. ...|$|E

Tuning of the resonator may be achieved by inserting a screw into the central axis of the helix (Weston, 2001, p. 660). Other means of input and output coupling used are a wire loop coupling to the magnetic field near the shorted end, or a probe capacitively coupling near the open end. Coupling between resonators in a multi-resonator filter is often simply achieved with apertures in the shielding between them (Whittaker, 2000, p. 227).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{research}} involves {{active and}} adaptive-passive control {{problems that are}} related to thermoacoustic cooling. The basic issue is acoustic impedance control for one-dimensional sound wave in ducts. The goal is to replace the duct of a standing wave tube with a controlled or tunable boundary and thus reduce space requirements. In the active control approach a secondary driver is used to force the sound field as desired. Both single-input-single-output and two-input-two-output control schemes are formulated and implemented. Robust repetitive control was used for both cases, and satisfactory results from experiments have shown the feasibility of the proposed method. For the adaptive-passive control scheme, a tunable Helmholtz resonator is developed as an attachment to the existed thermoacoustic cooler to control the boundary conditions. A motor-driven mechanism drives the piston in the resonator such that the compliance of the <b>end</b> <b>impedance</b> can be changed. The cooling power is chosen as the variable to be maximized, as it is a better performance index to evaluate the cooling system. The acoustic impedance matching control is achieved implicitly. Extremum seeking control is applied for the adaptive-passive thermoacoustic cooler to maximize the cooling power via tuning the piston position and the driving frequency. Experimental results show the effectiveness of such control schemes in searching for the optimal cooling power with fixed and varying operating conditions. Improvement in terms of transient performance is observed by incorporating a proportional-derivative (PD) compensator in the control loop. ...|$|E

The imaging problem {{is characterized by the}} forward operator and its Jacobian. The Fisher information operator is defined for a deterministic parameter in a real Hilbert space and a stochastic measurement in a finite-dimensional complex Hilbert space with a Gaussian measure. The connection between the Fisher information and the singular value decomposition (SVD) based on the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion (the ML-based SVD) is established. It is shown that the eigenspaces of the Fisher information provide a suitable basis to quantify the trade-off between the accuracy and the resolution of the (nonlinear) inverse problem. It is also shown that the truncated ML-based pseudo-inverse is a suitable regularization strategy for a linearized problem, which exploits sufficient statistics for estimation within these subspaces. The statistical-based Cramér–Rao lower bound {{provides a}} complement to the deterministic upper bounds and the L-curve techniques that are employed with linearized inversion. To this <b>end,</b> electrical <b>impedance</b> tomography provides an interesting example where the eigenvalues of the SVD usually do not exhibit a very sharp cut-off, and a trade-off between the accuracy and the resolution may be of practical importance.

The λ/4 conductor acts as a transformer, converting the zero impedance at the short to the braid into an infinite impedance at the open <b>end.</b> This infinite <b>impedance</b> at the open end of the pipe prevents current flowing into the outer coax formed by the outside of the inner coax shield and the pipe, forcing the current to remain in the inside coax.

Solutions of the ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride, [C 2 mim]Cl, which contain both Cu+ and Cu 2 + ions, show current oscillations during potentiostatic polarization. The oscillations were analyzed by the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) technique and by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical oscillations are of the N-NDR-type, because the low frequency <b>end</b> of the <b>impedance</b> spectrum has negative real impedances. The oscillating current leads to an oscillating growth speed of a metallic copper layer. Besides the presence of both Cu+ and Cu 2 +, the presence of chloride is a necessary, yet not a sufficient, condition for the occurrence of current oscillations.

Most devices control complete joint trajectories and assume symmetry between both legs by either a position or an impedance control. However we believe that the control should not be on a joint level but on a subtask level (i. e. foot clearance, balance control). To this end we have chosen for virtual model control (VMC) to define a set of controllers that can assist in each of these tasks. Thus enabling the exoskeleton to offer selective support and evaluation of each substask during rehabilitation training. The bottleneck of the VMC performance is the ability to offer an <b>end</b> point <b>impedance</b> at the ankle as the arm between the joints is largest here.

40|$|An {{increase}} in photocurrent {{has been observed}} at silicon electrodes coated with nanostructured porous silica films as compared to bare, unmodified silicon. Ultimately, to utilize this effect in devices such as sensors or microchip power supplies, the physical phenomena behind this observation need to be well characterized. To this <b>end,</b> Electrochemical <b>Impedance</b> Spectroscopy (EIS) was used to characterize the effect of surfactant-templated mesoporous silica films deposited onto silicon electrodes on the electrical properties of the electrode space-charge region in an aqueous electrolyte solution, as the electrical properties of this space-charge region {{are responsible for the}} photobehavior of semiconductor devices. A significant shift in apparent flat-band potential was observed for electrodes modified with the silica film when compared to bare electrodes; the reliability of this data is suspect, however, due to contributions from surface states to the overall capacitance of the system. To assist in the interpretation of this EIS data, a series of measurements at Pt electrodes was performed with the hope of decoupling electrode and film contributions from the EIS spectra. Surprisingly, the frequency-dependent impedance data for Pt electrodes coated with a surfactant-templated film was nearly identical to that observed for bare Pt electrodes, indicating that the mesoporous film had little effect on the transport of small electrolyte ions to the electrode surface. Pore-blocking agents (tetraalkylammonium salts) were not observed to inhibit this transport process. However, untemplated (non-porous) silica films dramatically increased film resistance, indicating that our EIS data for the Pt electrodes is reliable. Overall, our preliminary conclusion is that a shift in electrical properties in the space-charge region induced by the presence of a porous silica film is responsible for the {{increase in}} observed photocurrent...|$|R
