This happens mostly over land and it is related to misrepresentation of specific aerosol conditions or surface properties. New satellite missions, based on high spectral resolution instruments, such as PRISMA (Hyperspectral Precursor of the Application Mission), represent a valuable opportunity to improve the accuracy of &tau;a 550 retrievable from a remote-sensing system developing new atmospheric measurement techniques. This paper aims to address the potential of these new observing systems in more accurate retrieving &tau;a 550 , specifically over land in heterogeneous and/or homogeneous areas composed by dark and bright targets. The study shows how the variation of the hyperspectral observed radiance can be addressed to recognise a variation of &Delta;&tau;a 550 = 0. 02. The goal has been achieved by using simulated radiances by combining two aerosol models (urban and continental) and two reflecting surfaces: dark (represented by water) and bright (represented by sand) for the PRISMA instrument, considering the environmental contribution of the observed radiance, i. e., the adjacency effect. Results showed that, in the continental regime, the expected instrument sensitivity would allow for retrieval accuracy of the aerosol optical thickness at 550 nm of 0. 02 or better, with a dark surface surrounded by dark areas. The study also showed that for the urban regime, the surface plays a more significant role, with a bright surface surrounded by dark areas providing favourable conditions for the aerosol load retrievals, and dark surfaces representing less suitable situations for inversion independently of the surroundings. However, over all, the results obtained provide evidence that high resolution observations of Earth spectrum between 400 and 1000 nm would allow for a significant improvement of {{the accuracy of the}} &tau;a 550 for anthropogenic/natural aerosols over land...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The Institute for Planetary Re-search has an {{expertise}} in spectroscopy of minerals, rocks, meteorites, and organic matter, {{build up in}} more than two decades. The available equipment allows spectroscopy from the visible to TIR range using bi-conical reflection and emission spectroscopy. The in-stitute has an outstanding heritage in designing and building <b>infrared</b> <b>remote-sensing</b> instruments for planetary missions. The heart of the spectroscopic facilities is the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) which has been completely refurbished in the last two years. The PEL allows now to measure the emissivity of planetary ana-logue materials from 3 - 50 μm for very fine grained samples. We will report here on the next development step of the PEL which is the addition of a planetary simula-tion chamber. This chamber will allow to measure samples under vacuum and at temperatures up to 500 °C. After this upgrade the PEL will be the first lab that can routinely measure the emissivity of fine grained samples from 1 to 50 μm over an extremely wide range of temperatures. The PEL: The PEL has been operating in various configurations for the last 10 years. The laboratory experimental facilities consist of the main emissivity spectrometer laboratory, a supporting spectrometer laboratory for reflectance measurements, sample preparation facilities and an extensive collection of rocks and minerals. The emissivity spectrometer laboratory has been upgraded in 2006 with a new Bruker VERTEX 80 V FTIR spectrometer. This spectrometer has a very high spectral resolution (better then 0. 2 cm- 1), and a resolv-ing power of better than 300, 000 : 1, and can be oper-ated under vacuum conditions to remove atmospheric features from the spectra. To cover the entire from 1 to 50 μm spectral range, two detectors, a liquid nitrogen cooled MTC (1 - 16 μm) and a room temperature DTGS (15 - 50 μm). two beamsplitter, a KBr and a Multilayer, and two entrance windows, KBr and CsI are used to measure the same target. The spectrometer is coupled to an emissivity cham-ber which has been developed at DLR. It is a double-walled box with three apertures: a 15 cm squared door used to insert the cup in the box, a 5 cm rounded open-ing through which the beam is directed to the spec-trometer and a 5 cm opening facing the attached black-body unit. A heater is placed in the chamber and is used to heat the cup with samples from the bottom. The thermal radiation emitted normal to the surface by the sample or the blackbody is collected by an Au-coated parabolic off-axis mirror and reflected to the entrance port of the spectrometer. Figure 2 shows the emissivity device attached to the spectrometer external port: the cover of the sample chamber is removed to show the parabolic mirror mounted on a mechanical arm and oriented toward the reference blackbody, the sample heater and the purging system. A pump circulates water at a constant temperature in the volume between the inner and outer walls of the chamber. The surfaces of the box are painted with black high emissivity paint. The chamber is purged with dry air to remove particulates, water vapour and CO 2. Further details can be found in [1, 2]. The PEL is with this setup since late summer 2007 in routine operation. In Figure 2 an example of quartz measurements for two extreme grain sizes is shown, together with analogue measurements extracted from the ASU and ASTER spectral libraries. Complemen-tary to the existing datasets (ASU and ASTER), the BED library sensibly extend both the investigated spectral range and the grain size ranges. The enormous difference between the spectra of the small and large fractions witness the need for such a complete dataset for a correct interpretation of remote sensing data. The Berlin Emissivity Database (BED) : One of the main tasks of the PEL is the creation of the Berlin Emissivity Database (BED) - a spectral library con-taining the emissivity measurements of several plane-tary analogues. It contains currently entries for more than 25 minerals including plagioclase and potassium feldspars, low Ca and high Ca pyroxenes, olivine, elemental sulphur, common martian analogues (JSC Mars- 1, Salten Skov, palagonites, montmorillonite) and a lunar highland soil sample all measured in the wavelength range from 3 to 50 μm as a function of particle size. For each sample, the spectra of four well defined particle size separates (< 25 μm, 25 - 63 μm, 63 - 125 μm, 125 - 250 μm) are measured with a 4 cm- 1 spectral resolution. These size separates have been selected as typical representations for most of the planetary surfaces [3]. The next step: For 2008 a major upgrade of the PEL is planned. A planetary simulation chamber will be replace the currently used chamber for most meas-urements. This chamber can be evacuated so that the complete optical path from the sample to the detector is free of any influence by atmospheric gases. The chamber will have an automatic sample transport sys-tem which allows to maintain the vacuum while chang-ing the samples. The main highlight however will be the new heating system. It will allow to heat the samples to tempera-tures of up to 700 K allowing measurements under real-istic conditions for the surface of Mercury. Further-more the heating system will allow to force thermal gradients in the samples which is a much more realistic representation of the thermal conditions on planetary surface. Summary: The PEL can provide the planetary community already today with emissivity measure-ments highly complementary to exisiting spectral data-bases. With the 2008 upgrade the PEL will allow unique measurements with a strong focus on airless bodies and extreme conditions as for example BepiColombo and MESSENGER will encounter at Mercury. This will be especially benefical for MERTIS the thermal infrared imaging spectrometer on BepiCo-lombo [1, 2, 4]. The PEL will routinely obtain emissivity measurements over the extremely wide spectral range from 1 - 50 μm for fine grained samples. The measurements at 1 μm will for example allow {{for the first time a}} direct interpretation of the surface observa-tions obtained by VIRTIS on VenusExpress through the atmospheric windows.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of emissions of fluorine-containing molecules are anthropogenic in nature, e. g. chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These molecules slowly degrade in the atmosphere, leading {{to the formation of}} HF, COF 2, and COClF, which are the main fluorine-containing species in the stratosphere. Ultimately both COF 2 and COClF further degrade to form HF, an almost permanent reservoir of stratospheric fluorine due to its extreme stability. Carbonyl fluoride (COF 2) is the second-most abundant stratospheric "inorganic" fluorine reservoir, with main sources being the atmospheric degradation of CFC- 12 (CCl 2 F 2), HCFC- 22 (CHF 2 Cl), and CFC- 113 (CF 2 ClCFCl 2). This work reports the first global distributions of carbonyl fluoride in the Earth's atmosphere using <b>infrared</b> satellite <b>remote-sensing</b> measurements by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS), which has been recording atmospheric spectra since 2004, and the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) instrument, which recorded thermal emission atmospheric spectra between 2002 and 2012. The observations reveal a high degree of seasonal and latitudinal variability {{over the course of a}} year. These have been compared with the output of SLIMCAT, a state-of-the-art three-dimensional chemical transport model. In general the observations agree well with each other, although MIPAS is biased high by as much as ~ 30 %, and compare well with SLIMCAT. Between January 2004 and September 2010 COF 2 grew most rapidly at altitudes above ~ 25 km in the southern latitudes and at altitudes below ~ 25 km in the northern latitudes, whereas it declined most rapidly in the tropics. These variations are attributed to changes in stratospheric dynamics over the observation period. The overall COF 2 global trend over this period is calculated as 0. 85 ± 0. 34 (MIPAS), 0. 30 ± 0. 44 (ACE), and 0. 88 % year − 1 (SLIMCAT) ...|$|R

The chemical species involved all have spectral signatures within the near and mid infrared that can now be measured by advanced techniques of <b>remote-sensing</b> <b>infrared</b> spectroradiometry. Such a system is the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), now in Phase B definition for the Earth Observing System (EOS) polar platforms.

A method was developed for generating seamless and radiometrically accurate mosaics of thermal infrared data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument. Using a combination of high resolution thermal emission spectroscopy results of sand samples and mosaic satellite data, surface emissivity was derived to map surface composition, which led to improvement {{in the understanding of}} sand accumulation in the Gran Desierto of northern Sonora, Mexico. These methods were also used to map sand transport pathways in the Sahara Desert, where the interaction between sand saltation and dust emission sources was explored. The characteristics and dynamics of dust sources were studied at White Sands, NM and in the Sahara Desert. At White Sands, an application was developed for studying the response of dust sources to surface soil moisture based on the relationship between soil moisture, apparent thermal inertia and the erosion potential of dust sources. The dynamics of dust sources and the interaction with sand transport pathways were also studied, focusing on the Bodele Depression of Chad and large dust sources in Mali and Mauritania. A dust detection algorithm was developed using ASTER data, and the spectral emissivity of observed atmospheric dust was related to the dust source area in the Sahara. At the Atmospheric Observatory (IZO) in Tenerife, Spain where direct measurement of the Saharan Air Layer could be made, the cycle of dust events occurring in July 2009 were examined. From the observation tower at the IZO, measurements of emitted longwave atmospheric radiance in the TIR wavelength region were made using a Forward Looking Infrared Radiometer (FLIR) handheld camera. The use of the FLIR to study atmospheric dust from the Saharan is a new application. Supporting data from AERONET and other orbital data enabled study of net radiative forcing...|$|R

40|$|Critical to {{spectral}} {{interpretations of}} geologic surfaces on the Earth and Mars is {{an understanding of}} the relationship between the composition of weathered rock surfaces and whole-rock mineralogy. In this study, thermal <b>infrared</b> spectroscopic and <b>remote-sensing</b> analyses were used to determine the composition of weathered granitoid rock surfaces in the Sacaton Mountains, Arizona. A linear spectral deconvolution approach was employed to determine the mineralogies of naturally exposed, weathered surfaces and artificially exposed, fresh rock surfaces. Deconvolution results from fresh rock surfaces yield similar bulk mineralogy to results from point counting of rock slabs and thin sections. Deconvolution of weathered rock spectra indicate that compared to fresh samples, weathered surfaces are deficient in plagioclase feldspar and are enriched in clay minerals. The differential weathering of feldspar minerals impacts the interpretation of whole-rock mineralogy and the spectral classification of bedrock geology, which, for plutonic rocks, is dependent on the relative proportions of different feldspars. Deconvolutions of multispectral remote-sensing or laboratory data show a deficiency of total feldspar in the weathered rock units but lack sufficient spectral resolution for the discrimination between different feldspars. These results demonstrate that the differential breakdown and removal of primary minerals in rock surfaces due to weathering can affect the interpreted rock petrology from remote-sensing studies. The relationships observed in our granitic samples could be applied to any rock type and may be important to consider for remote sensing of Mars. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.

The goal of the ARIEL mission is to investigate the atmospheres of several hundred planets orbiting distant stars in order to address the fundamental questions on how planetary systems form and evolve. During its four (with a potential extension to six) years mission ARIEL will observe 500 + exoplanets in the visible and the infrared with its meter-class telescope in L 2. ARIEL targets will include gaseous and rocky planets down to the Earth-size around different types of stars. The main focus of the mission will be on hot and warm planets orbiting close to their star, as they represent a natural laboratory in which to study the chemistry and formation of exoplanets. The ARIEL mission concept has been developed by a consortium of more than 50 institutes from 12 countries, which include UK, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Denmark, Ireland and Portugal. The analysis of the ARIEL spectra and photometric data in the 0. 5 - 7. 8 micron range will allow to extract the chemical fingerprints of gases and condensates in the planets' atmospheres, including the elemental composition for the most favorable targets.

40|$|Background: Following {{the severe}} acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) outbreak, <b>remote-sensing</b> <b>infrared</b> thermography (IRT) has been advocated {{as a possible}} means of screening for fever in travelers at airports and border crossings, but its applicability has not been established. We therefore set out to evaluate (1) the feasibility of IRT imaging to identify subjects with fever, and (2) the optimal instrumental configuration and validity for such testing. Methods: Over a 20 -day inclusive period, 176 subjects (49 hospital inpatients without SARS or suspected SARS, 99 health clinic attendees and 28 healthy volunteers) were recruited. Remotely sensed IRT readings were obtained from various parts of the front and side of the face (at distances of 1. 5 and 0. 5 m), and compared to concurrently determined body temperature measurements using conventional means (aural tympanic IRT and oral mercury thermometry). The resulting data were submitted to linear regression/correlation and sensitivity analyses. All recruits gave prior informed consent and our Faculty Institutional Review Board approved the protocol. Results: Optimal correlations were found between conventionally measured body temperatures and IRT readings from (1) the front of the face at 1. 5 m with the mouth open (r = 0. 80), (2) the ear at 0. 5 m (r = 0. 79), and (3) the side of the face at 1. 5 m (r = 0. 76). Average IRT readings from the forehead and elsewhere were 1 °C to 2 °C lower and correlated less well. Ear IRT readings at 0. 5 m yielded the narrowest confidence intervals and could be used to predict conventional body temperature readings of ≥ 38 °C with a sensitivity and specificity of 83 % and 88 % respectively. Conclusions: IRT readings {{from the side of the}} face, especially from the ear at 0. 5 m, yielded the most reliable, precise and consistent estimates of conventionally determined body temperatures. Our results have important implications for walk-through IRT scanning/screening systems at airports and border crossings, particularly as the point prevalence of fever in such subjects would be very low. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|<b>Remote-sensing</b> <b>infrared</b> {{spectroscopy}} is {{the principal}} field of investigation for planetary surfaces composition. Past, present and future missions to the solar system bodies include in their payload, instruments measuring the emerging radiation in the infrared range. Apart from measuring the reflected radiance, more and more spacecrafts are equipped with instruments measuring directly the emitted radiation from the planetary surface. The emitted radiation {{is not only a}} function of the composition of the material but also of its texture and especially the grain size distribution. For the interpretation of the measured data an emissivity spectral library of planetary analogue materials in grain size fractions appropriate for planetary surfaces is needed. The Berlin emissivity database (BED) presented here is focused on relatively fine-grained size separates, providing thereby a realistic basis for the interpretation of thermal emission spectra of planetary regoliths. The BED is therefore complimentary to existing thermal emission libraries, like the ASU library for example. BED currently contains emissivity spectra of plagioclase and potassium feldspars, low Ca and high Ca pyroxenes, olivine, elemental sulfur, Martian analogue minerals and volcanic soils, and a lunar highland soil sample measured in the wavelength range from 7 to 22 μm as a function of particle size. For each sample we measured the spectra of four particle size separates ranging from < 25 to 250 μm. The device we used is built at DLR (Berlin) and is coupled to a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer Bruker IFS 88 purged with dry air and equipped with a nitrogen-cooled MCT detector. All spectra were acquired with a spectral resolution of 4 cm ‑ 1. We are currently working on upgrading our emissivity facility. A new spectrometer (Bruker VERTEX 80 V) and new detectors will allow us to measure the emissivity of samples in the wavelength range from 1 to 50 μm in a vacuum environment.

40|$|Multi-decade {{atmospheric}} OCS (carbonyl sulfide) infrared measurements {{have been}} analyzed {{with the goal}} of quantifying long-term changes and evaluating the consistency of the <b>infrared</b> atmospheric OCS <b>remote-sensing</b> measurement record. Solar-viewing grating spectrometer measurements recorded in April 1951 at the Jungfraujoch station (46. 5 °N latitude, 8. 0 °E longitude, 3. 58 km altitude) show evidence for absorption by lines of the strong ν 3 band of OCS at 2062 cm(− 1). The observation predates the earliest previously reported OCS atmosphere remote-sensing measurement by two decades. More recent infrared ground-based measurements of OCS have been obtained primarily with high-resolution solar-viewing Fourier transform spectrometers (FTSs). Long-term trends derived from this record span more than two decades and show OCS columns that have remained constant or have decreased slightly with time since the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, though retrievals assuming different versions of public spectroscopic databases have been impacted by OCS ν 3 band line intensity differences of 10 %. The lower stratospheric OCS trend has been inferred assuming spectroscopic parameters from the high-resolution transmission (HITRAN) 2004 database. Volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles measured near 30 °N latitude with high-resolution solar-viewing FTSs operating in the solar occultation mode over a 22 years time span were combined. Atmospheric Trace MOlecucle Spectroscopy (ATMOS) version 3 FTS measurements in 1985 and 1994 were used with Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) measurements during 2004 – 2007. Trends were calculated by referencing the measured OCS VMRs to those of the long-lived constituent N 2 O to account for variations in the dynamic history of the sampled airmasses. Means and 1 -sigma standard deviations of VMRs (in ppbv, or 10 − 9 per unit air volume) averaged over 30 – 100 hPa from measurements at 25 – 35 °N latitude are 0. 334 ± 0. 089 ppbv from 1985 (ATMOS Spacelab 3 measurements), 0. 297 ± 0. 094 ppbv from 1994 ATLAS 3 measurements, 0. 326 ± 0. 074 ppbv from ACE 2004 measurements, 0. 305 ± 0. 096 ppbv from ACE 2005 measurements, 0. 328 ± 0. 074 from ACE 2006 measurements, and 0. 305 ± 0. 090 ppbv from ACE measurements through August 2007. Assuming these parameters, we conclude that there has been no statistically significant trend in lower stratospheric OCS over the measurement time span. We discuss past measurement sets, quantify the impact of changes in infrared spectroscopic parameters on atmospheric retrievals and trend measurements, and discuss OCS spectroscopic uncertainties of the current ν 3 band parameters in public atmospheric databases.
