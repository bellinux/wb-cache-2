He later commented on his promotions, [...] "Everybody thought I was a boy wonder. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> {{the right place at}} the right time." [...] As a chief, Finn served with patrol squadrons in San Diego, Washington, and Panama.|$|E
500|$|Early in {{the writing}} process, Donegan created guitar riffs. The rest of the band then listened to the riffs, and wrote {{the rest of the}} music, with the riffs being the base. As Donegan commented, [...] "The writing process is... pretty much the same since the beginning... of this band. It's always been riffs; {{something}} musically that I'll come up with [...]" [...] Wengren commented, [...] "We're always tossing around riffs and beats, but it isn't really until we get home and we are able to clear our minds, decompress for a little bit, and then hit it, especially Danny and I, and just start throwing the riffs and the beats out, that the music starts to finally come to life." [...] Bassist John Moyer left the studio during the recording process, due to his wife being pregnant. Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e-mail, and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio. Regarding electronics on the album, Donegan said, [...] "When the basic guitar, bass, [...] drums were being laid down, at first I didn't really see a whole lot of room for some of the electronics, but as the songs were starting to develop, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics." ...|$|E

6000|$|MacSpadden laughed. [...] "It {{means that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> {{time to keep}} Kilbraithie from {{chucking}} Delfosse down that ravine; but they both scooted when they saw me. By Jove! I don't know which was the most frightened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi! hi! boys, {{what does}} this mean?" [...] came in a high-pitched voice. [...] "What are you {{hammering}} on the house for, when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> {{the midst of a}} deep problem concerning the rotation of crops on a hillside with northern exposure?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beauty such as hers {{would be}} ruined by {{rigorous}} education. Fortunately, Sid hates wise women. Imagine Mariposilla developing the occult transitions of theosophy. Come here, you pretty butterfly!" [...] she cried. [...] "Sid is a greedy boy {{to keep you}} away so long. Go fetch the guitar; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> the humor for music." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yesterday, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> {{the midst}} of the luxury of feeling at home, with no {{journeys}} to make to-morrow. I have a friend I would like to introduce to you," [...] she said, rising and going out. She returned in a few moments with a tall young lady in street dress, whom she introduced as Miss Cassiday.|$|R
60|$|The nurse {{closed the}} front door; I went {{in by the}} side {{entrance}} {{which led to the}} schoolroom: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.|$|E
60|$|When I {{had reached}} a point where I could again see the dugout, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time to see it glide un-harmed between two needle-pointed {{sentinels}} of granite and float quietly upon the unruffled bosom of a tiny cove.|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear girl," [...] he laughed, [...] "what {{was there}} to fear for me? I {{had a very good}} dinner with a very charming man. Afterwards, we went to a music-hall for a short time, I went back to his rooms, and here <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time to wish you good night. What could the voices have to tell you about that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I greet you, Strangers, in {{the name}} of her I serve. I see that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time, but this does not {{surprise}} me, since she said that it would be so. You seem to have done very well with these dogs," [...] and he prodded a dead Amahagger with his sandalled foot. [...] "Yes, very well indeed. You must be great warriors." ...|$|R
5|$|Even {{though to}} me, a Japanese schoolgirl uniform {{is kind of}} like blackface, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> {{acceptance}} over it, because something is better than nothing. An ugly picture is better than a blank space, and it means that one day, we will have another display at the Museum of Asian Invisibility, that groups of children will crowd around in disbelief, because once upon a time, we weren’t there.|$|R

50|$|From the Place Bellecour, the rue Childebert (reference to Childebert <b>I)</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> {{front of}} the square.

A traboule / shopping mall from the rue du Président-Édouard-Herriot also provides an access to the square : the Passage de l'Argue. The square is rectangular {{and a total of}} 11 streets lead to it.|$|R

I hope to have it ready for the press by May next. But I may fail in this on account of weakness. My mouth has been very sore, but not so bad I think as the papers have made out. But it has been bad enough. The {{rest of the family}} are all well.|$|R

6000|$|My {{sole purpose}} {{in going to}} Florence was to see this immortal [...] "Moses," [...] and by good fortune <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time, for they were already {{preparing}} to remove it to a more private and better-protected place because a fashion of robbing the great galleries was prevailing in Europe at the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{turned over}} our {{conversation}} in my mind, after you had gone," [...] replied Mr. Bruff.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> {{the act of}} {{despatching}} {{the last}} morsel of a most savory stewed lamb and rice, which had formed my meal, when I heard a scuffle of feet, a shrill clatter of female voices, and, the curtain being flung open, in marched a lady accompanied by twelve slaves, with moon faces and slim waists, lovely as the houris in Paradise.|$|E

60|$|He got no farther, and had I not intervened by {{throwing}} my arms about Saduko and dragging him back, that moment {{would have been}} Umbezi's last, for Saduko was about to pin him to the earth with his spear.

60|$|The {{man with}} the knife rushed out into the lane, and so did I, {{and so did the}} man on horseback, almost on top of me. On {{the other side of the}} lane was a little gorge with rocks and trees and water at the bottom of it, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time to see the stag spring over the lane and drop out of sight among the rocks and the moss and the vines.|$|E
6000|$|I dashed aft myself {{meeting on}} my way a hard gust of wind whose {{approach}} Gambril's ear had detected from afar and which filled the sails on the main {{in a series of}} muffled reports mingled with the low plaint of the spars. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time to seize the wheel while Frenchy who had followed me caught up the collapsing Gambril.
