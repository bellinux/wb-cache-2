40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} analysis of four different variants of a regional freighter aircraft {{on the basis of}} the ATR 72 full freighter version. The variants differ in their type of propulsion system (jet/turboprop) as well as in the fuel they use (kerosene/hydrogen). The presented work has been performed within the scope of the joint aircraft design project "Green Freighter " (GF). The setup of the aircraft models inside the Preliminary Aircraft Design and Optimization program PrADO is shown with special respect to the propulsion systems and the integration of the hydrogen tanks. Afterwards, the resulting aircraft parameters, such as the aircraft masses and the payload-range diagrams, are presented, and the aircraft variants are compared ac-cording to their Direct Operating Costs (DOC) and their emissions. In order to integrate two large hydrogen tanks inside the aircraft fuselage it is necessary to stretch the original fuselage. This stretch plus the masses of the hydrogen tanks increase the <b>empty</b> <b>masses</b> of the hydrogen-powered aircraft compared to the kero-sene variants by about 8 %. From a purely economic point of view, the use of hydrogen as fuel is not favor-able at today’s kerosene and an energy equivalent hydrogen price.

This makes hydrogen favorable from an ecologic point of view, and in the future, these low emissions are ex-pected to become economic benefits as well...|$|R

Similarly, the body-mass-adjusted length of the tammar wallaby caecum and proximal colon combined was 25 % longer in animals maintained on the pelleted diet compared with those maintained on forage. Our data suggest that food particle size may be directly involved in controlling the size of the post-gastric alimentary tract in tammar wallabies, and thus in their diet choice and nutritional ecology. Notably, this is the first study that links phenotypic plasticity of the gut directly to diet in a marsupial and we conclude that the tammar wallaby is an excellent model for exploring the causes and consequences of digestive plasticity in macropodid marsupials...|$|R

Thermal energy is determined by measuring inlet and outlet temperatures of cooling water and its mass flow. The energy yield of this calorimeter is 95 - 98 % depending on input power. Our best result so far is an excess heat of 3 W with an input power of 47 W using an oxidized palladium tube filled with palladium powder.

40|$|Die Anwendbarkeit der Verdünnungsmethode mit Hilfe des Markers Deuteriumoxid (D 2 O) zur in vivo-Erfassung der sich ändernden Körperzusammensetzung wurde an 53 Ziegenlämmern der Rasse Bunte Deutsche Edelziege im Gewichtsabschnitt von 4 kg bis 20 kg LM überprüft. Bei einer Lebendmasse von 4, 8, 12, 16 bzw. 20 kg wurde den Tieren nach einer 13 - bis 18 stündigen Nüchterung D 2 O injiziert und nach weiteren vier bis fünf Stunden Blutproben gezogen. Bei jeweils einem Teil der Tiere erfolgte anschließend die Schlachtung und die chemische Analyse der Körper zur Bestimmung des Ganzkörperwassergehaltes, der Chymusmasse und der Leerkörperzusammensetzung. Die Messungen der D 2 O-Konzentrationen in den Blutproben und die chemische Analyse der Ganzkörper ergaben eine Überschätzung des Ganzkörperwassergehaltes durch die Verdünnungsmethode um im Mittel 3, 99 %. Zwischen dem chemisch bestimmten und dem geschätzten Wert besteht eine enge lineare Beziehung. Die Schätzung des Inhaltes des Gastro-Intestinaltraktes (Chymus) dient zur Schätzung der Leerkörpermasse. Dessen Variabilität lässt sich im Wesentlichen durch die Lebendmasse erklären. Die chemische Analyse der Tierkörper zeigte, dass die Zusammensetzung des fettfreien Leerkörpers im hohen Maß von der Leerkörpermasse abhängt. Anhand von allometrischen Regressionsgleichungen wurden die Bestandteile der fettfreien Leerkörpermasse geschätzt und daraus die Zusammensetzung des fetthaltigen Leerkörpers ermittelt. Der Vergleich der mittels chemischer Analyse bestimmten bzw. der Verdünnungsmethode geschätzten Leerkörperzusammensetzung ergab eine hohe Übereinstimmung beim Wasser-, Rohprotein- und Rohaschegehalt. Der Rohfettgehalt wies dagegen größere Abweichungen auf. Als Ursache wurde die Streuung der geschätzten Chymusmasse bzw. Chymuswassermasse aufgedeckt. Das Fazit ist, dass sich die D 2 O-Verdünnungsmethode zur in vivo-Bestimmung der sich ändernden Körperzusammensetzung von Ziegenlämmern im Gewichtsabschnitt von 4 kg bis 20 kg LM eignet. On young goats (breed Bunte Deutsche Edelziege) with a {{live weight}} range of 4 kg up to 20 kg the {{suitability}} of the dilution method using the marker deuterated water (D 2 O) was checked {{in order to measure}} the changes of body composition during growth on living animals (in vivo). At a live weight of 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 kg the animals received an intrave¬nous dose of D 2 O after a fastening time of 13 to 18 hours. Blood samples were taken after a waiting period of 4 to 5 hours. In connection with the last blood sample in each period a part of the animals were slaughtered to determine the total body water content, the digesta <b>mass</b> and the <b>empty</b> body composition by chemical analysis. The determination of the marker concentration in the blood samples and the chemical analysis of the total bodies showed that the dilution method overestimated total body water content by 3, 99 %. There is a close linear relationship between the estimated and the chemically determined content of total body water. The estimation of the digesta mass serves for the estimation of the <b>empty</b> body <b>mass.</b> Its variation mainly depends on the live weight. The chemical analysis of the animal bodies revealed that the composition of the fat-free empty body is mainly dependent on the <b>empty</b> body <b>mass.</b> Using allometric equations the components of the fat-free <b>empty</b> body <b>mass</b> were estimated and thus the composition of the empty body could be calculated. The comparison of the chemically determined components with the estimated components of the empty body showed a high agreement concerning the content of water, protein and ash. However estimation of the fat content is less accurate. The reason is the variation of the estimated digesta mass and the digesta water mass.
