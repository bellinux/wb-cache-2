The mortar round hit and shot down the helicopter, serial number ZD275, while it was <b>hovering</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> helipad.

25|$|Cixi's {{ascendancy}} {{came at a}} time {{of internal}} chaos and foreign challenges. The effects of the Second Opium War were still <b>hovering</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> country, and the Taiping Rebellion continued its seemingly unstoppable advance through China's south, eating up the Qing Empire bit by bit. Internally, both the national bureaucracy and regional authorities were infested with corruption. 1861 happened to be the year of official examinations, whereby officials of all levels presented their political reports from the previous three years. Cixi decided that the time was ripe for a bureaucratic overhaul, and she personally sought audience with all officials above the level of provincial governor, who had to report to her personally. Cixi thus took on part of the role usually given to the Bureaucratic Affairs Department (吏部). Cixi had two prominent officials executed to serve as examples for others: Qingying, a military shilang who had tried to bribe his way out of demotion, and He Guiqing, then Viceroy of Liangjiang, who fled Changzhou in the wake of an incoming Taiping army instead of trying to defend the city.|$|E

[...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see.

She had been imported to be trimmed, educated, cut down and trained according to the great man's conception of things." [...] When describing her early days in Romania, Marie wrote that [...] "for long hours [...] would mope, whilst [...] young husband did his military service, all alone in rooms [...] hated, heavy German rooms". Marie's paternal aunt, the Dowager German Empress, wrote to her daughter, the Crown Princess of Greece, that [...] "Missy of Roumania is more to be pitied than you. The King is a great tyrant in his family, & has crushed the independence in Ferdinand so that no one cares about him, & his beautiful & gifted little wife, I fear, gets into scrapes, & like a butterfly, instead of <b>hovering</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> flowers, burns her pretty wings by going rather near the fire!" [...] Easily learning to speak the Romanian language, she followed her mother's advice to dress carefully and show respect for Orthodox rituals.|$|E
500|$|Tyler {{made the}} {{annexation}} of the Republic of Texas {{part of his}} agenda soon after becoming president. Texas had declared independence from Mexico in the Texas Revolution of 1836, although Mexico still refused to acknowledge its sovereignty. The people of Texas actively pursued joining the Union, but Jackson and Van Buren had been reluctant to inflame tensions over slavery by annexing another Southern state. Though Tyler intended annexation to be {{the focal point of}} his administration, Secretary Webster was opposed, and convinced Tyler to concentrate on Pacific initiatives until later in his term. Tyler's desire for western expansionism is acknowledged by historians and scholars, but views differ regarding the motivations behind it. Biographer Edward C. Crapol notes that during the presidency of James Monroe, Tyler (then in the House of Representatives) had suggested slavery was a [...] "dark cloud" [...] <b>hovering</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Union, {{and that it would be}} [...] "well to disperse this cloud" [...] so that with fewer blacks in the older slave states, a process of gradual emancipation would begin in Virginia and other upper Southern states. Historian William W. Freehling, however, wrote that Tyler's official motivation in annexing Texas was to outmaneuver suspected efforts by Great Britain to promote an emancipation of slaves in Texas that would weaken the institution in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} special a grade of C, criticizing it {{as a mere}} promotional vehicle for Gaga with the Muppets a last-minute addition. The {{production}} was unable to balance Gaga's album promotion with a Muppets holiday special: [...] "Nothing in Lady Gaga & The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular destroys {{the sanctity of the}} Muppets ... However, the potential for a Muppets holiday special was never given room to materialize amidst a Lady Gaga concert special designed to sell her new album. The choice to combine the two may have reached out to a broader audience, but the incongruence of the special's various parts... was bound to frustrate a sizable portion of that audience." [...] Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times agreed, criticizing the special's commercial nature; he also said its songs were [...] "less fit for a Muppet-like music special, and no one seemed willing to stray too far from the show's message of selling a product. Rather than aim for holiday timelessness, this was self-promotion, with the Muppets often coming to Gaga's world than the other way around." [...] Billboards Chris Willman also gave it a negative review, citing the show's palpably-low budget and its dialogue, guest appearances, Gaga's lip-syncing and production: [...] "There was a familiar 'why is this happening?' question <b>hovering</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> star-crossed proceedings, albeit without the benefit of any guest stars as seriously wacky as that ones to show up and redeem the incongruousness." ...|$|E
