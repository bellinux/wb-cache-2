2500|$|It was {{followed}} by similar bubble-top variants, including the P-47D-26, D-27, D-28 and D-30. Improvements added in this series included engine refinements {{and the addition of}} dive recovery flaps. Cutting down the rear fuselage to accommodate the bubble canopy produced yaw instability, and the P-47D-40 introduced a vertical stabilizer extension {{in the form of a}} fin running from the vertical stabilizer to just behind the radio aerial. The fin fillet was often retrofitted in the field to earlier P-47D bubble-top variants. The P-47D-40 also featured provisions for 10 [...] "zero length" [...] launchers for 5in (127mm) High velocity aircraft rockets (HVARs), as well as the new K-14 computing gunsight. This was a license-built copy of the British Ferranti GGS Mark IID computing <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>sight</b> which allowed the pilot to dial in target wingspan and range, and would then move the gunsight reticle to compensate for the required deflection.|$|E
5000|$|The P-61 {{featured}} {{a crew of}} three: pilot, gunner, and radar operator. It was armed with four 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano M2 forward-firing cannons mounted in the lower fuselage, and four [...]50 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns lined up horizontally with the two middle guns slightly offset upwards in a remotely aimed dorsally mounted turret, a similar arrangement to that used with the B-29 Superfortress using four-gun upper forward remote turrets. The turret was driven by the General Electric GE2CFR12A3 gyroscopic fire control computer, and could be directed by either the gunner or radar operator, who both had aiming control and <b>gyroscopic</b> collimator <b>sight</b> assembly posts attached to their swiveling seats.|$|R
5000|$|The XP-61's spine-mounted dorsal remote turret {{could be}} aimed and {{fired by the}} gunner or radar operator, who both had aiming control and <b>gyroscopic</b> {{collimator}} <b>sighting</b> posts attached to their swiveling seats, or could be locked forward to be fired by the pilot {{in addition to the}} 20 mm (.79 in) cannons. The radar operator could rotate the turret to engage targets behind the aircraft. Capable of a full 360째 rotation and 90째 elevation, the turret could be used to engage any target in the hemisphere above and to the sides of the XP-61. A brief assessment of the turret by the British Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment in 1944 found problems with the aiming and [...] "jerky movement" [...] of the guns.|$|R
5000|$|The tail turret was {{the most}} {{important}} defensive position and carried the heaviest armament. Despite this, the turrets used, starting with the FN-20, were never entirely satisfactory and numerous designs were tried. The FN-20 was replaced by the very similar FN-120 which used an improved <b>gyroscopic</b> gun <b>sight</b> (GGS). Many rear gunners insisted on having the centre section of perspex removed from the turret to improve visibility. The transparencies were difficult to see through at night, particularly when trying to keep watch for enemy night fighters that appeared without notice astern and below the aircraft when getting into position to open fire. This removal of perspex from the turret was called the [...] "Gransden Lodge" [...] modification. Ammunition for the tail turret was 2,500 rounds-per-gun. Due to the weight, the ammunition was stored in tanks situated near the mid-upper turret's position and fed rearward in runways down the back of the fuselage to the turret.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{the four}} types of bomber used by the Luftwaffe the Ju 88 (the {{original}} Schnellbomber) {{was considered to be}} the most difficult to shoot down. As a bomber it was relatively manoeuvrable and, especially at low altitudes with no bomb load, it was fast enough to ensure that a Spitfire engaged in a tail-chase would be hard pressed to catch up. It could carry up to 3,000 kg of bombs. However, only small sized 50 and 70 kg bombs, up to a total weight of 1,400 kg, could be carried internally, while larger bombs had to be carried on external racks, causing considerable drag. The Ju 88 was also extremely versatile, being fitted with both the Lotfernrohr 7 <b>gyroscopic</b> bomb <b>sight</b> and Stuvi dive sight as well as retractable dive brakes. The front MG 15 machine gun could be locked with an ingenious retracting clamp just forward of the windscreen to lock it for forwards firing, and could be used for strafing runs. Thus the Ju 88, dubbed as the [...] "Big Stuka", was equally at home when it came to level or dive bombing or low-level attacks. The versions of the Ju 88 used during the battle were the small-wingtipped A-1 and the A-5; the latter incorporated several improvements, including the A-4's increased 20.08 meter wingspan and uprated armament. The Ju 88 C-1 heavy fighter version, with a sheet metal nose replacing the bombers' [...] "beetle's-eye" [...] faceted glazing, was also used in small numbers.|$|R
50|$|The Luftwaffe in 1940 {{primarily}} {{relied on}} three twin-engined medium bombers: the Dornier Do 17, the Heinkel He 111 and the Junkers Ju 88. Despite the Luftwaffe {{being in the}} possession of advanced <b>gyroscopic</b> bomb <b>sights,</b> the Lotfernrohr 7 for daylight bombing and electronic navigational aids like the Knickebein, X-Ger채t and Y-Ger채t for nocturnal bombing, there were some very fundamental limitations to the accuracy of bombing from level flight, and there was no guarantee that such attacks could achieve success on small or difficult targets such as radar stations.For precision attack emphasis was placed on the development of aircraft which could utilise the technique of dive bombing for which the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka was specifically designed. The Junkers Ju 88 was fitted with external dive brakes and a control system, {{similar to those of the}} Ju 87 and could carry out a dive bombing role, although it was primarily used as a level bomber. The light bomb loads carried by the Ju 87 had been used to great effect during the Battle of France. However, the Ju 87 was slow and possessed an inadequate degree of defensive weaponry, with only a single, 7.92mm calibre MG 15 machine gun at the rear of the cockpit for rearward defense. Furthermore, it could not be effectively protected by fighters, because of its low speed and the very low altitudes at which it ended its dive bomb attacks. The Stuka depended on air superiority, the very thing being contested over Britain. It was therefore withdrawn from attacks on Britain in August after prohibitive losses, leaving the Luftwaffe short of precision ground-attack aircraft.|$|R
