According to the 1955 circular of the Pennsylvania Geological Survey, In 1955 Beaver County produced 13.7% of Pennsylvania's total clay output. There were 13 companies that mined clay in Beaver county at that time. Two of these companies, The Negley Fire Clay Co. and Ralph A. Veon, Inc. mined fire clay {{of the plastic}} variety from open pits and marketed the output for use in manufacturing fire brick and block, foundries, and <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>products.</b> In addition, Ralph A.

40|$|This thesis wad {{aimed at}} the study and {{application}} of titanium dioxide photocatalytic activity on ceramic materials. As a matter of fact, photocatalysis is a very promising method to face {{most of the problems}} connected with the increasing environmental pollution. Furthermore, titanium dioxide, in its anatase crystallographic phase, {{is one of the most}} investigated photocatalytic material and results to be perfectly compatible with silicate body mixes. That goal was pursued by two different strategies: 1. 	the addition to a body mix used for <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>products</b> of several titania powders, with different mean crystallite size, surface area, morphology and anatase/rutile ratio and a titania nanosuspension as well. The titania addition followed two procedures: bulk and spray addition over the ceramic samples surface. Titania was added in two different percentages: 2. 5 and 7. 5 wt. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} ceramic industrial production, {{for most}} of its applications, i. e. Ceramic Tiles, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Clay</b> <b>Products,</b> Tableware and Sanitaryware, is often affected by the formation, during the firing process, of a dark color core, normally named “Black Core”, that can represent an aesthetical and technological problem. The true nature of this defect was never clearly stated, but it is known to be due to the presence of chromophores, like Iron, and organic or reducing materials, combined with a lack of permeability of the unfired body. A novel, mullti-approach study was made by XRD, XRF, SEM-EDS, FTIR and Mossbauer Spectroscopy, and by micro Raman spectroscopy and mapping, with the aim to clarify the morphology, the composition and the Iron oxidation state of this inner layer. Possible solutions were suggested, by the addition to the recipe of proper additives...|$|R
40|$|This work {{involved}} {{the characterization of}} clays collected in the municipalities of São Luis, Rosário, Pinheiro and Mirinzal (state of Maranhão, Brazil), based on specific mass, specific surface area, cation exchange capacity (CEC), particle size distribution, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTA) and Atterberg limits. Technological tests for ceramic applications were also carried out on compacts pressed under 20 MPa and heat-treated at 850, 950, 1050, 1150 and 1250 ºC. Our results indicated {{that two of the}} clays composed of kaolinite, quartz, and anatase with high plasticity limits, have excellent properties and can be used in the whiteware industry. The other ones are red-firing clays and have a mineralogical composition of quartz, kaolin, feldspar, montmorillonite, hematite and goethite. The latter showed low and moderate values of plasticity, which makes them suitable for the production of <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{a method}} was {{developed}} {{for the application of}} red mud, an alkaline leaching waste, from a bauxite processing plant located in northern Brazil (Amazon region) as starting material for <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>products.</b> Samples were prepared by pressing blends of red mud and clay, which were then fired at temperatures from 900 ºC to 1190 ºC. Characterization was carried out by chemical analysis, differential thermal analysis (DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the following ceramic properties were evaluated: water absorption, linear shrinkage and flexural strength. In order to evaluate the Na + stability in the dense ceramic, leaching tests were also carried out on the specimens after sintering process. Results indicated that samples with 50 and 70 wt% of red mud are proper for being used in the production of ceramic bodies, due to its excellent properties, mainly high mechanical resistance and low water absorption, showing thus, an option to minimizing the environmental impacts caused by the aluminum industry...|$|R
30|$|Clay {{deposits}} {{are widely}} distributed within many geological formations from Carboniferous to recent age. They {{are located in}} the region of Nile Valley and Delta, {{as well as in the}} Western and Eastern Desert of Egypt. Most of these deposits are used for the applications in many ceramic industries, for example, whiteware, refractories, <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>products,</b> and Portland cement (Hanna and Stoops 1977; Said 1990; Youssef 2008). Clays are classified according to their particle size, mineral and chemical compositions, and other properties (Grim 1962, 1968; Grimshaw 1971; Norton 1969; Konta 1979, Burst 1991). Many authors indicated that kaolinite-rich clay materials are refractory with a high vitrification range, low plasticity, white-to-buff burning colour and a low-drying and firing shrinkage. Moreover, montmorillonite-rich clays are non-refractory with low vitrification ranges, high plasticity, buff-to-red burning colour, and a high-drying and firing shrinkage. In contrast, illite-rich clays are falling between kaolinitic and montmorillonitic clays and exhibit wide variations. Lightweight clay aggregates may be produced by firing pellets of low-grade montmorillonite-rich clays with or without adding to the vitrification range. After firing, the clay pellets swell or bloat owing to gas releases within the firing bodies during the liquid phase. On cooling, these low-grade montmorillonite clays conserve the cellular texture, and lightweight aggregate is obtained (Serry et al. 1985; Konta 1995; Karaman et al. 2006; Bernhardt et al. 2013; Ismail et al. 2016, Ismail et al. 2018; Risdanareni et al. 2017).|$|R
40|$|Alternatives ways of {{recycling}} soda-lime-silica scrap glass (SLS) glass, apart from remelting can offer certain advantages {{and may be}} implemented when glass production is not suitable. For the ceramics industry, the incorporation of glass into the ceramic body may {{improve the quality of}} fired products and save energy Mixtures of SLS glass and ceramic raw materials used for the production of porcelain stoneware tiles and heavy-clay products were developed and examined. In the case of porcelain stoneware tiles, several modified mixes were prepared by replacing different amounts of the fluxing component, sodium,feldspathic sand For roofing tiles, SLS glass was added at a fixed percentage in the body mixes. The fired samples were characterised in terms of linear shrinkage, water absorption, flexural strength and reliability Microstructure and the main phase transformations in the fired samples were examined by x-ray diffraction and by scanning electron microscopy along with EDS microanalysis. The results, for the porcelain stoneware body mix, shou, that a substitution of the fluxing component in the range of 5 - 10 wt% is feasible The new formulations had lower water absorptions, adequate flexural strengths and a consistent increase in reliability due to improved homogeneity. For substitutions exceeding 10 plagioclase was crystallised, which inhibited the formation of mullite and did not favour densification. The results regarding the modified body mix for <b>heavy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>products</b> have shown that a glass additions up to 30 wt% are feasible. New crystalline phases were developed within and at the interface of the glass grains. The particle size distribution of the glass and the firing temperature both influenced the physical and mechanical characteristics whereas they had a minor effect on the mineralogy. The fired products demonstrated improved characteristics in terms Of water absorption and bending strength. status: publishe...|$|R

However, certain types of clay are known to contain high concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the PCDD/F contents of orally consumed clays purchased from Dutch and African markets. Congener patterns were compared with those of pooled human milk samples collected in eight African countries, to investigate a possible relationship with clay consumption. From the Dutch market thirteen <b>clay</b> <b>products</b> were examined, seven of African and six of Suriname origin. From seven African countries, twenty <b>clay</b> <b>products</b> were collected. All 33 <b>clay</b> <b>products</b> were screened with a cell-based bioassay and those showing a high response were analyzed by GC/HRMS.
