Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We are trying to get away from those kind of songs, but like <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E
500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E
2500|$|Palmeiro {{continues}} to strongly deny ever having used steroids intentionally, telling The Baltimore Sun in June 2006, [...] "Yes sir, that's what happened. It's not a story; it's {{the reality of}} what happened", and [...] "I said what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> Congress because I meant every word of it." [...] Palmeiro passed a polygraph test in which he was not asked if he ever used steroids, but in which he did state that he unknowingly ingested them via a B12 injection. A 2005 New York Times article expressed one writer's belief that Palmeiro's story could perhaps be the truth.|$|E

All my {{brothers}} and sisters are dead and children but yourself... We are all ejected out of Mr. Enright's ground... The times was so bad and all Ireland in such a state of poverty that no person could pay rent. My only hope now rests with you, as I am without one shilling and as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before</b> I must either beg or go to the poorhouse... I remain your affectionate father, Owen Larkin. Be sure answer this by return of post." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was on {{the verge}} of {{painting}} the Portrait of Jacques Nayral. He was to become my brother-in-law, and was one of the most sympathetic men I have ever met. A strange lad, a little surprising on first encounter - both disturbing because of his sharp use of irony and also attractive because of a generosity that left him as vulnerable as a child. The first time I met him was at President Bonjean's house at Villepreux-les-Clayes, near Versailles, during a dinner which brought together the committee of that 'Villa Medicis Libre' which, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> had been founded by Alexandre Mercereau. From that time onwards, we saw each other often and became friends.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for the ESPN documentary series SportsCentury in 2002, Clemente's widow Vera mentioned that Clemente had told her several times {{that he thought he}} was going to die young. Indeed, while being asked by broadcaster and future fellow Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn in July 1971 during the All-Star Game activities about when he would get his 3,000 career hit, Clemente's response was [...] "Well, uh, you never know. I, I, uh, if I'm alive, like <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> you never know because God tells you how long you're going to be here. So you never know what can happen tomorrow." [...] Clemente's older stepbrother, Luis, died on December 31, 1954 and his stepsister a few years later.|$|E

2500|$|According to Collins, [...] "What we're {{in court}} {{deciding}} {{seems to be}} a level or two down from what, before we went into the jury, we supposed the trial was about, or had been initially about, which was who leaked [...] Some jurors commented at some point: 'I wish we weren't judging Libby. You know, this sucks. We don't like being here.' But that wasn't our choice." [...] Collins described how after 10 days of deliberations, [...] "What we came up with from that was that Libby was told about Mrs. Wilson nine times...We believed he did have a bad memory, but it seemed very unlikely he would not remember about being told about Mrs. Wilson so many times....Hard to believe he would remember on Tuesday and forget on Thursday." [...] Collins told the press [...] "Well, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> I felt like it was a long, you know, haul to get this jury done. And if Mr. Libby is pardoned, I would have no problem with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nozomi {{continued}} to enjoy sex {{both within and}} outside of the AV setting, and stated that she did not mind having it every day. Nevertheless, the intense pace of her career was beginning to tire her. She had been making up to ten videos a month, and expressed fatigue with the AV work both in interviews and in private conversations. She told an interviewer, [...] "...it {{was a lot of fun}} at first, but I'm really tired nowadays. To tell you the truth, I think I'm over-exerting myself right now. So I want to take a decent vacation rather than get paid." [...] She continued, [...] "Like <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> I enjoy the shoots a lot. There are times when I think it's hard and tiring, but the fun part is a lot greater!" [...] A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress. Nozomi also formed an idol musical group with some other AV idols and released a musical CD in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Captain Frederick Benteen, {{battalion}} {{leader of}} Companies D, H and K, recalled his {{observations on the}} Custer battlefield on June 27, 1876:I went over the battlefield carefully {{with a view to}} determine how the battle was fought. I arrived at the conclusion I [...] now – that it was a rout, a panic, until the last man was killed…There was no line formed on the battlefield. You can take a handful of corn and scatter [...] over the floor, and make just such lines.

There were more than 20 [...] killed there were [...] four or five at one place, all within a space of 20 to 30 yards …I counted 70 dead [...] horses and 2 Indian ponies.I think, in all probability, that the men turned their horses loose without any orders to do so. Many orders might have been given, but few obeyed. I think that they were panic stricken; it was a rout, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

6000|$|But if {{she felt}} any pique she quickly brushed {{it out of}} sight, for, as <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>before,</b> {{she was a young}} woman who had great command of herself.
