Carmody used Henderson, who commonly scrimmaged with the players, as part of a joke for a Sports Illustrated: [...] "I don't mind that Mitch is cagier and smarter than all those <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> court. The thing that bothers me is that he's faster than all of them." [...] During Henderson's final three seasons at Northwestern, the team qualified for the National Invitation Tournament.|$|E
500|$|The {{scripting}} of the film, tentatively titled as Running {{with the}} Bulls, {{was completed in}} November 2009 {{after three months of}} work. Zoya and Kagti incorporated real life observations, and specially wrote the character of Imraan for her brother Farhan Akhtar. Akhtar wrote the dialogues for the film. The theme of the film was [...] "about three <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of making commitments in life", according to him. They used Javed Akhtar's poetry as a voice-over because they felt the poetry adds depth to the character and lends voice to their feelings. A special poem inspired by a fan's poem was penned down for Katrina's character, after she was cast in the project. The first choice for the location of principal filming was Mexico, but was later changed to Spain since the climax features running with the bulls and Zoya wanted a country that blended history, culture and sports. The release date of the film was rescheduled thrice because the originally selected editor, Chandan Arora, fell ill and they had to redo the editing.|$|E

I mean he really pulverized him. I call Bostic and Frank Minnifield (Cleveland cornerback) my sons, my sons of dirt." [...] Hayes meant that Bostic and Minnifield played a {{physical style}}, just like Hayes. [...] Bostic {{is known as a}} big hitter blessed with athletic ability. [...] He combined strength and speed to play his physical style according to Ozzie Newsome: [...] "He's as strong as any linebacker and can run like any of the <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corner." [...] Bostic earned the nickname [...] "Batman" [...] for his style of play. [...] Instead of instructing his team to elect captains, Glanville instructed his team to [...] "...pick the three toughest guys. If somebody throws a grenade into a room, they're the ones who'll jump on it." [...] Bostic was the player chosen from the Oilers' defense. [...] Although much is made of his strength and toughness, it should also be mentioned that he once collared Tony Dorsett from behind in a footrace. [...] At one point in Bostic's career, while Glanville was still defensive coordinator, the Oilers considered moving him to cornerback because of his speed.|$|E
500|$|In his career, Russell {{won five}} regular season MVP awards (1959, 1961–63, 1965)—tied with Michael Jordan for second all-time behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six awards.

Russell was elected to one NBA All-Defensive First Team. This took place during his last season (1969), {{and was the first}} season the NBA All-Defensive Teams were selected. In 1970, The Sporting News named Russell the [...] "Athlete of the Decade". Russell is universally seen {{as one of the best}} NBA players ever, and was declared [...] "Greatest Player in the History of the NBA" [...] by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America in 1980. For his achievements, Russell was named [...] "Sportsman of the Year" [...] by Sports Illustrated in 1968. He also made all three NBA Anniversary Teams: the NBA 25th Anniversary All-Time Team (1970), the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team (1980) and the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team (1996). Russell ranked #18 on ESPN's 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century in 1999. In 2009, SLAM Magazine named Russell the #3 player of all time behind Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain. Former NBA player and head coach, Don Nelson, described Bill Russell in a quote that says, [...] "There are two types of superstars. One makes himself look good at the expense of the other <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. But there's another type who makes the players around him look better than they are, and that's the type Russell was." ...|$|E

[...] His team has a physical advantage {{and with the help of}} Mr. Widmore, they have a tactical advantage as well. [...] Keamy is like a bulldog being thrown into a cage full of kittens (except for [...] Sayid)". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post, stated that [...] "Keamy is Crazy! … out of all the bad <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Island—past, present, and future—Keamy has to be one of the most dangerous ones. [...] Not because of how big he is, or the weaponry, but his willingness to kill at the drop of a hat. [...] That doesn't bode well for our Losties [...]" [...] Co-show runner/executive producer/writer Carlton Cuse has stated that he and the other writers create [...] "complex" [...] characters because they [...] "are interested in exploring how good and evil can be embodied in the same characters and [...] the struggles we all have to overcome the dark parts of our souls"; however, he later clarified that there is an exception: [...] "Keamy's bad, he knows he's bad, but he's ... a guy that does the job." [...] Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "the great thing about Keamy is that he is like a ... merciless survivor. [...] 's this great moment [...] where he just sort of hackie-sacks [...] over to where [...] Omar is standing. [...] Omar is certainly an acceptable casualty as far as Keamy is concerned." [...] According to a featurette in the Lost: The Complete Fourth Season – The Expanded Experience DVD set, Keamy likes [...] "heavy weaponry" [...] and [...] "physical fitness" [...] and dislikes [...] "negotiations" [...] and [...] "doctors".|$|E

2500|$|At 6:28a.m., {{two minutes}} {{ahead of the}} time set as H-Hour, Schroeder's unit {{was in the first}} wave of 20LCVPs to {{disembark}} on Utah Beach. Schroeder's own assault boat, commanded by navy Lieutenant (j.g.) Abraham Condiotti of Brooklyn, New York, was the first to hit the beach. In his boat were 32men, including Brigadier General Roosevelt. He recalled to a television interviewer in 2008 that [...] "80percent of the <b>guys</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boat were sick" [...] due to the rough seas and, as his landing craft in the first wave neared the shore, Allied forces were still shelling Company F's designated landing site on Utah Beach. [...] "They were dropping all those bombs on the place where we were going in" [...] and his company had to disembark [...] "without getting bombed by our own guys". [...] He held his [...]45-caliber pistol above the waist-high water as he waded the final [...] from his landing craft to the beach. In the lead landing craft, he covered the remaining distance as quickly as possible due to enemy fire. The soldiers encountered machine gun fire from German pillboxes and artillery shelling, underwater mines, barbed wire, and trenches. His company's mission was to break up the enemy's fortified seawall and then liberate a village five miles inland. Half of his men were casualties and Schroeder himself was shot twice in the left arm. He was hospitalized in England and later in South Carolina and almost had his arm amputated due to the severity of his wounds. [...] Asked later if {{he knew that he was}} the first soldier on the beach, he said, [...] "I knew my company was in the first wave, but I didn't know I was actually going to be the first ashore. [...] Besides, I was too scared to think about it". Afterwards, he was hailed in a Pentagon press release as [...] "the first GI to invade Europe". The Baltimore Sun said of Schroeder afterwards, [...] "when his boot touched French soil, it was a great moment in history". He earned a Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart during World War II, in addition to numerous other decorations.|$|E
