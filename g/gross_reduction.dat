It aims less at deciding this controversy, than at defining the limits within which its economic aspect may be said to lie.

[...] Another study showed that persistent hypothyroxinaemia at 12 weeks gestation was associated with an 8-10 point deficit in mental and motor function scores in infant offspring compared to children of mothers with normal thyroid function.

30|$|Fire may {{therefore}} affect foraging opportunities for wading birds through several mechanisms, including direct mortality of prey, alteration of habitat that prey depend on, increased primary production benefiting primary consumers through {{the release of}} nutrients and increased light, or changing accessibility of prey. In this study, we first tested the general prediction that wading birds select for burned habitats over unburned habitat (H 1). We also examined several mechanisms that might explain why birds are attracted to burns. We tested the hypothesis that fires make prey available by injuring or killing prey during the burn, predicting that dead or injured prey would be more abundant in burned than unburned areas (H 2). Under the assumption that primary production post burn would be elevated, we also tested the prediction that live prey densities would be greater in burned than unburned sawgrass (H 3). If <b>gross</b> <b>reductions</b> in vegetation create higher prey vulnerability, we predicted that wading birds would have a higher capture rate (captures per minute; H 4 a) and capture efficiency (captures per attempt; H 4 b) in burned areas than in unburned areas, accounting for effects of water depth, flock size, and time since burn.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{processes}} of myelination remain incompletely understood but are of profound biomedical importance {{owing to the}} several dysmyelinating and demyelinating disorders known in humans. Here, we analyze the zebrafish puma mutant, isolated originally for pigment pattern defects limited to the adult stage. We show that puma mutants also have late-arising defects in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system, locomotor abnormalities, and sex-biased defects in adult craniofacial morphology. Using methods of positional cloning, we identify a critical genetic interval harboring two alpha tubulin loci, and we identify a chemically induced missense mutation in one of these, tubulin alpha 8 -like 3 a (tuba 8 l 3 a). We demonstrate tuba 8 l 3 a expression in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), leading us to search for defects in the development of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS. We find <b>gross</b> <b>reductions</b> in CNS myelin and oligodendrocyte numbers in adult puma mutants, and these deficits are apparent already during the larval-to-adult transformation. By contrast, analyses of embryos and early larvae reveal a normal complement of oligodendrocytes that nevertheless fail to localize normal amounts of myelin basic protein (mbp) mRNA in cellular processes, and fail to organize these processes as in the wild-type.

40|$|The classic minimum {{induced drag}} spanload is not {{necessarily}} the best choice for an aircraft. For a single aircraft configuration, variations from the elliptic, minimum drag optimum load distribution can produce wing weight savings that result in airplane performance benefits. For a group of aircraft flying in formation, non-elliptic lift distributions can give high induced drag reductions both for the formation and for each airplane. For single aircraft, a discrete vortex method which performs the calculations in the Trefftz plane has been used to calculate optimum spanloads for non-coplanar multi-surface configurations. The method includes constraints for lift coefficient, pitching moment coefficient and wing root bending moment.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{efficacy}} of radiation therapy, {{the mainstay of}} treatment for malig-nant gliomas, is limited by our inability to accurately determine tumor margins. As a result, despite recent advances, the prognosis remains appalling. Because gliomas preferentially infiltrate along white matter tracks, methods that show white matter disruption should improve this delineation. In this study, results of histologic examination from samples obtained from image-guided brain biopsies were correlated with diffusion tensor images. METHODS: Twenty patients requiring image-guided biopsies for presumed gliomas were imaged preoperatively. Patients underwent image-guided biopsies with multiple biopsies taken along a single track that went into normal-appearing brain. Regions of interest were determined from the sites of the biopsies, and diffusion tensor imaging findings were compared with glioma histology.

The losses {{observed}} for storage conditions and times as {{allowed by the}} reference standard for dynamic olfactometry (EN 13725 : 2003) indicate that odour concentration values due {{to the presence of}} small molecules may be significantly underestimated if samples are not analysed immediately after sampling. A diffusion model was used in order to study diffusion through the bag. The study discusses the effect of concentration gradient (ΔC) across the polymeric membrane of the analyte. The ΔC was controlled by using a setup bag called “double bags. ” Experimental data show a reduction of ammonia percentage losses due to the effect of the external multibarrier. The expedient of the double bag loaded with the same gas mixture allows a reduced diffusion of ammonia into the inner bag. Comparing the inner bag losses with those of the single bag stored in the same conditions (T, P, u) and with equal geometrical characteristics (S/V, z), it was observed that the inner bag of the double bag displays a 16 % loss while the single bag displays a 37 % loss.

In these cases a variety of surgical techniques have been used on the infer-ior turbinates. 1 During the last decade laser surgery {{has been reported}} as an effective method {{to reduce the size of}} the turbinates, 2 and in most recent years submucosal tis-sue reduction by radiofrequency energy has been reported not only to be effective in improving nasal obstruction but also in preserving nasal mucociliary function. 3, 4 The purpose of this retrospective study was to investi-gate the long-term effects, and possible side-effects, of <b>gross</b> <b>reduction</b> of the inferior turbinates by means of bipolar radiofrequency therapy in an ordinary clinical population...|$|E
40|$|Nations {{having access}} to oceans are blessed with the wealth of many added {{resources}}. Fisheries form one among the renewable, but not inexhaustible marine resources. Majority of fisher folk in India, who depends on these resources for their livelihood over generations could not still get the benefits of rapid technological advancements and economic development. The operational efficiency of complex and diverse capture fishing strategies led to implicit conflict in resource use among stakeholders of different sectors. Mounting competition and continuous technological up-gradation in open access multi - gear, multi- species marine fisheries {{paved the way for}} increase in <b>gross</b> production with <b>reduction</b> in catch rates and per capita earnings. Excess capacity of fishing fleets due to overcapitalization has not only led to disguised unemployment and diminishing returns but also threatens the extinction of certain distinctly precious resources beyond the sustainable level. The marginalisation further widens economic disparity and coastal distress warranting massive extension efforts in capacity building and empowerment of stakeholders for sustainable production and equitable distribution...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe research presented {{is dedicated to}} the advancement of construction techniques in order to implement new designs of a vehicle suited for cross-flow fan propulsion. This is accomplished by designing a quad-rotor cross-flow fan that incorporates lessons learned from previous generation models as well introducing novel new construction concepts tailored to cross-flow fan propulsion vehicles. The current vehicle design was built using both custom and standard sections. Commercially available drivetrain and control components are used. The new design focused on three key areas of improvement: airframe simplification, <b>gross</b> takeoff weight <b>reduction</b> and structural rigidity improvement. At all phases the construction and emphasis on using readily available technologies or minor modifications to these was maintained. Novel techniques in construction are presented that allow these technologies to be leveraged. Finally, a new vehicle was built and tested and shown to be able to take-off vertically and be fully controllable in pitch, yaw, and roll.

40|$|Cobalt oxide Co(3) O(4) is {{prepared}} {{according to several}} methods i. e. oxalate decomposition (CoAO), surfactant-assisted precipitation (CoCTAB), sol-gel technique (CoSG) and polymer combustion (CoPVA). The solids are characterized by XRD, FTIR, TPR and TEM analysis. The method via oxalate decomposition (CoAO) appears as that giving the smallest particles nanostructured with an almost monomodal distribution, whereas the CoPVA needs to be calcined at the highest temperature {{in order to have}} pure Co(3) O(4). As a consequence on CoPVA the largest particle size is found. The reducibility by H(2) of cobalt oxide particles having the smallest (CoAO) and the largest particle size (CoPVA) is found to depend on the particle dimensions and, where the distribution is monomodal, the reduction steps Co(3) O(4) -> CoO -> Co appear clearly distinct and the temperatures relative to the two reduction steps are well beyond those monitored on microprepared oxide, where only a <b>gross</b> and unique <b>reduction</b> peak is envisaged...|$|R
