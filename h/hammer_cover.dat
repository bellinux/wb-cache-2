25|$|Orangutans (genus Pongo) {{were first}} {{observed}} using {{tools in the}} wild in 1994 in {{the northwest corner of}} Sumatra. As with the chimpanzees, orangutans use tools made from branches and leaves to scratch, scrape, wipe, sponge, swat, fan, hook, probe, scoop, pry, chisel, <b>hammer,</b> <b>cover,</b> cushion and amplify. They will break off a tree branch that is about 30cm long, snap off the twigs, fray one end and then use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites. Sumatran orangutans use a variety of tools—up to 54 types for extracting insects or honey, and as many as 20 types for opening or preparing fruits such as the hard to access Neesia Malayana. They also use an 'autoerotic tool'—a stick which they use to stimulate the genitals and masturbate (both male and female). In parts of Borneo, orangutans use handfuls of leaves as napkins to wipe their chins while orangutans in parts of Sumatra use leaves as gloves, helping them handle spiny fruits and branches, or as seat cushions in spiny trees. There have been reports that individuals in both captivity and in the wild use tools held between the lips or teeth, rather than in the hands. In captivity, orangutans have been taught to chip stone handaxes.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate effectiveness of surface coating repairs after 20 years since their application on façade panels of two existing concrete buildings. The repairs involved coatings and electrochemical treatment systems comprising Silane and Siloxane (S/S), Amino Alcohol Corrosion Inhibitor (AACI), acrylic coating, and re-alkalisation (Re-Alk). Altogether, 11 selected façade panels were evaluated in this study. The field investigations comprised visual survey, non-destructive tests (NDT) for compressive strength using Schmidt <b>hammer,</b> <b>cover</b> depth, reinforcement bar size, Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity Test (UPV), Torrent permeability. Limited carbonation depth tests were also conducted on selected panels. It was found that, UPV and permeability values indicated poor or very poor concrete quality in the repaired panels except for those repaired using acrylic coatings, which showed retention of good concrete quality. AACI coatings with or without S/S gave similar performance as control, implying no significantly improved protection by these repair materials...|$|E

25|$|Certain revolvers, called double-action-only (DAO) or, more {{correctly}} {{but less}} commonly, self-cocking, lack the latch {{that enables the}} hammer to be locked to the rear, and thus can only be fired in the double-action mode. With no way to lock the hammer back, DAO designs tend to have bobbed or spurless hammers, and may even have the <b>hammer</b> completely <b>covered</b> by the revolver's frame (i.e., shrouded or hooded). These are generally intended for concealed carrying, where a hammer spur could snag when the revolver is drawn. The potential reduction in accuracy in aimed fire is offset by the increased capability for concealment.|$|R

5000|$|This pistol was {{actually}} fired by action of a hammer striking and driving a firing pin into a center-fire cartridge's primer. The <b>hammer</b> was <b>covered</b> by {{the rear of}} the slide. The [...] "hammerless" [...] designation was merely an advertising designation pointing out the pistol's particular suitability for concealed carry. Special features include a serrated slide to prevent slippage during manual cycling of the slide, and two safety mechanisms (a grip safety and a manual safety). The grip safety is a spring-loaded piece making up the back strap of the pistol. The grip safety, though not solely restricted to them, was a typical feature of Colt automatic pistols. A magazine safety was added on later models; this feature prevents the pistol from being fired with a round in the chamber and the magazine removed.|$|R
40|$|What is Blaxploitation? In {{the early}} 1970 s {{a type of}} film emerged that {{featured}} all-black casts, really cool soul, R 'n' B and disco music soundtracks, characters sporting big guns, big dashikis, and even bigger 'fros, and {{had some of the}} meanest, baddest attitudes to shoot their way across our screens. More than that, for African-American audiences these films were an antidote to the sanitised 'safe' images of blackness that Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby presented to America. These films depicted a reality about the world which African-American audiences could identify with, even if the stories themselves were pure fantasy. Blaxploitation Films considers Blaxploitation from the perspective of class and racial rebellion, genre - and Stickin' it to the Man, with over 60 Blaxploitation films reviewed and discussed.

50|$|Horton first {{believed}} that the weapon used had been a ripping chisel. One {{was found in the}} shop, but it was clean. In the bedroom he found a heavy, long-handled shipwright's <b>hammer,</b> or maul, <b>covered</b> with blood, leaning against a chair. He assumed this was the murder weapon, abandoned when Jewell's knocking scared the killer away. Human hairs were stuck in the drying blood on the flat, heavy end, and the tapered end, used for driving nails into wood, was chipped.Two sets of footprints were then discovered {{at the back of the}} shop. These appeared to belong to the killers, as they contained both blood and sawdust from carpentry work done inside earlier in the day. A group of citizens followed the tracks to Pennington Street, which ran behind the house, and found a possible witness who reported that he had seen a group of some ten men running away from an empty house in the direction of New Gravel Lane (now Glamis Road) shortly after the alarm had been raised. Speculation now arose that the crime was the work of a gang.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a certain}} {{relationship}} with the glass harmonica and the clavic cylinder. The glass harmonica produces the sound by friction from touching the rotating bells with wet fingers.With the terpodion, operating the keyboard pushes a wooden or metal arm against a rotating coated cylinder of wood or other material, producing sounds by friction. For the lower notes the arms are mainly made of wood and for the higher notes they are made of metal. The arms are adjustable so the pitch of each note can be adjusted within the tuning process. The terpodion rarely requires tuning.The rotating cylinder is made from box wood (Buxus sempervirens), but the patent states {{it could be any}} material. The most important aspect of the cylinder is the coating. The exact mixture {{can be seen in the}} patent writing. (2 parts ethanol, 1 part mastic, 1 part sandarac, 1/16 part campher). The vibrating parts are pushed by the key mechanic toward the rotating cylinder so a sort of <b>hammer</b> that is <b>covered</b> by soft rough leather, which is coated with same mixture as the cylinder.The volume of the sound is dependent on the amount of pressure applied to the keys. The lower register requires more pressure for the same amount of volume as the higher register.|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean domain is {{characterized}} by a specific climate resulting from the close interplay between atmospheric and marine processes and strongly differentiated regional topographies. Corsica Island, a mountainous area located {{in the western part of}} the Mediterranean Sea is particularly suitable to quantify regional denudation rates in the framework of a source-to-sink approach. Indeed, fluvial sedimentation in East-Corsica margin is almost exclusively limited to its alluvial plain and offshore domain and its basement is mainly constituted of quartz-rich crystalline rocks allowing cosmogenic nuclide Be- 10 measurements. In this paper, Holocene denudation rates of catchments from the eastern part of the island of Corsica are quantified relying on in situ produced Be- 10 concentrations in stream sediments and interpreted in an approach including quantitative geomorphology, rock strength measurement (with a Schmidt <b>Hammer)</b> and vegetation <b>cover</b> distribution. Calculated denudation rates range from 15 to 95 mm ka(- 1). When compared with rates from similar geomorphic domains experiencing a different climate setting, such as the foreland of the northern European Alps, they appear quite low and temporally stable. At the first order, they better correlate with rock strength and vegetation cover than with morphometric indexes. Spatial distribution of the vegetation is controlled by morpho-climatic parameters including sun exposure and the direction of the main wet wind, so-called Libecciu'. This distribution, as well as the basement rock strength seems to play a significant role in the denudation distribution. We thus suggest that the landscape reached a geomorphic steady-state due to the specific Mediterranean climate and that Holocene denudation rates are mainly sustained by weathering processes, through the amount of regolith formation, rather than being transport-limited. Al/K measurements used as a proxy to infer present-day catchment-wide chemical weathering patterns might support this assumption...|$|R
