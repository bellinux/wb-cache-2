As Motherwell saw, Bekie (Beichan, Buchan, Bateman) is really Becket, Gilbert Becket, father of Thomas of Canterbury. Every one has heard how HIS Saracen bride sought him in London. (Robert of Gloucester's Life and Martyrdom of Thomas Becket, Percy Society. See Child's Introduction, IV., i. 1861, and Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. xv., 1827.) The legend of the <b>dissolved</b> <b>marriage</b> is from the common stock of ballad lore, Motherwell found an example {{in the state of}} Cantefable, alternate prose and verse, like Aucassin and Nicolette. Thus the cockney rhyme descends from the twelfth century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the context}} of AVAHAN, the India AIDS Initiative of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, general {{population}} surveys (GPS) were carried out between 2006 and 2008 in Belgaum (northern), Bellary (mid-state) and Mysore (southern) districts of Karnataka state, south India. Data from these three surveys were analysed to understand heterogeneity in HIV risk. Methods Outcome variables were the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Independent variables included age, district, place of residence, along with socio-demographic, medical and behavioural characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression was undertaken to identify characteristics associated with HIV and differences between districts, incorporating survey statistics to consider weights and cluster effects. Results The participation rate was 79. 0 % for the interview and 72. 5 % for providing a blood or urine sample that was tested for HIV. Belgaum had the highest overall HIV (1. 43 %) and Herpes simplex type- 2 (HSV- 2) (16. 93 %) prevalence, and the lowest prevalence of curable STIs. In Belgaum, the HIV epidemic is predominantly rural, and among women. In Bellary, the epidemic is predominantly in urban areas and among men, and HIV prevalence was 1. 18 %. Mysore had the lowest prevalence of HIV (0. 80 %) and HSV- 2 (10. 89 %) and the highest prevalence of curable STIs. Higher HIV prevalence among men was associated with increasing age (p 25 - 29 years = 11. 22, 95 %CI: 1. 42 - 88. 74, AOR 30 - 34 years = 13. 13, 95 %CI: 1. 67 - 103. 19 and AOR 35 - 39 years = 11. 33, 95 %CI: 1. 32 - 96. 83), having more than one lifetime sexual partner (AOR= 4. 61, 95 %CI: 1. 26 - 16. 91) and having ever used a condom (AOR= 3. 32, 95 %CI: 1. 38 - 7. 99). Having a <b>dissolved</b> <b>marriage</b> (being widowed/divorced/separated) was the strongest predictor (AOR= 10. 98, 95 %CI: 5. 35 - 22. 57) of HIV among women. Being a muslim woman was associated with lower HIV prevalence (AOR= 0. 27, 95 %CI: 0. 08 - 0. 87). Conclusion The HIV epidemic in Karnataka shows considerable heterogeneity, and {{there appears to be}} an increasing gradient in HIV prevalence from south to north. The sex work structure in the northern districts may explain the higher prevalence of HIV in northern Karnataka. The higher prevalence of HIV and HSV- 2 and lower prevalence of curable STIs in Belgaum suggests a later epidemic phase. Similarly, higher prevalence of curable STIs and lower HIV and HSV- 2 prevalence in Mysore suggests an early phase epidemic. </p...|$|E
