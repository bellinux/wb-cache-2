40|$|One {{application}} of physical acoustics {{is the development}} of ultrasonic dental instruments for cleaning purposes including <b>descalers</b> and endosonic files. The vibration characteristics of these instruments have been measured by scanning laser vibrometry, SLV. One possible contribution to the cleaning processes is cavitation and we have been using sonochemical methods to characterize cavitation around dental instruments. For example, significant amounts of sonoluminescence can be produced at the vibration antinodes of the endosonic files and there is good correspondence between regions of cavitation and large vibration. The cleaning efficacies of the files were studied using an irrigant used in endodontics (sodium hypochlorite) to bleach a dye (Rhodamine B). Results showed that ultrasound accelerates the rate of degrdation of the dye. For a range of different file shapes and sizes, there was a correlation between sonoluminescence and Rhodamine B degradation although the chemical effects of each files depended on their design. A comparison of the chemistry with the SLV results should allow the optimization of cavitation production along the endosonic files by modifying their shape to increase the cleaning efficacy for benefit in treatments...|$|R
40|$|A b s t r a c t The aim of {{our study}} was to quantify, {{by means of a}} {{chemical}} dosimeter, the chemical effects of cavitation ultrasound generated by a descaling tool. These effects are associated with the formation of cavitation bubbles that produce free radicals. Quantification (dosimetry) of chemical cavitation effects due to ultrasonic <b>descalers</b> has not been reported yet. In this study, a Piezon Master 400 ultrasonic unit with different working tips was used. A mixture of chloroform and distilled water, at a 1 : 1 ratio, served as a chemical dosimeter. Cl ˚ ions, which are liberated during exposure to ultrasound, give rise to a weak hydrochloric acid (HCl). The pH values of this solution were measured in each sample at 11 different exposure times. Using a logarithmic scale, the linear dependence of pH values on exposure times was obtained. This approach also simplified statistical evaluation of the results. Our study showed that, in addition to mechanical cavitation effects, ultrasonic treatment for tooth descaling also resulted in formation of sonochemical products. Because the safety of patients is involved, the clinical importance of these reactions should be further studied. K e y w o r d s Ultrasound, Descaling, Cavitation, Chemical dosimetr...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{occurrence}} of slimy black biofilms on water taps was reported from various drinking water supply areas in Germany. In {{the course of the}} investigations presented here, the herpotrichiellaceous black yeast Exophiala lecanii-corni could be identified as the main contributor to these biofilms. This species could not be detected in any sample taken from corresponding public drinking water production, treatment and distribution facilities, but was found to be common in sinks of sanitary installations. Thus, retrograde contamination of the water taps as it is known for Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be likely. An important cofactor {{in the formation of the}} respective biofilms seems to be volatile organic compounds from indoor air, which serve the fungi as carbon and energy source. Comparative nephelometrically recorded growth kinetics with E. lecanii-corni showed that acetic acid and ethanol, common components of cleaning agents (<b>descalers)</b> and disinfectants, can be utilized by this fungi already at low concentrations. Lab experiments under otherwise optimal nutrient conditions revealed a growth-promoting effect of phosphate at a concentration of 0. 75 mg/L PO 43 - and higher. SDS turned out to be a very effective alternative to conventional aggressive disinfectants for biofilm control and elimination. A comprehensive evaluation concerning the risk arising from the identified fungi in the biofilms revealed that health hazards to humans are rather unlikely...|$|R

5000|$|A {{descaling}} {{agent or}} chemical <b>descaler</b> is a chemical substance used to remove limescale from metal surfaces {{in contact with}} hot water, such as in [...] boilers, water heaters, and [...] kettles. [...] Descaling agents are typically acidic compounds such as hydrochloric acid that react with the alkaline carbonate compounds present in the scale, producing carbon dioxide gas and a soluble salt. [...] Strongly acidic descaling agents are often corrosive to the eyes and skin.|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic descalers {{are used}} in {{dentistry}} to remove calculus and other contaminants from teeth. One mechanism which may assist in the cleaning is cavitation generated in cooling water around the <b>descaler.</b> The spatial distribution of cavitation around three designs of <b>descaler</b> tips and under three load conditions has been observed using sonochemiluminescence from a luminol solution and compared with the vibratory motion of the tips in a water bath, characterised by scanning laser vibrometry. The type of cavitation was confirmed by acoustic emission analysed by a ‘Cavimeter’ supplied by NPL. Surface profilometry and SEM of eroded hydroxyapatite pellets was performed to quantitatively study the erosion caused by a <b>descaler</b> tip in both contact and non-contact modes. Densitometry was used to study the erosion of black ink from a glass microscope slide, and determined that under the majority of conditions, no erosion was demonstrated via cavitation, by descalers operating in non-contact mode, although significant erosion was demonstrated with the tip {{in contact with the}} slide.

40|$|Objective. To {{ascertain}} the reported toxicity of current United Kingdom (UK) household products following {{the launch of}} new products, such as liquid detergent capsules, and the manufacture of more concentrated formulations. Methods. Between 1 March 2008 and 30 April 2009 the UK National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) collected prospectively 5939 telephone enquiries relating to household products, approximately 10 % of all telephone enquiries received over this period. Results. The majority of enquiries (n =[*] 3893; 65. 5 %) concerned children 5 {{years of age or}} less and were received predominantly from hospitals (n =[*] 1905; 32. 1 %), general practitioners (n =[*] 1768; 29. 8 %) and NHS Direct/NHS 24 (n =[*] 1694; 28. 5 %). The majority of exposures occurred at home (n =[*] 5795; 97. 6 %); most exposures were accidental (n =[*] 5561; 93. 6 %). Liquid detergent capsules were most commonly involved (n =[*] 647), followed by bleaches (n =[*] 481), air fresheners (n =[*] 429), multipurpose cleaners (n =[*] 408), dishwasher products (n =[*] 399) and <b>descalers</b> (n =[*] 397). Exposure to household products occurred mainly as a result of ingestion (n =[*] 4616; 75. 8 %), with eye contact (n =[*] 513; 8. 4 %), inhalation (n =[*] 420; 6. 9 %) and skin contact (n =[*] 187; 3. 1 %) being less common; 5. 1 % (n =[*] 313) of enquiries involved multiple routes of exposure. The most commonly reported features were vomiting (ingestion), pain (eye contact), dyspnoea (inhalation) and burns (skin contact). In 5840 of 5939 enquiries the Poisoning Severity Score (PSS) was known. The majority of patients (n =[*] 4117; 70. 5 %) were asymptomatic (PSS 0), 28. 0 % (n =[*] 1638) developed minor features (PSS 1), 1. 3 % (75 patients) developed moderate features (PSS 2) and 0. 15 % (nine patients) developed serious features (PSS 3). Four of these nine patients made a complete recovery, two died from exposure to drain cleaner and PVC solvent cleaner; the outcome in three was unknown. Conclusion. In the UK, advice from the NPIS is sought commonly regarding household products, but such exposures only rarely result in clinically serious features. As 65. 5 % of exposures were in children less than 5 years of age, parents clearly have an important role to play in ensuring that household products are stored safely at all times...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of making welding wire an {{important}} step is to descale an oxide layer {{from the surface of the}} wire. If the oxide layer is not entirely removed it will affect the quality of the finished product. A common way of descaling is to use acids which is not quite environmental friendly. It is possible to mechanically descale the wire but the method needs to be better since the current methods does not give consistent results. In this work the possiblity to descale the wire using ultrasounds have been investigated. It has been theoretically analysed, modelled in MATLAB and compared with results from an existing mechanical wire <b>descaler.</b> The results have not been validated through experimental analysis. The results show that ultrasound may be an interesting technique to investigate further, and guidelines and important variables for future experiments are given...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a process to}} treat cooling tower water {{by means of a}} fully automated and chemical free mechanical water treatment process. This is an alternative to conventional chemical treatment. Beginning with a suction pump to draw water out of the tower sump, water goes through a permanent magnetic <b>descaler</b> to increase the water solubility and begin the scale inhibition process. This also descales existing scale build-up in the system. Ozone is manufactured from ambient air and injected into the bypass system through a venturi type injector. This kills algae, slime and bacteria and enhances the magnetic descaling process. The final stage filter separates solids from the water to prevent corrosion from impingement. These solids are automatically purged to the sanitary drain. Clarified water is returned to the sump where the process repeats on a 10 %- 20 % by volume side stream basis...|$|E
