5000|$|Diffusion is the net {{movement}} of material {{from an area}} of high concentration to an area with lower concentration. The difference of concentration between the two areas is often termed as the concentration gradient, and diffusion will continue until this gradient has been eliminated. Since diffusion moves materials from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, it is described as moving solutes [...] "down the concentration gradient" [...] (compared with active transport, which often moves material from area of low concentration to area of higher concentration, and therefore referred to as moving the material [...] "against the concentration gradient"). However, in many cases (e.g. passive drug transport) {{the driving force of}} passive transport can not be simplified to the concentration gradient. If there are different solutions at {{the two sides of the}} membrane with different <b>equilibrium</b> <b>solubility</b> of the drug, the difference in degree of saturation is the driving force of passive membrane transport.

40|$|Gastrointestinal fluid is {{a complex}} milieu and it is {{recognised}} that gut drug solubility is different to that observed in simple aqueous buffers. Simulated gastrointestinal media have been developed covering fasted and fed states to facilitate in vitro prediction of gut solubility and product dissolution. However, the combination of bile salts, phospholipids, fatty acids and proteins in an aqueous buffered system creates multiple phases and drug solubility is therefore a complex interaction between these components, which may create unique environments for each API. The impact on solubility can be assessed through a statistical design of experiment (DoE) approach, to determine the influence and relationships between factors. In this paper DoE {{has been applied to}} fed simulated gastrointestinal media consisting of eight components (pH, bile salt, lecithin, sodium oleate, monoglyceride, buffer, salt and pancreatin) using a two level D-optimal design with forty-four duplicate measurements and four centre points. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>solubility</b> of a range of poorly soluble acidic (indomethacin, ibuprofen, phenytoin, valsartan, zafirlukast), basic (aprepitant, carvedilol, tadalafil, bromocriptine) and neutral (fenofibrate, felodipine, probucol, itraconazole) drugs was investigated. Results indicate that the DoE provides <b>equilibrium</b> <b>solubility</b> values that are comparable to literature results for other simulated fed gastrointestinal media systems or human intestinal fluid samples. For acidic drugs the influence of pH predominates but other significant factors related to oleate and bile salt or interactions between them are present. For basic drugs pH, oleate and bile salt have equal significance along with interactions between pH and oleate and lecithin and oleate. Neutral drugs show diverse effects of the media components particularly with regard to oleate, bile salt, pH and lecithin but the presence of monoglyceride, pancreatin and buffer have significant but smaller effects on solubility. There are fourteen significant interactions between factors mainly related to the surfactant components and pH, indicating that the solubility of neutral drugs in fed simulated media is complex. The results also indicate that the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>solubility</b> of each drug can exhibit individualistic behaviour associated with the drug’s chemical structure, physicochemical properties and interaction with media components. The utility of DoE for fed simulated media has been demonstrated providing <b>equilibrium</b> <b>solubility</b> values comparable with similar in vitro systems whilst also providing greater information on the influence of media factors and their interactions.

40|$|Upon oral {{administration}} the solubility {{of a drug}} in intestinal fluid is a key property influencing bioavailability. It is also recognised that simple aqueous solubility does not reflect intestinal solubility and to optimise in vitro investigations simulated intestinal media systems have been developed. Simulated intestinal media which can mimic either the fasted or fed state consists of multiple components each of which either singly or in combination may influence drug solubility, a property that can be investigated by a statistical design of experiment technique. In this study a design of experiment covering the full range from the lower limit of fasted to the upper limit of fed parameters and using {{a small number of}} experiments has been performed. The measured <b>equilibrium</b> <b>solubility</b> values are comparable with literature values for simulated fasted and fed intestinal fluids as well as human fasted and fed intestinal fluids. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>solubility</b> data range is statistically equivalent to a combination of published fasted and fed design of experiment data in six (indomethacin, phenytoin, zafirlukast, carvedilol, fenofibrate and probucol) drugs with three (aprepitant, tadalafil and felodipine) drugs not equivalent. In addition the measured <b>equilibrium</b> <b>solubility</b> data sets were not normally distributed. Further studies will be required to determine the reasons for these results however it implies that a single solubility measurement without knowledge of the solubility distribution will be of limited value. The statistically significant media factors which promote <b>equilibrium</b> <b>solubility</b> (pH, sodium oleate and bile salt) were in agreement with published results but the number of determined significant factors and factor interactions was fewer in this study, lecithin for example did not influence solubility. This {{may be due to the}} reduction in statistical sensitivity from the lower number of experimental data points or the fact that using the full range will examine media parameters ratios that are not biorelevant. Overall the approach will provide an estimate of the solubility range and the most important media factors but will not be equivalent to larger scale focussed studies. Further investigations will be required to determine why some drugs do not produce equivalent DoE solubility distributions, for example combined fasted and fed DoE, but this simply may be due to the complexity and individuality of the interactions between a drug and the media components...|$|E
