500|$|Coming off a {{successful}} second AHL season, Grabner {{was expected to}} challenge for a roster spot at the Canucks' 2009–10 training camp, but was sent {{back down to the}} Moose {{before the start of the}} regular season. [...] After a quick start with the Moose, however, scoring four goals in five games, he was called up by the Canucks on 14 October 2009, to replace injured star winger Daniel Sedin. Grabner then scored his first NHL goal on 21 October on the powerplay against Antti Niemi in a 3–2 win against the Chicago Blackhawks. Nine games into his initial stint with the Canucks, however, he injured himself during a pre-game warmup on 1 November. Grabner was kicking a soccer ball around with teammates before a game against the Colorado Avalanche when <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>over</b> his ankle.|$|E
500|$|On April 13, 1921, the Arizona Republican ran {{a lengthy}} {{interview}} with Thomas Raines, a former resident of Tombstone. Raines described the gunfight as an ambush. He {{said that he}} remembered the Earps shot the Cowboys and killed Ike Clanton (when they actually killed his brother Billy) before the Cowboys {{had a chance to}} surrender. He recalled that the Cowboys [...] "were leading their horses out of the gate when they were confronted, almost from ambush, by four of the Earps, Virgil. Wyatt, Morgan and Jim and by Doc Holliday. Virgil Earp, armed with a sawed off express shotgun, and accompanying his demand with profanity, yelled [...] "Hands up!" [...] But he didn't wait for the action demanded and shot almost as soon as he spoke. Tom McLowery showed his empty bands, and cried. 'Gentlemen, I am unarmed.' Holliday answered with the discharge of his shotgun. Ike Clanton fell at the first fire, mortally wounded, but <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>over</b> and fired two shots from his pistol between his bent knees." ...|$|E
500|$|The weather {{conditions}} on the grid were dry before the race; the air temperature was [...] and the track temperature [...] The race started at 14:00 local time. A total of approximately 100,000 spectators attended the race. As the drivers were preparing to start the formation lap, both Minardis were in the pit lane due to technical difficulties. Both Alonso and Marques initially started from the pit lane. Both Williams drivers maintained first and second positions going into the first corner. Further back, Michael Schumacher slowed with an issue with his gear selection, which resulted in drivers being forced to swerve to avoid him. Burti was unable to view the Ferrari as Panis was blocking his view and hit the rear of Schumacher's car, launching Burti {{into the air and}} <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>over</b> the top on Bernoldi's vehicle's and narrowly landed on Verstappen's Arrows. Burti's car lost one of its wheels, landing of Bernoldi's Arrows which resulted in a broken engine cover and rear wing for the Brazilian. Burti's car bounced across the gravel trap and came to a rest on the Nordkurve corner tyre barriers. The race was red-flagged as strands of carbon fibre were scattered across the track and marshals were needed to clear the debris.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ending of}} the fight {{remains one of the}} most {{controversial}} in boxing history. Midway through the first round, Liston threw a left jab and Ali went over it with a fast right, knocking the former champion down. Liston went down on his back. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>over,</b> got to his right knee and then fell on his back again. Many in attendance did not see Ali deliver the punch. The fight quickly descended into chaos. Referee Jersey Joe Walcott, a former World Heavyweight Champion himself, had a hard time getting Ali to go to a neutral corner. Ali initially stood over his fallen opponent, gesturing and yelling at him, [...] "Get up and fight, sucker!" [...] "Nobody will believe this!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} {{game against the}} Milwaukee Braves, his {{teammates}} joked {{that he had a}} [...] "perfect" [...] night, as he went 1 for 1 with a single, two walks, and a successful squeeze play. On May 25, there was a play at the plate with the Giants up 2-1 against the Philadelphia Phillies where Phillies pitcher 6'0", 200 pound Robin Roberts attempted to run for home off a ground ball in the third inning. He collided with Landrith, knocking Landrith unconscious as <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>over</b> onto his back. Despite being knocked out, he held onto the ball, saving the Giants lead. At the end of May, Landrith lost his starting role back to Bob Schmidt. He only had a [...]208 batting average combined with a [...]221 slugging percentage. Landrith hit very well in July and August, hitting [...]305 over the two-month stretch.|$|E
2500|$|In 1927, {{shortly before}} his {{graduation}} at March Field, Mantz was flying solo over the Coachella Valley when he spotted a train heading west over the empty desert floor up the long grade from Indio. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>over</b> into a dive, leveled off a few feet above the track and flew head-on towards the train as the engineer repeatedly sounded the whistle. At the last moment Mantz pulled up, did a [...] "victory roll" [...] and flew away. This sort of dangerous stunt was fairly common during the early era of loosely regulated flying in the 1920s but the train's passengers included ranking officers coming to March Field {{to participate in the}} graduation ceremonies and Mantz was subsequently dismissed from the army. His instructor reportedly made it clear to him that he had the makings of an exceptional pilot and encouraged him to continue a career in aviation.|$|E

5000|$|After calling an {{undertaker}} {{who takes}} the body of Claire's mother away, Jay insists on staying the night to [...] "take care" [...] of Claire, promising {{to sleep on the}} couch. But he goes to Claire's narrow bed and starts to remove her clothes. After a few seconds of brutal thrusting, during which he talks to {{her as if she were}} the phone sex service he uses so frequently, <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>over</b> and falls asleep.|$|R
60|$|What do {{you think}} happened? Why, <b>he</b> was <b>rolled</b> <b>over</b> on to his feet so gently that he just gasped with surprise. It didn't seem {{possible}} that such a great paw could be so gentle.|$|R
2500|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Michigan scored its second {{touchdown}} and converted the extra point to take a 12–5 lead. [...] Widman ran 65 yards for the touchdown on a [...] "delayed pass" [...] on the most exciting play of the game. [...] The Chicago Daily Tribune described Widman's run:"Widman scurried {{out of the back}} of the mass of players with the ball under his arm and down the field with nothing in sight ahead of him except the goal posts. [...] All the fast men of the Chicago team went in fast pursuit. [...] It was a beautiful race down the field. [...] Three Chicago men were close behind. [...] But the blue-legged runner gained almost imperceptibly at times, and then barely held his own. [...] He could run as fast as his pursuers, and with his start was safe. [...] If one or two of those Chicago players had made a dive for him perhaps he might have been stopped. One of them did try up near the goal, but missed him, tripping him slightly, but <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>over</b> the line. [...] Michigan had another touchdown and the game, and the Western championship in its pocket." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Geoff Pullar {{unable to}} play Colin Cowdrey opened for England again, a role {{he did not}} relish and after making two runs he was out, mis-hitting a ball from Alan Davidson to Neil Harvey at {{backward}} short-leg, who darted forward to take it at grass height. David Sheppard became Neil Hawke's first Test wicket, catching a full blooded cover drive off his own bowling. This made England 39/2 after 108 minutes and with Ken Barrington entrenched at one end the crowd were looked to Ted Dexter to produce some excitement. The wicket was dead {{and the sky was}} clear, so there was no chance of the ball swinging and the famous Sydney Hill was becoming restless, Barrington raising his cap when he was jeered and a slow hand clap started around the ground as Dexter played himself in. This was briefly curtailed when Barrington glanced a full toss from Garth McKenzie for four and Dexter hit three fours off Bobby Simpson. Norm O'Neill caught Barrington on the pads and appealed, but no else joined in and the Englishman stayed put. Australia were running through 14-15 overs an hour, the fastest so far in the series, but with such defensive play the effort was wasted. Dexter was out after lunch edging O'Neill (1/38) to Simpson at first slip for 47 and Tom Graveney almost went the same way to Benaud. At 5:15 pm the batsmen appealed for light, but were turned down and five minutes later he glanced McKenzie (1/57) off his legs, but [...] "Harvey, anticipating, shot out his left hand; he somersaulted and momentarily stood on his head, then <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>over</b> and sat up, still clutching the ball." [...] Barrington usually woke up when his century was in sight, and a sweep of Simpson was dropped by Brian Booth, but a drive found its way to the boundary and a single brought up his hundred and a surprisingly generous round of applause from the stadium. He drove Benaud straight to Harvey in the covers, who bruised a finger taking his third catch, out for 101 after 320 minutes. Ray Illingworth and Fred Titmus lasted until stumps, with England 195/5 after a full day's play. The second day continued in the same dull way, or perhaps worse as only three boundaries were hit between the two sides. Illingworth (27) and Titmus (34) produced, long, slow innings occasionally interrupted by drizzle before they were both caught by Wally Grout, one off Davidson and the other off Hawke (2/57). Even Fred Trueman played a subdued innings before he was caught by Harvey off Benaud for 30. Alan Smith was bowled by Simpson (1/51) and David Allen and Brian Statham finally livened things up with a last wicket stand of 28 in 35 minutes until Benaud caught Allen off Davidson (3/43). England's 321 had taken them nine and a half hours, an innings more akin to saving a lost cause than trying to win a match.|$|E

60|$|Then {{another step}} of stone, ten feet high; {{and there he}} had to stop himself, and crawl along the edge to find a crack; for if <b>he</b> had <b>rolled</b> <b>over,</b> <b>he</b> would have <b>rolled</b> right into the old woman's garden, and frightened her out of her wits.|$|R
5000|$|After an {{explosive}} argument where Tony yells at Christopher and Brendan Filone about their successful hijacking of a Comley Trucking transport truck, a trucking company that operates under the [...] "protection" [...] of Tony's uncle Corrado Soprano, Brendan {{is picked up}} and {{thrown out of the}} back room and into the kitchen where <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>over</b> a table of fresh meat chops.

50|$|The other escaped Chouans {{are also}} present, {{but before they}} discuss their plans they dump a {{drunkard}} out into the corridor, where <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>over</b> contentedly and settles down {{to sleep in the}} doorway. With the landlord sent away and the drunkard removed, Blue-Heart and White-Beak tell the Marquis that they have laid a trap for the Emperor by scattering nails and broken glass over the road about a km from the Inn. This will cause his horses to go lame at which point they can overpower him and shoot him with the pistol procured by Constance.|$|R

At first, he is happy of the change for the better, but while he's kissing his wife he's hit by strong flashes of Max and Liz together from Max's soul, and <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>over,</b> agonized. At this point, he realizes that Max is still inside him, and he believes that the only way he can get rid of Max is to kill Liz. Clayton goes to Vermont, but when he sees her he realizes that Max's connection to the girl is stronger than he thought.|$|R

They are long in coming, but curiosity always gets the better of them; those in the rear crowd the front rank forward.
