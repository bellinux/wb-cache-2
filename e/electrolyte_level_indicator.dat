40|$|SummaryWe {{studied the}} effects of high doses of {{pentobarbital}} (PB) and carbamazepine (CBZ) on <b>electrolyte</b> <b>levels</b> and pH in an epileptic animal model. Pentobarbital decreased Ca 2 + and Na+ levels without pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). After this, Ca 2 + and Na+ levels continued to decrease except when CBZ was used, which preserved the Ca 2 + levels PTZ may have opposed effects on PB. Our results suggest that PB causes changes in <b>electrolyte</b> <b>levels</b> and pH, but these changes are diminished by CBZ...|$|R

50|$|Treatments for Glycerol Kinase Deficiency are {{targeted}} {{to treat the}} symptoms {{because there are no}} permanent treatments for this disease. The main way to treat these symptoms is by using corticosteroids, glucose infusion, or mineralocorticoids. Corticosteroids are steroid hormones that are naturally produced in the adrenal glands. These hormones regulate stress responses, carbohydrate metabolism, blood <b>electrolyte</b> <b>levels,</b> as well as other uses. The mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone control many <b>electrolyte</b> <b>levels</b> and allow the kidneys to retain sodium. Glucose infusion is coupled with insulin infusion to monitor blood glucose levels and keep them stable.|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} influences of steroid hormones on the serum <b>electrolytes</b> <b>level</b> of the rats. Sex difference and comparison between nephrectomized and non-nephrectomized rats were particularly studied. 1) Administration of testosterone propionate resulted in hyperpotassemia in nephrectomized rats of both sex, but more markedly of male rats. No serum electrolytes change was observed in non-nephrectomized rats. 2) Administration of estradiol benzoate caused no change of serum <b>electrolytes</b> <b>level</b> in male rats but caused hyponatremia, hypochloremia and alkalosis in female rats. This effect was somewhat emphasized in the nephrectomized group when 0. 04 mg of estrogen per 100 g body weight was administered. 3) Cortisone administration caused hyperpotassemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypochloremia and alkalosis in male rats, among which hyperpotassemia was quite striking in the nephrectomized group. In female rats, hyperpotassemia, hypochloremia and alkalosis were also observed, but hyperpotassemia was less marked than that seen in male rats. Also, hyperpotassemia of nephrectomized rats was {{less than that of}} non-nephrectomized group. 4) ACTH administration caused the similar changes of the <b>electrolytes</b> <b>level</b> as cortisone...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether <b>electrolyte</b> <b>levels</b> measured by using blood gas analyzers (ABG) and auto-analyzers (AA) are equivalent {{and can be}} used interchangeably. Methods: This observational prospective study was conducted in 100 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, Adnan Menderes University School of Medicine, Aydin, Turkey, between March and August 2014.

40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} de-termine whether fluctuations in dietary <b>electrolyte</b> <b>level</b> (milliequivalents Na+K-Cl per kilogram) or different di-etary sodium chloride levels would affect performance, water intake, or excreta moisture of chickens fed semdur-amicin vs nonmedicated controls. In all experiments, male commercial broiler chicks were used, and all diets were fed with and without 25 mg semduramicin/kg diet. The basal diets were based on corn, soybean meal, and poul-try oil. Experiments 1, 3, and 4 were conducted using male broiler chicks in battery brooders to 18 d of age. In Experi-ment 1, six <b>electrolyte</b> <b>levels</b> were fed [basal (0. 2 % Na, 0. 33 % Cl, 1. 10 % K); basal plus 0. 1 % Na (from sodium chloride); basal plus 0. 1 % K (from potassium chloride); basal plus 0. 2 % Na (from sodium carbonate); basal plus 0. 34 % K (from potassium chloride); basal plus 0. 15 % Cl (from ammonium chloride) ]. There were no significant changes in BW gain, feed consumption, or feed conver-sion ratio caused by any dietary treatment. Water con-sumption was not affected by the inclusion of Na, Cl, K, or <b>electrolyte</b> <b>levels,</b> but excreta moisture was affected. The highest and lowest excreta moisture levels came from chicks fed the lowest chloride levels. There were no sig-nificant dietary effects on serum Na, Cl, or K by dietary electrolytes or semduramicin...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "flooded" [...] is {{used because}} {{this type of}} battery {{contains}} a quantity of electrolyte fluid so that the plates are completely submerged. The <b>electrolyte</b> <b>level</b> should be above the tops of plates {{which serves as a}} reservoir to make sure that water loss during charging does not lower the level below the plate tops and cause damage. Flooded batteries will decompose some water from the electrolyte during charging, so regular maintenance of flooded batteries requires inspection of <b>electrolyte</b> <b>level</b> and addition of water. Major modes of failure of deep-cycle batteries are loss of the active material due to shedding of the plates, and corrosion of the internal grid that supports active material.
