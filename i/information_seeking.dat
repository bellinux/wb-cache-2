25|$|In the 1980s, {{literature}} {{began to}} emerge which examined <b>information</b> <b>seeking</b> behaviors {{of gay and lesbian}} library patrons. The 1981 book The Joy of Cataloging by Sanford Berman outlined the difficulties of accessing gay and lesbian books and information. In 1988, the Task Force on Gay Liberation released the “International thesaurus of gay and lesbian index terms,” aimed at standardizing terms used for cataloging gay and lesbian-related library materials, and making Library of Congress Subject Headings friendlier for use by gay and lesbian archives.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{library and}} {{information}} science (LIS) {{research has focused}} on the information-seeking practices of practitioners within various fields of professional work. Studies have been carried out into the information-seeking behaviors of librarians, academics, medical professionals, engineers and lawyers (among others). Much of this research has drawn on the work done by Leckie, Pettigrew (now Fisher) and Sylvain, who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the LIS literature (as well as the literature of other academic fields) on professionals' <b>information</b> <b>seeking.</b> The authors proposed an analytic model of professionals' <b>information</b> <b>seeking</b> behaviour, intended to be generalizable across the professions, thus providing a platform for future research in the area. The model was intended to [...] "prompt new insights... and give rise to more refined and applicable theories of information seeking" [...] (1996, p.188). The model has been adapted by Wilkinson (2001) who proposes a model of the <b>information</b> <b>seeking</b> of lawyers.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the <b>information</b> – <b>seeking</b> behaviour {{of members of the}} economically disadvantaged community of Amsterdam. The study involved both a qualitative and quantitative investigation of the critical factors that affected <b>information</b> – <b>seeking,</b> need, and use in the Amsterdam community. The research design included a study of various information behaviour models with particular emphasis on Wilson’s 1996 general model of <b>information</b> – <b>seeking</b> behaviour. The three factors identified by Wilson for the study of various groups’ information behaviour were personality, work – related or work – role and environmental factors. Information science researchers, in the study of rural communities’ information behaviour, have used these three factors extensively. The data collection was triangulated with the use of survey, observations, and focus group discussions and in – depth interviews. The findings show how the person, in the context of <b>information</b> – <b>seeking</b> and the role-played within a given environment, could determine information needs and use. A person in the context of <b>information</b> – <b>seeking,</b> could be a father, a mother, a group leader, a nurse or a teacher. The main elements are the situation within which a need for information arises, and the person performing a role in an environment situated within the context of <b>information</b> – <b>seeking.</b> <b>Information</b> was found to be a critical commodity for the socio – economic, political, and educational development of any given community. Recommendations were made that could transform the community of Amsterdam, through the provision of sustainable information...|$|R

50|$|The CMIS {{has been}} quantitatively tested and {{performs}} well {{when it comes}} to health <b>information</b> <b>seeking</b> behaviors (HISB). There are three main schemas in the CMIS. These are: Antecedents, information field, and <b>information</b> <b>seeking</b> actions. The antecedents are those factors that determine how an information consumer will receive the information. Those factors are: Demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs. These factors are fluid and can change during the health <b>information</b> <b>seeking</b> process. The second schema is the information fields that consist of characteristics and utilities. This schema is concerned with the channels and carriers of information. A person’s understanding is developed through the information field. The third schema involves the transformational processes and measured by the consumer’s understanding of the messages received through the information field. The final schema involves <b>information</b> <b>seeking</b> actions. This is what the consumer does {{as a result of the}} first two schemas through <b>information</b> <b>seeking.</b> There are three major dimensions: the scope, depth, and method of <b>information</b> <b>seeking.</b>|$|E

Disputes arose between the parties over the adequacy of Commerce's search, and Judicial Watch charged that some Department officials had destroyed or removed responsive documents.|$|R
