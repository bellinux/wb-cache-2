40|$|A {{molecular}} cloud (considered {{as a point}} macroparticle) represents a clump of increased mass density moving in the disk of a galaxy. Its presence generates a gravitational polarization of the disk, somewhat analogous to the polarization of a dielectric medium by a test charged particle. This means that the cloud travels along with a wakefield (a region of increased mass density) which is the collective response of the stars and gas to the perturbing mass. It can represent many times {{the mass of the}} cloud, and emits spiral density waves which propagate away. In terms of statistical mechanics, this wakefield will appear as an increased two-particle correlation function which is the equivalent of the <b>Debye</b> <b>sphere</b> in a plasma - despite the absence here of negative charges. At short distances clouds will thus interact through their own gravitational field amplified by their wakefields, which might thus strongly affect their collisionality.

30|$|Another {{phenomenon}} {{linked to}} structure breaker monovalent ions {{as well as}} structure maker divalent ions (Ca 2 +) is the charge inversion of the silica surface [32, 46, 47]. At a certain accelerator concentration the silica surface will be covered by ions {{to such an extent}} that the surface has no charge. That is, the screening is so effective as to completely hide the charge of the surface. At this point the zeta potential will be equal to zero and the <b>Debye</b> <b>sphere</b> will not be present, meaning that no electrostatic repulsion exists between the particles. If the accelerator concentration is high enough, both potassium and cesium have been observed to continue adsorbing to the surface even after complete screening is achieved. This leads to a overcharging of the surface with a positive surface charge as a result. The electrostatic repulsion forces not present or severely reduced by the presence of the accelerator can thus re-emerge due to the higher numbers of ions at the silica surface [48, 49]. The forces between particles in presence of different ions is treated in detail in a review by Trefalt et al. [50].|$|E

Electron emission due to electron impact or ultraviolet exposure can cause a particle {{to have a positive}} charge, which has useful implications for plasma processing, since particles are confined in a discharge only if they have a negative charge. Ion trapping occurs due to ion-neutral collisions within the attractive <b>Debye</b> <b>sphere</b> of a negatively charged particle. Trapped ions reduric the net electric force on a particle.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{derivation}} of the electrostatic screening effect from first principles. We show {{that under the}} conditions prevailing in the Sun the number of particles in the <b>Debye</b> <b>sphere</b> is {{of the order of}} unity. Consequently, fluctuations play a dominant role in the screening process and lead to an energy exchange between the scattering particles and the surrounding plasma that depends on the energy of the particles. Extensive molecular dynamics calculations show that low-energy particles gain on the average energy from the plasma while high-energy particles lose energy to the plasma, in contrast with the classical Salpeter picture in which all particles gain during the close approach to each other the mean Coulomb energy. Next, we adopt the Langevin equation for charged particles with the Rosenbluth potential. We show how the two completely independent methods, the molecular dynamics and Langevin equation, yield the same physical results. We then review the arguments for a static screening based on a static potential and show its basic assumptions and shortcomings. The particular assumptions leading to the Salpeter formula are discussed along with the approximations involved in its derivation. One of the tacit fundamental assumptions in the Salpeter approximation is that the scattering is fully elastic. The inelastic nature of the collisions which are dominant under the solar conditions is clarified. PACS numbers: 52. 25. Gj, 52. 20. Hv, 95. 30. Cq, 26. 65. +t, 26. 20. +f 1...|$|E

Neutron and X-ray solution scattering experiments were performed on the dimeric and trimeric forms of properdin. These have RG values of 9. 1 and 10. 7 nm, respectively. The scattering curves were compared with <b>Debye</b> <b>sphere</b> modeling simulations for properdin. Good agreements were obtained for models similar to published electron micrographs showing that the properdin trimer has a triangular structure with sides of 26 nm.

Sequences for these 12 TSRs were aligned with 19 others found in thrombospondin and the late complement components. Three distinct groups of TSRs were identified, namely, the TSRs found in thrombospondin and properdin, the TSRs mostly found at the N-terminus of the late complement components, and the TSRs found at the C-terminus of the late components. Averaged secondary structure predictions suggested that all three groups contain similar backbone structures with two amphipathic turn regions and one hydrophilic beta-strand region.

40|$|During {{the burn}} of DT (Deuterium-Tritium) fuel in ICF (Inertial Confinement Fusion) target, the energy {{deposition}} of fusion-product charged particles {{is an important}} problem that recently received again increasing attention. The unified theory explains the energy losses due to binary and collective collisions in the dilute plasmas, {{and also in the}} condensed matter physics for the case of plasma parameter less than one, i. e., g 3 ̆c 1, which is related to the number of particles in the Debye radius. ^ The ignition of an ICF DT target produces 3. 5 MeV alpha particles, which are under extremely high-energies compared to the temperature of field plasmas at around 3 - 5 keV. At the incidence of a fast alpha particle (3. 5 MeV) into ionized plasmas as a fusion product, the incoming fast ion loses its energy to the charged particles inside the target, called an ensemble system, by way of primarily Coulomb collisions. At dilute plasmas, i. e., plasma parameter g 3 ̆c 1, the unified theory is well accounted for the energy loss of an alpha particle. ^ However, at dense plasmas, especially for plasma parameter g 3 ̆e 1, there is an extraordinary situation occurred that is caused by ionized field-electrons. Normally an incident ion should lose its energy to the field plasmas due to two-body and many-body collisions. When the velocity of an incident ion is less than that of field-electrons, those free electrons can make a contribution to the incident ion paradoxically by way of collisions among field electrons. Those collisional contributions among field electrons to the incident fast ion via collective phenomena for this particular situation should be taken into account in the unified theory. ^ In the mathematical description of energy losses, the unified theory, which is valid only in the plasma parameter g= 4 pl 3 Dn/ 3 - 12 ̆ 6 Lt; 1, cannot include the collective phenomenon which is the collisions among the field charged particles in dense plasmas.
