5|$|On the October 28, 2014 {{episode of}} Raw, Ziggler and John Cena shook <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> backstage, which The Authority {{interpreted}} as a deal to plot against them. As a result, Ziggler was put in a match against Kane, which Ziggler won. Ziggler then joined Team Cena at Survivor Series. On the November 10 episode of Raw, Ziggler was brutally attacked by the returning Luke Harper. The following week, Harper was awarded a title match against Ziggler, which Harper won with assistance from The Authority, ending Ziggler's reign at 56 days.|$|E
5|$|With Carltron's defeat, {{the monsters}} plaguing Evermore disappear, {{but the world}} itself grows unstable. The boy returns {{to each of the}} worlds to collect Ruffleberg's companions, taking them back to the real world. In doing so, Evermore's {{destruction}} is averted and it continues to exist without them. After the credits roll, a final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task of cleaning the lab. Carltron grins and rubs his <b>hands</b> <b>together,</b> implying that he is not as docile as the professor believes.|$|E
5|$|He {{is known}} to have absorbed the {{abilities}} of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his <b>hands</b> <b>together.</b> His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|E

5|$|The {{boys and}} the backpackers visit a water park, where Jay intends to find his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The park staff tell Jay that Jane has found a new job in the vast Outback, which leaves Jay feeling very dejected. Lucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane {{is working on a}} stud farm in the remote {{settlement}} of Birdsville, and the boys intend to drive there. Their car runs out of petrol {{in the middle of the}} desert. The group hold <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> as they realise that they will most likely die, but are rescued by Jane and her co-workers. She realises how far Jay came to win her over again, and although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house, the boys find that their parents have travelled to find them after hearing of their near-death experience. The boys are shocked to find Mr Gilbert (their old head of sixth form and Will's nemesis) there too, and Will's mother announces that she and Gilbert are in a relationship, to the abject horror of Will and amusement of the other three friends. Over Skype, Lucy breaks-up with Simon because she is now in a relationship with his university 'best friend' Pete, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging-up on her.|$|E

25|$|The Lady Chapel also {{contains}} some notable memorials, including the marble tomb of John Sayer, inscribed {{with the date}} 1682. Next to the old chancel (now the wooden steps into the vestry) lies a stone tomb which {{is thought to be}} that of Henry of Berkhamsted and his wife; the tomb has lost its inscription and the identity of the persons interred within has been in dispute for many years. The tomb has two stone supine effigies on top with <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> in prayer, Henry wearing medieval armour. Henry was Constable to the Black Prince at Berkhamsted Castle in the mid-14th Century.|$|E
25|$|First {{one should}} rinse hands with warm water, keeping hands below wrists and forearms, to prevent {{contaminated}} water from {{moving from the}} hands to the wrists and arms. The warm water helps to open pores, which helps with the removal of microorganisms, without removing skin oils. One should use five milliliters of liquid soap, to completely cover the hands, and rub wet, soapy <b>hands</b> <b>together,</b> outside the running water, for at least 20 seconds. The most commonly missed areas are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under fingernails. Artificial nails and chipped nail polish harbor microorganisms.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately for her, black-haired Lavigne and {{her friends}} happen to be present at the venue as well. As soon as she {{and her friends}} see them, black-haired Lavigne hits her {{in the head with a}} golf ball, {{resulting}} in the red-haired girl splashing down into the water. Her boyfriend tries to grab her hand but misses, to black-haired Lavigne's amusement. Finally, the man, who eventually develops feelings for black-haired Lavigne, is seen waiting for her. As she comes toward him, they soon hold <b>hands</b> <b>together,</b> but red-haired girl sees this and attempts to seize black-haired Lavigne. But black-haired Lavigne and the man manage to dodge her, and in her attempt to win back her boyfriend, she tumbles all the way down and lands in a portable toilet ahead, where she gives a look of desperation towards the camera, showing she has failed to do so, and signalling that black-haired Lavigne has finally won the man's affections. Blonde Lavigne then takes her new boyfriend into a bathroom stall and slightly opens the door after a moment and pumps her arm in victory.|$|E
25|$|Prayer {{appears to}} have health implications. Empirical studies suggest that mindfully reading and reciting the Psalms (from scripture) can help a person calm down and focus. Prayer is also {{positively}} correlated with happiness and religious satisfaction (Poloma & Pendleton, 1989, 1991). A study conducted by Franceis, Robbins, Lewis, and Barnes (2008) investigated the relationship between self-reported prayer frequency and measures of psychoticism and neuroticism according to the abbreviated form of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-A). The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland. The data shows a negative correlation between prayer frequency and psychoticism. The data also shows that, in Catholic students, frequent prayer has a positive correlation to neuroticism scores. Ladd and McIntosh (2008) suggest that prayer-related behaviors, such as bowing the head and clasping the <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> in an almost fetal position, are suggestive of “social touch” actions. Prayer in this manner may prepare an individual to carry out positive pro-social behavior after praying, due to factors such as increased {{blood flow to the}} head and nasal breathing. Overall, slight health benefits have been found fairly consistently across studies.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{purposes}} of bondage in BDSM is to restrain a person (typically called the bottom) in a BDSM position. This may involve simply tying the <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> in front or behind. Other positions involve the use of a waist belt to anchor the hands to the front, back or sides. Other popular positions are the spread eagle, with the limbs splayed out and fastened by wrists and ankles to bedposts, door frame or some other anchoring point; the hogtie, which secures each wrist to its corresponding ankle behind the back (wider, padded restraints such as bondage cuffs are recommended for this); the balltie, which secures wrists to ankles, in front, with the knees drawn up to the chest; the crotch rope, which involves pulling a rope between the labia to apply pressure to the female genitals. Sometimes a knot is placed in the rope at the position of the clitoris to intensify the sensation. A crotch rope can also be used on males, either placing pressure directly on the scrotum or including a tie to capture the scrotum. Other positions include the reverse prayer position (not recommended unless the subject has flexible shoulders), and an over-arm tie, in which the arms are brought over the head, and the wrists fastened together behind the head and then by a length of rope, chain or strapping to a belt at the waist.|$|E

Partly it was also the way he alternated between employing his <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> and in opposition to each other, and allied to this was his unusual time feeling." ...|$|E

500|$|After the Hiroshima bomb detonated successfully, Oppenheimer {{addressed}} {{an assembly}} at Los Alamos [...] "clasping his <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> like a prize-winning boxer". The bombing amazed Otto Hahn and other German atomic scientists the British held at Farm Hall in Operation Epsilon. Hahn {{stated that he}} had not believed an atomic weapon [...] "would be possible for another twenty years"; Werner Heisenberg did not believe the news at first. Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker said [...] "I think it's dreadful of the Americans to have done it. I think it is madness on their part", but Heisenberg replied, [...] "One could equally well say 'That's the quickest way of ending the war'". Hahn was grateful that the German project had not succeeded in developing [...] "such an inhumane weapon"; Karl Wirtz observed that even if it had, [...] "we would have obliterated London but would still not have conquered the world, and then they would have dropped them on us".|$|E

500|$|After {{about three}} months spent in the Tower, on Saturday 3 May 1606 Garnet was {{strapped}} to a wooden hurdle and taken by three horses to the churchyard of St Paul's. He wore a black cloak over his clothes and hat, and {{spent much of the}} journey with his <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> and eyes closed. Present in the churchyard were the Sheriff of London, Sir Henry Montague, George Abbot and John Overal. When asked if he had knowledge of any further treasons, Garnet replied that he had nothing to say. He rejected any entreatments to abandon his faith for Protestantism, and said that he had committed no offence against the king. [...] The only thing he thought he might be condemned for was for abiding by the terms of the confessional, and if by that action he had offended the king or state, he asked for forgiveness. The recorder announced that this was an admission of guilt, but Garnet reiterated his not guilty plea and continued to argue the point.|$|E
500|$|Physicist Isidor Rabi noticed Oppenheimer's disconcerting triumphalism: [...] "I'll {{never forget}} his walk; I'll {{never forget the}} way {{he stepped out of}} the car... his walk was like High Noon... this kind of strut. He had done it." [...] At an {{assembly}} at Los Alamos on August 6 (the evening of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima), Oppenheimer took to the stage and clasped his <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> [...] "like a prize-winning boxer" [...] while the crowd cheered. He noted his regret the weapon had not been available in time to use against Nazi Germany. However, he and many of the project staff were very upset about the bombing of Nagasaki, as they did not feel the second bomb was necessary from a military point of view. He traveled to Washington on August 17 to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned. In October 1945 Oppenheimer was granted an interview with President Harry S Truman. The meeting, however, went badly, after Oppenheimer remarked he felt he had [...] "blood on my hands". The remark infuriated Truman {{and put an end to}} the meeting. Truman later told his Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson [...] "I don't want to see that son-of-a-bitch in this office ever again." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their <b>hands</b> <b>together.</b> Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E
