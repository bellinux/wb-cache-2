40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{differences}} in local financial development within an <b>integrated</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market.</b> To do so, we construct a new indicator of financial development by estimating a regional effect on the probability that, ceteris paribus, a household is shut off from the credit market. By using this indicator we find that financial development enhances the probability an individual starts his own business, favors entry, increases competition, and promotes growth of firms. As predicted by theory, these effects are weaker for larger firms, which can more easily raise funds outside of the local area. Overall, the results suggest local financial development is an important determinant of the economic success of an area even in an environment where there are no frictions to capital movements. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, as {{the efforts}} {{linked to the}} {{elimination}} of the capital movements control between countries have intensified, the preoccupations concerning the explanation of the financial integration concept have multiplied, in their turn. An <b>integrated</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> is necessary particularly to the distribution of liquidity between the institutions in the euro zone, and, implicitly, for the enforcement of a common monetary policy. Thus, the problem of the integration of the financial market, respectively of the monetary one, appears as a premise for a homogenous transmission of the financial policy impulses all throughout the euro zone. The financial integration is defined in conformity with the law of a single price. According to this definition, in case the markets are integrated, the financial assets bearing identical characteristics should have the same price, regardless of their geographic origin. : financial market, financial stability, euro zone, single currency...|$|E

Much less attention is paid to the activities of banking intermediaries which fund these operations. The expansion and strengthening of cooperation in the region is accompanied by a growing demand for banking services. In the 1990 s, cross-border banking operations were practically the only international system available. In the past few years, financial organisations have set up networks in EurAsEC member countries to service their regular clients, whose economic interests extend beyond national economic boundaries.

With a focus on Europe, it looks at how these banks ‟ foreign affiliates have been faring during the recent financial crisis. It finds that retail and corporate lending of these foreign affiliates have been stable and even increasing between 2007 and 2009. This pattern {{is related to the}} functioning of the internal capital market through which these banks funnel funds across their units. The internal capital market has been an effective tool to support foreign affiliates in distress and to isolate their lending from the local availability of financial resources, notwithstanding the systemic nature of the recent crisis.

Globalization, technological advancements and financial market integration have aggravated the challenges to emerging economies to grow at an extraordinary pace for promoting domestic savings, foreign capital inflows and economic growth. The study is based exclusively on secondary data obtained from various websites of Asian stock markets including yahoo finance and Bloomberg database. To explore these relationships we have used the daily stock indices from August, 2002 to August, 2011 by applying bivariate and multivariate co-integration tests and the Granger causality tests. The result shows both long-run and short-run association among the selected markets. The investors can reap benefit during short-run rather than in the long-run. It indicates that there are ample opportunities for the investors to broaden the horizons of their investments not only in Indian equity markets and also to the selected South Asian markets to reap the benefits of such diversification with risk reduction...|$|E
40|$|The European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is a {{historic}} construction. It is a monetary union among sovereign states that have surrendered their monetary policy and entered a fixed exchange rate regime, while maintaining an autonomous fiscal policy. Internal and external macroeconomic imbalances have developed between the member states since {{the creation of the}} monetary union, but the effect of this development became more visible after the financial crisis, as it led to some European states requiring emergency assistance from the IMF and the EU. This thesis studies whether the development of imbalances in three southern European countries, namely Greece, Italy and Spain, were: (a) the result of purely domestic sources; (b) the result of domestic difficulties amplified by EMU membership; or (c) the result of these countries joining the EMU, regardless of their domestic state of affairs prior to membership. The purpose is to understand what caused the imbalances to develop, as this has implications for the long run survival of the EMU, as well as how to construct potential new monetary unions between sovereign states. The method used is a country-specific case study of Greece, Italy and Spain, highlighting the differences and similarities of macroeconomic and microeconomic variables as well as policies between the countries from 1992 until 2011. To reveal when the imbalances started to develop the sample years have been divided into three periods: a pre-EMU, a core-EMU and a crisis-response period. The results are discussed for each country to discover the sources of the internal and external imbalances, and to evaluated whether the already suggest policy measures will remedy and hinder reoccurrence of the current problems in the EMU. The outcome of the case study is that the EMU membership amplified existing domestic imbalances in Greece, Italy and Spain. This amplification happened due to the more <b>integrated</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> that led to the disappearance of the long-term interest rate spreads, resulting in easier access to credit for the government. Italy and Greece took advantage of this, while in Spain, the more <b>integrated</b> <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> caused the private sector to take on excessive debt. Greece, Italy and Spain experienced higher cost growth relative to the other EMU member countries, causing above average inflation and an appreciation of the real exchange rate. The countries lost competitive power relative to the other EMU member states and emerging markets. Identified sources of external imbalances were declining private and public saving rates combined with increased investment that created balance of trade deficits. Italy and Greece exemplify that a monetary union between sovereign states is doomed to fail when the regulatory framework lacks strong sanction possibilities. This is due to moral hazard on both the lending side, represented by the financial institutions, and on the borrowing side, represented by the governments. The presented evidence suggests that stricter financial regulation and firmer sanctions in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) are needed if the EMU is to survive in the long run, as the control mechanisms of the countries’ fiscal policy were too weak, relative to the large negative spillover effects from reckless borrowing. The policy implications that inform this, is that the EMU do not need to form a federal state or a fiscal union to survive in the long run, if the new macroeconomic surveillance regime as well as the SGP is obeyed to by all member states, in addition to implementation of an EMU-wide financial regulation framework. The main findings of this study can be generalized to other potential monetary unions in the making without a fiscal union, keeping in mind the limited nature of examining only three of the current 17 EMU member states...|$|E
