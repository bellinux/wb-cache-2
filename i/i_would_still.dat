McLaren driver Fernando Alonso {{was given a}} five-second penalty for exceeding track limits, promoting Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen to tenth. When asked about the collision with Bottas {{at the press conference}} for the following United States Grand Prix, Kimi Räikkönen remained unregenerate, saying: [...] " [...] hasn't changed.

[...] Bottas took a different viewpoint, saying: [...] "I don't think it was a racing incident. I didn't see anyone there and I was in front, and then suddenly someone hits me.

500|$|In {{the third}} round of the League Cup, Arsenal faced Derby County at Pride Park. Wenger made several first team changes to give his younger players playing time; Arsenal ran out 2–1 winners, a {{performance}} where [...] "every touch by a Derby player was greeted with ironic cheers." [...] However, the team were beaten comprehensively in the next round to Chelsea at Highbury, losing 0–5. The result inflicted Arsenal's biggest defeat in over eight years and Wenger defended his team selection, virtually a 'second team': [...] "I knew before the game that this kind of thing might happen. You only had to look at the team sheets. If we had won <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> have gone on playing the same side because the players need the experience." [...] Bergkamp, who was rested for the match, echoed his manager's comments: [...] "We had a lot of young players on the field against Chelsea and, although they were feeling very down after losing like that, they will learn from it. To be honest, the scoreline doesn't mean anything, whether it was 1–0 or 5–0. The supporters will feel bad but I hope they understand Saturday will be a different game [...]" ...|$|E

He became the third youngest Senate Majority Leader in US history. In his 2005 book, Herding Cats, A Lifetime in Politics, Lott accuses Frist of being [...] "one of the main manipulators" [...] in the debate that ended Lott's leadership in the Republican Senate. Lott wrote that Frist's actions amounted to a [...] "personal betrayal". Frist [...] "... didn't even have the courtesy to call and tell me personally {{that he was going}} to run ...

2500|$|It was in Corinth that {{a meeting}} between Alexander the Great and Diogenes is {{supposed}} to have taken place. These stories may be apocryphal. The accounts of Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius recount that they exchanged only a few words: while Diogenes was relaxing in the morning sunlight, Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favour he might do for him. Diogenes replied, [...] "Yes, stand out of my sunlight." [...] Alexander then declared, [...] "If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes." [...] "If I were not Diogenes, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> wish to be Diogenes.", Diogenes replied. In another account of the conversation, Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, [...] "I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{an early}} age, Alice was {{interested}} in politics. When advancing age and illness incapacitated her Aunt Bamie, Alice stepped into her place as an unofficial political adviser to her father. She warned her father against challenging the renomination of William Howard Taft in 1912. Alice took a hard-line view of the Democrats and in her youth sympathized with the conservative wing of the Republican Party. She supported her half-brother Ted {{when he ran for}} governor of New York in 1924. When Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for president in [...] 1932, Alice publicly opposed his candidacy. Writing in the Ladies' Home Journal in October 1932, she said of FDR, [...] "Politically, his branch of the family and ours have always been in different camps, and the same surname is about all we have in common..... I am a Republican..... I am going to vote for Hoover..... If I were not a Republican, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> vote for Mr. Hoover this time." ...|$|E

[...] "People always think of technology as something having silicon in it. But a pencil is technology. Any language is technology. Technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when one talks about appropriate technology in developing countries, appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity." [...] NASA training manager and author Homer Hickam later expressed some regret that she had departed, saying, [...] "NASA had {{spent a lot of}} money training her; she also filled a niche, obviously, being a woman of color." [...] Hickam had trained Jemison for her flight on Spacelab-J/STS-47. In an interview with the Des Moines Register on October 16, 2008, Jemison said that she was not driven to be the [...] "first black woman to go into space."

2500|$|Ribbentrop was a {{defendant}} at the Nuremberg Trials. The Allies' International Military Tribunal convicted him on four counts: crimes against peace, deliberately planning {{a war of}} aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. According to the judgment, Ribbentrop was actively involved in planning the invasions of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. He was also {{deeply involved in the}} [...] "final solution"; as early as 1942 he had ordered German diplomats in Axis countries to hasten the process of sending Jews to death camps in the east. He supported the lynching of Allied airmen shot down over Germany, and helped to cover up the 1945 murder of Major-General Gustave Mesny, a French officer being held as a prisoner of war. He was held directly responsible for atrocities that took place in Denmark and Vichy France, since the top officials in those two occupied countries reported to him. Ribbentrop claimed that Hitler made all of the important decisions, and that he had been deceived by Hitler's repeated claims that he only wanted peace. The Tribunal rejected this argument, saying that given how closely involved Ribbentrop was with the execution of the war, [...] "he could not have remained unaware of the aggressive nature of Hitler's actions." [...] Even in prison, Ribbentrop remained loyal to Hitler: [...] "Even with all I know, if in this cell Hitler should come to me and say 'Do this!', <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> do it." ...|$|E

That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of Chamberlain's anti-Catholicism, Catholic {{newspapers}} all published very hostile {{reviews of}} The Foundations, though Catholic reviewers rarely faulted Die Grundlagen [...] for its anti-Semitism. Protestant völkisch newspapers [...] gave The Foundations very good reviews while more orthodox Protestant newspapers were disturbed by Chamberlain's {{call for a}} racialized Christianity. One Protestant reviewer, Professor Baentsch of Jena wrote that Chamberlain had systematically distorted the Book of Job, the Psalms, the Prophets, and other books of the Old Testament, leading him to conclude {{that it was no}} surprise that Chamberlain found so little common ground between Christianity and Judaism given the way he had misrepresented the entire Old Testament. One German Jewish reviewer, the Berlin banker Heinrich Meyer-Cohn wrote that The Foundations was [...] "bad, unclear, and illogical in its train of thought and unpleasing in style, full of false modesty and genuine superciliousness, full of real ignorance and false affectation of learning." [...] German Jewish groups like the Centralverein deutscher Staatsburge jüdischen Glaubens and the Verein zur Abwehr Antisemitismus repeatedly issued statements in the early 20th century that the popularity of The Foundations was a major source of concern for them, noting that Die Grundlagen [...] had caused a major increase in anti-Semitism with many German Jews now finding themselves the objects of harassment and sometimes violence. The German Jewish journalist Moritz Goldstein wrote in 1912 that he had become a Zionist because he believed there was no future for Jews in Germany, {{and one of the reasons}} for that belief was: [...] "Chamberlain believes what he says and for that very reason his distortions shock me. And thousands more believe as he does for the book goes one edition after another and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> like to know if many Germanic types, whose self-image is pleasantly indulged by this theory, are able to remain critical enough to question its countless injustices and errors?". Goldstein added that the case of Chamberlain showed his views as typical of those of [...] "the best spirits, clever, truth-loving men who, however, as soon they speak of Jews, fall into a blind, almost rabid hatred".|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
