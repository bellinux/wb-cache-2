2500|$|Grades 5 and 6 form an {{orientation}} phase (Orientierungsstufe) during which students, {{their parents and}} teachers decide which of the above-mentioned paths the students should follow. In all states except Berlin and Brandenburg, this orientation phase is embedded into the program of the secondary schools. The decision for a secondary school influences the student's future, but during this phase changes can be made more easily. In practice this rarely comes to bear because teachers are afraid of sending pupils to more academic schools whereas parents are afraid of sending their children to less academic schools. In Berlin and Brandenburg, the orientation is embedded into that of the elementary schools. [...] Teachers give a so-called <b>educational</b> (<b>path)</b> recommendation (Bildungs(gang)empfehlung) based on scholastic achievements in the main subjects (mathematics, German, natural sciences, foreign language) and classroom behavior with details and legal implications differing from state to state: in some German states, those wishing {{to apply for a}} Gymnasium or Realschule require such a recommendation stating that the student is likely to make a successful transition to that type of school; in other cases anybody may apply.|$|E

40|$|Early {{childhood}} (EC) administrators {{could be}} the most important contributors to quality experiences in EC settings; they are also responsible for the caliber of experiences for children and staff. A quality EC program is licensed and accredited with administrators who have professional preparation and work experience and can lead and manage EC programs. There are the few direct <b>educational</b> <b>paths</b> to become an EC administrator. This lack of standardization influences the quality of leadership and organizational climate in EC settings. The purpose of this qualitative study as reflected in the research questions was to explore the experiences of EC administrators regarding their <b>educational</b> <b>paths,</b> their views of themselves as transformational leaders, and the influence of their leadership on their organizational climate. Prior research on the subject of leadership practices in EC suggests that Burns 2 ̆ 7 transformational leadership is most beneficial, but this leadership style has not been explored in detail in EC settings. This phenomenological study included interviews of six EC administrators about their <b>educational</b> <b>paths,</b> their views as transformational leaders, and how their leadership influenced the organizational climate in their setting. Data were analyzed for themes that emerged. Findings suggested the need for streamlined undergraduate and graduate coursework. Implications for positive social change are the potential for improved quality of programs and for the support needed for early childhood leadership...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{individuals who}} become either entrepreneurs or employees follow systematically different <b>educational</b> <b>paths</b> {{to a given}} educational level. Following Lazear 2 ̆ 7 s jack-of-all-trades theory, we expect that entrepreneurs aim at a balanced set of different skills - that is, they combine academic and vocational skills - while employees specialize in one skill. This means that entrepreneurs follow <b>educational</b> <b>paths</b> that combine different types of education, while employees follow same-type paths while climbing up the educational ladder. We use the Swiss Labor Force Survey to test our hypothesis. Our empirical findings {{are in line with}} Lazear 2 ̆ 7 s theory and indicate that individuals who change between different types of education and acquire a more balanced set of skills are more likely to become entrepreneurs. Thus, the permeability of a country-specific educational system is one crucial determinant of entrepreneurship. (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|R
