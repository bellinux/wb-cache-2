40|$|Large grazing herbivores {{can change}} fire regimes by {{altering}} fuel types and abundance, particularly in savanna biomes where the dominant fuel is grass. The use of herbivores as a fire management tool is receiving increasing consideration globally, but this intervention has a limited evidence-base and is controversial because of potential deleterious ecological effects. These issues are well {{illustrated by the}} political and scientific debate about the capacity of cattle <b>grazing</b> to reduce <b>fire</b> hazard in the Victorian Alps of Australia; there have been remarkably few scientific studies to illuminate this issue. Here we use remote sensing and geographic information system analysis {{to determine the effect}} of active <b>grazing</b> licences on <b>fire</b> severity (crown scorch) in eucalypt forests and woodlands following large fires in the Alps during the summers of 2002 / 2003 and 2006 / 2007.

40|$|A {{mosaic of}} Campos {{grassland}} and Araucaria forest characterizes the vegetation of the Southern Brazilian highland plateau. Palaeoecological {{evidence indicates that}} forest expansion over grassland initiated after the mid Holocene, when climate changed towards present day cool and moist conditions. In this paper, we discuss landscape level changes that occurred on vegetation patterns after <b>grazing</b> and <b>fire</b> exclusion in a mosaic of Campos and Araucaria forest in Southern Brazil. The analysis of aerial photographs from 1974 and 1999 showed alterations on grassland communities under <b>grazing</b> and <b>fire</b> exclusion, especially pronounced shrub establishment {{near the edge of}} the forest. Considering the change in the cover of vegetation classes relative to the total altered cover in all classes from 1974 to 1999, the most prominent alterations were: 48 % from grassland with tussock grasses dominance (GRA) to grassland with shrubs (GSR), 24 % from GRA to grassland with tall shrubs (GTS), 16 % from GSR to GTS and 9 % from GTS to forest (FOR). Considering the alteration relatively to the vegetation cover in 1974, the most relevant changes were: 44 % from GSR to GTS and 94 % from GTS to FOR. These observations support a directional forest expansion over grassland under <b>grazing</b> and <b>fire</b> exclusion...|$|R

40|$|Studies in {{tropical}} regions {{have shown that}} trees and grasses respond differently to <b>fire,</b> <b>grazing</b> and browsing. In African savannas, the responses to <b>fire,</b> <b>grazing</b> and browsing are different, determined by negative or positive correlations. Browsing may have other consequences than grazing because instead of increasing woody biomass it reduces it, causing increase in grass growth, leading to increase in fuel that results in more intense fires and decrease in woody biomass. Fire and herbivory are an important interactive disturbance factors affecting vegetation succession and the tree-grass dynamics in savanna environment. Several of the fire-herbivory interactions are landscape level effects, which is shown in 2 models. My hypothesis is that the tree-grass balances are determined by interactions of both <b>grazing</b> and <b>fire.</b> There have come new scientific data about fire and herbivory and the interaction effects on tree-grass dynamic and succession in the savanna. By analyzing my hypothesis through a comparison between hypotheses, Intermediate disturbance hypothesis, Janzen-Connell hypothesis and the Huston hypothesis, I propose several scenarios of the savanna tree-grass dynamics in East Africa, {{as a result of}} this comparison...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 31 st January 2018. Desert {{surfaces}} are typically stable and represent {{some of the}} longest-lived landforms on Earth. For surfaces devoid of vegetation, {{the evolution of a}} desert pavement of gravel and small stones protects the surface from erosion by wind and water and vegetation further protects the surface in arid and semi-arid rangelands. The susceptibility of the land surface to wind erosion is enhanced by mechanical damage to the desert pavement or vegetation losses resulting from <b>fire</b> or <b>grazing.</b> Despite the relatively rich literature on the effects of <b>grazing</b> and <b>fire</b> on plant community composition, land degradation, and the productivity of arid landscapes, {{little is known about the}} effects of moderate <b>grazing</b> or <b>fire</b> on the erodibility of soils in desert grasslands and shrublands. Here we investigate the effects of simulated moderate grazing, simulated livestock trampling, and of fire on the resulting wind erodibility and dust emissions of the affected soil surfaces. We surveyed 24 plots of the same size, 6 m × 0. 6 m, at a research site in the northern Chihuahuan Desert including 6 plots in a shrub-grass ecotone, 12 plots in an adjacent grassland, and 6 plots in an area that had been burned by a natural wildfire 6 months earlier but had no vegetation recovery due to the time of year and drought. To evaluate the various effects of disturbances on the susceptibility of the surface to wind erosion and dust entrainment, replicates of three plots underwent different treatments including clipping, trampling, fire, and tillage. We subsequently tested each of the treated plots with a portable field wind tunnel run at 12. 6 m s− 1. We found that moderate <b>grazing</b> and <b>fire</b> did not result in great soil loss in desert grasslands but that shrublands were more seriously affected by <b>grazing</b> and <b>fire.</b> Total removal of vegetation and disturbance of the soil surface did result in greater than order of magnitude increases of vertical sediment flux and greater than three-fold increases of dust emissions...|$|R
