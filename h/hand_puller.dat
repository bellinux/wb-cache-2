40|$|The {{implement}} {{was designed}} and developed in a workshop held at the Agricultural Engineering Department, College of Agricultural Studies, Sudan University of Science and Technology between April 2011 and June 2012. The implement was constructed {{from a series of}} disc blades mounted on a frame. The two discs arranged together with specific space and angles to adapt with cotton stalks pulling operation. The implement mounted on the tractor by three hitches linkage. The field performance test was done for the implementation in Gezira Scheme by measuring the tilt and rake angles parameters, operation speed, pulling operation cost for both systems; manual and mechanical and total cost to product the implement. The experimental design was split plot in a complete randomized block adopted with three replications. The results revealed that the best performance efficiency of the implement (94 %) was found at both 30, 20 degrees of tilt angle and rake angle respectively. The suitable operating speed was found to be 2. 8 km/h. When estimated, the total cost to achieve the cotton stalks removal per using two systems <b>hand</b> <b>puller</b> and designed implement found that 200, 50 SDG required per feddans respectively. The current implement design can be manufactured in both industrial and semi-industrial factories and even small workshops due to design simplicity. Finally {{it was found that the}} total manufacturing cost of the implement was 3000 SDG (500 $) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{invasive}} spotted knapweed has infested the Bass River Recreation Area in Ottawa County, Michigan. We {{tested the}} effects of herbicides and <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> on knapweed densities, as well as native plant establishment in the area. We <b>hand</b> <b>pulled</b> mature knapweed from 24 {{out of a total}} of 48 5 -m by 5 -m plots. The removed and residual knapweed biomass was quantified as well as the presence of native forbs and grasses on all plots. In 2010, <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> had started to reduce mature knapweed densities on mowed-only plots, while densities actually had increased on herbicide-treated hand-pulled plots as new seedlings began to mature. Juvenile knapweed densities generally decreased on all plots except non-pulled mowed-only plots. Native forbs and grasses have become established on most plots but are still several years away from becoming a dominant and diverse community. Initial results suggest that <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> will provide effective knapweed control when applied consistently through time...|$|R

50|$|The Derby Brewing Company {{joined forces}} with Everardsin 2011 in a £400,000 project to restore the Queen's Head. The deal saw the two breweries share the cost of buying and {{revamping}} the grade II-listed alehouse which dates back to 1835. The pub features 10 <b>hand</b> <b>pulls</b> featuring Derby Brewing Company beers, hand selected guest ales and a <b>hand</b> <b>pull</b> cider plus beers, wines and spirits from around the world. As part of the restoration, the pub returned to its original layout, with a central entrance leading directly into anewly-positioned bar area. The pub re-opened on 17 November 2011.|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{areas in}} the upper Midwest have been invaded by spotted knapweed, and {{effective}} management strategies are required to reestablish native plant communities. We examined effects of mowing, mowing plus clopyralid, or mowing plus glyphosate in factorial combination with <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> and burning on knapweed abundances on a knapweed-infested site in western Michigan. We applied mowing and herbicide treatments in summer 2008, and seeded all plots with native grasses and forbs in spring 2009. We conducted the knapweed pulling treatment from 2009 to 2012 in July. The prescribed burn was conducted in April 2012. By 2012, <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> reduced adult knapweed densities to 0. 57 [*]±[*] 0. 12 m− 2 (0. 053 [*]±[*] 0. 011 ft− 2) (mean[*]±[*]SE), which was 5. 8 % of nonpulled treatments, juvenile densities to 0. 29 [*]±[*] 0. 07 m− 2 (2. 1 % of nonpulled treatments), and seedling densities to 0. 07 [*]±[*] 0. 06 m− 2 (2. 6 % of nonpulled treatments). After 3 yr, <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> reduced seed bank densities to 68 [*]±[*] 26 m− 2 as compared to 524 [*]±[*] 254 m− 2 in nonpulled treatments and 369 [*]±[*] 66 m− 2 in adjacent untreated areas of the study site. Without <b>hand</b> <b>pulling,</b> effects of mowing or mowing plus glyphosate were short-lived and allowed knapweed to rapidly resurge. In comparison, although a single mowing plus clopyralid treatment maintained significantly reduced densities of knapweed for 4 yr, by 2012 knapweed biomass in the nonpulled clopyralid treatment was approximately 60 % {{of that in the}} other nonpulled treatments. Burning had minimal impacts on knapweed densities regardless of treatment combination, probably as a result of low fire intensity. Results demonstrated that persistent <b>hand</b> <b>pulling</b> used as a follow-up to single mowing or mowing plus herbicide treatments can be an effective practice for treating isolated spotted knapweed infestations or for removing small numbers of knapweed that survive herbicide applications...|$|R

50|$|Pigmentograph is a {{printing}} technology {{developed by the}} artist as a trace-print technique in the 1970s, and designated as Pigmentograph in 1980. The image is drawn or painted on a carrier template or film. Subsequently, the printing forms, the color separations of the motive, are cut and stung in the positive negative procedure. During the printing-process color is brushed by hand through the printing forms and fixed afterwards.
