5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong and <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{demonstrated}} that the emotional significance of a spatial cue <b>enhances</b> <b>the</b> effect of covert attention on spatial and temporal resolution (i. e., our ability to discriminate small spatial details and fast temporal flicker).

Furthermore, we observed that the overall magnitudes of individuals' attentional effects correlated strongly with {{the magnitude of the}} emotion × attention interaction effect.

Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
