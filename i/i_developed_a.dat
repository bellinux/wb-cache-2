I was forced to reconsider everything I'd once believed. <b>I</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> profound distrust of government regardless of the philosophy of the people in power. I remained a liberal on civil-rights issues, became a conservative on defense, and a semi-libertarian on all other matters." ...|$|E

Spiders I had met long before Burroughs began to write, and I do not think he is in any way responsible for Shelob. At any rate I retain no memory of the Siths or the Apts." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{philosophical}} logic, {{a certain}} family of model constructions has received particular attention. Prominent examples are the cumulative hierarchy of well-founded sets, and Kripke’s {{least fixed point}} models of grounded truth. <b>I</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> general formal theory of groundedness and explain how the well-founded sets, Cantor’s extended numbersequence and Kripke’s concepts of semantic groundedness are all instances of the general concept, and how the general framework illuminates these cases. Then, <b>I</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> new approach to a grounded theory of proper classes. However, the general concept of groundedness {{does not account for}} the philosophical significance of its paradigm instances. Instead, I argue, the philosophical content of the cumulative hierarchy of sets is best understood in terms of a primitive notion of ontological priority. Then, <b>I</b> <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> analogous account of Kripke’s models. I show that they exemplify the in-virtue-of relation much discussed in contemporary metaphysics, and thus are philosophically significant. I defend my proposal against a challenge from Kripke’s “ghost of the hierarchy”. ...|$|R
40|$|Do {{political}} and legislative ties matter {{as much as}} conventional partisan or institutional factors for parties, candidates, and legislative voting? Scholars frequently think of parties as more or less discrete, stable political entities which form and compete in elections. Similarly, {{when they talk about}} influence between legislators, they tend to talk about institutional sources of influence - such as leadership influence, constituent influence, or party influence; but scholars often ignore social sources of influence - influence due to actors 2 ̆ 7 embeddedness in social networks. In this dissertation, <b>I</b> <b>develop</b> theories of legislative network formation and legislative influence; and leverage network-analytic techniques to empirically test them. I address the causes and consequences of legislative networks for parties and legislative processes in four ways. First, <b>I</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> theory of legislative network formation and use network survey data to test it. Second, <b>I</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> theory of legislative influence and utilize mixed effects logistic regression tests to assess its validity with network survey and legislative voting data. Third, <b>I</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> theory of party recruitment, and use records of party-switches over 20 years to test it. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> theory of the long-term effects of political networks on political party success, and apply duration modeling and regression techniques to assess it. Overall, I find that {{political and}} legislative networks have sizable effects on legislative coordination and party success, and that the root causes of political network formation lie in heretofore unmeasured sociopolitical processes...|$|R
2500|$|After Kavadh I, his son Khosrau I, {{also known}} as Anushirvan ("with the immortal soul"; ruled 531–579), ascended to the throne. He is the most celebrated of the Sassanid rulers. Khosrau I is most famous for his reforms in the aging {{governing}} body of Sassanids. He introduced a rational system of taxation based upon a survey of landed possessions, which his father had begun, and he tried in every way to increase the welfare and the revenues of his empire. Previous great feudal lords fielded their own military equipment, followers, and retainers. Khosrau <b>I</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> new force of dehqans, or [...] "knights", paid and equipped by the central government and the bureaucracy, tying the army and bureaucracy more closely to the central government than to local lords.|$|E

60|$|For {{some years}} after my marriage, I too was for leaving them alone. <b>I</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> dread and dislike for romance, for {{emotional}} music, {{for the human}} figure in art--turning my heart to landscape. I wanted to sneer at lovers and their ecstasies, and was uncomfortable until I found the effective sneer. In matters of private morals these were my most uncharitable years. I didn't {{want to think of}} these things any more for ever. I hated the people whose talk or practice showed they were not of my opinion. I wanted to believe that their views were immoral and objectionable and contemptible, because I had decided to treat them as at that level. I was, in fact, falling into the attitude of the normal decent man.|$|E
6000|$|That {{remained}} {{the state of}} our relations for two days. <b>I</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> growing irritation with and resentment against cousin Sybil, combined with an intense desire to get that kiss for which I hungered and thirsted. Cousin Sybil went about in the happy persuasion that I was madly in love with her, and her game, so far as she was concerned, was played and won. It wasn't until I had fretted for two days that I realised that I was being used for the commonest form of excitement possible to a commonplace girl; that dozens perhaps of young men had played the part of Tantalus at cousin Sybil's lips. I walked about my room at nights, damning her and calling her by terms which on the whole she rather deserved, while Sybil went to sleep pitying [...] "poor old Dick!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} get Marie out of my mind; her image was with me by day and by night, {{especially}} by night, which caused me to sleep badly. I became morose, supersensitive, and excitable. <b>I</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> cough, and thought, as did others, that I was going into a decline. I remember that Hans even asked me once if I would not come and peg out the exact place where I should like to be buried, so that I might be sure {{that there would be}} no mistake made when I could no longer speak for myself. On that occasion I kicked Hans, one of the few upon which I have ever touched a native. The truth was that I had not the slightest intention of being buried. I wanted to live and marry Marie, not to die and be put in a hole by Hans. Only I saw no prospect of marrying Marie, or even of seeing her again, and that was why I felt low-spirited.|$|E

40|$|Energy-economy {{models have}} emerged to provide policy makers with {{information}} {{on the effect of}} their policies. These models are used to forecast the responses of businesses and consumers, and the costs of these responses may be estimated using a cost accounting method. In this paper, I suggest three improvements that can be made to energy-economy models and cost accounting techniques. First, I outline a method of simulating the obsolescence of technologies when they become uncompetitive. Second, <b>I</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> method to simulate the behaviour of businesses and consumers when they have expectations of their future emissions costs. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> method of cost accounting that can estimate the social costs caused by policies, and that can estimate the costs caused by regulations...|$|R

60|$|I was {{off again}} with the Red Cross shortly after, and {{did not return to}} England till August of 1918. I was unwell, and went down to my cottage, now free to me again. The {{influenza}} epidemic was raging, and there <b>I</b> <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> mild attack; when I was convalescent my first visitor was Harburn, who had come down to his bungalow for a summer holiday. He had not been in the room five minutes before he was off on his favourite topic. My nerves must have been on edge from illness, for I cannot express the disgust with which I listened to him on that occasion. He seemed to me just like a dog who mumbles and chews a mouldy old bone with a sort of fury. There was a kind of triumph about him, too, which was unpleasant, though not surprising, for he was more of a 'force' than ever. 'God save me from the fixed idea!' I thought, when he was gone. That evening I asked my old housekeeper if she had seen young Mr. Holsteig lately.|$|E
