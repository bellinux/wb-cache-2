40|$|The {{blistering}} {{phenomenon is}} one of the major damages in <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavement</b> during a hot summer. The phenomenon was believed to be caused by water permeating from outside via channels of connected pores in bituminous mixtures. However, the surface course in <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavement</b> is not permeable to water, particularly near the blistering area. Therefore, permeation of liquid water is unlikely to be responsible for the water accumulation that causes the blistering phenomenon. Moisture vapor in the air is important in water intrusion into bituminous mixtures. This study examined moisture transfer mechanisms in <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements,</b> focusing on the coefficient of permeability of pavement mixtures of both liquid water and humid air (i. e. air containing water vapor). ブリスタリング現象は，夏季の特に暑い時期に生じるアスファルト舗装の主要な損傷の一つである。この現象は，アスファルト混合物中の連続空隙を通して外部から浸入した雨水が原因であるとされてきた。しかしながら，アスファルト舗装の表層，特にブリスタリング等の損傷が生じる箇所周辺は不透水である。つまり，ブリスタリング現象を引き起こす滞留水の要因として，液体状態での水の浸透は考えにくい。著者らは，大気中の湿気が水蒸気として透過し結露することが舗装体内への水分浸入の鍵を握る現象であることを既報で指摘した。本研究では，アスファルト舗装混合物中の水分移動機構の検討として，水および湿潤空気の透過係数に注目することにより，ブリスタリング現象において鍵となる水分浸入の要因を実験検討した研究成果を報告する...|$|R

40|$|Excessive rutting, one of {{the major}} {{distress}} modes of <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements,</b> is mainly caused by the accumulation of load-induced permanent deformation. However, current pavement design approaches against the excessive rutting are mainly developed using the theory of elasticity. Recently, a new pavement design approach based on the shakedown concept has attracted lots of attention because it can consider plastic properties of pavement materials. However, most of the existing shakedown solutions were developed for pavement foundations composed of granular materials and soils. Very limited work has been reported on <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements.</b> Besides, current studies usually assume homogeneous, isotropic pavement materials obeying an associated plastic flow rule (termed as standard materials in the present study), which may not be realistic for pavement materials. In the present research, a step-by-step numerical approach was used to obtain numerical shakedown limits of pavement structures under repeated moving loads. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems were considered. It was found that, under the assumption of standard materials, the obtained numerical shakedown limits and residual stress fields agreed well with the available theoretical data. A static (i. e. lower bound) shakedown approach for pavements with anisotropic, heterogeneous materials was developed based on Melan’s lower bound theorem and the critical residual stress method of Yu and Wang (2012). The influence of material plastic flow rules on pavement shakedown limits was also evaluated both numerically and theoretically. It was found that neglect of the inherent material properties (i. e. anisotropy, heterogeneity and non-associated plastic flow) could overestimate the real shakedown limits of <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements.</b> A series of tests were conducted to validate the shakedown concept for the responses of <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements</b> under traffic loads. Two distinct phenomena corresponding to shakedown and non-shakedown were observed. Triaxial tests and uniaxial compression tests were also undertaken to obtain the stiffness and strength parameters, from which the theoretical shakedown limits can be calculated. Comparison between the experimental results and the theoretical solutions revealed that the current 3 D shakedown approach for standard materials may overestimate capacities of <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements.</b> Finally, the lower bound shakedown approach was employed to design a typical <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavement.</b> A direct comparison was made between the shakedown-based design and the current UK design method. It demonstrated that the shakedown-based design for <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements</b> can be conducted considering the maximum contact pressure and a relatively high air temperature...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} current {{literature}} {{on the effects of}} deicing salt and trace minerals, such as sulfate, on aggregate deterioration was conducted. Such deterioration in both Portland cement concrete, and <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements</b> was reviewed. For Portland cement concrete, it was determined that current research on the effects of moisture and deicing salt on aggregates concrete matrix durability, with little discussion on the effects on aggregates. The effects of trace minerals in deicing salt are also rarely discussed. Pore size distribution, insoluble residue, absorption, and susceptibility to alkali-silica reaction all appear to affect aggregate durability in the presence of moisture of freeze-thaw. Based on available research, it is concluded that salt in solution exacerbates the damaging effects of moisture and freeze-thaw on aggregates. Several researchers currently are evaluating other features of aggregate deterioration by deicing salts. 	Moisture damage effects on aggregates in <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements</b> have been widely studied. Damage potential is strongly related to the susceptibility of stripping of the bituminous covering from the aggregate surface. Research has been conducted on the use of various additives to reduce stripping, some of which consist of proprietary commercial formulations. There is also extensive research on testing procedures, which predict stripping potential of aggregates. However, the added effect of deicing salt has received relatively little attention. Some researchers have speculated that deicing salts may increase the brittleness of asphalt pavements thereby increasing susceptibility to moisture. Determining specific effects of deicing salts on aggregate may prove difficult because of the numerous properties that affect the stripping potential of aggregates for <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavements.</b> Mixture type, placement techniques and traffic, as well as aggregate properties, appear to be related to a <b>bituminous</b> <b>pavement’s</b> susceptibility to moisture damage...|$|R

The aim is to refine the test method for determining the stiffness modulus in a way that partly leads to less variation between stiffness modulus measurements performed by different laboratories, partly to increased knowledge of different apparatuses used in Sweden. This is done by controlling and comparing the load pulse and the resulting deformation pulse when using variable loading.
