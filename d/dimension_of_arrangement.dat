40|$|Over {{the past}} thirty years, forest policy in the Netherlands has almost entirely been {{integrated}} into nature policy. This process of `de-institutionalisation¿ is surprising in view of widely accepted theories of institutional stability and `path dependency¿. The process is investigated in this paper along the four <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the policy <b>arrangement</b> approach: discourse, power, rules and actors. It is argued that a discursive shift, moving the focus from production forest to `forest as part of nature¿ and fuelled {{by a number of}} underlying factors, {{lies at the heart of}} the process. In concordance with this shift, advocates of timber autarky lost power in favour of `nature advocates¿. A more diverse set of actors became involved in forest policy, also reflecting a more general trend in Dutch politics towards greater openness and the erosion of neo-corporatist rules. Thus, changes in all four <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the policy <b>arrangement</b> worked into one direction. This may explain the unusually quick and radical `de-institutionalisation¿ of Dutch forest policy...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Due to {{demographic}} {{change and the}} consequently increasing number of older people with dementia the question <b>of</b> adequate care <b>arrangements</b> and their quality of care becomes more important. The wish for more self-determination in old age regarding living and care is a main reason for the development <b>of</b> shared-housing <b>arrangements.</b> These care arrangements {{are considered to be}} beneficial in terms of residents’ quality of life. However until now it is unclear how quality of life should best be assessed in shared-housing arrangements. Methods: In the present dissertation it was investigated how quality of life of residents <b>of</b> shared-housing <b>arrangements</b> could be evaluated. To address this aim, a literature study was conducted in order to determine which dementia-specific quality of life instruments are optimal in the light of content validity for their application in shared-housing arrangements. Afterwards, in a cross-sectional field period, the performance (acceptance, reliability, validity) of the previously identified instruments was evaluated. Additionally, a predictor of a higher level of agreement between resident and nurses rated quality of life was investigated. Findings: The literature study yielded 19 dementia-specific quality of life instruments, none of which has been developed especially for shared-housing arrangements. In addition, their applicability in this setting has not been evaluated. The comparison of the content of the instruments with the <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> shared-housing <b>arrangements</b> showed that the instruments ADRQL, QoL-AD and QUALIDEM cover most <b>of</b> the <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> shared-housing <b>arrangements.</b> The empirical part of the present study showed that the QUALIDEM instrument had a higher acceptance by nurses than the ADRQL and QoL-AD. Not all <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the quality of life instruments show a sufficient reliability (Cronbach’s alpha). The examination of the validity (construct, convergent, discriminant validity) showed that all instruments provide valid results in shared-housing arrangements. Whenever the primary nurse rates {{the quality of life of}} residents, the level of agreement with the ratings of residents itself will be higher, compared to other nurses. Conclusion: Based on the study results, it is recommended that the quality of life of residents in shared-housing arrangements be evaluated with the QUALIDEM, by the primary nurse. This approach results in a continuous quality of life evaluation, without being limited by the severity of dementia. Only three redundant dimensions will not be evaluated for residents with very severe dementia...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - To re-examine {{the role}} of {{property}} management from an institutional economics perspective. Design/methodology/approach - The role of property management is explored by asking why property management has emerged from the first principle. Then, an analytical framework for property management is put forward. Different <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> institutional <b>arrangements,</b> ranging from open access to communal private property or solely owned private property, {{are discussed in the}} real estate property context. Findings - The paper shows that a unique feature of property management is its role in excluding outsiders and resolving internal conflicts among the stakeholders of communal private property. Research implications/limitations - This approach opens up a new research agenda for property management. The adoption <b>of</b> different institutional <b>arrangements</b> in property management can be explained by further studies. Practical implications - The efficiency <b>of</b> different institutional <b>arrangements</b> for the governance of communal private property is situation-specific. An endogenous assumption of institutional regime property management practice greatly expands the flexibility of management. Originality/value - This paper is the first to apply an analytical framework for interpreting the institutional arrangements in property management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{institutional arrangements}} for the delivery of coastal programs through {{a new way of}} thinking about their evolution and structure. The notion of three distinct "dimensions" describing the phases in the evolution <b>of</b> institutional <b>arrangements</b> is introduced. The notion <b>of</b> <b>dimensions</b> is developed from conceptualizing about how institutional arrangements are diagrammed. This allows the visualization of how individual institutions and key stakeholders relate {{to each other in the}} delivery of coastal programs, how effective these relationships are, and how their relationships could be redesigned. "Dimensional thinking" enables the re-examination of existing institutional design of coastal programs and how these can evolve to meet the challenges of the new millennium. It is concluded that institutional arrangements have grown from a single dimensional view, where institutions (mainly governmental) delivered programs in isolation, through to the present second dimension where agency programs are managed through coordinating bodies and through coastal management plans. It is argued that a third <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> institutional <b>arrangements,</b> one that recognizes and embraces the rapid pace of change in this century, will be needed that is aligned by themes rather than by organizational structure. To illustrate a third dimension a visualization tool is developed drawing from management cybernetics. It recognizes the increasing importance of formal and informal networks in relation to traditional modernist hierarchical management by recognizing multiple stakeholders (government at all levels, industry, advocacy groups, conservation interests, and the broader community) and their degree of mutual dependence. Dimensional thinking has the potential to institutionalize the interaction between these multiple stakeholders to ensure the effective delivery of coastal programs in the new millennium. A single answer to what the third <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> coastal management program evolution should include is not presented. Rather, an approach is presented that allows coastal managers to move forward in the debate on redesigning coastal programs to meet today's complex suite of issues, values, and interests. An experimental case study from Western Australia is used to illustrate the potential application of the dimensional thinking to coastal management institutional design in that State's coastal program...|$|R

Interviews were conducted with 27 women employed in the Victorian higher education sector and retail industry, exploring the temporal <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> paid work-family <b>arrangements</b> and plans from before, during and after parental leave. Participants convey concerns about the logistical, gendered and emotional dynamics of combining work and life, the cost of and access to childcare and the management of domestic work so they may return to paid work. These concerns provide a foundation for debates on the relationship between policy and the lived experience of navigating parental leave, gender relations and work-care arrangements. While the debate has focused largely on the workplace and policy initiatives that provide support enabling a primary carer to integrate their multiple roles and demands, there still requires a high degree of negotiation and creativity in individual and household contexts.

Governance failure is conceptualised through the various <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the policy <b>arrangements</b> approach (1) actors and coalitions, (2) power and influence, (3) policy discourses and (4) rules of the game.

For instance, under the new arrangements, power struggles became more overt, discursive conflicts occurred between the state department and the lower administrative levels as well as between advocates and adversaries, and rules of the game faced similar contestations.

40|$|Abstract The {{state of}} stress in the {{vicinity}} of the crack tip changes from plane strain at the tip to plane stress at a critical distance (about half the specimen thickness) from the tip through an intermediate region where the {{state of stress}} is three-dimensional. In the optical method of caustics, the caustic is the image of a circle on the specimen centered at the crack tip, and, therefore, yields information on the stress state along this circle. In the method conditions of plane stress are assumed along this circle. This condition imposes restrictions on the geometrical <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the optical <b>arrangement,</b> specimen thickness, crack length and applied loads for the correct determination of stress intensity factors. In the present work the limits of applicability of the method of caustics are studied. The use of optically anisotropic materials is introduced to obtain a double caustic which provides the correct state of stress (plane strain, plane stress or three-dimensional) along the initial curve. When the state of stress is known the proper values of stress-optical constants can be used for the correct determination of stress intensity factors...|$|R

We show that the poset of regions ({{with respect to a}} canonical base region) of a supersolvable hyperplane arrangement is a congruence normal lattice. Specifically, the poset of regions <b>of</b> a supersolvable <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> rank k is obtained via a sequence of doublings from the poset of regions <b>of</b> a supersolvable <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> rank k − 1. An explicit description of the doublings leads to a proof that the order <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> the poset of regions (again with respect to a canonical base region) of a supersolvable hyperplane arrangement is equal to the rank <b>of</b> the <b>arrangement.</b> In particular, the order <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> the weak order on a finite Coxeter group of type A or B is equal to the number of generators.
