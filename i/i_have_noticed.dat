25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> that people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, {{this is not the}} case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is true {{that the}} music I traffic in, along with Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter and others, has never gained a great popularity. But that was true of the {{so-called}} difficult music of earlier centuries, too. And I must say that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed,</b> as we have held our ground, {{that there has been a}} softening of response. There are now those who are beginning to find expressive beauty in a music that was at first rejected entirely." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Warren Dockter, Churchill {{wrote this}} {{during a time}} of a fundamentalist revolt in Sudan and this statement does not reflect his full view of Islam, which were [...] "often paradoxical and complex." [...] He could be critical but at times [...] "romanticized" [...] the Islamic world; he exhibited great [...] "respect, understanding and magnanimity." [...] Churchill had a fascination of Islam and Islamic civilization. Winston Churchill's future sister-in-law expressed concerns about his fascination by stating, [...] "lease don't become converted to Islam; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> in your disposition a tendency to orientalism." [...] According to historian Warren Dockter, however, he [...] "never seriously considered converting".|$|E
2500|$|Layton {{started off}} the 2008 federal {{election}} campaign with a speech {{similar to that}} of US presidential nominee Barack Obama. Layton denied he was trying to draw comparisons with Obama, saying [...] "I mean, I am a lot shorter than he is. He is a brilliant orator. I'm never going to claim to be that. But what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> is that the key issues faced by the American middle class, the working people of the U.S. and their concerns about their families' futures, are awfully similar to the issues that I hear in Canada." [...] Layton said that he has also written to Obama and Hillary Clinton saying that the North American Free Trade Agreement had hurt working people in both countries [...] "and those stories have to be told." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hill {{remained}} as a committeeman {{and as a}} reporter on Somerset cricket for more than 40 years. He also contributed the notes on Somerset matches to Wisden for many years. His former school-friend and fellow reporter Alan Gibson wrote in 1983: [...] "He rules over the tatty old press-box at Taunton with what purports to be an iron glove, {{though there is a}} velvet hand within it. He will growl about 'you cowboys' to visitors, especially when they arrive late and want to borrow his scorecard, but having been suitably humbled they get their information and their telephone calls in the end... He rightly dislikes a stream of dirty stories in a press-box... but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> he is becoming increasingly voluble himself. Last season I heard him mutter 'Good shot' twice in one over." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> it too. She {{started and}} turned pale, when Ambrose {{repeated}} to her what Silas {{had said to}} him.|$|R

6000|$|As {{the teacher}} said this, his good-natured black face was {{wrinkled}} with a smile of merriment. Observing that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> it, he said: ...|$|R

60|$|A {{tendency}} to obesity {{is more common}} {{in this part of the}} country than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> it elsewhere.|$|E
60|$|CRICHTON. So--like one washing them. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> {{that the}} others tend to do it also. It seems odd.|$|E
60|$|An {{exceedingly}} fat man, whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> as {{the companion}} of the lady {{upstairs in the}} sailor hat, beckoned me to stand before him.|$|R
60|$|I {{determined}} to make {{at least one more}} effort to learn something, and to this end I adopted strategy when next the youth came to my cell. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> that he was a handsome fellow, about the size and age of Carthoris. And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> also <b>noticed</b> that his shabby trappings but illy comported with his dignified and noble bearing.|$|R

60|$|Lon seemed put out, but {{he began}} in that hearty, genial manner that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> before. It seemed a shade too hearty and genial, and it irritated me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{noticed it}}," [...] cried Corp. [...] "I've noticed it this while back, though I didna ken <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> it, Gavinia. <b>I</b> wonder {{what can be}} the reason?" ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{some time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> that Miss Willoughby {{had ceased to}} look past me when she spoke to me, and now she fixed her eyes fully upon me and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wonder if}} he really {{believed}} it. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> that the maids and the waiters seem to look at us with a certain interest.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> her myself," [...] Mrs. Walsham said. [...] "She is a {{singularly}} {{pretty and}} graceful child; {{but it will}} certainly cause remark." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, {{all that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> {{is that they}} are horribly tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably {{conceited}} when they are not.|$|E
60|$|If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> {{no other}} {{alteration}} in her than this welcome {{change for the}} better, my record of the day would have ended here, as the record of unmixed happiness.|$|R
6000|$|Miggles darted a quick, half-defiant {{glance at}} the two lady {{passengers}} who <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> {{did not participate in}} the general masculine admiration of Miggles, and said gravely, [...] "No; it's Jim." ...|$|R
60|$|He's very susceptible. He's always {{falling in}} and out of love. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> that he was attracted, and I confess I thought it better to put him out of harm's way.|$|R
60|$|THE CLERK [feebly ironical]. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> {{something}} {{about it in the}} papers. Heard you mention it once or twice, now I come to think of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Like the chair," [...] said Dan, [...] "it is no novelty, {{except in}} this out-o'-the-way place. You see, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> that Old Peg is rather deaf--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That pendulum's wrong; {{it is not}} {{properly}} weighted," [...] suddenly said a somewhat testy voice at my shoulder. Looking round I saw the naval officer whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> when the passengers came aboard.|$|R

60|$|He {{bellowed}} rollickingly. I saw {{now that}} he was in the pink. As a matter of fact, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> something of the sort directly I met him, but had attributed it to alcoholic stimulant.|$|R
