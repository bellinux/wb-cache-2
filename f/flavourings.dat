5|$|Nigerian cuisine, like West African cuisine in general, {{is known}} for its {{richness}} and variety. Many different spices, herbs and <b>flavourings</b> are used in conjunction with palm oil or groundnut oil to create deeply flavoured sauces and soups often made very hot with chili peppers. Nigerian feasts are colourful and lavish, while aromatic market and roadside snacks cooked on barbecues or fried in oil are plentiful and varied.|$|E
5|$|One stew {{that may}} be served with {{couscous}} is the Moroccan tagine, a hearty, somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked slowly in a pot (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, chillies, and paprika). Other characteristic <b>flavourings</b> of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins.|$|E
5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further <b>flavourings</b> such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|English tastes evolved {{during the}} sixteenth century {{in at least three}} ways. Firstly, recipes emphasise a balance of sweet and sour. Secondly, butter becomes an {{important}} ingredient in sauces, a trend which continued in later centuries. Thirdly, herbs, which could be grown locally but had been little used in the Middle Ages, started to replace spices as <b>flavourings.</b> In A. W.'s Book of Cookrye, 35% of the recipes for meat stews and sauces include herbs, most commonly thyme. On the other hand, 76% of those meat recipes still used the distinctly mediaeval combination of sugar and dried fruit, together or separately. New ingredients were arriving from distant countries, too: The Good Huswifes Jewell introduced sweet potatoes alongside familiar Medieval recipes.|$|E
5|$|Rice is {{the staple}} diet, while fish is an {{integral}} component of coastal South Indian meals. Coconut and spices are used extensively in South Indian cuisine. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes comprising rice, legumes and lentils. Its distinct aroma and flavour is achieved by the blending of <b>flavourings</b> and spices including curry leaves, mustard seeds, coriander, ginger, garlic, chili, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, green cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, coconut and rosewater. The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a banana leaf and using clean fingers of the right hand to take the food into the mouth. After the meal, the fingers are washed; the easily degradable banana leaf is discarded or becomes fodder for cattle. Eating on banana leaves is a custom thousands of years old, imparts a unique flavor to the food and is considered healthy. Idli, dosa, uthappam, appam, pongal and paniyaram are popular dishes for breakfast. Rice is served with sambar, rasam and poriyal for lunch. Andhra cuisine is characterised by pickles and spicy curries. Chettinad cuisine is famous for non-vegetarian items and Hyderabadi cuisine is popular for its biryani.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as <b>flavourings</b> and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E
25|$|Tea {{is often}} {{consumed}} with {{additions to the}} basic tea leaf and water. These can be grouped into <b>flavourings</b> added to the tea in processing before sale and those added during preparation or drinking. The former are often floral, herbal or spice <b>flavourings</b> and the latter include milk, sugar, lemon, among other things.|$|E
25|$|American bacons include {{varieties}} smoked with hickory, mesquite or applewood and <b>flavourings</b> such as chili pepper, maple, brown sugar, honey, or molasses.|$|E
25|$|Processing {{food for}} sale {{produces}} wastes generated from cooking {{which are often}} rich in plant organic material and may also contain salt, <b>flavourings,</b> colouring material and acids or alkali. Very significant quantities of oil or fats may also be present.|$|E
25|$|Blended whiskey—a mixture that {{contains}} a blend of straight whiskeys and neutral grain spirits (NGS), and may also contain <b>flavourings</b> and colourings. The percentage of NGS must be disclosed on the label and may be as much at 80% on a proof gallon basis.|$|E
25|$|Sloe gin is {{traditionally}} {{described as a}} liqueur made by infusing sloes (the fruit of the blackthorn) in gin, although modern versions are almost always compounded from neutral spirits and <b>flavourings.</b> Similar infusions are possible with other fruits, such as damsons or beach plums.|$|E
25|$|Reactions to {{chemical}} {{components of the}} diet are more common than true food allergies. Although, {{there is no evidence}} to support this. They are caused by various organic chemicals occurring naturally in a wide variety of foods, both of animal and vegetable origin more often than to food additives, preservatives, colourings and <b>flavourings,</b> such as sulfites or dyes.|$|E
25|$|From an {{economic}} point of view, the order Asparagales {{is second in}} importance within the monocots to the order Poales (which includes grasses and cereals). Species are used as food and <b>flavourings</b> (e.g. onion, garlic, leek, asparagus, vanilla), as cut flowers (e.g. freesia, gladiolus, iris, orchids), and as garden ornamentals (e.g. day lilies, lily of the valley, Agapanthus).|$|E
25|$|The {{bread is}} almost always very low in fat, its content {{comparable}} to most other varieties of bread. It contains no added oils or fats. Additional <b>flavourings,</b> other than salt, can include barley malt syrup. It is rich in whole grain and dietary fiber and contains little or no sugar, and is thus considered by many Danes as a healthy alternative to whiter types of bread.|$|E
25|$|Distilled gin is {{produced}} exclusively by redistilling ethanol of agricultural origin {{with an initial}} strength of 96% ABV (the azeotrope of water and ethanol) in stills traditionally used for gin, {{in the presence of}} juniper berries and of other natural botanicals, provided that the juniper taste is predominant. Gin obtained simply by adding essences or <b>flavourings</b> to ethanol of agricultural origin is not distilled gin.|$|E
25|$|Commercial kvass, {{especially}} {{less expensive}} varieties, is occasionally made {{like many other}} soft drinks, using sugar, carbonated water, malt extract, and <b>flavourings.</b> Better brands, often made by beer rather than soft drink manufacturers, usually use {{a variation of the}} traditional process to brew their products. Kvass is commonly served unfiltered, with the yeast still in it, which adds to its unique flavour as well as its high vitamin B content.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, the {{regulations}} regarding naming conventions for brandy {{are similar to}} those of the US (provisions B.02.050–061). According to the Canadian food and drug regulations, Brandy shall be a potable alcoholic distillate, or a mixture of potable alcoholic distillates, obtained by the distillation of wine. The minimum specified aging period is six months in wood, although not necessarily oak (provision B.02.061.2). Caramel, fruit, other botanical substances, <b>flavourings,</b> and flavouring preparations may also be included in a product called brandy (provisions B.02.050–059).|$|E
25|$|The bulk of truffle oil on {{the market}} is made with a {{synthetic}} ingredient, as are many other truffle products. However, alcohol is now being used to carry the truffle flavour {{without the need for}} synthetic <b>flavourings.</b> The first truffle vodka, Black Moth Vodka, is a natural vodka infused with black Périgord truffles (Tuber melanosporum). Although primarily used as a spirit in its own right and mixed in a range of cocktails, truffle vodka is also used by various chefs to flavour dishes by evaporating the alcohol through cooking whilst retaining the truffle aroma.|$|E
25|$|Butter is a {{dairy product}} {{containing}} up to 80% butterfat (in commercial products) which is solid when chilled and {{at room temperature}} in some regions and liquid when warmed. It is made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk to separate the butterfat from the buttermilk. It is generally used as a spread on plain or toasted bread products and a condiment on cooked vegetables, {{as well as in}} cooking, such as baking, sauce making, and pan frying. Butter consists of butterfat, milk proteins and water, and in some types, added salt. Butter may also be sold with added <b>flavourings,</b> such as garlic butter.|$|E
25|$|Ice cream (derived {{from earlier}} iced cream or cream ice) is a {{sweetened}} frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavors. It is typically {{sweetened with sugar}} or sugar substitutes. Typically, <b>flavourings</b> and colourings are added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (<nbsp&). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>flavourings</b> {{are added}} to {{varieties}} of tea during processing. Among the best known are Chinese jasmine tea, with jasmine oil or flowers, the spices in Indian masala chai, and Earl Grey tea, which contains oil of bergamot. A great range of modern flavours {{have been added to}} these traditional ones. In eastern India, people also drink lemon tea or lemon masala tea. Lemon tea simply contains hot tea with lemon juice and sugar. Masala lemon tea contains hot tea with roasted cumin seed powder, lemon juice, black salt and sugar, which gives it a tangy, spicy taste. Adding a piece of ginger when brewing tea is a popular habit of Sri Lankans, who also use other types of spices such as cinnamon to sweeten the aroma.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} and frequently used spices and <b>flavourings</b> in Indian cuisine are whole or powdered chilli pepper (mirch, introduced by the Portuguese from Mexico in the 16th century), black mustard seed (sarso), cardamom (elaichi), cumin (jeera), turmeric (haldi), asafoetida (hing), ginger (adrak), coriander (dhania), and garlic (lasoon). One popular spice mix is garam masala, a powder that typically includes five or more dried spices, especially cardamom, cinnamon (dalchini), and clove (laung). Each culinary region has a distinctive garam masala blend—individual chefs may also have their own. Goda masala is a comparable, though sweet, spice mix popular in Maharashtra. Some leaves commonly used for flavouring include bay leaves (tejpat), coriander leaves, fenugreek leaves, and mint leaves. The use of curry leaves and roots for flavouring is typical of Gujarati and South Indian cuisine. Sweet dishes are often seasoned with cardamom, saffron, nutmeg, and rose petal essences.|$|E
25|$|Fraud in wine {{production}} {{refers to the}} use of additives in order to deceive. This may include colouring agents such as elderberry juice, and <b>flavourings</b> such as cinnamon at best, or less desirable additives at worst. Some varieties of wine have sought after characteristics. For example some wines have a deep, dark color and flavor notes of spices due to the presence of various phenolic compounds found in the skin of the grapes. Fraudsters will use additives to artificially create these characteristics when they are lacking. Fraud in the selling of wine, has seen much attention focused on label fraud and the investment wine market. Counterfeit labelling of rare, expensive, and cult wines, and unregulated investment wine firms characterise this type of fraud. Wine Spectator noted as much as 5% of the wine sold in secondary markets could be counterfeit and the DTI (UK) believes losses (by investors) to rogue wine investment firms amount to hundreds of millions of pounds.|$|E
25|$|Shrubby {{evergreen}} perennials grown chiefly {{for their}} fragrance, may be species or cultivars but all {{must have a}} clear and distinct scented foliage. Scent is emitted when the leaves are touched or bruised with some scents aromatic, others pungent {{and in a few}} cases, quite unpleasant. Several of the scented leaved pelargoniums are grown for the oil ‘geranol’, which is extracted from the leaves and is an essential oil much used commercially in perfumery. The scent of some species growing in their natural habitat, acts as a deterrent to grazing animals who appear to dislike the emitted scent. Conversely, it also attracts other insect life to visit the bloom and pollinate the plant. The scented leaves can be used for potpourri and they also have a use as <b>flavourings</b> in cooking. Occasionally scented types can be found in some of the other groups mentioned; for example, the Angels, having P.crispum in their genetic makeup, can often have a strong citrus scent. Leaves are lobed, toothed, incised or variegated. Growth habit is very variable, but the flowers are less prominent than other groups, and most closely resemble the species they originated from.|$|E
500|$|While {{running the}} shop, David wrote another {{full-length}} book, Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen (1970). It {{was her first}} book in a decade and {{the first of a}} projected series on English cookery to be called [...] "English Cooking, Ancient and Modern". She had decided to concentrate on the subject while recuperating from her cerebral haemorrhage in 1963. The book was a departure from her earlier works and contained more food history about what she called [...] "the English preoccupation with the spices and the scents, the fruit, the <b>flavourings,</b> the sources and the condiments of the orient, near and far".|$|E
500|$|English cuisine in {{the twentieth}} century {{suffered}} from a poor international reputation. Keith Arscott of Chawton House Library comments that [...] "at one time people didn't think the English knew how to cook and yet these [...] female writers were at the forefront of modern day cooking." [...] English food was popularly supposed to be bland, but English cuisine has made extensive use of spices since the Middle Ages; introduced curry to Europe; and makes use of strong <b>flavourings</b> such as English mustard. It was similarly reputed to be dull, like roast beef: but that dish was highly prized both in Britain and abroad, and few people could afford it; the [...] "Roast Beef of Old England" [...] lauded by William Hogarth in his 1748 painting celebrated the high quality of English cattle, which the French at the [...] "Gate of Calais" [...] (the other name of his painting) could only look at with envy. The years of wartime shortages and rationing certainly did impair the variety and flavour of English food during the twentieth century, but the nation's cooking recovered from this with increasing prosperity and the availability of new ingredients from soon after the Second World War.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on {{the local}} regulations, {{additional}} <b>flavourings</b> and colouring compounds may {{be added to the}} whisky. Canadian whisky may contain caramel and flavouring in addition to the distilled mash spirits. Scotch whisky may contain added (E150A) caramel colouring, but no other additives. The addition of <b>flavourings</b> is not allowed in American [...] "straight" [...] whiskey, but is allowed in American blends.|$|E
2500|$|... in the {{extraction}} of seasonings and <b>flavourings</b> from vegetable or animal proteins and {{in the manufacture of}} sauces; ...|$|E
2500|$|... n-Butanol {{is used as}} an {{ingredient}} in processed and artificial <b>flavourings,</b> and for the extraction of lipid-free protein from egg yolk, natural flavouring materials and vegetable oils, the manufacture of hop extract for beermaking, and as a solvent in removing pigments from moist curd leaf protein concentrate.|$|E
2500|$|Italian {{ice cream}} or Gelato as it is known, is a {{traditional}} and a popular dessert in Italy. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in [...] "produzione propria" [...] gelaterias. Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural <b>flavourings.</b> Gelato typically contains 7–8% fat, less than ice cream's minimum of 10%.|$|E
2500|$|SodaStream International Ltd. (...) is an Israeli drinks company {{best known}} as the maker of the {{consumer}} home carbonation product of the same name. The device, like a soda syphon, carbonates water by adding carbon dioxide from a pressurized cylinder to create soda water (or carbonated water) to drink. The company also sells more than 100 types of concentrated syrups and <b>flavourings</b> to make carbonated drinks.|$|E
2500|$|The Danish hønsekødssuppe is {{traditionally}} cooked using large hens specifically reserved for soup, known as [...] "suppehøner" [...] (lit.: soup hens). Vegetables like celeriac, carrots, onions and leek are usually added and typical <b>flavourings</b> are thyme, laurels and white pepper. The soup may be served with small white dumplings and meatballs. As part of traditional housekeeping, the cooked meat {{is reserved for}} other dishes such as høns i asparges (lit.: [...] "chicken in asparagus") or hønsesalat (lit.: [...] "chicken salad").|$|E
2500|$|Liquorice {{provides}} {{tobacco products}} {{with a natural}} sweetness and a distinctive flavour that blends readily with the natural and imitation flavouring components employed in the tobacco industry. It represses harshness and is not detectable as liquorice by the consumer. [...] Tobacco <b>flavourings</b> such as liquorice also {{make it easier to}} inhale the smoke by creating bronchodilators, which open up the lungs. [...] Chewing tobacco requires substantially higher levels of liquorice extract as emphasis on the sweet flavour appears highly desirable.|$|E
2500|$|E150A caramel {{colouring}} may {{be added}} to single malt Scotch whisky prior to bottling, to give the whisky a more rich and well-aged appearance. No other additives are allowed in Scotch whisky. This contrasts with the rules governing Canadian whisky production, which allow the addition of other <b>flavourings</b> as well as caramel, and with the rules governing American whiskey, which do not allow additives in [...] "straight" [...] whisky. The use of the caramel additive must be disclosed when the whisky is sold in some jurisdictions, although not in Scotland itself.|$|E
2500|$|Bacon is {{distinguished}} from salt pork and ham by {{differences in the}} brine or dry packing. Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably sodium nitrite, and occasionally potassium nitrate (saltpeter), but sodium ascorbate or erythorbate may also be added to accelerate curing and stabilise colour. <b>Flavourings</b> such as brown sugar or maple syrup are used for some bacon products. Sodium polyphosphates, such as sodium triphosphate, may also be added to make the product easier to slice and to reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried. Today, a brine specifically for ham includes {{a large amount of}} sugar. Historically, the terms [...] "ham" [...] and [...] "bacon" [...] referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel.|$|E
60|$|Sweets and bitters {{are really}} almost the only tastes proper, almost {{the only ones}} {{discriminated}} by this central and truly gustatory region of the tongue and palate. Most so-called <b>flavourings</b> will be found on strict examination {{to be nothing more}} than mixtures with these of certain smells, or else of pungent, salty, or alkaline matters, distinguished as such by the tip of the tongue. For instance, paradoxical as it sounds to say so, cinnamon has really no taste at all, but only a smell. Nobody will ever believe this on first hearing, but nothing on earth is easier than to put it to the test. Take a small piece of cinnamon, hold your nose tightly, rather high up, between the thumb and finger, and begin chewing it. You will find that it is absolutely tasteless; you are merely chewing a perfectly insipid bit of bark. Then let go your nose, and you will find immediately that it 'tastes' strongly, though in reality it is only the perfume from it that you now permit to rise into the smelling-chamber in the nose. So, again, cloves have only a pungent taste and a peculiar smell, and the same is the case more or less with almost all distinctive <b>flavourings.</b> When you come to find of what they are made up, they consist generally of sweets or bitters, intermixed with certain ethereal perfumes, or with pungent or acid tastes, or with both or several such together. In this way, a comparatively small number of original elements, variously combined, suffice to make up the whole enormous mass of recognisably different tastes and flavours.|$|E
