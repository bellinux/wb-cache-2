50|$|The {{video head}} drum itself of a VX machine {{also has the}} unique {{distinction}} of being completely removable and replaceable without any special tools or equipment. The drum has a <b>knurled</b> <b>nut</b> on top, which can be adjusted by hand, allowing the drum {{to be removed from}} the deck for cleaning or replacement. To this date, the VX machines have been the only VCR designed with this feature.|$|R
50|$|Knurling is {{also used}} on the grips of darts and the footpegs of BMX bicycles. Aside from adding {{functionality}} to an object (valve repairs and hand grips being {{some of the most}} common), knurling also adds a decorative pattern to the material. The <b>knurled</b> <b>nut</b> is one such application, which uses a knurled finish instead of hexagonal or square edges which helps in tightening or loosening the nut without the use of a tool. The knurled surfaces provide enough grip to hold the nut between the thumb and forefinger. Hence it is also called a thumb nut. It is mainly used on small diameter bolts.Knurled nuts are typically used in electrical components, musical instruments and in automobiles.|$|R
50|$|The gun was {{designed}} {{with a long}} barrel (305mm) which featured a compensator and cooling fins. The replaceable barrel was held in by a <b>knurled</b> <b>nut,</b> but a design fault meant that the barrel could be fitted upside down (a famous picture exists {{of a member of}} the I.R.A. brandishing a Vigneron, with the foresight below the barrel). This fault was never corrected. Empty casings are ejected out of the ejection port on the right which has a hinged dust cover. This cover opens automatically when cocking the gun. If the gun is to be kept cocked in dusty conditions the cover can be manually closed after cocking to exclude dust and grit, and it will open automatically when the gun is fired.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Pistachio (Pistacia vera) <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> {{shell and}} kernel defects detract from {{consumer}} acceptance and, in some cases, {{may be more}} prone to insect damage, mold decay, and/or aflatoxin contamination. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop imaging algorithms to improve sorting of <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> the following shell defects: oily stains, dark stains, adhering hull, and the following kernel defects: navel orangeworm (NOW) damage, fungal decay, and Aspergillus molds, all of which indicate risk of aflatoxin contamination. Imaging algorithms were developed to distinguish normal nuts from those <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> oily stains, dark stains, and adhering hull as well as nuts having kernel defects. Image algorithm testing on a validation data set showed that nuts having oily stain, dark stain, or adhering hull could be distinguished from normal <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> an accuracy of 98 %. Removing <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> oily stain, dark stain, and adhering hull will also remove 89. 7 % of <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> kernel decay, 93. 8 % of <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> Aspergillus molds present, and 98. 7 % of NOW positive nuts...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{was developed}} to separate pistachio <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> closed-shells from those with open-shells. It was observed that upon impact on a steel plate, <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> closed-shells emit different sounds than <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> open-shells. Two feature vectors extracted from the sound signals were melcepstrum coefficients and eigenvalues obtained from the principle component analysis of the autocorrelation matrix of the signals. Classification of a sound signal was done by linearly combining feature vectors from both mel-cepstrum and PCA feature vectors. An important property of the algorithm {{is that it is}} easily trainable. During the training phase, sounds of the <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> closed-shells and open-shells were used to obtain a representative vector of each class. The accuracy of closed-shell nuts was more than 99 % on the test set...|$|R
40|$|In {{the results}} of survey on {{operating}} state of pine nut processors located in Gapyeong–gun, Gyeonggi–do and Hongcheon–gun, Gangwon–do, representative pine nut producing area, the total purchasing amount of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone of Gapyeong–gun, Gyeonggi–do was 500 ~ 4, 000 bags (1 bag is 80 kg), of which average amount per processor was 2000 bags. The price range per bag of pine nuts was 470 ~ 620 thousand won and the average price was 550 thousand won. Total purchase price of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone per processor averaged 1. 2 billion won and the mean net income per bag of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone was 35 thousand won. Total purchasing amount of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone of Hongcheon–gun, Gangwon–do was 1, 000 ~ 2, 000 bags, averaging 1, 500 bags per processor and the price range per bag of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone was 580 ~ 630 thousand won, averaging 610 thousand won. Total purchase price of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone per processor averaged 0. 9 billion won and the mean net income per bag of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone was 100 thousand won. However, 9 processors among total 16 processors answered to plan to maintain the present state because of difficulty in securing material amount of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone, low profitability, poor selling, lack of equipment introducing fund, and lack of pine nuts purchasing fund for future business scale. Therefore, {{it was suggested that}} in order to activate local economy through maintenance and expansion of pine nut processors, financial supports such as low interest loan for expansion of processing amount were necessary in the short run and expansion of new forestation and crown shape control to facilitate seed exploitation as well as work enforcement such as thinning for increase of yield was required in the long run...|$|R
5000|$|Presta {{valve stems}} are 6 mm in diameter, whereas Schrader valve stems for bicycle tires are 8 mm, thus {{requiring}} a larger diameter {{hole in a}} bicycle rim. While not a concern on wider bike rims, it will weaken a narrow wheel rim, precluding their use on (road) racing bicycles. Another disadvantage of the Schrader is that the air chuck must depress the spring-loaded pin before air can flow during inflation (and potentially introducing debris into the tube or the seal inside the valve), whereas the Presta valve relies on a small <b>knurled</b> <b>nut</b> to keep it shut. To fill up a bicycle tire with a Presta-valved tube {{at a gas station}} requires an adaptor, while a Schrader-valved tube does not. Bike riders also need to purchase Presta pumps, or more commonly the dual valve capable pumps for both Schrader and Presta valves. As of this point, most CO2 inflators are also Presta only, although some manufacturers are developing Schrader compatible inflator heads which use pressure to open the Schrader valve. Presta valves are also available in a wider variety of stem lengths for aero-bicycle rims. A removable core Presta valve has become common in many applications, specifically tubeless tires where the ability to introduce sealant into the tire through the stem is considered useful.|$|R

40|$|The {{qualitative}} phytochemical {{analysis revealed}} {{the presence of}} alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, cardiac glycoside, glycoside, saponins glycosides, steroid, and volatile oil for both red and white cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> varying degree in their concentration, only anthraquinone was not detected. The quantitative analysis revealed {{that there was a}} significant difference at (p< 0. 05) in saponins content of white cola <b>nut</b> when compared <b>with</b> red cola <b>nut</b> which has the highest percentage of saponins content (20. 60 %) than red cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> (10. 80 %). While no significant difference in the contents of alkaloid, flavonoids, tannins and glycosides. The alkaloids contents of red cola nut was higher (16. 07 %) when compared to white cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> (14. 40 %), while flavonoids contents of white cola nut was high (6. 33 %) compared to red cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> (5. 60 %), glycoside contents of white cola nut (6. 76 %) to that of red cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> (5. 68 %) and tannin content of white cola nut (1. 18 %) as compared with the red cola nut (1. 12 %). Conclusively this proved the scientific basis for the traditional uses of the plant extracts that have long being the knowledge for many years. It therefore recommended that further research study should be conduct on characterization of bioactive secondary metabolite of cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> a view of stabilizing the active ingredient so that they can be prevented from losing their potency...|$|R
