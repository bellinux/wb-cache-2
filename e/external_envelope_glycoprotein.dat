Envelope glycoprotein from IIIB and IIIRF appears to be identical, whether isolated from infected {{cell membranes}} or culture media. The molecular size of the IIIRF <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> was 110 kilodaltons, whereas the relative size of IIIB gp 120 was 123 kilodaltons. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of purified <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> isolated from infected cell membranes or culture fluids revealed identical single sequences for the first 20 amino acids for each variant. The sequences obtained for IIIB gp 120 were identical to those reported for the BH 10 clone of the IIIB isolate, and the sequences determined for IIIRF gp 110 matched the amino acid sequence predicted for the HAT 3 clone of the Haitian HIV isolate. The amino-terminal sequences of external envelope glycoproteins isolated from either HIV- 1 variant corresponded to the sequence starting at the proposed proteolytic cleavage site for the processing of the signal peptide of gp 160. Immunization with <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> isolated from {{either of the two}} HIV- 1 variants yielded goat antibodies that primarily precipitated the homologous antigen.

40|$|To map {{the regions}} of the <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) {{involved in the process}} of membrane fusion, we determined the syncytium-inducing capacity of a panel of transiently expressed chimeric envelope genes. This panel was generated by exchanging gene fragments between four previously studied envelope genes that exhibited a high degree of sequence homology yet displayed marked differences in syncytium-inducing capacity when expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus. The results demonstrate that multiple regions of the HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> are involved in syncytium formation. Some fragments, most notably those containing the V 2 or V 3 region, can transfer syncytium-inducing capacity to envelope proteins previously not capable of inducing syncytia. Moreover, it is shown that such regions functionally interact with other envelope regions, especially one encompassing the V 4 and V 5 regions of gp 120 or a region encompassing part of gp 41, to exert their function in membrane fusion...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of an effective HIV- 1 vaccine must be {{considered one of the}} greatest biomedical challenges of today. The nature of the virus, characterized by immense variability as well as its tropism for the essential CD 4 + T cells of the immune system, allows it to establish a chronic infection for years under constant immune selection pressure. Eventually the depletion of CD 4 + T cells is so severe that the immune system fails and the host succumbs to AIDS. One of the most variable components of the virus is the <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins,</b> which mediate receptor binding and fusion. As the sole virally derived components facing the outside of the viral membrane, the <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> also represent the only target for neutralizing antibodies. Under the scope of this thesis we evaluate novel strategies to elicit neutralizing antibodies against HIV- 1, using different envelope glycoprotein-based immunogens and different modes of delivery. By biochemical methods we characterize vaccine candidates for their structural and antigenic properties. In addition, we also investigate the ability of these candidates, administered by selected regimens, to induce immune responses against the HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> in small animals (paper I) and in non-human primates (paper III). One of the major findings of this thesis is that the priming agent in combined prime-boost regimens can be utilized to shape the immune response in terms of specificity and T-helper bias of the CD 4 + T cells without apparent detriment for the elicited neutralizing antibody response. In addition, we design a novel recombinant Semliki Forest virus vector, allowing for a ten-fold increase of HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein-secretion, as compared with the parental vector (paper II). We also show that the increased secretion is translated into increased immunogenicity in mice. This vector may be useful for future HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> vaccine studies. Finally we define the mechanism by which antibodies against the co-receptor binding site of the HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> are elicited. In a set of controlled experiments in non-human primates, rabbits and transgenic rabbits we definitively conclude that the in vivo presence of primate CD 4 is critical for the elicitation such antibodies. This thesis provides new fundamental information of relevance to both natural HIV- 1 infection and the {{development of}} HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein-based vaccines...|$|R

The fusion protein V 3 /V 4 GST was used in lymphocyte proliferation assays, where it consistently caused peripheral blood lymphocytes from naive cats to proliferate in a dose-dependent manner. Other FIV fusion proteins produced under identical conditions (V 5 GST and p 24 GST) and glutathione S-transferase alone did not cause proliferation in this system. The monoclonal antibody vpg 15, which has been shown to block infection of susceptible cells in vitro, did not decrease the response to V 3 /V 4 GST.

These MVC inhibited HIV- 1 infection of T cell lines and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by T cell line-adapted viruses or primary isolates, with IC 50 s ranging from 0. 1 to 7. 4 μg/ml. Inhibition of Env-mediated membrane fusion by MVC was also observed using a dye-transfer assay.

Immunization of rabbits or goats with the native <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> gp 120 or with corresponding recombinant proteins elicited strictly type-specific neutralizing antibodies. A broad, group-specific cellular immune response to gp 120 and to three different HIV isolates was seen in goats immunized with the native gp 120 but not in animals immunized with the nonglycosylated recombinant envelope proteins. In HIV-infected people, no T-cell response was seen, even though their T-cell response toward other foreign antigens was intact.

40|$|The innate immune {{response}} {{is a key}} barrier against pathogenic microorganisms such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). Because HIV- 1 is rarely transmitted orally, we hypothesized that oral epithelial cells participate in the innate immune defense against this virus. We further hypothesized that secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), a 12 -kDa mucosal antiviral protein, is {{a component of the}} host {{immune response}} to this virus. Here we demonstrated constitutive expression and production of SLPI in immortalized human oral keratinocytes. Brief exposure of cells to HIV- 1 BaL and HXB 2 significantly increased SLPI mRNA and protein production compared to that in mock-exposed cells (P < 0. 01), as evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIV- 1 -mediated stimulation of SLPI occurred at the transcriptional level, was dose and time dependent, was elicited by heat-inactivated and infectious viruses, and did not depend on cellular infection. Experiments with purified retroviral proteins showed that the stimulatory effect was induced specifically by <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> from HIV- 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus. SLPI responsiveness to HIV- 1 was also observed in an unrelated oral epithelial cell line and in normal (nonimmortalized) human oral epithelial cells isolated from healthy uninfected gingival tissues. In this first report of SLPI regulation by HIV- 1, we show that the expression and production of the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory protein can be stimulated in oral epithelial cells by the virus through interactions with gp 120 in the absence of direct infection. These findings indicate that SLPI is a component of the oral mucosal response to HIV- 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{cellular}} cytoskeleton in Junin virus (JV) infection was explored in two ways. Firstly, the action of inhibitors that affect individual cytoskeletal systems (microtubules or microfilaments) selectively was analysed. It was found that perturbations of microtubule or microfilament networks caused by colchicine, nocodazole, nifedipine, EGTA or DMSO strongly affected virion production and viral protein expression at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Secondly, the extent of association of viral proteins and infectious virus particles with the cytoskeletal fraction of monkey Vero cells was determined by using three non-ionic detergents, Triton X- 100 (TX- 100), NP- 40 and octyl glucoside (OG). The cytoskeleton retained nearly 70 % of the <b>external</b> JV <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> GP 38 and about 40 % of the JV nucleoprotein NP, according to TX- 100 and OG insolubility results.

40|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{effective}} approaches to prevent and inhibit viral infections is to block host cell receptors that are used by viruses to gain cell entry. Major advances have been made over the past decade in the understanding of the molecular mechanism of HIV entry into target cells. A crucial step in this entry process is the interaction of the <b>external</b> HIV <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein,</b> gp 120, with the cellular CD 4 receptor molecule. This binding step represents a potential target for new antiviral agents, and current efforts to develop safe and effective HIV entry inhibitors are focused on natural ligands and/or monoclonal antibodies that interfere with gp 120 /CD 4 interaction. Also, small synthetic compounds obtained either by high-throughput screening of large compound libraries or by structure-guided rational design have recently entered the antiretroviral arena. In this review, the anti-HIV activity of novel entry inhibitors targeting gp 120 /CD 4 interaction is outlined, and special attention is given to the cyclotriazadisulfonamide compounds, which are the most specific CD 4 -targeted antiviral drugs described so far. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|HIV {{infection}} is {{initiated by the}} selective interaction between the cellular receptor CD 4 and gp 120, the <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> of the virus. We used analytical ultracentrifugation, titration calorimetry, and surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis to characterize the assembly state, thermodynamics, and kinetics of the CD 4 -gp 120 interaction. The binding thermodynamics were of unexpected magnitude; changes in enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity greatly exceeded those described for typical protein-protein interactions. These unusual thermodynamic properties were observed with both intact gp 120 and a deglycosylated and truncated form of gp 120 protein that lacked hypervariable loops V 1, V 2, and V 3 and segments of its N and C termini. Together with previous crystallographic studies, the large changes in heat capacity and entropy reveal that extensive structural rearrangements occur within the core of gp 120 upon CD 4 binding. CD spectral studies and slow kinetics of binding support this conclusion. These results indicate considerable conformational flexibility within gp 120, which may relate to viral mechanisms for triggering infection and disguising conserved receptor-binding sites from the immune system...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{intensive}} investigation, no {{clearly defined}} mechanism explaining {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) -induced cell killing has emerged. HIV- 1 infection is initiated through a high-affinity interaction between the HIV- 1 <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> (gp 120) and the CD 4 receptor on T cells. Cell killing is a later event intimately linked by in vitro genetic analyses with the fusogenic properties of the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp 120 and transmembrane glycoprotein gp 41. In this report, we describe aberrancies in cell cycle regulatory proteins initiated by cell-cell contact between T cells expressing HIV- 1 envelope glycoproteins and other T cells expressing CD 4 receptors. Cells rapidly accumulate cyclin B protein and tyrosine-hyperphosphorylated p 34 cdc 2 (cdk 1) kinase, indicative of cell cycle arrest at G 2 phase. Moreover, these cells continue to synthesize cyclin B protein, enlarge and display an abnormal ballooned morphology, and disappear from the cultures in a pattern previously described for cytotoxicity induced by DNA synthesis (S phase) inhibitors.

Neutralizing antibodies were found in 66 % of the samples tested and highest neutralization titres observed in cases with lymphadenopathy syndrome. Antibody titres against the viral proteins also seemed to be highest in cases with LAS. Neutralization titres correlated well with antibodies to envelope glycoproteins gp 41 and gp 120 and to one of the core proteins, p 17. An increase in neutralization titre during the follow-up period was associated with a stable clinical course. Furthermore, the occurrence of antibodies directed against the <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> (gp 120) in the initial serum sample correlated well with a stable clinical course. The results suggest that neutralizing activity in the serum, particularly that evoked against gp 120, may have some prognostic significance, and that several distinct antigenic epitopes on the virus may be a target for neutralizing antibodies...|$|E

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> {{has been shown to}} be extensively modified by N-linked glycosylation; however, the presence of O-linked carbohydrates on the glycoprotein has not been firmly established. We have found that enzymatic deglycosylation of the HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> with neuraminidase and O-glycosidase results in a decrease in the apparent molecular weight of the <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein.</b> This result was observed in both vaccinia virus recombinant-derived <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> and glycoproteins derived from the IIIB, SG 3, and HXB 2, strains of HIV- 1. The decrease in molecular weight was also observed when the <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> had been deglycosylated with N-glycanase F after treatment with neuraminidase and O-glycosidase, indicating that the decrease in apparent molecular weight was not attributable to the removal of N-linked carbohydrate.

Selection of these sequences was based on their homology to the highly conserved and immunosuppressive sequence contained within the transmembrane proteins p 15 E and gp 21 of animal and human retroviruses, respectively. Peptide aa 581 - 597 was found to specifically inhibit human and murine lymphoproliferation, whereas peptides aa 655 - 671 and aa 457 - 464 had no activity. These results suggest a mechanism by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp 41 exerts a direct immunosuppressive effect in vivo, analogous to that postulated for p 15 E and gp 21, which could contribute to the immune dysfunction observed in patients suffering from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It {{is of particular interest}} that the sequence aa 584 to 609, shown to contain B- and T-helper-cell epitopes, overlaps with the sequence aa 581 to 597 that is shown here to inhibit lymphoproliferation.

To further characterize this mechanism, we studied ADA binding to murine clones stably expressing human CD 26 and/or human CD 4, and transiently expressing human CXCR 4. In this heterologous model, we show that both recombinant gp 120 and viral particles from the X 4 HIV- 1 isolate IIIB inhibited the binding of ADA to wild-type or catalytically inactive forms of CD 26. In cells lacking human CXCR 4 expression, this gp 120 -mediated inhibition of ADA binding to human CD 26 was completely dependent on the expression of human CD 4. In contrast, when cells were transfected with human CXCR 4 the inhibitory effect of gp 120 was significantly enhanced and was not blocked by anti-CD 4 antibodies. These data suggest that the interaction of gp 120 with CD 4 or CXCR 4 is required for efficient inhibition of ADA binding to CD 26, although in the presence of CXCR 4 the interaction of gp 120 with CD 4 may be dispensable...|$|E

We identified 11 replication-competent derivatives of SIVmac 239 lacking two, three, four, or five potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. These sites were located within and around variable regions 1 and 2 of the surface envelope protein of the virus. Asn (AAT) of the canonical N-linked glycosylation recognition sequence (Asn X Ser/Thr) was changed in each case to the structurally similar Gln (CAG or CAA) such that two nucleotide changes in the codon would be required for reversion. Replication of one triple mutant (g 456), however, was severely impaired. A revertant of the g 456 mutant was recovered from CEMx 174 cells with a Met-to-Val compensatory substitution at position 144, 2 amino acids upstream of attachment site 5. Thus, a debilitating loss of sites for N-linked glycosylation can be compensated for by amino acid changes not involving the Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif.

Furthermore, a CD 4 -independent R 5 HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> was able to kill CD 4 -negative target cells expressing CCR 5, demonstrating that CD 4 is not intrinsically required for the induction of death. Interestingly, high levels of CD 4 expression protected cells from lysis and syncytium formation mediated by the HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins.</b> Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that high levels of CD 4 coexpression inhibited proteolytic processing of the HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> precursor gp 160.

40|$|The {{unexpected}} encounter, 10 years ago, {{between human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the chemokine system has dramatically advanced {{our understanding of the}} pathogenesis of AIDS, opening new perspectives for the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic measures. To initiate infection, the HIV- 1 <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein,</b> gp 120, sequentially interacts with two cellular receptors, CD 4 and a chemokine receptor (or coreceptor) like CCR 5 or CXCR 4. This peculiar two-stage receptor-interaction strategy allows gp 120 to maintain the highly conserved coreceptor-binding site in a cryptic conformation, protected from neutralizing antibodies. The differential use of CCR 5 and CXCR 4 defines three HIV- 1 biological variants (R 5, R 5 X 4, X 4), which vary in their prevalence during the disease course. The evolutionary choice of HIV- 1 to exploit chemokine receptors as cellular entry gateways has turned their chemokine ligands into endogenous antiviral factors that variably modulate viral transmission, disease progression and vaccine responses. Likewise, the natural history of HIV- 1 infection is influenced by specific polymorphisms of chemokine and chemokine-receptor genes.

This study clearly demonstrates that neutralizing properties can be observed with antibodies raised to regions undescribed so far and included in both the amino-terminal and central parts of the antigen. In addition, some helper T-cell determinants were defined from gp 51 -immunized mice and from BLV-infected cattle. Although none of the peptides tested behaved as a universal helper T-cell epitope, peptide 98 - 117 stimulated T-cell proliferation from BALB/c mice and from three infected cows, while peptide 169 - 188 strongly stimulated T-cell proliferation from one infected cow. Further experiments performed with three peptides overlapping the 169 - 188 region (177 - 192, 179 - 192, 181 - 192) demonstrated the particular relevance of residue(s) P- 177 and/or D- 178 in the helper T-cell epitope. These data should assist {{in the design of}} an efficient subunit vaccine against BLV infection that contains peptides possessing both B-neutralizing and helper T-cell determinants...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA novel membrane-bound serine {{esterase}} in cultured human T 4 + lymphocytes, recently purified {{and named}} tryptase TL 2, binds {{specifically to the}} <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> protein gp 12 O of HIV- 1, interacting with its V 3 domain. This binding was selectively blocked by inhibitors of tryptase TL 2 with a GPCR sequence in their reactive site, synthetic peptides corresponding with the sequences of the V 3 domains of various HIV- 1 strains with the GPGR sequence, and antibody against tryptase TL 2, or neutralizing antibody against the V 3 domain of HTLV-IIIB. These findings suggest that tryptase TL 2 is a binding protein of the V 3 domain of HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein...</b>|$|R
40|$|Several {{domains of}} the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> have been identified {{that are involved in}} HIV- 1 -mediated membrane fusion. One domain that is involved in membrane fusion is the hydrophobic amino terminus of the HIV- 1 transmembrane glycoprotein gp 41. Here we show that a polar substitution at gp 41 amino acid 2 (the 41. 2 mutation) results in an <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> that dominantly interferes with both syncytium formation and infection mediated by the wild-type HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein.</b> The interference by the 41. 2 mutant is not a result of aberrant <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> synthesis, processing, or transport. The 41. 2 mutant elicits a dominant interfering effect even in the presence of excess wild-type glycoprotein, suggesting that a higher-order <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> complex is involved in membrane fusion. These results shed light on the process by which the HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> induce membrane fusion reactions and present a possible approach to anti-HIV therapy...|$|R
40|$|The <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> of {{the human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 2 (HIV- 2) is synthesized as a polyprotein precursor which is proteolytically processed to produce the mature surface and transmembrane <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins.</b> The processed <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> species {{are responsible for the}} fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane during the infection process. The <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> also induces syncytium formation between envelope-expressing cells and receptor-bearing cells. To characterize domains of the HIV- 2 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> involved in membrane fusion and in proteolytic processing, we introduced single amino acid mutations into the region of the HIV- 2 surface glycoprotein corresponding to the principal neutralizing determinant (the V 3 loop) of HIV- 1, the putative HIV- 2 envelope precursor-processing sequence, and the hydrophobic amino terminus of the HIV- 2 transmembrane <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein.</b> The effects of these mutations on syncytium formation, virus infectivity, envelope expression, envelope processing, and CD 4 binding were analyzed. Our results suggest that the V 3 -like region of the HIV- 2 surface glycoprotein and the hydrophobic amino terminus of the transmembrane glycoprotein are HIV- 2 fusion domains and characterize the effects of mutations in the HIV- 2 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> precursor-processing sequence...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{antigenic determinant}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 that induces neutralizing activity in infected humans and chimpanzees was previously mapped with nonapeptides between amino acids 307 and 320 on the <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> (gp 120) of strain HTLV-II IB (molecular clone BH 10) and amino acids 320 to 330 of strain HTLV-II IRF. Using different sera we found different reactive nonapeptides that overlapped and shared a tetrapeptide, GPGR. This tetrapeptide, {{which is the same}} in HTLV-IIIB and HTLV-II IRF, is flanked by amino acids that vary between virus strains. Because GPGR is predicted to form a fl-turn and is flanked by two cysteine residues that may form a disulphide bridge, a hairpin-like structure is suggested for this part of gpl 20. The tetrapeptide GPGR and the reactive peptides are located on top of this structure, well exposed to antibodies. We determined the role of the individual amino acids in antibody binding using three sets of peptide analogues derived from three reactive nonapeptides (two of strain HTLV-II IB which overlapped and one of strain HTLV-IIIRF). Each set contained peptide analogues in which each amino acid was replaced, one at atime, by all genetically encoded amino acids. At least five consecutive amino acids in each nonapeptide were essential for antibody binding. They include amino acids of GPGR and potentially provide the virus with ample opportunity to escape immune surveillance...|$|E
40|$|This study initiates {{an effort}} to develop a safe vaccine against the {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that is caused by infection with a retrovirus designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [formerly human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) ]. Other retrovirus models have shown that purified external glycoprotein subunits are immunogenic. The <b>external</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> of HIV (gp 120) has a molecular size of 120 kDa, is responsible for virus infectivity, and induces strong antibody response in humans. Purified HIV virus preparations contain relatively little gp 120 so HIV-infected cells were used as the antigen source. The gp 120 was localized on cell membranes and was solubilized {{with low levels of}} nonionic detergent. The glycoprotein was further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography over a resin prepared from IgGs isolated from patients. Homogeneity was achieved following extensive dialysis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gp 120 isolated from infected cells was shown to be structurally identical by peptide maps to virion gp 120 and the amino-terminal amino acid sequence confirmed that the molecule was specified by the HIV genome. Goat, horse, and rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) immune sera to gp 120 precipitated the homologous antigen and neutralized the in vitro infectivity of HIV. The induction of neutralizing antibody indicates that a gp 120 subunit vaccine against HIV is theoretically possible...|$|E

We now describe the humoral and cellular immune response of rhesus monkeys immunized with these hybrid particles. Macaque antisera raised by subcutaneous injections of the HIV/HBsAg particles were shown to be specific for HIV in peptide-binding assays. Moreover, {{we were able to}} generate in these vaccinated animals a T-cell-proliferative response to both parts of the hybrid particle, i. e., HIV and HBsAg. These results establish the presence of a T-cell epitope in this HIV segment, which has been shown previously (L. A. Lasky, G. Nakamura, D. H. Smith, C. Fennie, C. Shimasaki, E. Patzer, P. Berman, T. Gregory, and D. J. Capon, Cell 50 : 975 - 985, 1987) to be an important domain involved in the binding of the virus to its cellular receptor, the CD 4 molecule.
