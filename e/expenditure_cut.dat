Total revenue was about 2.7% of Estonia GDP in 2009.Bank of Estonia has also imposed the requirements to maintain reserve requirements of 15%, having strong bank regulatory and supervisory frameworks that includes capital requirements of 10% (international norm 8%), as well as limited deposit guarantee scheme. In addition to that, deposit guaranty scheme (also known as deposit insurance) has been raised from €20,000 to €50,000 effective from October 23, 2008. This coverage would covers more than 90% of deposit in the banking sector of Estonia. To raise the Guarantee Fund, banks in Estonia were required to pay quarterly premiums to the fund at a flat rate of 0.125% of the amount of each bank’s guaranteed deposits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an inter-industry analysis and a quantification {{of some of}} the likely macroeconomic effects of the removal of payroll taxes (PRT) in Australia. The share of labour costs attributable to PRT in 110 Australian industries is estimated. The effects of removing these taxes are simulated using an extended version of the ORANI model. A variety of assumptions about the macroeconomic environment are employed. These include the requirements that first, alternative taxes or government expenditure cuts be used to ensure no change in the public sector borrowing requirement; second, the balance of trade does not change; and third, real pre-tax wage rates do not change. The results show that under the assumption that the alternative tax is an income tax surcharge, significant employment gains are likely, often in industries where the direct effects on labour costs of PRT removal are only modest. These employment gains are much less under the government <b>expenditure</b> <b>cut</b> scenario. ...|$|E

40|$|This Paper {{analyses}} {{the occurrence}} of non-Keynesian effects in fiscal consolidations in the EU. The analysis is carried out both ex post, i. e. {{by looking at the}} emergence of expansionary consolidations in the past and at their characteristics, and ex ante, i. e. by simulating with the European Commission QUEST model under which conditions public finance consolidation would exhibit non-Keynesian effects in the current EMU context. Cross-country analysis shows that roughly half of the episodes of fiscal consolidations that have been undertaken in the EU in the last 30 years have been followed by an acceleration in growth. The consolidations {{that turned out to be}} expansionary were in general based on expenditure cuts rather than on revenue increases. Simulations with the QUEST model show that expansionary effects from fiscal consolidations can emerge in the short/medium run provided that consolidations are expenditure-based. Irrespective of the type of <b>expenditure</b> <b>cut</b> simulated, non-Keynesian effects in QUEST are associated with a reaction of aggregate consumption to expected future incomes; in the case of cuts to the government wage bill the investment channel is also relevant. fiscal consolidations; fiscal policy in the EU; non-keynesian effects of fiscal policy...|$|E

40|$|The study {{attempts}} to address, from amongst {{the key issues}} in the current debate on economic development: the effect of trade liberalization on poverty. The relationship between trade liberalization and poverty levels is investigated in both the long run and the short run for South Africa. To measure trade liberalization, trade openness is used as the standard index. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) measures financial openness while taxation {{is a measure of}} public intervention in the country. Consumption per capita is a proxy for poverty and Real Gross Domestic Product (RGDP) controlled for economic growth. Applying the Johansen Co-integration Techniques and Error Correction Method, empirical results suggest that trade liberalization has a cumulative effect on poverty reduction in the long-run. Lower poverty level is associated with low taxation and high foreign direct investment, particularly in the short run, in South Africa. Therefore, it is recommended that the government needs to design and pursue active development strategies to benefit from openness. There is also a need to enhance the tax revenues of the state through better collection of revenues, and administrative reforms rather than <b>expenditure</b> <b>cut</b> backs, which can reduce the effectiveness of the public sector. The government needs to strengthen allocation of funds to social sectors so as to bring the issue of poverty reduction to the central stage of economic policy making...|$|E

Another problem is, that it is a governmental supported industry where only 20 % of the cinemas are producing 80 % of the turnover, and therefore the distributors’ interest in co-financing the digitalization only concerns the largest cinemas, which will force the small cinemas to obtain alternative financing or close down. If you analyze the issue from a game theoretical angle, the distributors are the ones with the win out because they are economically strong, more homogeneous, and have credible means of exerting pressure, and therefore the cinemas will have to implicate thirds parties to gain a better position in the negotiations e. g. the Danish Film Institute. Because of the dilemma between commercial interests and cultural politics, most likely a comprehensive agreement between the distributors and the largest cinemas will be made, and afterwards the small and local cinemas will find individual ways to fund their own investments either through the Danish Film Institute, the municipalities, or community networks...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a structural macro simulation model {{to quantify the}} effects of alternative stabilization packages {{on the distribution of}} income and wealth. The model combines the explicit microeconomic optimizing behavior characteristic of computable general equilibrium models with asset portfolio behavior of macroeconomic models in Tobin's tradition. In this model there are four main mechanisms by which policy changes affect the distribution of income and wealth. First changes in factor rewards affect directly household income distribution. Second, household real incomes are affected by changes in their respective cost of living indexes. Third, household real incomes are affected by changes in real returns on financial assets since household incomes include income from financial holdings. Fourth, household wealth distribution is affected by capital gains and losses. Simulations with' the model are carried out for a representative economy subject to the interest rate and terms-of-trade shocks of the early 1980 s. The simulations suggest a large adverse impact on the distribution of income of a sharp contractionary package. The resulting distributional shifts are likely to endanger the sustainability of the package even though the distribution of income becomes more equal when normal policies are resumed. By contrast, the targeted <b>expenditure</b> <b>cut</b> programs advocated by the critics of contractionary packages result in a much less unequal distribution of income during the adjustment package, even though the distributional improvements of the targeted package are mostly reversed in the post-adjustment period. The simulations support the view that stabilization packages which do not have specific components targeted towards the poor will have a noticeable adverse effect on the distribution of income, which is likely to result in some form of permanent damage for those below the poverty line. ...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: A case study of an Italian district has been studied, taking into account three echelons: suppliers, central stock, and hospitals. A model of the various supply chain configurations has been created with the use of the simulation. Specifically, 24 supply chain configurations have been examined, stemming from the combination of several supply chain design parameters, namely: transshipment policies (Emergency Lateral Transshipment or Total Inventory Equalization); re-order and inventory management policies (Economic Order Quantity or Economic Order Interval); required service levels (90 % or 95 %); the number of available vans (one or two). For each configuration, hospital average stock, service level and a “Bullwhip effect” analysis are computed. To know which input variables are statistically significant, a DoE (Design of Experiments) analysis has been executed. Findings: The output of this paper provides useful insights and suggestions to optimize the healthcare logistic and drug supply chain. According to the developed DoE analysis, it can be stated that the introduction of transshipment policies provides important improvement in terms of service and stock levels. To reduce the Bullwhip effect, which results in a service level decreasing, and in a managing stock costs increasing, it is worth to adopt an EOQ re-order policy. Practical implications: This research gives practical recommendations to the studied system, in order to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to study which combination of transshipment policies, re-order/inventory management policies and required service levels, can be the best one to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level, in the specific logistic system...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the size of the {{informal}} (black or grey) economy causes serious fiscal problems for Hungary. This study makes an attempt to quantify the budgetary and macroeconomic effects of different ways of widening the formal sector (whitening 2 ̆ 01 d) {{with the help of a}} model. It turns out that if only negative incentives were involved (better enforcement scenario) the real effects would be painful: reduced disposable income and higher labor costs would result in lower consumption, exports, and, a fortiori, GDP growth. Obviously, unemployment would increase, and. less obviously, inflation would pick up. The tradeoff between the reduction of public debt and macroeconomic equilibrium seems to be quantitatively unfavourable. The major alternative policy option is a positive incentives scenario. The simplest measure consists of a substantial reduction in the comparatively large social security contribution rate. Its positive real effects (lower wage costs would lead to higher export growth, GDP and consumption) appear slowly, but after the second year their size would be apprehensible. However, the negative impact on the budget deficit is immediate, and though the real effects would turn the tide eventually, the initial public debt increase would worsen public indebtedness significantly within 2 years. Running scenarios under several behavioral 2 ̆ 01 d assumptions, but fixing the current structure of the government finances, we could not find any possibility to simultaneously improve macroeconomic performance and reduce public debt by using the social security contribution rate as the chief vehicle of reform. Combining the incentive scenario with improved enforcement (principally by raising the effective VAT rate) would ameliorate the situation as higher export growth would still be the decisive factor for GDP. On the other hand in this version higher inflation would constitute the main policy concern. Combining incentives with a cut in government investment spending is not necessarily alluring: it would require a very large reduction to undo the negative budgetary impact, while its negative demand effect would also undo the positive effects on GDP and consumption. To summarize: better enforcement alone would be a socially counterproductive way to reduce government debt. The incentive scenario would work out well in the long term, but it would certainly create short term budgetary, and therefore, longer term debt problems. To avoid this it must be combined with better enforcement and, possibly, with a significant <b>expenditure</b> <b>cut...</b>|$|E
