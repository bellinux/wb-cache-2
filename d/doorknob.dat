25|$|Automatic {{sliding doors}} {{are open and}} closed either by power, spring, or by a sensor. This {{eliminates}} the need for a person to open or close a door by turning a <b>doorknob</b> or pressing up against a bar on the door itself. Automatic sliding doors are commonly found at entrance and exits of supermarkets, department stores, and airport terminals. In 1954, Dee Horton and Lew Hewitt co-invented the automatic sliding door.|$|E

After a night out drinking, he was found hanged by a towel tied to a <b>doorknob</b> in his {{apartment}} in the Minami-Azabu district of Tokyo. He had returned to Japan just five days earlier, after a three-month stay in Los Angeles. On May 1, hide and the members of Spread Beaver recorded for television shows and went out drinking, with his brother driving him home at roughly 6:30am the following morning.

500|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Washington Monitor and her crew {{were greeted by}} a crowd of {{thousands}} of cheering admirers who {{came to see the}} ship that [...] "saved the nation". Monitor was now a premier tourist attraction and the crowd was soon allowed on board to tour the vessel. During this time the vessel was picked clean of artifacts for souvenirs by the touring civilians that came aboard.

500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Paul Boyd. It depicts Twain wearing a long dress and a bindi. She is walking down a hallway, attempting to go through several doors; however, they are all locked. Finally she finds an unlocked door, proceeds through it and finds an orchestra being led by a conductor. She stands in front and finishes singing the song. The video uses The Right Mix of the song. This re-recorded solo version features slightly more contemporized instrumentation and removes White's vocals. The version shown on Twain's video compilations [...] "" [...] and [...] "The Platinum Collection" [...] adds a short outtake during filming, in which Twain accidentally broke off a <b>doorknob,</b> {{to the end of}} the video.|$|E
500|$|Unusually for an Australian, Johnson bowled off-spin {{rather than}} the wrist spin {{normally}} associated with countrymen of his day. [...] Johnson had an atypical bowling action, with a [...] "rather staccato swing" [...] of his bowling arm. He bowled {{with a high degree}} of flight, causing opposing batsmen difficulties in judging where the ball would land. Making intelligent use of the wind, Johnson was able to make his deliveries float away from the batsman, changing from his standard off-break. According to E. W. Swanton, Johnson was [...] "probably the slowest bowler to achieve any measure of success in Test cricket". [...] His action was compared to a corkscrew; writer Ray Robinson saying that [...] "to coax turn from firm Australian pitches he twisted the ball almost hard enough to screw a <b>doorknob</b> off". [...] There were doubts about the legality of his bowling action; his English rival, Trevor Bailey claimed Johnson threw every delivery. [...] Johnson was never no-balled for throwing, having played cricket in front of umpires from Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies, India and Pakistan.|$|E

Lorne had an extensive collection of <b>doorknobs</b> in real life, some of which she used as props in the series.|$|R
5|$|Starting {{with the}} first floor and {{continuing}} to the third, black and white floor tiling is made of Vermont marble and limestone. The exception is {{the floor of the}} rotunda which is composed of 976 blocks of translucent glass. The blocks vary in size so that when viewed from the upper floors, they appear to form a bowl which mirrors the dome above. The <b>doorknobs</b> are mostly made of a brass and bronze alloy (most of the original brass <b>doorknobs</b> have disappeared over time). The present <b>doorknobs</b> and hinges, locked for protection, display the state coat of arms. Though the building appears to have walnut woodwork, the wood is Michigan white pine that has been wood-grained to give the appearance of walnut.|$|R
500|$|The Lazear Chemistry Hall was {{constructed}} in the Georgian style between 1939 and 1949. [...] It was designed by Frederick Larson and was named after former student Jesse William Lazear, who helped develop the cure for yellow fever. [...] In 2010, the Department of Chemistry moved from Lazear to the new Swanson Science Center. [...] With 50 rooms, including a nationally recognized polymer lab, a darkroom, a 100-seat lecture hall, and a main supply room with an acid room and hazardous chemical vault. [...] The campus chapter of the Student Affiliates of the American Chemical Society produces an annual [...] "Fear at Lazear" [...] haunted house. The door to the Troutman Library {{on the first floor}} of Lazear holds the original <b>doorknob</b> from Tara, the main plantation house from the 1939 movie Gone with the Wind. [...] It was donated to the college in May 1940 by the film's producer and Pittsburgh native David O. Selznick, who had family in the Washington area. [...] A faulty heating system and general disrepair spurred the construction of the Swanson Science Center, where the chemistry department moved in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Due to Anna Lizas success, Vega {{was dubbed}} the [...] "Original Soap Opera Princess". Director Ruel Bayani, the {{producer}} of ABS-CBN's remake of Anna Liza, commended Vega, calling her portrayal of the role [...] "iconic" [...] and that she set a high standard on being a [...] "child star". Judy Ann Santos once stated on StarStudio's special issue about Santos herself {{that she is a}} fan of Vega, and when she learned about the latter's death, she first disappeared into her room and then into the bathroom. She turned the bathroom's <b>doorknob</b> quietly, pushed the door shut then {{stood in front of the}} sink. She then looked at herself in the mirror and cried.|$|E

2500|$|The {{motion of}} the basic stroke is either similar to the motion of turning a <b>doorknob,</b> that is, an {{absolute}} forearm rotation, or {{similar to that of}} a snare drummer, where the wrist is the primary actor, or more commonly, a hybrid of these two strokes. [...] Bass drum technique sees huge variation between different groups both in the ratio of forearm rotation to wrist turn and the differing views on how the hand works while playing. Some techniques also call for the use of fingers supporting the {{motion of the}} mallet by opening or closing, but no matter whether it is open or closed the thumb needs to be close {{to the rest of the}} fingers.|$|E
2500|$|Dickey {{was drafted}} by the Texas Rangers {{in the first round}} (18th overall) of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft. After being drafted by the Rangers, Dickey was {{initially}} offered a signing bonus of $825,000, before a Rangers team physician saw Dickey's throwing (right) arm hanging oddly in a picture of him with other Team USA players in Baseball America. The Rangers subsequently did further evaluation of Dickey, leading to the discovery of a missing ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow joint, and reduced their offer to $75,000. [...] Dickey has been quoted as saying, [...] "Doctors look at me and say I shouldn't be able to turn a <b>doorknob</b> without feeling pain," [...] making his ability to pitch somewhat remarkable.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Conjectural Sound" [...] {{principle}} applies even to happenstance sounds, such as tires squealing, doorknobs turning {{or people}} walking. [...] If the sound editor wants to communicate that a driver is {{in a hurry}} to leave, he will cut the sound of tires squealing when the car accelerates from a stop; even if the car is on a dirt road, the effect will work if the audience is dramatically engaged. [...] If a character is afraid of someone {{on the other side of}} a door, the turning of the <b>doorknob</b> can take a second or more, and the mechanism of the knob can possess dozens of clicking parts. [...] A skillful Foley artist can make someone walking calmly across the screen seem terrified simply by giving the actor a different gait.|$|E

2500|$|Van Peebles {{turned down}} a large money offer from a record label that wanted him to perform his lyrics over samples of older recordings. Van Peebles said, [...] "That's not what I do! The {{structures}} of my songs are more complicated and subtle than jingles or nursery rhymes, with music which helps carry the story along. The words aren't just shouted over some loop which repeats itself." [...] Van Peebles later received an offer from Capitol Records and told the label [...] "Here's the deal: Send money, and leave me alone. I'll send the tape. That's it. Just go away, and let the <b>doorknob</b> hit you where the good Lord split you." [...] Capitol gave Van Peebles complete artistic control over the recording as a result, and he was satisfied with the business deal, {{as well as the}} finished album.|$|E
