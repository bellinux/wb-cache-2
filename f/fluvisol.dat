The length of internodes and two intersecting diameters in the middle of each internode were measured on three highest seedlings in the seedbed (h= 208. 7 – 223. 7 cm). Results and Conclusion: The elements of seedling growth were affected by microsite conditions and growing space. The analysis of covariance showed that growing space did not {{have a significant effect on}} mean seedling height (ha, hL, hg 20 %), and on mean square diameter of 20 % largest-diameter seedlings, which indicates that these growth elements were more affected by site conditions, i. e., indirectly, by silvicultural treatments. This shows that the conditions for narrow-leaved ash were more favourable on microsite B than on microsite A.

After deposition on the soil surface, rainfall and spring flood events transfer radiocesium downstream. Identifying the source of contaminated sediment is important for managing potential downstream radiocesium contamination. Soil (n = 37) and sediment (n = 211) were sampled from November 2011 to May 2014 in the Mano and the Niida coastal catchments. Two sediment fingerprinting approaches quantified the source of radiocesium contaminated sediment. First, cesium- 137 activities in surface soil and sediment samples were modelled to determine the contribution of upstream, more contaminated areas, to sediment transiting the more densely populated coastal plain. Second, elemental geochemistry of three major soil types (zs, Cambisols and <b>Fluvisols)</b> was used to model the relative contribution of these soils to sediment sampled throughout the catchments. In the Niida catchment, 47 % (σ 19 %) of sediment sampled in the coastal plain was modelled {{to be derived from}} the upstream area whereas, it was only 19 % (σ 19 %) in the Mano catchment. The main factor driving this difference is the presence of a large dam on the main stem of the Mano River. Geochemical modelling results indicated that <b>Fluvisols,</b> an alluvial soil type on which paddy fields are typically cultivated, supply the majority of sediment (μ 76, σ 14 %). The results confirm that the management of dams is fundamental to radiocesium migration. Moreover, this research indicates that <b>Fluvisols</b> and concomitantly, rice paddies on this soil type, supply a disproportionate amount of sediment.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The s tudy {{presents}} basic {{types of}} hydromorphic soils in a protected area of middle {{part of the}} Danube alluvial plain in Vojvodina. The Danube is the largest river in the Republic of Serbia. This is the first river which itself created an alluvial plain through the Pannonian plain. Due to the mild decrease of river bed slope and lateral erosion, which is a characteristic of lowland rivers, it formed a large dry alluvial plain. It was formed during the Holocene by alternating action of fluvial, erosion and accumulation processes. Materials and Methods: In this study, the following classes of hydromorphic soils in the protected area of alluvial plain of the river Danube were studied: undeveloped hydromorphic soils (<b>fluvisol),</b> semigley soils (humofluvisol) and gley soils (humogley and eugley). Four soil types were examined within the hydromorphic order of soils: <b>fluvisol,</b> humofluvisol, humogley and eugley. The measurements of groundwater level and of the water level of the Danube river were carried out twice a month {{during the growing season}} in the period of two years. The distance of piezometers from the Danube was also measured. By each piezometer, apedological profile was established. Its external and internalmorphology was described and soil samples were collected for laboratory testing. Laboratory examination of soil included analyses according to standard pedological methods. Results: The most important characteristics of the soils are presented in this study. The hydrological and physical characteristics are particularly described, especially the dynamics of groundwater during the growing period in two years, granulometric composition, differential porosity and Darcy’s coefficient. The average groundwater level related to the soil surface varied in <b>fluvisol</b> from 258 to 301 cm, in humofluvisol from 234 to 260 cm, in humogley from 142 to 167 cm, and eugley from 38 to 51 cm beneath soil surface.

40|$|Nonexchangeable {{potassium}} in soil {{plays an}} important role for plant nutrition in some circumstances. Exchange reaction and/or acid dissolution is the two main processes involved in its release from the rhizosphere. However the source and the releasing processes of nonexchangeable K from the rhizosphere is not understood well for natural soils, mainly {{due to the lack of}} a suitable method to evaluate its depletion in the rhizosphere. This study therefore aimed to quantify the depletion of nonexchangeable K in the rhizosphere and to estimate the source and the releasing processes of nonexchangeable K supplied to plants, by using a 0. 01 M HCl sequential extraction that enables to detect a subtle depletion of nonexchangeable K in the rhizosphere. Two rhizobox experiments were conducted by growing maize for 17 days under different K sources (non-allophanic Andosol, <b>Fluvisol,</b> biotite and orthoclase). As a result, nonexchangeable K decreased in the rhizosphere of Andosol, <b>Fluvisol</b> and biotite, but not of orthoclase. The width of depletion was about 0 - 1 mm from the root compartment regardless of K sources, and was much less than that of exchangeable (510 mm) and water-soluble (50 mm) K. Total depletion of nonexchangeable K at the root compartment amounted to 0. 26 mg (1. 1 % of plant uptake) for Andosol and 0. 88 mg (4. 4 % of plant uptake) for <b>Fluvisol,</b> although it was too small to detect as mineralogical changes by the XRD analysis. These results suggested that the main source of nonexchangeable K for maize was the interlayer K in 2 : 1 type clay minerals. All the rhizosphere pHs were above 4. 5. Thus mineral dissolution by proton would not occur, and the exchange of interlayer K was suspected.

The mean total content of Cd, Pb, Ni Cu, Zn, Mn, as well as Fe in <b>Fluvisols</b> at the depth of 120 – 150 cm was assumed as the content of the local geochemical background and it was: 1. 0 mg·kg - 1, 22. 8 mg·kg - 1, 26. 9 mg·kg - 1, 1. 4 mg·kg - 1, 60. 8 mg·kg - 1, 591 mg·kg - 1, and 17. 6 g·kg - 1, respectively. The values of the indicators such as contamination factor (CF), enrichment factor (EF) revealed higher levels of the accumulation of heavy metals in the soils of grasslands, which shows that the method of their use has a significant effect on the total metal content. Contamination with heavy metals in the surface layer of the investigated <b>Fluvisols</b> was found, and in terms of the content with cadmium there a moderate and considerable potential ecological risk was reported. Due to the fact that no unfavourable effect of trace elements on the riverside environment was proved and that the floodplain areas are under agricultural use, to evaluate the contamination with metals, the limit values for the soils of agricultural land were assumed as stipulated in the Regulation of Minister of the Environment of September 9, 2002. According to that criterion, the soils studied do not qualify as contaminated with metals. Only in one of the soil sampling points the total content of zinc was higher than the one determined as the maximum for agricultural land soils, namely 350 mg·kg - 1.

Under the deciduous and semideciduous woodland and forest formations on flood free riverbanks and relict dunes Arenosols, Solonetz and Alisols dominate. Inundation forests grow on a large variety of soil groupings such as Alisols, Solonetz, <b>Fluvisols,</b> Gleysols and Cambisols, mainly on fluvial deposits. Under the grassland formations of periodically flooded spreadings and depressions Planosols, Acrisols, Alisols, <b>Fluvisols,</b> Arenosols and Cambisols were cored, while Gleysols are common on swamps bearing Thalia geniculata or Cyperus giganteus. Canonical Correspondence Analysis was applied to study the influence of monitored environmental factors on spatial distribution of vegetation formations. Water regime and soil texture were found to define the grassland-forest boundaries as well as the transition between different grassland formations and between seasonal as well as evergreen forest...|$|R
