500|$|With {{each new}} treaty, {{the powers of}} the Parliament, in terms of its role in the Union's {{legislative}} procedures, have expanded. The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the [...] "ordinary legislative procedure" [...] (previously named [...] "codecision procedure"), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if both agree on a text, which they <b>do</b> (<b>or</b> <b>not)</b> through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a [...] "common position". That position may either be approved by Parliament, [...] or it may reject the text by an absolute majority, causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a [...] "Conciliation Committee" [...] is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority. This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the Bolkestein directive in 2006.|$|E
500|$|The Libellus {{consists}} {{of a series of}} responses (responsiones) by Gregory to [...] "certain jurisprudential, administrative, jurisdictional, liturgical and ritual questions Augustine was confronted with as leader of the fledgling English church". The numbering and order of these responses differ across the various versions of the Libellus (see below). But in the most widely known version (that reproduced in Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica) there are nine responses, each of which begins by re-stating or paraphrasing Augustine's original questions. Gregory's first response addresses questions about the relationship of a bishop to his clergy and vice versa, how gifts from the laity to the church should be divided amongst the clergy, and what the tasks of a bishop were. The second response addresses why the various northern European churches of which Augustine was aware had differing customs [...] and liturgies, and what Augustine should do when he encounters such differences. The third response was in answer to questions about the proper punishment of church robbers. The fourth and fifth response deal with who might marry whom, including whether it was allowed for two brothers to marry two sisters, or for a man to marry his step-sister or step-mother. The sixth response addresses {{whether or not it was}} acceptable for a bishop to be consecrated without other bishops present, if the distances involved prevented other bishops from attending the ceremony. The seventh response deals with relations between the church in England and the church in Gaul. The eighth response concerns what a pregnant, newly delivered, or menstruating woman might <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> do, including whether or not she is allowed to enjoy sex with her husband and how long after child-birth she has to wait to re-enter a church. The last response answers questions about whether or not men might have communion after experiencing a sexual dream, and whether or not priests might celebrate mass after experiencing such dreams. An additional chapter, not included by Bede in his Historia is known as the [...] "Obsecratio": it contains a response by Gregory to Augustine's request for relics of the local British martyr Sixtus. Gregory responds that he is sending relics of Pope Sixtus II to replace the local saint's remains, as Gregory has doubts about the actual saintly status of the British martyr. Although the authenticity of the [...] "Obsecratio" [...] has occasionally been questioned, most modern historians accept that it is genuine.|$|E

2500|$|The Tongan {{archipelago}} {{has been}} inhabited for perhaps 3000 years, since settlement in late Lapita times. The culture {{of its inhabitants}} has surely changed greatly over this long time period. Before the arrival of European explorers in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Tongans were in frequent contact with their nearest Oceanic neighbors, Fiji and Samoa. In the 19th century, {{with the arrival of}} Western traders and missionaries, Tongan culture changed dramatically. Some old beliefs and habits were thrown away and others adopted. Some accommodations made in the 19th century and early 20th century are now being challenged by changing Western civilization. Hence Tongan culture is far from a unified or monolithic affair, and Tongans themselves may differ strongly as to what it is [...] "Tongan" [...] to <b>do,</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> do.|$|E

2500|$|In 1964, Goldwater ran a {{conservative}} campaign that emphasized states' rights. [...] Goldwater's 1964 campaign was {{a magnet for}} conservatives since he opposed interference {{by the federal government}} in state affairs. Although he had supported all previous federal civil rights legislation and had supported the original senate version of the bill, Goldwater made the decision to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1964. His stance was based on his view that the article II and article VII of the Act interfered with the rights of private persons to <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to do business with whomever they chose and believed that the private employment provisions of the Act would lead to racial quotas. In the segregated city of Phoenix in the 1950s, he had quietly supported civil rights for blacks, but would not let his name be used.|$|E
2500|$|The writ of {{habeas corpus}} is one of what are called the [...] "extraordinary", [...] "common law", or [...] "prerogative writs", which were {{historically}} issued by the English courts {{in the name of}} the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are quo warranto, prohibito, mandamus, procedendo, and certiorari. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent must prove his authority to <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.|$|E
