25|$|Degree of {{acetylation}} (DA) for soluble chitosan {{ranges from}} 0% to 60%, depending on processing conditions. A {{study was conducted}} to characterize how varying DA affects the properties of chitosan. Varying DA was obtained using acetic anhydride or alkaline hydrolysis. It was found that decreasing acetylation created an increase in compressive strength. Biodegradation was examined by use of lysozyme, which is known to be mainly responsible for degrading chitosan in vivo by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds and is released by phagocytic cells after nerve injury. The results reveal that there was an accelerated mass loss with intermediate DAs, compared with high and low DAs over the time period studied. When DRG cells were grown on the N-acetylated chitosan, cell viability decreased with increasing DA. Also, chitosan has an increasing charge density with decreasing DA, which is responsible for greater cell adhesion. Thus, controlling the DA of chitosan is important for regulating the <b>degradation</b> <b>time.</b> This knowledge could help {{in the development of a}} nerve guidance conduit from chitosan.|$|E
25|$|A novel biodegradable, tough {{elastomer}} {{has been}} developed from poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) for use in creation of a nerve guidance conduit. PGS was originally developed for soft tissue engineering purposes to specifically mimic ECM mechanical properties. It is considered an elastomer because {{it is able to}} recover from deformation in mechanically dynamic environments and to effectively distribute stress evenly throughout regenerating tissues in the form of microstresses. PGS is synthesized by a polycondensation reaction of glycerol and sebacic acid, which can be melt processed or solvent processed into the desired shape. PGS has a Young's modulus of 0.28 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength greater than 0.5 MPa. Peripheral nerve has a Young's modulus of approximately 0.45 MPa, which is very close to that of PGS. Additionally, PGS experiences surface degradation, accompanied by losses in linear mass and strength during resorption. Following implantation, the degradation half-life was determined to be 21 days; complete degradation occurred at day 60. PGS experiences minimal water absorption during degradation and does not have detectable swelling; swelling can cause distortion, which narrows the tubular lumen and can impede regeneration. It is advantageous that the <b>degradation</b> <b>time</b> of PGS can be varied by changing the degree of crosslinking and the ratio of sebacic acid to glycerol. In a study by Sundback et al. (2005), implanted PGS and PLGA conduits had similar early tissue responses; however, PLGA inflammatory responses spiked later, while PGS inflammatory responses continued to decreases.|$|E

40|$|Degraded {{clear and}} {{pigmented}} epoxy coatings were investigated by dielectric sorption analysis (DSA). Differences in dynamics of absorption, {{due to increased}} hydrophilicity, crosslinking and porosity, were found between UV degraded and undegraded epoxy coatings. Desorption was observed for longer <b>degradation</b> <b>times,</b> caused by swelling of the coating, squeezing out the excess of water. Model system measurements of pigmented coatings with various filters on top reproduced the desorption behaviour. Due to crack formation during DSA measurements, clear coatings showed fluctuating results, a result of release of tension of the UV degraded clear coating by humidified nitrogen. Pigmented coatings did not show this behaviour, resulting in an increasing water absorption trend with increasing <b>degradation</b> <b>times.</b> Larger desorption peaks were found for lower frequencies, indicating that either polarization takes place or water-hydrophilic interaction. Based on these results, DSA is suitable for non-destructive investigation of degraded coatings and paints. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the mechanical behaviour of a bioresorbable polymeric coronary scaffold using finite element method, focusing on scaffold-artery interaction during degradation and vessel remodelling. A series of nonlinear stress-strain responses was constructed to match the experimental measurement of radial stiffness and strength for polymeric scaffolds over 2 -year in-vitro <b>degradation</b> <b>times.</b> <b>Degradation</b> process was modelled by incorporating the change of material property {{as a function of}} time. Vessel remodelling was realised by changing the size of artery-plaque system manually, according to the clinical data in literature. Over <b>degradation</b> <b>times,</b> stress on the scaffold tended to increase firstly and then decreased gradually, corresponding to the changing yield stress of the scaffold material; whereas the stress on the plaque and arterial layers showed a continuous decrease. In addition, stress reduction was also observed for scaffold, plaque and artery in the simulations with the consideration of vessel remodelling. For the first time, the work offered insights into mechanical interaction between a bioresorbable scaffold and blood vessel during two-year in-vitro degradation, which has significance in assisting with further development of bioresorbable implants for treating cardiovascular diseases...|$|R

5000|$|During the {{synthesis}} of acetalated dextran both acyclic and cyclic acetals are formed. The acyclic acetals degrade into an acetone and an alcohol, whereas cyclic acetals degrade into acetone. The ratio of cyclic to acyclic acetals varies with reaction time since acyclic acetals are kinetically favored and cyclic acetals are the thermodynamically favored. This unique formation of cyclic and acyclic acetals leads to varying <b>degradation</b> <b>time</b> because the two acetal groups hydrolyze at different rates. Acetlated dextran's <b>degradation</b> <b>time</b> can vary from hours to {{a month or more}} at pH 7.2. Also, acetalated dextran is unique because it is acid sensitive. Therefore, at lower pH acetalated dextran degrades more rapidly, which results in a polymer that degrades approximately two logs faster at pH 5 compared to pH 7.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of the enzymatic reaction, the two {{substrates}} (reactants) are again acetic ester and H2O, the two products of the reaction are alcohol and acetate. This reaction is exactly the same as the chemical hydrolysis. Both of these products are perfectly fine in the environment. Once the acetate group is removed from the cellulose chain, the polymer can be readily degraded by cellulase, which is another enzyme found in fungi, bacteria, and protozoans. Cellulases break down the cellulose molecule into monosaccharides ("simple sugars") such as beta-glucose, or shorter polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. These simple sugars are not harmful to the environment and are in fact are a useful product for many plants and animals. The breakdown of cellulose is of interest in the field of biofuel.

50|$|Magnesium is a {{relatively}} new biomaterial that has recently been gaining traction. While degrading harmlessly, it has been shown to possess a functional <b>degradation</b> <b>time</b> of about 30 days in vivo. This is much short of the three-to-six month window desired for bioabsorbable stents. Thus, much attention has been given to drastically reducing the rate of magnesium corrosion by alloying, coating, etc. Many novel methods have surfaced to minimize the penetration rate and hydrogen evolution rate (or, in layman's terms, the corrosion rate). One of the most successful has involved the creation of bioabsorbable metallic glasses via rapid solidification. Other, alternative solutions have included the development of magnesium-rare-earth (Mg-RE) alloys, which benefit from the low cytotoxicity of RE elements. Coatings and sophisticated materials processing routes are currently being developed to further decrease the corrosion rate. However a number of issues remain limiting the further development of Mg biomaterials in general.|$|E

In this study, stereocomplexation and photopolymerization are combined to yield rapidly in situ forming robust hydrogels. Two types of methacrylate-functionalized PEG−PLLA and PEG−PDLA star block copolymers, PEG−PLLA−MA and PEG−PDLA−MA, which have methacrylate groups at the PLA chain ends and PEG−MA/PLLA and PEG−MA/PDLA, which have methacrylate groups at the PEG chain ends, were designed and prepared. Results showed that stereocomplexed hydrogels could be rapidly formed (within 1 − 2 min) in a polymer concentration range of 12. 5 − 17. 5 % (w/v), in which the methacrylate group hardly interfered with the stereocomplexation. When subsequently photopolymerized, these hydrogels showed largely increased storage moduli as compared to the corresponding hydrogels that were cross-linked by stereocomplexation or photopolymerization only. Interestingly, the storage modulus of stereocomplexed−photopolymerized PEG−PLA−MA hydrogels increased linearly with increasing stereocomplexation equilibration time prior to photopolymerization (from ca. 6 to 32 kPa), indicating that stereocomplexation aids in photopolymerization. Importantly, photopolymerization of stereocomplexed hydrogels could take place at very low initiator concentrations (0. 003 wt %). Swelling/degradation studies showed that combining stereocomplexation and photopolymerization yielded hydrogels with prolonged <b>degradation</b> <b>times</b> as compared to corresponding hydrogels cross-linked by photopolymerization only (3 vs 1. 5 weeks).

However, these studies did not {{examine the effect of}} individual differences between the same kinds of food. Here we elucidate whether luminance distribution would continue to {{have a significant effect on}} visual freshness perception even if visual stimuli included individual differences in addition to the degradation process of foods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We took pictures of the degradation of three fishes over 3. 29 hours in a controlled environment, then cropped square patches of their eyes from the original images as visual stimuli. Eleven participants performed paired comparison tests judging the visual freshness of the fish eyes at three points of degradation. Perceived freshness scores (PFS) were calculated using the Bradley-Terry Model for each image. The ANOVA revealed that the PFS for each fish decreased as the <b>degradation</b> <b>time</b> increased; however, the differences in the PFS between individual fish was larger for the shorter <b>degradation</b> <b>time,</b> and smaller for the longer <b>degradation</b> <b>time.</b> A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted in order to determine the relative importance of the statistics of luminance distribution of the stimulus images in predicting PFS.
