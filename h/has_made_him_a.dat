25|$|Jones hosts {{a popular}} Sydney breakfast radio program, on radio station 2GB. Jones advocates mainly {{conservative}} views, and {{the popularity of}} his radio program <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> highly paid and influential media personality in Australia. Despite his success, he remains a controversial figure. His on-air conduct has received adverse findings from Australia's media regulators, and he has frequently been sued for defamation.|$|E

25|$|Jones' {{program has}} {{remained}} little changed over time, as {{a mixture of}} opinion pieces, interviews, talkback, and commercial endorsements.

Jones uses his program to advocate largely conservative views, {{and he has been}} described {{as one of the most}} influential broadcasters in Australia. Throughout his time on radio Jones has frequently been referred to as a 'shock jock' due to the style of his presentation, although he personally rejects this term.|$|E

25|$|Mathews {{began his}} {{international}} career in late 2008 with ambitions {{of becoming a}} genuine allrounder, but has since given primacy to his batting (to diminish his workload and avoid injuries), and effectively plays as a specialist batsman in the Test side. However, for {{the balance of the}} team, he still plays as a batting allrounder in the limited overs cricket. A more than useful strike rate of 84.06 <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> damaging prospect in the final overs of the Sri Lankan innings.|$|E
25|$|Nineteen-year-old Margaret Hale happily {{returns home}} from London to the idyllic {{southern}} village of Helstone after her cousin Edith marries Captain Lennox. She lived for almost 10 {{years in the}} city with Edith and wealthy Aunt Shaw {{to learn to be}} a young lady. Margaret has refused an offer of marriage from the captain's brother, Henry, an up-and-comng barrister. Her life is turned upside down when her father, the local pastor, leaves the Church of England and the rectory of Helstone as a matter of conscience; his intellectual honesty <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> dissenter. At the suggestion of Mr. Bell, his old friend from Oxford, he settles with his wife and daughter in Milton-Northern (where Mr. Bell was born and owns property). The industrial town in Darkshire (a textile-producing region) manufactures cotton and {{is in the middle of}} the Industrial Revolution; masters and workers are clashing in the first organised strikes.|$|E
25|$|Hopper's {{cinematic}} compositions {{and dramatic}} use {{of light and}} dark <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> favorite among filmmakers. For example, House by the Railroad is reported to have heavily influenced the iconic house in the Alfred Hitchcock film Psycho. The same painting has also been cited as being an influence on the home in the Terrence Malick film Days of Heaven. The 1981 film Pennies from Heaven includes a tableau vivant of Nighthawks, with the lead actors in the places of the diners. German director Wim Wenders also cites Hopper influence. His 1997 film The End of Violence also incorporates a tableau vivant of Nighthawks, recreated by actors. Noted surrealist horror film director Dario Argento {{went so far as to}} recreate the diner and the patrons in Nighthawks as part of a set for his 1976 film Deep Red (aka Profondo Rosso). Ridley Scott has cited the same painting as a visual inspiration for Blade Runner. To establish the lighting of scenes in the 2002 film Road to Perdition, director Sam Mendes drew from the paintings of Hopper as a source of inspiration, particularly New York Movie.|$|E

500|$|Teammate Aaron Mauger, {{along with}} many New Zealand fans, have {{suggested}} that McCaw's influence and playing style <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> target for illegitimate play. International players Phil Waugh, Jamie Heaslip, Marcus Horan, Lote Tuqiri, Andy Powell, Dylan Hartley, Quade Cooper, Dean Greyling, Kevin McLaughlin and Scott Higginbotham {{have been accused of}} making [...] "cheap shots" [...] on McCaw. He has even been on the receiving end from his All Black teammates when playing for the Crusaders, with Neemia Tialata, Jerry Collins and Ali Williams becoming frustrated with his play. According to McCaw [...] "what happens on the field stays on the field" [...] and if he gets extra attention it is because he [...] "must be doing something right".|$|E
500|$|The wealth Zahir {{accumulated}} through monopolizing Palestine's {{cotton and}} olive oil trade to Europe financed his sheikhdom. For much of his rule, he oversaw a relatively efficient administration and maintained domestic security, although he faced and suppressed several rebellions by his sons. The aforementioned factors, along with Zahir's flexible taxation policies and his battlefield reputation made him popular among the local peasantry. Zahir's tolerance of religious minorities encouraged Christian and Jewish immigration to his domain. The influx of immigrants {{from other parts of}} the empire stimulated the local economy and led to the significant growth of the Christian communities in Acre and Nazareth and the Jewish community in Tiberias. He and his family, the Zaydani clan, also patronized the [...] construction of commercial buildings, houses of worship and fortifications throughout Galilee. Zahir's founding of a virtually autonomous state in Palestine <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> national hero among Palestinians today.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{the death}} of PedroI, the then-powerful Restorationist Party {{vanished}} overnight. A fair assessment of the former monarch became possible once the threat of his return to power was removed. Evaristo da Veiga, one of his worst critics {{as well as a}} leader in the Liberal Party, left a statement which, according to historian Otávio Tarquínio de Sousa, became the prevailing view thereafter: [...] "the former emperor of Brazil was not a prince of ordinary measure... and Providence <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> powerful instrument of liberation, both in Brazil and in Portugal. If we [...] exist as a body in a free Nation, if our land was not ripped apart into small enemy republics, where only anarchy and military spirit predominated, we owe much to the resolution he took in remaining among us, in making the first shout for our Independence." [...] He continued: [...] "Portugal, if it was freed from the darkest and demeaning tyranny ... if it enjoys the benefits brought by representative government to learned peoples, it owes it to D. Pedro de Alcântara, whose fatigues, sufferings and sacrifices for the Portuguese cause has earned him in high degree the tribute of national gratitude." ...|$|E
500|$|By early 1980, The Cockroaches {{began writing}} their own music {{as well as}} {{covering}} various 1960s rock 'n' roll artists, especially The Rolling Stones. In July 1980, they issued their debut single, [...] "I Want a Leather Jacket", on the Refugee Records label. The song was written by Paul, was produced by Greg Owens and the band, and was recorded at their school and at Studio B in Bondi. According to Australian musicologist, Glenn A. Baker, the track provided [...] "the aura of a rockabilly band... {{they have always been}} much closer in style to the original cocky, bluesy, strident Stones". When they recorded their second single, [...] "Bingo Bango" [...] in June 1981, Hatfield had been replaced by Geoff O'Reagan on bass guitar. This song was written by John and Anthony, was produced by Owens and was recorded at Wirra-Willa Studios. By August of that year Jeff Fatt had joined on keyboards and Phil Robinson became their bass guitarist. According to Anthony, Fatt {{had been a member of}} [...] "a seminal Sydney rockabilly band called the Roadmasters", and had joined [...] "to fight boredom". They had hired Fatt and his brother to manage their sound system during gigs. Anthony declared this began [...] "a beautiful three-decade relationship that <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> very wealthy man".
