The manufacturing hands were to be seduced from their looms by high wages, in order to prepare a raw produce for our market; {{they were to be}} locked up in the factories; and the commodity acquired by these operations was, in this immature state, carried out of the country, whilst its looms would be left without any material but the debased refuse of a market enhanced in its price and scanted in its supply.

6000|$|I {{was delighted}} to hear the Leader of the Opposition say, in a concise and cogent sentence, that he could easily {{conceive}} many sweated trades in which the wages of the workers could be substantially raised without any other change except a diminution of price. Sir, the wages of a sweated worker bear no accurate relation to the ultimate price. Sometimes they vary in the same places for the same work done at the same time. And sometimes the worst sweating forms {{a part of the}} production of articles of luxury sold at the very highest price. We believe further, however, that decent conditions make for industrial efficiency and increase rather than diminish competitive power. [...] "General low wages," [...] said Mill, [...] "never caused any country to undersell its rivals; nor did general high wages ever hinder it." [...] The employers who now pay the best wages in these sweated trades maintain themselves not only against the comparatively small element of foreign competition in these trades, but against what is a far more formidable competition for this purpose--the competition of those employers who habitually undercut them by the worst processes of sweating. I cannot believe that the process of raising the degenerate and parasitical portion of these trades up {{to the level of the}} most efficient branches of the trade, if it is conducted by those conversant with the conditions of the trade and interested in it, will necessarily result in an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of the ultimate product.

5000|$|According to , {{the ending}} of the FBPA in the UK (1995) did not lead to a sharp {{decrease}} of the number of bookshops, rather to a displacement of small, independent bookshops by big-chain outlets. He notices however that the former stayed in place where a quality-sensitive demand existed, and that competition between bookshops spurred a reduction of operational costs thanks to better logistics and collection management (an argument also found in [...] ). In a counterfactual manner, [...] shows that in France, the FBP helped to maintain a dense network of independent bookshops, reined in the deployment of chain bookstores and spurred supermarkets to boost their offer of books. Fishwick also shows that while the number of published titles increases as fast as in France, {{there is no sign of}} an overall increase of book prices. He shows however that this stability hides a strong distributive effect. Comparison with France show that the FBP leads to an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of bestsellers relative to non-FBP markets and a decrease of low-selling or long-selling books. He argues that the assessment of this effect is difficult, since the relation between the (un)popularity of a book and its cultural value is unclear, whereas consumers of low-selling books are, on average, wealthier than consumers of bestsellers (making a FBP a subsidy of wealthier people by poorer people).|$|E

Only about one fifth of pre-schools and elementary schools have already experienced the involvement of organic food in the school meals preparation. Some of them are not interested in organic food but most of them fear the strong increase of the school meal’s price when using ingredients originated from organic farming.
