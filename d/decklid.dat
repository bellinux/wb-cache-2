25|$|Key {{among the}} {{changes for the}} car {{included}} a carbon fibre hood and <b>decklid,</b> shaving 160 pounds from Sprint Cup cars, and new improved safety bars added to the roll cage. The roof flaps were increased in size to prevent the airborne accidents that marked the CoT's early life.|$|E
25|$|Neon lamp tubes were {{introduced}} into series production for the centre high-mount stop lamp on the 1995 Ford Explorer. Notable later uses included the 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII with a neon tube spanning {{the width of}} the trunk <b>decklid,</b> and the BMW Z8, which made extensive use of neon. Concept cars such as those from Volvo have included neon lamp features. Hella offered an aftermarket neon CHMSL in the late 1990s.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 Roadmaster had a {{shallower}} Sweepspear {{that did}} not dip {{all the way to}} the rocker panel as on other models. Twin chrome strips graced the <b>decklid</b> with Roadmaster spelled out between them. Roadmaster script now appeared on the doors beneath the vent windows. Fender tip dual bombsights were standard. Two stator wheels were adopted as an improvement to Dynaflow. A brand new 4-door Riviera hardtop, proved to be the most popular Roadmaster, with 24,770 units sold and outselling the pillared sedan by more than two-to-one. Overall sales were 53,500. A padded dash became standard.|$|E
50|$|One {{benefit of}} {{clinching}} is {{the capability to}} join prepainted sheet metal commonly used in the appliance industry without damaging the painted surface. Clinching is an important means of fastening aluminum panels, such as hoods and <b>decklids,</b> in the automotive industry, due {{to the difficulty of}} spot welding of aluminum.|$|R
5000|$|The same model lineup continued, with a {{revision}} of both the front grille and taillight lenses. A diesel version of the Oldsmobile 260 (based on the Olds 350 diesel) was optional; diesel Cutlasses had the [...] "Oldsmobile Diesel" [...] badges on the <b>decklids,</b> where gasoline-powered Cutlasses had the [...] "Rocket" [...] logo.|$|R
5000|$|After {{three years}} of production, an update for 2009 models was made. This {{included}} moving the <b>decklids</b> [...] "CHARGER" [...] badge from the left to the right, making way for [...] "DODGE" [...] at the left. Tail lamps were also revised. 2008 models had seen minor revisions to the interior (a new center console and switchgear changes).|$|R
25|$|The AMC Cavalier {{was unique}} in that the vehicle was a study in symmetry. It was built to {{demonstrate}} the use of numerous interchangeable body panels. For example, the fenders were identical (the opposite ends, e.g. left front and right rear). The doors were similarly shared with opposite sides (an idea originated by Cord on its prototype 935 Saloon) since the rear doors were hinged in the back (suicide door). The hood and <b>decklid</b> were also interchangeable. The Nash Metropolitan, which was sold by AMC up to 1962, also had interchangeable inner panels, but their outer skins were different. In addition to reducing tooling costs by thirty percent, the design objective of the AMC Cavalier was also to demonstrate how to reduce the costs of production.|$|E
25|$|The G20 {{was first}} {{unveiled}} to Infiniti dealers at the 1989 New York International Auto Show (appearing {{to the public}} at the 1990 show), with the first series production example being assembled on July 10, 1990. The final 1996 G20 was rolled off the assembly line on July 19, 1996. The P10 featured the first application of Nissan's multi-link front suspension in a front-wheel-drive car, with an independent MacPherson strut setup in the rear. It came standard with a 5-speed manual transmission. The only options to begin with were an automatic transmission, leather interior, and a power glass moonroof; a Touring package (labeled G20t) was introduced in 1994 and featured a black leather interior with sport front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats, as well as a limited-slip differential in the transmission and a spoiler on the rear <b>decklid.</b>|$|E
25|$|Introduced at the 1993 New York Auto Show, {{the main}} {{changes for the}} P10 came as a midyear refresh in April 1993 (model year 1993.5), when dual airbags {{replaced}} motorized seatbelts, leather interiors came standard with power front seats, matte-black side moldings were replaced by body-colored ones, the refrigerant was converted from R12 to R134a, the audio system was upgraded to six speakers with a CD player instead of the previously-standard cassette deck, and other new options such as remote keyless entry were added. In February 1994, the 1994 model year was given a new larger chrome-plated grille and door handles, a lowport engine (replacing the original highport SR20DE, in which the intake plenum is below the fuel injectors and fuel rail), {{a change in the}} vehicle's self-diagnostic system to OBD-II, and larger 195/65R14 tires. The Touring models, introduced in February 1994, featured a limited-slip differential in the transmission; 195/65R14 Yokohama tires, sportier, more highly bolstered black leather front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats; fog lights; and a spoiler on the rear <b>decklid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 880 and Custom 880 {{received}} their most significant and final redesign of the 1960 body for 1964. This time, the rear body contours were squared up somewhat, with new <b>decklids,</b> wraparound rectangular taillights, and new quarter panels. Four-door models received a new roofline, although this {{was actually the}} same as had been used on the Chrysler New Yorker until 1962. Regardless, it did impart a fresh appearance. The grille was also updated, this time featuring a concave design with a central horizontal break spanning {{the distance between the}} headlights.|$|R
5000|$|Around mid-1955, dealers began {{complaining}} that consumers were lukewarm to the cars {{because they were}} true Packards and demanded that the Packard name appear somewhere on the cars. Nance refused at first, feeling that placing the Packard name on the cars would undo his plan to save the Packard name for luxury automobiles. However, when dealers began defecting to Mercury franchises, Nance gave in, fearful that the shrinking number of dealers would harm the company {{more than just the}} Packard marque. A small [...] "Packard" [...] script emblems began to be placed on the <b>decklids</b> of newly built Clippers. In a complete reversal of Nance's strategy, the emblems were also made available for placement on already-built cars that were languishing on dealers' lots.|$|R
5000|$|... 1999: For the {{beginning}} of this model year, the DOHC 3.5 L [...] "Shortstar" [...] engine was standard in the top-line GLS and optional on mid-level GL and base GX models. Early GLS models could be ordered with the 3.8L instead of the standard (for GLS) 3.5 L, but later on the 3.8 L was phased out and the 3.5 L became standard on all models. <b>Decklids</b> now wore a small Oldsmobile badge. In the previous model year, there was a complaint that some people couldn't tell that Intrigues were Oldsmobiles. If you look closely, you can read 'Oldsmobile' molded in the backup light lens in the taillight housing on all model years. All models now got a thicker, leather-wrapped steering wheel. New to the option list was GM's OnStar emergency/communications system. Integrated rear radio antenna was standard this year and after.|$|R
25|$|The car {{now has the}} {{addition}} of the Advanced Aerodynamic Package (two-piece front corner splitters and a rear <b>decklid</b> spoiler made from carbon fiber), lightweight Sidewinder II wheels finished in matte-black, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires, two-mode (Street and Race) Bilstein DampTronic suspension adapted from the GTS, but with firmer levels of damping and a smaller spread between modes, shock dampers, increased spring rates and thicker anti-roll bars, carbon fiber underhood X-brace (instead of the aluminium brace in all other models), carbon fiber rear tail light applique from the Exterior Carbon Fiber Accent Package, two-piece Brembo brake rotors with wider brake annulus, black-anodized Brembo brake calipers painted with the Viper logo in TA Orange, TA logos behind both front wheels and a Stryker decal instead of the standard badge on the hood (TA Orange on the Venom Black cars, black on the TA Orange and Venom White cars), black interior with TA Orange accent stitching on the ballistic cloth seats, instrument panel & cowl, center stack, console, hand brake, shifter boot, and door panels. The aerodynamic package adds 200 pounds (90.72kg) of downforce at 100mph (160.93km/h). Top speed is 193mph (310.60km/h) instead of the non-aerodynamics package cars' 206mph (331.52km/h). The car's mileage is 12 mpg in city, and 19 mpg in highway.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 Ford Mustang GT from Shelby was {{previously}} only offered {{in a white}} exterior color with Guardsman Blue Le Mans racing stripes running {{the length of the}} vehicle, but 2012 will see two new colors in Race Red with white LeMans stripes and Kona Blue with white LeMans stripes. These paint schemes are unique because they are not Factory paint jobs from Ford. The convertible will offer a new optional light bar with other options including a one-piece drive shaft and color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. The extensive body kit includes a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and <b>decklid.</b> New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced. The 2012 Shelby GT350 will deliver the same performance numbers as the 2011 model with a 5.0L V8 delivering 430 hp normally aspirated, 525 hp supercharged, or 624 hp supercharged version. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system have really allowed this V8 to take {{on a life of its}} own. An automatic transmission is optional with the normally aspirated engine, but some will go towards the short throw shifter manual transmission because they actually enjoy to drive. Keeping the powerful engine under control will be an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang reduced body roll and more variability to create custom track setups. Custom ERADISPEED rear rotors in conjunction with Bear 6-piston brakes.|$|E
2500|$|Exterior changes {{included}} a new grille, wrap-around taillights, <b>decklid,</b> {{as well as}} trim and ornamentation. The front and rear track was increased from [...] to , but all other dimensions remained the same.|$|E
5000|$|After this trial, {{the first}} order was for 61 cars {{finished}} in silver and ten unmarked cars in various colors. Due to further cost-cutting reasons they were base model Javelins with heavy-duty [...] "fleet" [...] equipment, [...] "machine wheels" [...] with Goodyear Polyglas raised-white-lettered tires, and a rear spoiler (normally available only on a Javelin AMX model) to display the [...] "State Trooper" [...] markings on the rear of each car. A '401' emblem covered {{the holes in the}} spoiler to replace the AMX emblem. During 1972, a total of 62 Javelins were ordered: 12 in all silver paint, 42 were finished with the hoods, <b>decklids,</b> and spoilers in blue over silver body as the new police car scheme, as well as eight were unmarked cars in various colors. The 1972 models were only available from AMC as [...] "SST" [...] versions and included additional exterior and interior trim. The 1972 versions were delivered by Reinhardt AMC and also by Bill Whitten AMC/Datsun in Birmingham.|$|R
500|$|MY11: {{revisions}} to the styling identify this update, marketed by Holden as the [...] "Series II". Announced on 31 August 2010, and launched on 10 September, MY11 heralded styling changes across the range by way of new front fascias, the addition of aerodynamic lip detailing to the <b>decklids</b> of sedans, and new alloy wheel designs on the Berlina specification and higher. Front-end changes comprise partially reshaped headlamps, redesigned bumpers, and an enlarged grille with restyled inserts that differ throughout the model range. Inside, the interiors receive a redesigned centre console stack incorporating a new 6.5-inch touchscreen, new dashboard, rearranged controls, reconfigured ventilation outlets, and updates to trimmings and illumination colours. SV6, SS and SS V interiors are differentiated via the application of circular air vents. Standard on all models is the 6.5-inch infotainment system developed primarily by Siemens VDO. Dubbed [...] "Holden-iQ", this integrates media playback and control functions. The iQ head unit replaces the previous mechanical CD stacker with a single slot and built in storage for approximately 15 CDs worth of music (internal storage optional on the Omega). The system also features full iPod integration, USB and auxiliary input, and incorporates Bluetooth handsfree telephone compatibility and music streaming. On V-Series specifications, iQ incorporates satellite navigation with live traffic updates, speed zone alerts and traffic camera notification. Sedans and wagons specified with navigation also receive a reversing camera.In terms of powertrain, the MY11 brought flex-fuel capability for the 3.0-litre V6 and 6.0-litre V8, allowing them to run on E85 bio-ethanol (see above). With the MY11 update, Holden also introduced a new [...] "Redline" [...] sports package as an option on V-Series models. The package includes lightweight, forged and polished 19-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels from the Pontiac G8 GXP. Other Redline additions encompass four-piston Brembo high-performance brakes, stiffer [...] "FE3" [...] suspension and chromed window surrounds for sedans, and the fitment of the tyre inflater kit on the Redline Ute.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standard}} 3.1L V6, {{installed in}} SE models, gained 15 horsepower (now 175). New standard equipment included rear child-seat anchors and an anti-theft system that disabled the starter unless the proper ignition key was used. Pontiac also launched a Daytona 500 pace-car replica, with silver paint, unique [...] aluminum wheels, functional hood vents, a NASCAR-inspired <b>decklid</b> spoiler, polished quad exhaust tips, and Daytona decals. Only 2,000 were planned.|$|E
2500|$|Hydraulically-assisted (electric for North American market) {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} gives for a [...] turning circle. Braking-wise, ventilated front, and solid rear disc brakes are employed, both using piston steel calipers. To counteract noise, vibration, and harshness, engineers have designed the Cruze with an isolated four-point engine mount and implemented sound damping material in areas including the front-of-dashboard panel, luggage compartment, <b>decklid</b> internals, doors, carpet and headlining. Further noise suppression {{through the use of a}} triple-layer sealing system in the doors has also been employed.|$|E
2500|$|The SRT Viper GTS {{includes}} leather upholstery, accented {{colors in}} seats, doors, center console and stitching; gun metal trim on the cluster bezel, HVAC outlets, window switch bezels, shifter base, park brake bezel and the integrated passenger grab {{handle on the}} center console; Sabelt racing seats with Kevlar and fiberglass shell, carbon-fiber hood, roof, <b>decklid</b> and aluminum door panels, split six-spoke forged aluminum [...] "Venom" [...] wheels with polished face and graphite-painted pockets (standard), fully painted Hyper Black or fully painted low-gloss black finishes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main feature}} was the Marlin's {{fastback}} roof with [...] "stylish elliptical C-pillars that ended [...] "between two stubby, squared-off fins" [...] in the rear. The <b>decklid</b> {{was the same}} as on the previous model, but now without the large round insignia. A bigger back window improved rear visibility. New taillights were similar to those on the first-generation car. The rear bumper was slightly different from the one used on the Ambassador and Rebel station wagons, the top edge being a continuous horizontal line that fits up against the body.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} AMX full-scale {{models were}} developed in 1965 by AMC's advanced styling studios {{under the direction of}} Charles Mashigan. The two-seat AMX was [...] "big hit on the auto show circuit in 1966" [...] and featured a rumble seat that opened out from the rear <b>decklid</b> for extra passengers called a [...] "Ramble" [...] seat. AMC executives saw the opportunity to change the consumers' perception of the automaker from Romney's economy car image, to the realities of the new marketplace interested in sporty, performance oriented vehicles. Robert B. Evans requested a car like the AMX to be put into production quickly.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the entry}} into {{production}} of the [...] "unibody" [...] Citroën Traction Avant in 1934 using Budd technology, Budd worked in 1940 with Nash Motors on the development and production of North America's first mass-produced unibody passenger vehicle, the Nash 600. In the mid-1980s, Budd's Plastics Division introduced sheet moulding compound, a reinforced plastic in sheet form, suitable for stamping out body panels {{in much the same}} way, and as quickly, as sheet metal equivalents are made. Pontiac Fiero has some exterior SMC body parts manufactured by Budd Plastics - such as the quarter panels, roof skin, headlamp covers, and trunk <b>decklid.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In late 1999, several {{noteworthy}} {{changes for}} the P11 came as a refresh in the 2000 model year, when the 145 crank horsepower roller rocker variant of the SR20DE engine was implemented, newer automatic and manual transmission variations were introduced, anti-theft immobilizer circuitry was added, anti-glare side mirrors became standard, and a remote trunk release {{was added to the}} keyless entry fob. In 2001, the G20t was dropped and a Sport model was introduced. In addition to the prior G20t's limited slip differential and <b>decklid</b> spoiler, this model featured two-tone leather/suede sport seats, 16" [...] wheels, and a variety of minor cosmetic modifications. The 2002 base G20 received the 12-spoke Touring alloy wheels as standard.|$|E
2500|$|Shelby {{along with}} Paxton also {{designed}} a new variant {{based on the}} V6 Mustang. Modifications include a supercharged motor producing 350 horsepower (260kW). 20" [...] wheels bearing the Shelby name and the Cobra moniker on each side and the <b>decklid.</b> The 2" [...] drop in suspension, Baer/Shelby 14-inch front and rear brakes and aggressive front fascia along with a dual exhaust. Shelby also created the CS8, a 4.6-liter V8 variant of the CS6. The Shelby CS6/8 was not available as a factory release. However, Shelby had made the CS6/8 kit available for purchase. But then the contract with Hertz GT-H came, and {{only a handful of}} CS6/8' were built, making them one of the rarest cars ever built by Shelby.|$|E
2500|$|The current NYPD vehicle {{appearance}} is an all-white vehicle body with two blue stripes along {{each side of}} the car. The word [...] "POLICE" [...] is printed in small text above the front wheel wells, and as [...] "NYPD Police" [...] above the grille opening. The NYPD shoulder patch is printed on both sides {{just in front of the}} front doors or on the front doors. The letters [...] "NYPD" [...] are printed in blue Rockwell Extra Bold font on the front doors, and the NYPD motto [...] "Courtesy, Professionalism, Respect" [...] is printed on the rear doors. The unit's shop number is printed on the rear <b>decklid.</b> The shop number is also printed on the rear side panels above the gas intake, along with the number of the unit's assigned precinct.|$|E
2500|$|The Torino GT came {{standard}} with non-functional hood scoop molded {{into the}} hood, GT emblems (including {{the centre of}} the grille), dual colour-keyed sport mirrors, full width tail lights with a honeycomb effect (the centre portion was non-functional but reflective), black <b>decklid</b> appliques (SportsRoof only), and hub caps with wheel trim rings. Standard tires for the GT were E70-14 fibreglass belted tires, while convertibles wore F70-14s. New options for the Torino GT were a reflective laser stripe, which ran {{down the middle of the}} side of the Torino from the front fender to the door, and Hideaway headlamps. [...] Motor Trend magazine tested a 1970 Torino GT SportsRoof with a 429 CJ, C-6 Automatic, and 3.50:1 gears, and obtained a 0 - [...] time of 6.0 seconds, while the quarter mile took 14.4 seconds at [...]|$|E
2500|$|Italdesign Giugiaro {{began the}} first design {{drawings}} of the GS 300 in 1988. The design firm aimed to produce a deluxe saloon which did without the numerous exterior features and detailing found on existing Japanese premium sedans, {{in favor of a}} more simplified, European-style appearance. The vehicle's exterior styling blended elements of the then-current Lexus LS flagship and SC performance coupe in a rounded, aerodynamic wedge-like shape which featured a high rear <b>decklid</b> and longer and wider proportions than rival vehicles. The exterior produced a [...] The offered color schemes included single-tone bumper and body finishes, along with dual-tone schemes. Similarities with an Italdesign concept car which debuted in 1990, the Jaguar Kensington, led some observers to suggest that the GS 300 was derived from its design, but the firm has stated that the GS 300 was developed earlier. Equipped with an independent, double-wishbone suspension setup at both front and rear ends, Italdesign's saloon design first appeared in Toyota Aristo form in Japan in October 1991.|$|E
2500|$|The steel Italian cars {{differed}} from the original AMC design in having fewer but functional rear <b>decklid</b> louvers, louvered hoods, and, in some cases, hood scoops to direct fresh air into the heating-A/C system. Further engineering improvements and road testing was done by BMW, which declared the AMX/3's chassis one of the stiffest having a 50% higher stiffness compared to a benchmark Mercedes-Benz model. The car's steel semi-monocoque chassis design with its welded on steel body provided a strong overall structure while the top speed was only verified to , [...] with reports indicating the AMX/3 could go faster {{if it was not}} for the tendency for the font end to lift at those speeds, but BMW found the car to be most neutral handling they had ever tested. The BMW engineers also refined numerous components of the AMX/3 into [...] "a world-class contender among the mid-engined super car elite of its time." ...|$|E
2500|$|A new sports-oriented model, the AMX, was {{introduced}} to appeal to young, performance-oriented car buyers. The AMX was available only as a hatchback with the six or the V8 engine (automatic only) featuring a floor-shifted four-speed manual or automatic transmission. Standard was an upgraded black or tan interior with a floor console, [...] "rally" [...] instrumentation with tachometer, and [...] "soft-feel" [...] sports steering wheel. The special [...] "Hornet AMX" [...] was only available in four exterior colors that included matching painted bumpers with a wraparound rubber guard strip, body side rubber guard strip and contrasting AMX model identification bodyside decals ahead of the rear wheels. The exterior included a front spoiler integrated into the front lower fender extensions, rear lower fender flares, sport-styled road wheels, brushed aluminum [...] "Targa top" [...] band over the B-pillars and roof, black left and right outside mirrors, and louvers for the rear hatch window. Options included bright aluminum road wheels and large Hornet-graphic decals on the hood and on the <b>decklid.</b> This model marked the return of a famous name that evoked AMC's original AMX two-seat sports car.|$|E
2500|$|For the US market, two limited {{production}} GTV-6 models stand out. The Balocco (named {{after the}} famous Balocco test track in Italy) appeared in 1982 with a production run of only 350 cars. The Balocco was {{available only in}} red with sunroof and black interior, leather-wrapped steering wheel and red piping on the seats. There were also two green Quadrifoglio badges fixed on the rear quarter trim pieces above a badge with the [...] "Balocco SE" [...] designation. A plaque inset in the glove box door designated {{the number of the}} car out of the series of 350 (XXX of 350). Later there was the GTV6 2.5 Maratona, of which only 150 were built. The Maratona model included a more aggressive aerodynamic trim package, lightweight Speedline wheels, clear engine view port, sunroof, wood steering wheel and shift knob, rear louvers and Carello fog lamps. All 150 cars were available only painted silver and with a black leather interior; and came with [...] "Maratona" [...] badging on the rear <b>decklid,</b> front fenders and glove box door. (The most notable feature of the Maratona, its aerodynamic kit, was also available as a dealer-installed option on other GTV-6 models.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The G20 was a badge-engineered {{version of}} the Nissan Primera, but because Infiniti was pitched as a premium brand, it {{featured}} {{a high level of}} equipment compared to its European and Japanese relatives. The only engine available was the 2.0litre SR20DE Inline 4-cylinder; in Europe this was the top-of-the-line engine for the Primera lineup. 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmissions were both available, with the 5-speed being praised as [...] "one {{of the best in the}} business." [...] Power windows, power locks, power mirrors, air conditioning, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, alloy wheels, a Bose stereo, a theft-deterrent system, cruise control, floor mats, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift knob were all standard. Heated mirrors, leather seats and a power moonroof were common options, and were later offered in a package that included power seats and keyless entry. Later models also featured dual front airbags. The standard trim was called Luxury. Two major trim package upgrades were offered: Touring, badged G20t, available from model years 1994 to 1996 and 1999 to 2001, and Sport (with no badge modification) which was offered during model year 2002. These packages featured a limited-slip differential in the transmission, sportier, more highly bolstered front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats, all-black leather interior, fog lamps, and a spoiler on the rear <b>decklid.</b> The details of these trims varied from year to year.|$|E
2500|$|Released in June 1999, the HSV Grange (WH) {{received}} {{modifications to}} the Statesman's specification (Statesman VINs begin with [...] "6H8WHY", whereas the VIN of a Caprice is [...] "6H8WHZ"; the Grange shares the [...] "Y" [...] digit in its VIN with Statesman). Again, the Grange was finished by HSV in Clayton, Victoria. It was available with the 3.8-litre supercharged V6 and 5.7-litre V8 engines. The WH Grange had HSV's [...] "Prestige" [...] suspension tune, specially-developed Monroe Sensatrac shock absorbers, a front anti-roll bar, a rear anti-roll bar and a self-levelling function for the rear suspension (shared with Caprice). Standard features for the WH Grange included 18-inch ten-spoke alloy wheels, a 260-watt sound system with ten speakers and a six-disc CD changer, climate control air conditioning, eight-way power adjustable front seats, leather upholstery, cruise control, front fog lights, leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, remote central locking, power windows and mirrors, a height and reach adjustable steering wheel, driver seat and mirror memory settings, an electrochromatic rear view mirror, trip computer and an immobiliser. The Grange was also fitted with a limited slip rear differential {{as well as a}} choice of two higher performance brake packages, increased diameter front and rear swaybars and an exclusive-to-Grange HSV body kit consisting of front bumper with enlarged cooling intake, unique stainless steel meshed intake grille with HSV logo in the centre, flared deep side skirts, deep skirted three-piece rear bumper, rear <b>decklid</b> spoiler and rear HSV badging.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the first}} time on a Lincoln-badged Continental, its namesake [...] "Continental spare tire trunk" [...] seen on the Mark Series was used as a <b>decklid</b> design feature. In addition, the <b>decklid</b> was {{lettered}} [...] "CONTINENTAL" [...] instead of [...] "LINCOLN" [...] (as was the Versaillles, the first Lincoln to do so). As Ford Motor Company intended for the Lincoln Continental to compete against the Cadillac Seville, the rear half of the car was designed with a sloping [...] "bustle-back" [...] <b>decklid,</b> drawing inspiration from the Lincoln-Zephyr of the late 1930s. The <b>decklid</b> design of the Continental proved less extreme than that of the Seville. The addition of a horizontal brushed-chrome strip that ran along each side of Continental, along with plentiful two-tone color combinations, gave it a more conventional appearance in comparison to the Cadillac.|$|E
