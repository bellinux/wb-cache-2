40|$|This article reviews {{findings}} of studies regarding {{the treatment of}} truncal acne with benzoyl peroxide formulations and, in particular, studies utilizing a 5. 3 % benzoyl peroxide foam. Its formulation of micronized benzoyl peroxide particles in an emollient <b>foam</b> <b>vehicle</b> offers significant clinical and bioavailability advantages that enhance follicular penetration and skin moisturization. A key consideration for topical management of truncal acne is whether the treatment application method allows adequate skin contact time to reduce Propionibacterium acnes colony counts. The foam formulation has demonstrated significant reduction in Propionibacterium acnes on the back when used either as a leave-on or as short-contact therapy for five minutes. Short-contact therapy with a benzoyl peroxide foam is a novel approach {{to minimize the risk}} of benzoyl peroxide bleaching of clothing in truncal acne patients...|$|E
40|$|Psoriasis in some {{body parts}} can be {{challenging}} to treat. Psoriasis in the scalp, palms and soles, and intertriginous areas differ from disease on other body parts, and treatment regimens must be tailored to these areas. The presence of hair, along with the frequent, thick scale of psoriasis makes the scalp a challenge to treat. Skin in the body’s intertriginous areas is often thin, limiting treatment options for inverse psoriasis. Finally, palmoplantar psoriasis is often resistant to topical therapies because of {{the thickness of the}} skin. Moreover, cosmetic acceptibilty of a topical medicine is important when treating these areas. Coal tar has been used to treat psoriasis for hundreds of years. In a novel <b>foam</b> <b>vehicle,</b> coal tar 2 % is versatile and may be used to treat psoriasis even in challenging areas of the body, such as the scalp, intertriginous areas, and palms and soles...|$|E

40|$|Background The scalp is {{a common}} area for plaque psoriasis. Corticosteroid-based lotions are {{the most widely used}} therapy in this {{clinical}} setting. A new formulation of betamethasone valerate 0. 12 % in a thermophobic, low-residue <b>foam</b> <b>vehicle</b> (Bettamousse(TM), Mipharm, Italy; BVM) is available for the treatment of scalp dermatoses. Objectives In an open, investigator-blinded, multicentre (28 dermatology clinics), randomized, cross-over study, the efficacy, safety and patient acceptability of BVM in scalp psoriasis were evaluated in comparison with standard therapies (ST, i. e. corticosteroids or vitamin D analogues). ST were chosen by each centre according to its usual therapeutic protocols. Methods In total, 241 patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis participated in the trial. After a 2 -week run-in period, each active treatment (BVM or ST) was applied for 4 weeks, with a wash-out period between the two active treatment phases of at least 4 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated by investigators unaware of treatment sequence analysing a 'target' lesion for erythema, scaling, itching and burning using a five-point grading score. Patient treatment acceptability and assessment of the influence on Psoriasis Disability Index were evaluated using an eight-item modified Finlay-Khan questionnaire at baseline {{and at the end of}} each treatment period. Safety was evaluated by recording any adverse event occurring during the study duration. BVM was applied twice daily, and ST were applied once or twice daily, according to the approved scheduled regimens. Results Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Two hundred and ten patients concluded the study. Fifteen patients withdrew from the study during BVM treatment, and 16 during ST (not significantly different). Both treatments were well tolerated. At baseline, the mean+/-SD clinical global score (the 'Sum' score=erythema+scaling+itching+burning) was 7. 6 +/- 2. 6. The ST chosen were topical corticosteroids (55 % of cases; mainly mometasone and betamethasone dipropionate) or calcipotriol lotion (45 % of cases). At the end of active treatments, BVM was significantly superior to ST (P< 0. 001) in reducing, as compared with baseline, the mean+/-SD Sum score (1. 5 +/- 1. 9 with BVM and 3. 1 +/- 2. 7 with ST). During BVM treatment, 88 % (95 % confidence interval, CI 82 - 94 %) of patients had a complete or nearly complete resolution of scaling in comparison with 66 % (95 % CI 58 - 74 %) during ST therapy (P< 0. 001). BVM was also considered an easier and more convenient formulation to use in comparison with ST (P< 0. 01). Conclusions BVM is more effective than lotion-based ST commonly used in the treatment of scalp psoriasis, and has higher patient acceptability...|$|E

40|$|The {{definitive}} version can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Royal Pharmaceutical Society [Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]Objectives: Pharmaceutical foams are not new inventions and their application in topical therapy can be traced back three decades. However, foam formulations have been gaining in popularity with over 100 patents published globally in the last 10 years alone. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review the current status and explore the future potential of dynamic <b>foam</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the field of topical drug delivery. Key findings: The use of foam technology to deliver a range of topical active agents has been claimed, including sun-screening compounds, corticosteroids, and antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral agents. Although foams present distinct application advantages and improved patient compliance, the real reason for the rapid growth of topical foam technology is that foams as elegant, aesthetic and cosmetically appealing vehicles provide an alternative, promising formulation strategy in the highly competitive dermatological market. Although there is a plethora of published data proving the safety profiles of topical foams there is a lack of sufficient clinical evidence to demonstrate any superiority of foams over other traditional topical vehicles such as creams and ointments for drug delivery. Summary: Recent literature suggests that when foams are properly engineered using the advances of in situ analysis techniques, the enhancement of topical drug delivery via engineering this type of vehicle can be achieved...|$|R

5000|$|The primary {{functions}} of metallic <b>foams</b> in <b>vehicles</b> are to increase sound damping, reduce weight, increase energy absorption {{in case of}} crashes, and (in military applications) to combat the concussive force of IEDs. As an example, foam filled tubes {{could be used as}} anti-intrusion bars. [...] Because of their low density (0.4-0.9 g/cm3), aluminium and aluminium alloy foams are under particular consideration. These foams are stiff, fire resistant, nontoxic, recyclable, energy absorbent, less thermally conductive, less magnetically permeable, and more efficiently sound dampening, especially when compared to hollow parts. Metallic foams in hollow car parts decrease weakness points usually associated with car crashes and vibration. These foams are inexpensive to cast with powder metallurgy, compared to casting other hollow parts.|$|R

40|$|Sandwich armor {{structures}} {{with aluminum}} foam can be utilized {{to protect a}} military vehicle from harmful blast load such as a landmine explosion. In this paper, a system-level dynamic finite element model is developed to simulate the blast event and to evaluate the blast-resistant performance of the sandwich armor structure. It is found that a sandwich armor structure with only aluminum foam is capable of mitigating crew injuries under a moderate blast load. However, a severe blast load causes force enhancement and results in much worse crew injury. An isolating layer between the aluminum <b>foam</b> and the <b>vehicle</b> floor is introduced to remediate this drawback. The {{results show that the}} blast-resistant capability of the innovative sandwich armor structure with the isolating layer increases remarkably...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{discretization}} elastic-plastic material {{model was}} used for simulating the shock waves transmission within metallic foams. The density heterogeneity of metallic foams was considered. Several types of aluminum foams are studied on the transmission of displacement and stresses wave under impact loading. The results reveal the characteristics of compressive wave propagation within the metal foams. Under low impact pulses, considerable energy is dissipated during the progressive collapse of foam cells, and then reduces the crush of the objects. When the pulse is high sufficiently, on the fixed end of foam, stress enhancement may take place, where high peak stresses usually occur. The magnitude of the peak stress depends on the relative density of foams, the pulse loading intensity, the pulse loading duration {{as well as the}} density homogeneity of foam materials. This research offers valuable insight into the reliability of the metal <b>foams</b> used as <b>vehicles</b> and protective structure...|$|R
40|$|A new modular {{insulation}} panel {{technology for}} insulating reefer vans is proposed that can {{solve some of}} the problems of traditional methods. New insulating materials with lower thermal conductivity and aging rate are considered to be sandwiched in composite panels to provide better thermal performance in addition to stronger structure. The developed technology can be applied on a variety of commercial vans {{to improve the quality of}} insulation while reducing the cost and installation time of the process dramatically. The present method suggests prefabricating of modular insulation panels with accurate size in controlled conditions instead of spraying insulation <b>foam</b> inside the <b>vehicles.</b> In addition, the installation method of modular panels enables the operators to replace the damaged parts of insulation easily with less cost instead of changing the whole insulation in the old method. The MATLAB optimization toolbox is utilized to optimize the thickness of insulation panels based on energy cost and operational conditions. To validate the proposed model, a full-scale prototype is built and installed on a Ford transit connect and tested under road conditions for performance approval...|$|R
40|$|Metallic foams are {{currently}} being looked at as a new material for automobiles. The main goal {{of the use of}} metallic <b>foams</b> in <b>vehicles</b> is to increase sound dampening, reduce the weight of the automobile, and increase energy absorption in case of crashes, or in military applications, to combat the concussive force of IEDs. The metallic foams that are being looked at currently, are aluminum and its alloys due to their low density (0. 4 – 0. 9 g/cm 3). In addition these foams have a high stiffness, are fire resistant, do not give off toxic fumes, are fully recyclable, have high energy absorbance, have low thermal conductivity, have low magnetic permeability, and are efficient at sound dampening, especially in comparison to light weight hollow parts. In addition, partial addition of metallic foams in hollow parts of the car will decrease weakness points usually associated with car crashes and noisy vibrations. These foams are cheap to cast by using powder metallurgy (as compared to casting of other hollow parts). The aim of the research was to describe and to assess the main mechanisms that appear in the foam structure during the compression. The development process of the finite element model of the closed cell foam microstructure is presented in the paper. The model geometry was based on the real structure research, which was carried out with the use of computed tomography.

40|$|Cross flow heat {{exchangers}} made from aluminum are common as radiators in vehicles. However, {{due to the}} increasing power requirement and the limited available space in vehicles, {{it is extremely difficult}} to increase the size of {{heat exchangers}} (HEXs) placed in the front of vehicles. Placing the heat exchanger on the roof or at the underbody of vehicles might offer opportunity to increase the size of the heat exchangers. A new configuration of heat exchangers has to be developed to accommodate the position change. In this study, a countercurrent heat exchanger is proposed for the position {{on the roof of the}} vehicle compartment. Furthermore, a new material, graphite foam having high thermal conductivity (1700 W/(m•K)) and low density (0. 2 to 0. 6 g/cm 3), is introduced as a potential material for those heat exchangers in vehicles. In order to find an appropriate configuration of fins with high thermal performance and low pressure loss on the air side for a countercurrent flow HEX, the main-flow enhancement and the secondary-flow enhancement methods are employed to analyze different configurations of fins. The main-flow enhancement cases included are (1) aluminum: louver-, wavy-, and pin fin; (2) graphite foam: corrugated-, wavy corrugated-, pin-finned-, and baffle fin. The secondary-flow enhancement cases included are graphite foam: rectangular fin, rectangular fin with one-side dimples, and rectangular fin with two-side dimples. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach is applied for the comparative studies by using the ANSYS FLUENT software. Moreover, the simulation results are verified by experimental results from literature. After comparing the performance among different configurations of fin, it is found that the aluminum louver fin shows better performance than the wavy fin and pin fin. Also the graphite foam wavy corrugated fin presents higher heat transfer performance and lower pressure drop than the corrugated-, pin-finned-, and baffle fin. On the other hand, the graphite foam rectangular fin with two-side dimples exhibits better performance than the fin with one-side dimples. The cross flow HEX (made from aluminum) is compared with countercurrent flow HEXs (made from aluminum or graphite foam), in terms of the coefficient of performance (COP), power density (PD), compactness factor (CF), and energy saving efficiency. Due to the high power density and high compactness factor in the countercurrent flow HEXs, the overall size and weight of the countercurrent flow HEXs are much lower than those of the cross flow HEX. Moreover, the graphite foam wavy corrugated fin provides higher power density and higher compactness factor than an aluminum louver fin because of the high thermal conductivity and low density of the graphite foam. Furthermore, a graphite foam fin with two-side dimples exhibits higher coefficient of performance than an aluminum louver fin, and it becomes very efficient in energy saving. However, due to the high pressure loss in the graphite foam wavy corrugated fin, the air pumping power for the countercurrent flow graphite foam wavy corrugated fin HEX is much higher than that of the cross flow aluminum louver fin HEX. Based on the presented studies, useful recommendations are highlighted to promote the development of countercurrent flow HEXs and the graphite <b>foam</b> HEXs in <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R
