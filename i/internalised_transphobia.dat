Regret {{may be due}} to unresolved gender dysphoria, or a weak and fluctuating sense of identity, and may even lead to suicide. [...] During the process of sex reassignment surgery, transsexuals may become victims of different social obstacles such as discrimination, prejudice and stigmatising behaviours. The rejection faced by transsexuals is much more severe than what is experienced by LGB individuals. The hostile environment may trigger or worsen <b>internalised</b> <b>transphobia,</b> depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress.|$|E

It is comprised of four sections. The first section consists of a systematic literature review exploring factors which relate to suicidal ideation and attempts (SIA) in trans people. A systematic search of nine databases resulted in 27 papers. Discrimination and other negative experiences were related to increased SIA, whereas social interactions and access to support were protective, although some limitations to the study are also discussed. The second section is an empirical cross-sectional study to test aspects of the MSH. Specifically it examines the relationship between discrimination, <b>internalised</b> <b>transphobia</b> and negative expectations with the outcomes of depression, anxiety and stress. It also explores whether functional social support moderates these relationships. The study found high rates of poor mental health among the 250 participants, which were indeed related to the three predictor variables. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that these outcomes were predicted by discrimination and <b>internalised</b> <b>transphobia,</b> but not negative expectations. Social support did not moderate the relationships between predictors and outcomes. The third section comprises of a critical appraisal of the thesis process and studies herein. However, a substantial focus of this concerns issues specific to research with trans populations, and limitations of the current available evidence base. The final section collates the ethical application process and study materials. Overall, the studies reported here highlight the need for psychologists to work at structural and community levels, rather than simply at the individual level, if the mental health of these marginalised and oppressed groups is truly to improve...|$|E
