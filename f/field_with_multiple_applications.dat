The reduction of radiation-induced oxide trapped charge characteristic of deep submicron CMOS processes can be boosted if appropriate layout styles such as the gate-enclosed layout transistors are used.

Autonomous mobile robots make use of stereo vision to detect obstacles and measure their relative distance to them for path planning. Technically, it consists of the processing of two images simultaneously adquired by two cameras, from a given scene. Stereo vision is a <b>field</b> <b>with</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>applications</b> and many resources had been invested for research in this subject. In this paper, we present a stereo vision based controller design and its implementation on a mini helicopter with 4 rotors known as quadrotor. The dynamic model is obtained using the well known Euler-Lagrange approach. Experiment results show good performance of the proposed controller using "real-time" optical flow and image processing from two cameras...|$|E

This paper proposes {{a framework for}} capturing semantics from eye tracking data {{during the process of}} text skimming by readers of electronic documents, mainly from the Web. The research is part of an eye-tracking oriented project which aims at formalizing and defining web frameworks that exploit eye tracking data for better customization and adaptability with respect to each user’s ocular activity during the user-computer interaction and the browsing experience. However, the scope of the paper is limited to the process of reading textual information which, according to recent studies, tends to become a process of text skimming for visual cues and keywords.

While scientists observe PBDEs in various environmental media, little is known of their fate in soils. This study examines the potential fate of PBDEs in soils treated with biosolids. Surface soil samples were collected from commercial farms in the Mid-Atlantic region. Biosolids samples from the source wastewater treatment plant were collected to evaluate PBDE levels and trends. Results show that mean concentration of PBDEs in biosolids from this plant is 1496 ± 158 µg/kgd. w., mean concentration in soil from fields that had not received biosolids was 6. 8 µg/kgd. w., <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> a single application had a mean of 18 µg/kgd. w., and <b>fields</b> <b>with</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>applications</b> had a mean of 52 µg/kgd. w. Statistical analysis revealed that concentrations in the <b>multiple</b> <b>application</b> group {{were significantly higher than}} those in the single application group.

We systematically analyze the problem of optical plasmonic response in such systems and demonstrate the purely geometric nature of the size quantization condition for graphene plasmons. Accurate numerical calculations allowed us to tabulate the universal geometric parameters of plasmon size quantization, {{which is expected to}} become useful in analysis of experimental data on plasmonic response of graphene nanoribbons. A simple analytical theory has also been developed which accurately reproduces all the qualitative features of optical plasmonic response of graphene nanoribbons...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for capturing semantics from eye tracking data {{during the process of}} text skimming/scanning by readers of electronic documents and HTML user interfaces. RDFa and HTML microformats are some of the easier ways proposed by the Semantic Web paradigm for embedding semantics in web pages. XSLT transformations or specialized parsers may easily convert such documents to RDF/XML semantic repositories. However, semantics do not usually have an absolute character. Although a variety of web 2. 0 oriented ontologies and microformats have been widely adopted or even standardized (Dublin Core, FOAF, XFN etc.), in order to achieve semantic interoperability, there are scenarios in which user-relative semantics are especially important, such as in the development of customization engines (web session customization, recommender systems, targeted advertising), when a certain user must only share semantics with himself or with similar persons. Having the same web document, different readers would attach various semantics and relevance to the ideas, concepts or structural blocks of the document. Eye tracking is an emerging <b>field</b> <b>with</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>applications</b> in medicine, marketing, cognitive sciences and others, which allows the extraction of data regarding the eye activity of a user during human-computer interaction. Eye tracking data is valuable in measuring reading patterns, user experience and reflects the specific parts of an image or documents that attract the user’s interest.

In this study, a fully-automatic change detection method based on SAR amplitude images is proposed. This method aims at the detection of small-scaled abrupt changes which are caused for example by different kinds of vehicles or building sites. As dataset, a time series (about half a year) of TerraSAR-X images covering the scene of Greding (Germany) and surroundings was used. From this dataset, an amplitude based activity map was calculated. For evaluation purpose, this method is compared with the CoVAmCoh analysis, which represents a complementary approach for SAR change detection.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, change {{detection}} based on remote sensing data has become a highly frequented <b>field</b> of research <b>with</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>applications</b> for practical use. To detect changes between temporarily different satellite images is of interest for example in terms of urban monitoring and disaster management.

To create a robust method, only one single parameter encoding the size of the detected changes has to be set by the operator. Furthermore, first steps concerning the categorization of the detected changes are presented. As dataset, a time series of high resolution SAR images acquired by the German satellite TerraSAR-X was used. The time span of this time series, acquired in ascending and descending orbit, is about half a year...|$|R
