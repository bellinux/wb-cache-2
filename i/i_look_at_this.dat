5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E

Understand, in the first place, that <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> matter from a lawyer's point of view. It's a {{question}} of evidence, with me. Very well.

60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> splendid fellow, {{with his}} high-bred, {{clean-cut}} face, {{and thought of}} the fine qualities and gentle, generous impulses which I knew to lie within him, it seemed so absurd that he should speak as though my friendship towards him were a condescension, that I could not help laughing aloud.|$|R

60|$|I {{could feel}} that Beverly-Jones grew {{depressed}} as {{he showed me}} round. I was sorry for him, but unable to help.

Now, gentlemen, my opinion is that the Church, and the Church only, knows the secret of the passage through the foggy channel, and keeps it to itself. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> commercially, as a question of demand and supply. Well, sir; the only real trader here at Todos Santos is the Church." ...|$|E

6000|$|In this {{solitude}} where I now write--in {{the change}} of life and of all life's hopes and enjoyments which has come over me--when I look back to those evenings at North Villa, I shudder as <b>I</b> <b>look.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> moment, I see the room again--as in a dream--with the little round table, the reading lamp, and the open books. Margaret and I are sitting together: her hand is in mine; my heart is with hers. Love, and Youth, and Beauty--the mortal Trinity of this world's worship--are there, in that quiet softly-lit room; but not alone. Away {{in the dim light}} behind, is a solitary figure, ever mournful and ever still. It is a woman's form; but how wasted and how weak!--a woman's face; but how ghastly and changeless, with those eyes that are vacant, those lips that are motionless, those cheeks that the blood never tinges, that the freshness of health and happiness shall never visit again! Woeful, warning figure of dumb sorrow and patient pain, to fill the background of a picture of Love, and Beauty, and Youth! ...|$|E
60|$|We {{slept and}} stayed the {{following}} day at the post of Cufre. In the evening the postman or letter-carrier arrived. He was a day after his time, owing to the Rio Rozario being flooded. It would not, however, be of much consequence; for, although he had passed {{through some of the}} principal towns in Banda Oriental, his luggage consisted of two letters! The view from the house was pleasing; an undulating green surface, with distant glimpses of the Plata. I find that <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> province with very different eyes from what I did upon my first arrival. I recollect I then thought it singularly level; but now, after galloping over the Pampas, my only surprise is, what could have induced me ever to have called it level. The country is a series of undulations, in themselves perhaps not absolutely great, but, as compared to the plains of St. Fé, real mountains. From these inequalities there is an abundance of small rivulets, and the turf is green and luxuriant.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Flatiron is an incident, {{an accent}} merely, in the mighty {{music of the}} Avenue, a happy discord that makes for harmony. It is no longer nefarious, or even mischievous, now the reporters have got done {{attributing}} a malign meteorological influence to it. I wish I could say {{as much for the}} white marble rocket presently soaring up from the east side of Madison Square, and sinking the beautiful reproduction of the Giralda tower in the Garden half-way into the ground. As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> pale yellowish brown imitation of the Seville original, it has a pathos which I might not make you feel. But I would rather not look away from Fifth Avenue at all. It is astonishing how that street has assumed and resumed all the larger and denser life of the other streets. Certain of the avenues, like Third and Sixth, remain immutably and characteristically noisy and ignoble; and Fifth Avenue has not reduced them to insignificance as it has Broadway. That is now a provincial High Street beside its lordlier compeer; but I remember when Broadway stormed and swarmed with busy life. Why, I remember the party-colored 'buses which used to thunder up and down; and I can fancy some Rip Van Winkle of the interior returning to the remembered terrors and splendors of that mighty thoroughfare, and expecting to be killed at every crossing--I can fancy such a visitor looking round in wonder at the difference and asking the last decaying survivor of the famous Broadway Squad what they had done with Broadway from the Battery to Madison Square. Beyond that, to be sure, there is a mighty flare of electrics blazoning the virtues of the popular beers, whiskeys, and actresses, which might well mislead my elderly revisitor with the belief that Broadway was only taken in by day, and was set out again after dark in its pristine--I think pristine is the word; it used to be--glory. But even by night that special length of Broadway lacks the sublimity of Fifth Avenue, as I see it or imagine it from my motor-bus top. I knew Fifth Avenue in the Lincolnian period of brick and brownstone, when it had a quiet, exclusive beauty, the beauty of the unbroken sky-line and the regularity of facade which it has not yet got back, and may never get. You will get some notion of it still in Madison Avenue, say from Twenty-eighth to Forty-second streets, and perhaps you will think it was dull as well as proud. It is proud now, but it is certainly not dull. There is something of columnar majesty in the lofty flanks of these tall shops and hotels as you approach them, which makes you think of some capital decked for a national holiday. But in Fifth Avenue it is always holiday--" ...|$|E

60|$|And as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> wide {{expanse of}} houses and {{factories}} and churches, silent and abandoned; as I {{thought of the}} multitudinous hopes and efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this human reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung over it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled back, and that men might {{still live in the}} streets, and this dear vast dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave of emotion that was near akin to tears.|$|R

40|$|For my master's thesis I {{researched}} a {{book with}} testimonials about sexual violence during the 1994 Rwandan genocide: "The Men Who Killed Me". During this genocide approximately 250, 000 to 500, 000 women were raped or in other ways sexually violated. I was especially interested {{in the practice of}} remembrance and the following research question takes central stage in this thesis: In what way do individual as well as collective narratives of sexual violence contribute to remembrance practices of the Rwandan genocide? <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> question from different angles: memory, representation, 'the body' and affect.

5000|$|In the July - August 2012 {{parliamentary}} election, Gongarad Nkoua was re-elected to the National Assembly as the UPDP {{candidate in}} Ngo constituency. He won {{the seat in}} the second round of voting, receiving 56.46% of the vote against an independent candidate, Jean-Félix Nkoué. As the oldest deputy elected in the 2012 election, Gongarad Nkoua had the traditional honor of presiding over the National Assembly when it met on 5 September 2012 to elect its bureau for the new parliamentary term. Speaking on the occasion, he reflected on the role and the responsibilities of deputies: [...] "As parliamentarians, you are the link between the local and the national level, between the national and the global level. ... When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> chamber, I always realize that behind every elected deputy there are thousands of Congolese. It is our honor to represent and respect everyone regardless of their vote and their political beliefs. Our mandate requires us to never lose touch with our fellow citizens." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, {{a clip of}} Maloney asking [...] "Where are the women?" [...] {{created a}} bit of a firestorm. She asked the {{question}} of an all-male panel at a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The panel had been called by the Republican members of the Committee to testify on the issue of birth control and new health care reform regulations. In her opening statement, Maloney said: [...] "Where are the women? When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> panel, I don't see one single woman representing the tens of millions of women across the country who want and need insurance coverage for basic, preventative health care services, including family planning," [...] Maloney continued. Then she repeated: [...] "Where are the women?" [...] The clip and a photo of the all male panel quickly went viral and became a rallying cry for women's groups. Women's issues and their reproductive rights took on great significance during the 2012 Presidential campaign.|$|E
60|$|Height, 5 feet 6 inches; girth of the chest, 4 feet 2 inches; {{spread of}} its arms, 7 feet 2 inches.

When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> and <b>at</b> the great bunches of hard muscles which composed its brawny chest and arms, I could almost believe in the stories told by the natives of the tremendous feats of strength performed by the gorilla. The body of this brute was covered with grey hair, but the chest was bare and covered with tough skin, and its face was intensely black.

He was a very giant in size, with a breadth of shoulder that would have made him quite ridiculous had it not been counterbalanced by an altitude of six feet four. He had a huge head of red hair, and a huge heart full of tenderness. His only fault was utter recklessness in regard to his own life and limbs--a fault which not unfrequently caused him to place the lives and limbs of others in jeopardy, though he never could be brought to perceive that fact.|$|R
