50|$|Prior to the mid-20th century, {{literature}} on legal aid emphasised collective enforcement of economic, {{social and cultural}} rights. As classic welfare states {{were built in the}} 1940s and following World War II, an underlying principle was that citizens had collective responsibility for economic, social and cultural rights; and the state assumed responsibility for those unable to provide for themselves through illness and unemployment. The enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights was to be collective, through policies rather than <b>individual</b> <b>legal</b> <b>action.</b> Laws were enacted to support welfare provisions, though these were regarded as laws for planners, not lawyers. Legal aid schemes were established, as it was assumed that the state had a responsibility to assist those engaged in legal disputes, but they initially focused primarily on family law and divorce.|$|E

5000|$|The {{court found}} {{the problem of}} {{appropriate}} relief in a case {{such as this one}} to be difficult. It believed [...] "that no half-way measures will suffice." [...] The court said: There has been a deliberate violation of the law, and it is the duty of the court to do what he can to make certain that these violations of the law will cease and will not be resumed in the future and that competition will be restored in the industry. The record discloses that some of the <b>individual</b> defendants anticipated <b>legal</b> <b>action</b> by the Government, and went ahead in spite of that and violated the law. They also tried to anticipate the remedies that might be applied and did what they could to forestall the effect of such remedies and retain the benefits of their unlawful actions. The court intends to make certain that this does not occur.|$|R
40|$|In principle, the {{constitutional}} precepts envisage that judicial decisions {{are not subject}} to extrajudicial control. However, in the course of deciding on constitutional complaints, the Constitutional Court reviews the compliance of <b>individual</b> <b>legal</b> acts and <b>actions</b> of state authorities with the Constitution, including court decisions on cases involving {{the constitutional}}ly guaranteed rights. Hence, in order to eliminate tension or even contradiction between the constitutional precepts, the constitutional review of judicial decisions should be considered as a special form of judicial control, regardless {{of the fact that the}} Constitutional Court is not part of the judicial structure in the strict organizational sense. Thus, unlike the cases where the Court is involved in the normative control of the applicable law, in the process of reviewing judicial decision of lower courts the constitutional judiciary acts in the capacity of a specific judicial authority. According to another possible interpretation of the aforementioned constitutional norms, the direct constitutional protection of the constitutionally guaranteed rights may only be pursued in the process of reviewing <b>individual</b> <b>legal</b> acts and <b>actions</b> of state authorities, but not by pursuing a judicial review of court decisions which the Constitutional Court has no jurisdiction to decide upon. Thus, the dogma of judicial independence would prevail over the dogma of direct protection of fundamental rights. The third interpretation of this relationship maintains that that judicial decisions may be subject to control but, in this specific case, the Constitutional Court may only issue an opinion (a statement) rather than a binding decision which would cancel the lower court judgment. Then, it is up to the judicial authorities of the lower instance to adjust their judicial decision, which in the opinion of the Constitutional Court constitutes a violation of the constitutionally guaranteed rights, with the Constitution. In the long-standing practice of the Constitutional Court of Serbia, this competence has been perceived as the capacity to review all <b>individual</b> <b>legal</b> acts within the general framework of the Court's constitutional authority to directly protect fundamental human and minority rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, provided that this competence does not have the character of a last-instance control of the legal validity of the court decision in totum, in a manner exercised by higher judicial instances in regular court proceedings. With reference to these assumptions, the paper will examine and discuss the eligibility, scope, reach and limits of constitutional review of judicial decisions...|$|R

The Attorney General {{also has}} powers to bring [...] "unduly lenient" [...] {{sentences}} and points of law to the Court of Appeal, issue writs of nolle prosequi to cancel criminal prosecutions, supervise other prosecuting bodies (such as DEFRA) and advise <b>individual</b> ministers facing <b>legal</b> <b>action</b> {{as a result}} of their official actions.

He or she is also officially the leader of the Bar of England and Wales, although this is merely custom and has no duties or rights attached to it. The Attorney General's duties have long been considered strenuous, with Sir Patrick Hastings saying that [...] "to be a law officer is to be in hell". Since the passing of the Law Officers Act 1997, any duties of the Attorney General can be delegated to the Solicitor General for England and Wales, and his or her actions are treated as coming from the Attorney General.|$|R
