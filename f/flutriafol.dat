An infected plant can be removed from the area, which will slow the spread of infection to other plants, but this often is not desirable. Fungicides, such as mancozeb, chlorothalonil, <b>flutriafol,</b> penconazole, or a copper-based product, applied upon new leaf emergence or first appearance of black spot, can be used to control the disease. If a more natural and nontoxic approach is desired, diluted neem oil is effective both against black spot and as an insecticide against aphids. It is usually necessary to repeat the spraying at seven- to 10-day intervals throughout the warmest part of the growing season, as the fungus is most active at temperatures from 75 to 90 °F.|$|E

40|$|Summary 	Apple scab, {{caused by}} the fungal {{pathogen}} Venturia inaequalis, is a significant disease in regions of California characterized by spring precipitation. Disease control is typically attained with periodic application of fungicides. We conducted a field experiment near Camino, California to test the effects of several registered and experimental fungicides on control of scab in mature Red Delicious apple trees. In late spring 2009, following four applications (from green tip into post-bloom), we evaluated disease incidence and severity (lesion density). High disease incidence (> 95 %) and high lesion density (> 12 lesions/fruit) on untreated and water-treated fruits suggested significant disease pressure during the preceding months. Generally, fruits and leaves treated with kresoxim-methyl or mancozeb + <b>flutriafol</b> showed the lowest incidence and severity of disease. <b>Flutriafol</b> (used alone) was moderately effective; tea tree oil, parafinnic oil and monopotassium phosphate (fertilizer) showed little to no ability to control scab...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{challenges}} facing the Texas winegrape industry is Phymatotrichopsis omnivora, the cotton root rot (CRR) pathogen. A survey instrument was created and distributed to grape growers which revealed that the disease {{is a serious problem}} in counties where acreage of new vineyards is on the increase. Grape growers expressed significant concern because there were no effective recommendations for disease control. One control option for growers is the use of promising rootstock x scion combinations. In 2012, a root stock field trial was planted with two own-rooted grape varieties (Chardonnay, Merlot) and the same two varieties on Dog Ridge root stock. Both varieties on the root stock showed a significant statistical difference in disease development when compared to own-rooted vines. Merlot own-rooted vines were more resistant than the Chardonnay own-rooted vines. Two experimental fungicide field trials were initiated in vineyards in the spring of 2012. In one vineyard, several fungicides were tested including <b>flutriafol,</b> a fungicide being used successfully to control CRR on cotton. In the commercial vineyard in Travis County, TX, <b>flutriafol</b> was applied at 0. 26 lbs/a. i. /acre (1 X), 2. 6 lbs/a. i. /acre (10 X), and 5. 2 lbs/a. i. /acre (20 X) through a manually applied soil drench. There was a significantly lower level of disease development in the 10 X plots, as compared to untreated controls. Vines treated with a 10 X rate of <b>flutriafol</b> also showed decreased incidence of non-target foliar pathogens and possible plant health effects when compared to the other treatments. In 2014, two new field trials were established using chemigation at an established vineyard and a newly planted vineyard. The experimental block at the newly planted vineyard consisted of 30 rows of Petite Syrah on 5 BB rootstock containing 118 vines/row. Two rates of <b>flutriafol</b> at 0. 26 lbs/a. i. /acre (1 X) and 0. 52 lbs/a. i. /acre (2 X) were applied through the irrigation system with 10 plots (rows) /treatment. In the untreated plots, disease increased from 0 - 5. 5 % over a 12 week period following treatments. No disease was observed until week 11 in any of the treated plots. However, by week 12, disease incidence had increased to 2. 5 % and 1. 4 % in the 1 X and 2 X plots, respectively.

Algumas doenças que ocorrem na parte área das plantas podem ser manejadas através do tratamento das sementes com produtos sistêmicos. Essa forma de controle tem sido utilizada há muitos anos, visando o controle de fungos biotróficos em arroz e trigo. A ferrugem asiática da soja é a {{principal}} doença que ataca a cultura, a qual necessita de ferramentas eficientes para seu manejo. O objetivo desta dissertação foi verificar a contribuição do tratamento de sementes de soja com produtos fitossanitários no manejo da ferrugem asiática. Desta forma, produtos fitossanitários foram aplicados às sementes de soja em diferentes doses, a fim de se verificar os efeitos fitotóxicos sobre sementes e plântulas que eventualmente fossem causados pelos mesmos. As maiores doses não fitotóxicas de cada tratamento foram selecionadas, novamente aplicadas às sementes e distribuídas em campo experimental, onde se verificou o efeito do tratamento das sementes isoladamente ou com a aplicação foliar de fungicidas foliares, no manejo da ferrugem asiática da soja. Ciproconazol + azoxistrobina (10, 0 + 25, 0 g i. a. / 100 kg de sementes), difenoconazol (50, 0), epoxiconazol (2, 5), fluquinconazol (50, 0), <b>flutriafol</b> (10, 0), <b>flutriafol</b> TS (5, 0), <b>flutriafol</b> + tiofanato metílico (10, 0 + 50, 0), tebuconazol (10, 0), tebuconazol + trifloxistrobina (10, 0 + 5, 0), tetraconazol (10, 0), triticonazol (25, 0), acibenzolar-S-methyl (50, 0) e pó de rocha (2, 0) não apresentaram fitotoxicidade e foram comparados em campo. Ciproconazol + azoxistrobina (25, 0 + 10, 0 g i. a. / 100 kg de sementes) e epoxiconazol (2, 5) diminuíram a emergência das plântulas de soja em campo. No ensaio somente com tratamento de sementes, sem aplicação de fungicida foliar, tebuconazol e tebuconazol + trifloxistrobina diminuíram a ferrugem asiática em plantas de soja. Quando se integrou a pulverização foliar de fungicidas, fluquinconazol, tebuconazol e tebuconazol + trifloxistrobina, diminuíram a severidade da ferrugem asiática da soja. Apesar de não aumentar o rendimento da cultura, o tratamento de sementes pode contribuir no manejo da ferrugem asiática da soja, mantendo a segurança e o rendimento do produtor. Seed treatment has as traditional objective to eradicate or to reduce fungi associated with seeds {{and to protect}} them from soilborne pathogens. Some diseases that occur in the aerial part of plants may be managed through seed treatment with systemic products. This kind of control has been used for many years, aiming the control of biotrophic fungi in rice and wheat. Soybeanś asian rust is the main disease that attacks the culture, which needs efficient tools for its management. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify the contribution of soybean seed treatment with phytosanitary products in the management of asian rust. In this case, phytosanitary products were applied to soybean seeds in different doses, aiming to verify the phytotoxicity effects onto seeds and seedlings that eventually would be caused by these products. The highest non phytotoxic doses of each treatment were selected, applied again to seeds and these were distributed on experimental field, where it was verified the effect of each seed treatment with and without foliar application of fungicides, in the management of soybeanś asian rust.

To clarify this fact, in vitro experiments were conducted to determine mycelial sensitivity of five C. cassiicola isolates to fungicides. Mycelial growth was assessed based on the growth of the mycelium on the culture medium, in Petri dishes. The medium potato-dextrose-agar was supplemented with the concentrations 0; 0. 01; 0. 1; 1; 10; 20 and 40 mg/L of the active ingredients carbendazim, cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, <b>flutriafol</b> and tebuconazole.

Três ensaios, com 11 tratamentos e cinco repetições, foram conduzidos em laboratório com inseticidas, fungicidas e herbicidas, respectivamente. Cada ensaio foi conduzido com 10 tratamentos de agrotóxicos e água como testemunha seletiva. Todos os produtos fitossanitários foram testados nas doses utilizadas na cultura da soja. Ovos de S. frugiperda parasitados por T. remus foram imersos nos tratamentos por cinco segundos e, após secagem total, foram acondicionados em sacos plásticos até a emergência dos adultos dos parasitoides. A viabilidade do parasitismo foi avaliada, e a redução na emergência dos parasitoides foi classificada segundo as normas da International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC). Os resultados mostraram que os inseticidas do grupo dos reguladores de crescimento, como o flufenoxurom, diflubenzurom e metoxifenozido e também os inseticidas imidacloprido + beta-ciflutrina e acefato, foram seletivos às fases imaturas do parasitoide. Espinosade foi classificado como inócuo para larvas de T. remus. Gama-cialotrina foi levemente nocivo para larvas e inócuo para pupas. Bifentrina e clorpirifós foram, respectivamente, levemente nocivo e nocivo para ambas as fases de desenvolvimento de T. remus. Com relação aos herbicidas testados, 2, 4 -D, S-metolacloro, flumioxazina, dicloreto de paraquate + diurom, dicloreto de paraquate e glifosato (Roundup Transorb®) foram seletivos.

Inversamente, epoxiconazole e azoxistrobina foram seletivos para a fase de larva e levemente nocivos para a fase de pupa do parasitoide. <b>Flutriafol</b> foi classificado como levemente nocivo para ambas as fases de T. remus. Biological control agent preservation {{is crucial}} to the integrated pest management success. However, chemical control is yet useful for crop production. Thus, pesticide selectivity to beneficial insects is a feature that must always be taken into account in order to choose the best chemical. Therefore, this research studied the impact caused by different pesticides in the egg parasitoid, Telenomus remus Nixon (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) emergence, when sprayed on the larvae and pupae stage (Egg masses from 100 to 150 eggs of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) six and ten days after the parasitism, respectively). Three trials, with 11 treatments and 5 repetitions, were carried out in the laboratory with insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. Each test was carried out with 10 treatments of chemicals and water as control. All chemicals were tested at rates used in soybean crops. Eggs of S. frugiperda parasitized by T. remus, were immersed in the treatments for five seconds. After completely dry, they were placed in plastic bags until the emergence of adults of parasitoids. The viability of parasitism was evaluated and the reduction in the emergence of the parasitoids classified according to the rules of the International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC). The results showed that the insect growth-regulating (IGR) insecticides flufenoxuron, diflubenzuron, methoxyfenozide as well as the insecticides imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin and acephate were harmless to the parasitoid immature stages. Spinosad was classified as harmless for larvae of T. remus. Gama-cyhalothrin was slightly harmful to larvae and harmless to pupa of T. remus. Bifenthrin and chlorpyrifos were, respectively, slightly harmful and harmful to both stages of development of T. remus development. Regarding to the tested herbicides, 2, 4 -D, s-metolachlor, flumioxazin, paraquat dichloride + diuron, paraquat dichloride and glyphosate (Roundup Transorb®) were harmless. However, glyphosate + imazethapyr, clomazone, glyphosate (Gliz®), glyphosate (Roundup Ready®) were harmless to the larvae stage and slightly harmful (class 2) to T. remus pupae.

The formulations included cyproconazol / carbendazim (Alto-Ambel, 46 % SC); <b>Flutriafol</b> / carbendazim (Shafy, 24. 4 % SC); Propiconazol / cabendazim (Tilt CB, 18. 75 % SC) and Carbendazim (50 % WP). Test fungi were Alternaria tritici, Fusarium graminearum and Helminthosporium sativum. Results of laboratory tests indicated that, Alto-Ambel formulation showed the strongest inhibitory effect of H. sativum hyphal growth, followed by Shafy and Tilt CB formulations. Carbendazim exhibited the strongest effect against F. graminearum, but without appreciable effect on either A. tritici or H. sativum hyphal growth. Field experiment showed that, application of any of the formulations on wheat, 4 – 5 weeks after seeding produced good control of root-rot and leaf spot diseases of wheat, and Alto-Ambel (46 % SC) was the strongest in decreasing disease severity of leaf spot caused by Alternaria and Helminthosporium, whereas Tilt CB (18. 75 % SC) was the strongest against root-rot caused by Fusarium and Helminthosporium. Combination formulations (Alto-Ambel, Shafy and Tilt CB) showed an effective reduction in the percentages of the presence of Helminthosporium and Alternaria in leaf spot disease and of Fusarium in root-rot disease of wheat plants...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{occurrence}} of Fusarium spp. and concentrations of mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in {{the grain of}} the winter wheat moderately susceptible to Fusarium head blight (FHB) has been studied. Grain samples were collected from wheat crops intended mainly for human consumption. All wheat crops were treated with fungicides before (a. i. <b>flutriafol</b> - formulated as Fluoco, applied in dose of 0. 5 l ha- 1) and during the flowering phase of growing (a. i. thiophanate-methyl + epoxiconazole formulated as Eskorta plus and a. i. thiophanate-methyl formulated as Funomil, applied in doses of 0. 75 and 0. 5 l ha- 1, respectivily). Among of Fusarium species only F. graminearum, as a well known producer of DON, was identified. This fungus was identified in 15 of 19 samples (78. 9 %) with incidence in positive samples of 2 to 28 % (average, 14. 0 %). Presence of DON was established in 13 of a total 19 investigated wheat grain samples (68. 4 %). In positive samples DON was detected in concentrations from 69 to 918 μg kg- 1 (average, 478 μg kg- 1). DON showed a significant and positive correlation at P≥ 0. 05 with grain moisture content (r = 0. 52 *). Between the frequency of F. graminearum and concentration of DON and between the frequency of F. graminearum and grain moisture content, positive correlation was determined, but without statistical significance (r = 0. 44 and r = 0. 29, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|Leptosphaeria maculans is {{the major}} {{pathogen}} of canola (oilseed rape, Brassica napus) worldwide. In Australia, the use of azole fungicides {{has contributed to the}} 50 -fold increase in canola production in the last 25 years. However, extensive application of fungicides sets the stage for the selection of fungal populations with resistance. A high-throughput in planta assay was developed to allow screening of thousands of isolates from multiple populations. Using this screen, isolates were identified with decreased sensitivity to the fungicide fluquinconazole when applied at field rates as a protective seed dressing: these isolates cause significantly larger lesions on cotyledons and true leaves and increased disease severity at plant maturity. This increased in planta resistance was specific to fluquinconazole, with no cross resistance to <b>flutriafol</b> or tebuconazole/prothioconazole. In a limited set of 22 progeny from a cross between resistant and susceptible parents, resistance segregated in a 1 : 1 ratio, suggesting a single gene is responsible. A survey of 200 populations from across canola growing regions of Australia revealed fungicide resistance was present in 15 % of the populations. Although in vitro analysis of the fungicide resistant isolates showed a significant shift in the average EC 50 compared to the sensitive isolates, this was not as evident as the in planta assays. The development of this novel, high-throughput in planta assay has led to the identification of the first fungicide resistant L. maculans isolates, which may pose a threat to the productivity of the Australian canola industry...|$|E

Average concentration which reduced mycelial {{growth by}} 50 % {{comparing it to}} control (EC 50) was calculated for each isolate. Among fungicides tested, prochloraz was shown {{to be the most}} effective in growth inhibition of all three species, while flutirafol was proven to be the least effective. Metocnazole was more efficient in comparison with carbendazim and tebuconazole. EC 50 values of all isolates on prochloraz were lower than 0. 1 mg l- 1, while on flutirafol they ranged between 1. 66 and 8. 51 mg l- 1 for 18 isolates, or were higher than 10 mg l- 1 for 7 isolates. EC 50 values on carbendazim were 0. 39 - 1. 41 mg l- 1 for F. graminearum isolates, 0. 91 - 1. 35 mg l- 1 forF. avenaceum, and 0. 47 - 0. 6 mg l- 1 for F. verticillioides. EC 50 values on tebuconazole were 0. 85 - 2. 57 mg l- 1 for F. graminearum, 0. 85 - 1. 58 mg l- 1 for F. avenaceum and 0. 22 - 0. 85 mg l- 1 for F. verticillioides,while on metconazole EC 50 values ranged between less than 0. 1 mg l- 1 to 1. 66, 0. 56,and 0. 17 mg l- 1 for F. graminearum, F. avenaceum and F. verticillioides, respectively. Average growth inhibitions of different Fusarium species and all Fusarium isolates together on different concentrations of fungicides tested were significantly different. Significant differences in growth were not determined among isolates of the same species on neither one of fungicides tested, indicating that no decreased sensitivity to the fungicides exists among isolates included in the study...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. The two-spotted {{spider mite}} (TSM), Tetranychus urticae Koch, is an {{important}} pest of many greenhouse and field crops worldwide. The development of resistance in TSM populations to chemical acaricides, allied with public health concerns about pesticide residues, has motivated the search for alternative control measures to suppress the pest. Hyphomycetous fungi are promising agents for mite control and the fungus Beauveria bassiana (Bb) (Balsamo) Vuillemin was investigated in this study as a biocontrol agent. The principal objectives of this study comprised: a) screening Bb strains for their pathogenicity against T. urticae; b) testing the effect of adjuvants on the efficacy of Bb; c) studying the effect of plant type on persistence of Bb and the efficacy of control of Bb against T. urticae; d) evaluating the field efficacy of Bb applications against T. urticae; e) testing the compatibility of Bb with selected fungicides; and f) assessing the synergy between Bb and soluble silicon for T. urticae control. Screening bioassays of sixty-two strains of Bb identified the two most effective strains, PPRI 7315 (R 289) and PPRI 7861 (R 444), that caused mortality levels of more than 80 % of adult mites at 9 d post-inoculation with 2 × 108 conidia ml- 1. These strains performed significantly better than the Bb commercial strain PPRI 5339, in laboratory bioassays. The two strains also attacked mite eggs, causing 53. 4 % and 55. 5 % reduction in egg hatchability at 2 × 108 conidia ml- 1 respectively. However, PPRI 7861 showed relatively higher production of conidia in culture and was, therefore, selected for further trials under greenhouse and field conditions. Greenhouse evaluations {{of the effects of}} two adjuvants (Break-thru® and a paraffin oil-based emulsion) on efficacy of Bb demonstrated a higher efficacy of the biocontrol agent (BCA) when it was applied with Break-thru® or the oil solution than with water alone. Moreover, Bb conidia applied in Break-thru® solution resulted in greater control of TSM than conidia applied in the mineral oil. There was also a dose-response effect and the control of TSM by Bb increased when the concentration of conidia was increased. The control of TSM by Bb in beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), maize (Zea mays L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) was tested in greenhouse trials. On these crops, the persistence of conidia declined over time. The rate of decline was significantly higher on maize. However, TSM mortality was positively correlated with the amount of conidia deposited on leaves immediately after spraying, rather than their persistence over time. Higher levels of mortality of TSM due to Bb application were observed on beans, cucumber and eggplants, suggesting that the type of crop must be taken into consideration when Bb is applied as a BCA. Field efficacy of Bb against mites was evaluated in two trials on eggplants. Based on assessment of population densities of mites and leaf damage assessments; both trials showed that the strain PPRI 7861 controlled TSM in the field. Two commonly used fungicides, azoxystrobin and <b>flutriafol,</b> were investigated in vitro tests on culture medium and laboratory bioassays on detached bean leaves (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) for their effects on Bb. Azoxystrobin (a strobilurin) was less harmful to Bb while <b>flutriafol</b> was found to be inhibitory. Another important finding of this study was the substantial enhancement of Bb efficacy by soluble silicon. When Bb was combined with soluble Si, the control of TSM was better than when either of the two products was applied alone. Moreover, application of soluble Si as a plant fertilizer in hydroponic water nutrient increased accumulation of peroxidase, polyphenoloxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzymes in leaves of plants infested with TSM. Increased activity of these defense enzymes in leaves deters feeding behaviour of mites. We suggested that feeding stress renders them susceptible to Bb infection, which would explain the synergy observed between the two agents...|$|E
40|$|Net blotch {{is caused}} by Pyrenophora teres Drechs. (stat. conid. Drechslera teres (Sacc.) Shoem., syn. Helminthosporium teres Sacc). P. teres {{produces}} symptoms which appear initially as small necrotic spots and streaks on the leaf. These increase to produce the characteristic net-like symptoms, which {{have given rise to}} the name net blotch. Sometimes, lesions develop from small necrotic spots, to form elliptical lesions. This is the "spot" type of P. teres and was first noticed in 1967 in isolates from North America, Mexico, Israel and Holland. It was thought that these isolates were mutants of P. teres. Since 1969 however, other workers have reported similar observations widely occurring in Norway, Denmark and Finland. Based on minor morphological differences, Ito and Kuribayashi proposed a new species, called P. japonica. Smedegård-Petersen disagreed, and showed that the spot-producing isolate represents a deviating type of P. teres, only differing from the usual "net" type in the symptoms induced on barley plants. He based his reasoning on morphological, cultural and genetical investigations. Consequently, Smedegård-Petersen described two new forms of the fungus, Pyrenophora teres Drechs. f. teres Smedeg., which produces the usual net lesions, and Pyrenophora teres Drechs. f. maculata Smedeg., which produces well defined dark brown circular or elliptical lesions without netting. The aim of the research undertaken {{in the present study was}} to conduct a comparative study on the morphology and fitness of a range of New Zealand "net" and "spot" type isolates. An attempt was also made at crossing a "net" type with a "spot" type. Although Smedegård-Petersen had stated that there was no morphological difference between the "net" and "spot" types, this project was undertaken because no research had been done on New Zealand isolates. Furthermore, different features were studied using different methods not used by other workers in studying P. teres. The only morphological difference that was distinctive was that the "spot" types of P. teres formed coremial strands, which were fan-like in morphology, which produced conidia in culture, and the "net" types did not. There was no way to tell the "net" isolates apart from the "spot" isolates, based on conidia colour, length, width, volume or the number of cells per conidium. One fact that did emerge, was that the longest conidia had the greatest number of cells per conidium and the reverse was also true. The germination of monoconidial isolates showed that there were no major differences in branching between the two types of P. teres. However, it was revealed that two germ tubes were capable of emerging from one cell in the "spot" isolates. All cells in a conidium in both the "net" and "spot" types were able to germinate, cells that germinated tended to be at opposite ends, and the first cell to germinate in a conidium was usually the cell at the hilum. Examination of the growth rates showed that there were no significant differences in the growth rates of the "net" and "spot" types when grown on MEA+B. The "spot" types were able to penetrate cellulose faster than the "net" types and hence may produce cellulose faster as well. ANT 148, which had previously been an unknown type, was proved to be a "spot" type in the pathogenicity tests. It may have been the source of the New Zealand "spot" type inoculum because the seed it came from was imported into New Zealand in 1984, two years prior to the discovery of the "spot" type of P. teres in the South Island. Both forms of P. teres penetrated the leaf through the epidermal cell wall, and occasionally entered through the stomata. Even though the "spot" type may be present inside the leaf, the symptoms are not usually manifested until later, compared with the "net" type where the symptoms tend to be an indication of the amount of hyphae present in the leaf. In the screening of the progeny from the crossing, the "spot" type of P. teres had lost up to 78. 9 % of its resistance to triadimenol and <b>flutriafol,</b> when compared to the sensitivity tests carried out in 1986 and 1987. It is hypothesised that 13 Y, the "net" type is dominant, and the "spot" type, KF 2, recessive, as none of the progeny had any resistance to triadimenol or <b>flutriafol,</b> after undergoing somatic recombination. It was concluded that the "spot" and "net" types are two types of the same species, and there was not enough evidence to suggest otherwise. Further studies should be done, using more current isolates of the "net" and "spot" types of P. teres, and the old D. japonica isolates from New Zealand, to establish if the cultures identified as D. japonica, are different in any way...|$|E
40|$|Powdery mildew is an economically-important {{pathogen}} {{of grapes}} worldwide. This report details {{the findings of}} our annual powdery mildew fungicide trials on grapevine cultivar Chardonnay (Vitis vinifera). The trials were conducted at Herzog Ranch, near Courtland, California in 2009. Treatments were placed in five adjacent trials in the vineyard. Spraying commenced in mid April, shortly after a heavy rainfall event that likely promoted the release of powdery mildew (Uncinula necator) ascospores from overwintering chasmothecia. Spraying was completed in mid July and treatments were evaluated for disease incidence and severity on 21 July 2009, at about the beginning of veraison. Trial I consisted of IR- 4 -funded biofungicide research that focused on two products: caprylic acid (a novel control agent in current development) and Actinovate (a registered product containing the bacterium Streptomyces lydicus WYEC 106). Trials II-V included various fungicide products (either currently registered or {{in various stages of}} product development) including strobilurins, demethylase inhibitors, oils, and other materials. Spray frequencies varied from weekly applications to 21 day intervals. Temperatures were mild during much of the 2009 growing season, providing optimal conditions for the asexual reproduction and dispersal of powdery mildew. Risk index data was high from about mid-May {{through the rest of the}} evaluation period and the pathogen quickly colonized leaves. Disease pressure was higher than in similar trials conducted in 2007 or 2008. By mid-June, heavy to severe mildew was evident on untreated clusters. Treatment performances varied widely. Biological fungicides generally reduced disease severity, but were more effective when used in a combination program with synthetic materials. As a stand-alone product, caprylic acid was most effective when applied weekly at a concentration of 0. 3 % (v/v). At a concentration of 0. 5 % it consistently showed phytotoxic effects on berries. A few organic materials performed well, lowering disease severity to < 10 %: paraffinic oil + Foliar Supreme (sulfur + nutrient cocktail) and two types of fertilizers alternated with trifloxystrobin. Among synthetic products, difenoconzaole + cyprodinil, <b>flutriafol,</b> fluopyram, fluopyram + tebuconazole, quinoxyfen + alcohol ethoxylate (an adjuvant), various GWN 4617 treatments, picoxystrobin, penthiopyrad, boscalid + pyraclostrobin alternated with triflumizole, and metrafenone gave good to excellent control of disease severity on fruit. These trials easily separate highly effective materials from those which give only moderate control of powdery mildew, however long-term assessment of treatment efficacy is best evaluated with experiments conducted at multiple locations, across several growing seasons, and on multiple grape cultivars...|$|E
