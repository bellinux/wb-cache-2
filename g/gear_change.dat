5|$|The {{transmission}} of the T-26 consisted of single-disc main dry clutch, a gearbox with five gears in the front part of the vehicle, steering clutches, final drives and band brakes. The gearbox {{was connected to the}} engine by a drive shaft passing through the vehicle. A <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> lever was mounted directly on the gearbox.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> mechanisms, known as derailleurs and hub gears. Both systems have {{advantages}} and disadvantages, and which is preferable depends on the particular circumstances. There are a few other relatively uncommon types of <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> mechanism which are briefly mentioned {{near the end of}} this section. Derailleur mechanisms can only be used with chain drive transmissions, so bicycles with belt drive or shaft drive transmissions must either be single speed or use hub gears.|$|E
25|$|On {{a bicycle}} {{with only one}} <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> {{mechanism}} (e.g. rear hub only or rear derailleur only), the number of possible gear ratios {{is the same as}} the number of usable gear ratios, which is also the same as the number of distinct gear ratios.|$|E
5000|$|E: E is the {{functional}} equivalent of D {{in a full}} automatic. As the gearbox in a MMT car is a manual gearbox, instead of one with a torque converter as in a traditional automatic, <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> are noticeable. The accelerator should be eased off slightly when <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> to produce a smooth ride.|$|R
5000|$|The average manual car driver: 500 ms - 1 s (vertical <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> e.g. 1st-2nd, 3rd-4th, 5th-6th): 1s - 2s {{horizontal}} <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> (2nd - 3rd, 4th - 5th, 6th - 7th). As well shift {{times can}} <b>change</b> depending on <b>gear</b> throws (distance between gears), its easement of movement, ergonomics of lever {{and age of}} gearbox.|$|R

25|$|The {{transmission}} was the 4-speed gearbox {{from the}} 6C 2300, mounted with a Hardy disc behind the engine. originally standard fitted which they removed and installed {{in its place}} a differential unit from a Lancia Lambda. A unique system pre-selector <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> system was also developed. The clutch was hydraulically assisted.|$|E
25|$|There are two chainrings whose {{relative}} difference (say 10%) {{is about}} half the relative step on the cogset (say 20%). This {{was used in the}} mid-20th century when front derailleurs could only handle a small step between chainrings and when rear cogsets only had a small number of sprockets, e.g. chainrings 44-48 and cogset 14-17-20-24-28. The effect is to provide two interlaced gear ranges without any duplication. However to step sequentially through the gear ratios requires a simultaneous front and rear shift on every other <b>gear</b> <b>change.</b> This style is not available off the shelf.|$|E
25|$|Electrical power {{came from}} a 24 volt DC {{generator}} on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine, which supplied AC power for radios. The radiator shutters, supercharger <b>gear</b> <b>change,</b> gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release {{and all the other}} crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 volt battery. The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P. devices. The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically {{in the event of a}} crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers.|$|E

25|$|In August 2010, {{with the}} release of the WM Series II range, Holden {{announced}} the Statesman model had been discontinued, with the Caprice being split into two models and reduced in price. This was due to the lesser sales of the Statesman. In 2013, Holden updated the WM II to become the WN Caprice. This involved the fitment of the VF Commodore Calais V interior and alloy wheels. This update also includes the Caprice PPV which gets the interior from the VF Commodore Evoke which also includes a column <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> leaving the 9C3 version to be discontinued for 2014. In 2015 the Caprice PPV like the WN & Middle Eastern Counterparts gets the same rear vision camera as a new feature. In 2014 the base Caprice was discontinued leaving the Caprice V as the only model in the Holden range. The final, WN series II of 2015 dropped the V6 engine option and was solely available with the LS3 V8; minor external changes included new wheels.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with London Transport from 1937 Leyland developed the Tiger FEC, the initials stood for flat-engined coach. The Leyland 8.6-litre engine (with revised sump) was mounted horizontally in mid wheel-base driving through a Wilson fluid-flywheel and an air-actuated AEC mechanical pre-selector gearbox. The gearbox was {{basically the same}} as used in the STL but it was fitted with an externally mounted air cylinder which actuated the bus bar to engage and disengage the gears. It worked in the opposite way from that in the slightly later RT type double decker in that air pressure was used to disengage the gears instead of being used to keep them engaged. When the <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> pedal was released it allowed the selected gear to engage by means of spring pressure in that {{same way as the}} gearbox in the STL. The system caused problems in that if a vehicle was left with a gear engaged and the air pressure leaked off {{it was not possible to}} disengage that gear until air pressure had been built up again. Because of this, there were a number of garage incidents caused by vehicles being left overnight with a gear still engaged. 88 of this type were built and 12 were destroyed during World War Two, the rest serving until 1954-5 as Green Line coaches.|$|E
25|$|The 2S6 combat vehicle {{uses the}} GM-352 and later GM-352M chassis {{developed}} and {{produced by the}} Minsk Tractor Plant (MTZ) which has six road wheels with hydropneumatic suspension on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear and three return rollers. An NBC system is also integrated into the chassis, which is protected -as the entire vehicle- from small arms fire (7,62) and shell splinters by the armor, {{as well as an}} automatic fire suppression system, an automatic <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> and diagnostic capability are available with latest Tunguska-M1 which uses the new GM-5975 chassis developed and produced by MMZ. GM-5975.25 has a cruising range of 500km and a maximum speed of 65km per hour. It can function at a relative humidity of 98 per cent at 35 degrees C, in ambient temperatures of −50 degrees C to 50 degrees C and up to an altitude of 3,000 m. It has an ability of climb up to 35 degrees, can cross slopes of 25 degrees, 2 m width ditch, 1 m depth ford. Overall, the layout is similar to the previous ZSU-23-4 with a large central 360-degree rotating turret (designated the 2A40) containing the armament, sensors and three of the crew: the commander, gunner and radar operator. The driver sits in the front left of the hull, with a gas turbine APU to his right and the multi-fuel diesel engine {{in the rear of the}} hull.|$|E

500|$|According to Mulligan, {{a problem}} during the {{production}} {{was that her}} role required her to drive: {{at the time she}} {{did not know how to}} drive or have a driver's licence. She did a two-week intensive course to learn how to work a manual <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> so she could eventually film the driving scenes, but failed the driving test. [...] "I’m really bad at it", she explained. [...] " [...] no hand and eye coordination." [...] The production team ultimately had to shoot the scene on a private road, where she was allowed to get behind the wheel. The director had a hard time making Knightley look plain in the film. He tells in an interview: [...] "It was difficult. She was eager and happy to do it because the role called for it. But even at her worst, Keira still looks astonishing".|$|E
2500|$|A {{different}} type of dual-clutch transmission {{has been used in}} some railcars. The two clutches are placed one on the gearbox input shaft and the other on the gearbox output shaft. To make a <b>gear</b> <b>change,</b> both clutches disengage simultaneously and a brake inside the gearbox engages. [...] The gearchange occurs with all gears stationary, so no synchronizing mechanism is needed. [...] After the <b>gear</b> <b>change,</b> both clutches re-engage. There is a significant break in power transmission, so this system is unsuitable for shunting locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|On {{a bicycle}} {{with more than}} one <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> {{mechanism}} (e.g. front and rear derailleur), these three numbers can be quite different, depending on the relative gearing steps of the various mechanisms. [...] The number of gears for such a derailleur equipped bike is often stated simplistically, particularly in advertising, and this may be misleading.|$|E

2500|$|Mechanically, the Mk III C's {{transmission}} {{was a major}} improvement {{from the}} older car. [...] A new 6-speed gearbox built by X-Trac {{was part of the}} package, replacing the previous 5-speed. [...] This gearbox was further enhanced by the option of a pneumatically actuated <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> system developed by Megaline which was activated by paddles behind the steering wheel, rather than by a traditional gear stick.|$|E
2500|$|The scooter had rigid rear {{suspension}} and small [...] wheels that allowed a compact design {{and plenty of}} room for the rider's legs. The Vespa's enclosed, horizontally mounted 98cc two-stroke engine acted directly on the rear drive wheel through a three-speed transmission. The twistgrip-controlled <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> involved a system of rods. The early engine had no forced-air cooling, but fan blades were soon attached to the magneto-flywheel (which houses the points and generates electricity for accessories and for the engine's spark) to push air over the cylinder's cooling fins. [...] The modern Vespa engine is still cooled this way.|$|E
2500|$|Edison {{made several}} designs of phonographs both with {{internal}} and external horns for playing these improved cylinder records. The internal horn models were called Amberolas. Edison marketed its [...] "Fireside" [...] model phonograph with a gearshift and a 'model K' reproducer with two styli that allowed it to play both 2-minute and 4-minute cylinders. [...] Conversion kits were produced {{for some of the}} later model 2 minute phonographs adding a <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> and a second 'model H' reproducer. [...] These kits were shipped with a set of 12 (wax) Amberol cylinders in distinctive orange boxes. [...] The purchaser had no choice as to the titles.|$|E

2500|$|... 1986 {{was also}} the year that the racing variant, the Porsche 961, made its debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Driven by René Metge partnering Claude Ballot-Léna, it {{finished}} first in its class and 7th overall. It returned in 1987 but failed to finish after a spin (missed <b>gear</b> <b>change)</b> while in 11th place by Canadian/Dutch driver Kees Nierop of Vancouver. Upon rejoining the track the car was observed on TV monitors in the Porsche pits to be on fire and the driver was told to stop {{and get out of}} the car. Sadly Nierop pulled over between marshal stations and this extra time taken to get to the car by the marshals allowed the fire to consume most of the rear end and destroy the car. Thus ended the career of the 961. It was later repaired and put on display at the Porsche Museum.|$|E
2500|$|Prompted by a {{perceived}} {{need for a}} simple, inexpensive all-terrain vehicle for oil exploration in North Africa, the French motor manufacturer Citroën developed the 2CV Sahara in 1958. Unlike other 4×4 vehicles which use a conventional transfer case to drive {{the front and rear}} axle, the Sahara had two engines, each independently driving a separate axle, with the rear engine facing backwards. The two throttles, clutches and <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> mechanisms could be linked, so the two [...] engines could run together, or they could be split and the car driven solely by either engine. Combined with twin fuel tanks and twin batteries (which could be set up to run either or both engines), the redundancy of two separate drive trains meant that they could make it back to civilization even after major mechanical failures. Only around 700 of these cars were built, and only 27 are known to exist today.|$|E
5000|$|Gear change: The <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> in MMT is noticeable, {{unlike in}} a full {{automatic}} car. Under E gear, the car will automatically change the gear depending on speed and gradient information. It is recommended that the accelerator pedal should be momentarily lifted off during <b>gear</b> <b>change.</b> A constant throttle can also be maintained on the accelerator, and <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> can still occur, although the car will feel noticeably more jerky during <b>gear</b> <b>change</b> than {{in a full}} automatic.|$|E
50|$|In {{a gearbox}} with neutral between gears, a typical shift {{actually}} involves two <b>gear</b> <b>changes,</b> once into neutral, and {{again into the}} next gear. During any shift, disconnecting drive components via a clutch unloads the engine and transmission of the force from the opposing components. Using the clutch for each shift out of, and then into, each gear is double (de)clutching. Due {{to the absence of}} a neutral spacing, double clutching is ill-advised for sequential <b>gear</b> <b>changes,</b> as in a fully sequential gearbox such as a typical motorcycle.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Cirrus {{introduced}} the SR20 G2 (Generation 2) and in 2008 the SR20 G3 (Generation 3). Both were defined by airframe modifications, G2 by fuselage and G3 by wing/landing <b>gear</b> <b>changes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Low {{normal or}} rapid rise rear derailleurs return the chain {{to the largest}} {{sprocket}} on the cassette when no cable tension is applied. While this was once a common design for rear derailleurs, it is relatively uncommon today. [...] In mountain biking and off-road cycling, the most critical <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> occur on uphill sections, where riders must cope with obstacles and difficult turns while pedalling under heavy load. This derailleur type provides an advantage over high normal derailleurs because <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> to lower <b>gears</b> occur {{in the direction of}} the loaded spring, making these shifts easier during high load pedalling.|$|R
