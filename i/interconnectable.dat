5000|$|Patch cords were expensive, {{could be}} damaged by use (creating hard-to-find {{intermittent}} faults), and made complex patches difficult and time-consuming to recreate. Thus, later analog synthesizers {{used the same}} building blocks, but integrated them into single units, eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems. The most popular of these was the Minimoog. In 1970, Moog designed an innovative synthesizer with a built-in keyboard and without modular design - the analog circuits were retained, but made <b>interconnectable</b> with switches in a simplified arrangement called [...] "normalization". Though less flexible than a modular design, normalization made the instrument more portable and easier to use. This first pre-patched synthesizer, the Minimoog, became highly popular, with over 12,000 units sold. [...] The Minimoog also influenced the design of nearly all subsequent synthesizers, with integrated keyboard, pitch wheel and modulation wheel, and a VCO->VCF->VCA signal flow. In the 1970s, miniaturized solid-state components let manufacturers produce self-contained, portable instruments, which musicians soon began to use in live performances. Electronic synthesizers quickly become a standard part of the popular-music repertoire. The first movie to use music made with a (Moog) synthesizer was the James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969. After {{the release of the}} film, composers produced a large number of movie soundtracks that featured synthesizers.|$|E

40|$|A novel catabolic {{transformation}} of vanillic acid (4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzoic acid) by microorganisms is reported. Several strains of Bacillus megaterium and {{a strain of}} Streptomyces are shown to convert vanillate to guaiacol (o-methoxyphenol) and CO 2 by nonoxidative decarboxylation. Use of a modified most-probable-number procedure shows that numerous soils contain countable numbers (10 (1) to 10 (2) organisms per g of dry soil) of aerobic sporeformers able to convert vanillate to guaiacol.

40|$|Abstrakt The task of {{similarity}} search in image databases {{has been studied}} for decades, while {{there have been many}} feature extraction techniques proposed. Among the mass of low-level techniques dealing with color, texture, layout, etc., an extraction of shapes provides better semantic description of the content in raster image. However, even such specific task as shape extraction is very complex, so the mere knowledge of particular raster transformation and shape-extraction techniques does not give us an answer what methods should be preferred and how to combine them, in order to achieve the desired effect in similarity search. In this paper we propose a framework consisting of low-level <b>interconnectable</b> components, which allows the user to easily configure the flow of transformations leading to shape extraction.

Much attention is drawn to technologies supporting dynamicity and mobility over small devices which can follow the user anytime, anywhere. The Bluetooth standard particularly fits this idea, by providing a versatile and flexible wireless network technology with low power consumption. In this paper, we describe an implementation of a novel framework named JXBT (JXME over Bluetooth), which allows the JXME infrastructure to use Bluetooth as the communication channel. By exploiting the JXME functionalities we can overcome Bluetooth limitations, such as the maximum number of <b>interconnectable</b> devices (7 according to the Bluetooth standard) and the maximum transmission range (10 or 100 meters depending on the version). To test the lightness of JXBT, we designed and evaluated BlueIRC, an application running on top of JXBT.

We consider all variants s. t. their input does not admit a general compressed form, and prove that each such variant, provided {{that it is}} not "trivial", is NP-complete. 1 Introduction This paper is concerned with the Minimum Capacity Network Design (MCND) problem. There is a very wide variety of network design problems. In this paper, we are interested in the sort of the problems defined in [KKG 91, MP 94], [GJ 79, problems ND 7,ND 3,ND 6], and other references therein. contrary to some of these problems, we are interested in solutions which induce general graphs, rather than trees only. The problem that we define and consider here has a rather large number of variants in its own right. The general setting involves a network of n <b>interconnectable</b> sites. We differentiate between variants that we call "long", i. e. ones whose instances and solutions are generally of polynomial length in n, and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Engineering of {{synthetic}} gene circuits is {{a rapidly growing}} discipline, currently dominated by prokaryotic transcription networks, which can be easily rearranged or rewired to give different output behaviours. In this review, we examine both a rational and a combinatorial design of such networks and discuss progress on using in vitro evolution techniques to obtain functional systems. Moving beyond pure transcription networks, more and more networks are being implemented {{at the level of}} RNA, taking advantage of mechanisms of translational control and aptamer–small molecule complex formation. Unlike gene expression systems, metabolic components are generally not as <b>interconnectable</b> in any combination, and so engineering of metabolic circuits is a particularly challenging field. Nonetheless, metabolic engineering has immense potential to provide useful biosynthesis tools for biotechnology applications. Finally, although prokaryotes are mostly studied as single cell systems, cell–cell communication networks are now being developed that result in spatial pattern formation in multicellular prokaryote colonies. This represents a crossover with multicellular organisms, showing that prokaryotic systems have the potential to tackle questions traditionally associated with developmental biology. Overall, the current advances in synthetic gene synthesis, ultra-high-throughput DNA sequencing and computation are synergizing to drive synthetic gene network design at an unprecedented pace...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} ubiquitous computing {{is that the}} computational services in our environment are envisioned {{to be far more}} <b>interconnectable</b> than today. This means {{it should be possible to}} combine them to suit the purpose at hand at any given time. However, given a particular combination of services, there are numerable combined behaviours that could be meaningful. Furthermore, ubiquitous computing is often characterized by dynamically changing, heterogeneous combinations of services. It is therefore necessary to be able to specify the desired behavior and to be able to switch dynamically and easily between several such behaviours. Assemblies, as a concept in ubiquitous computing, has been suggested as a mechanism to represent a set of services and their behavior. After summarising the use-inspired notion of an assembly, this paper (1) clarifies the concept from a software engineering perspective, arguing that an assembly is both an architectural connector and a component (2) that an assembly should have a programmatic representation (3) provides a discussion of what it should comprise, based on realistic examples grounded in participatory design (4) the challenges facing the adoption of the concept, and finally (5) shows that a particular suggestion for its implementation based on publish/subscribe is architecturally realizable. 1...|$|E
40|$|Genetical {{genomics}} studies uncover genome-wide genetic {{interactions between}} genes and their transcriptional regulators. High-throughput measurement of gene expression in recombinant inbred line populations enabled {{the investigation of}} the genetic architecture of gene expression variation. This has the potential to enrich the understanding of the molecular mechanisms affected by and underlying natural variation. Moreover, it contributes to the systems biology of natural variation, as a substantial number of experiments have resulted in a valuable amount of <b>interconnectable</b> phenotypic, molecular and genotypic data. For Arabidopsis thaliana a number of genetical genomics studies have been published, uncovering many expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Yet, this complex data is not easily accessible to the plant research community, leaving most of the valuable genetic interactions unexplored as cross-analysis of these studies is a major effort. We address this with AraQTL www. bioinformatics. nl/AraQTL/, an easily accessible workbench and database for comparative analysis and meta-analysis of all published Arabidopsis eQTL datasets. AraQTL provides a workbench for comparing, re-using and extending upon the results of these experiments. For example, one can easily screen a physical region for specific local-eQTLs that could harbour candidate genes for phenotypic QTL, or detect gene-by-environment interactions by comparing eQTLs under different conditions...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} focus on the acquisition of research skills by law undergraduates. One reason for this interest is a belief that many such students do not acquire an adequate level of research skills by the time that they graduate. Reflecting this concern, both the Law Society/Bar Council's Joint Statement on Qualifying Law Degrees and the Quality Assurance Agency's Benchmark Standards for Law both place great emphasis on the need to improve research skills teaching at University level. In the light of these developments, Durham University's Centre for Law & Computing decided to develop an Iolis style courseware package on legal research skills. Rather than use traditional law courseware authoring tools, however, the Centre chose to experiment by attempting from the outset to develop the package as a prototype website comprising text integrated with interactions. If successful, such an approach could have the benefits of making a workbook that is: (i) accessible across the Internet or a campus intranet; (ii) customisable to the needs of individual law schools; (iii) flexible enough to reflect more of the author's own approach and style; and (iv) <b>interconnectable</b> more readily with other campus websites and with the world wide web at large...|$|E

40|$|P-RIO {{provides}} a middleware-based environment for parallel and distributed programming. Its object-based, softwareconstructionmethodology facilitates modularity and code reuse, allowing engineers and scientists with little training to build relatively complex programs. To exploit parallelism, developers have based the software of many powerful multicomputer architectures on sequential pieces of computation that act concurrently and interact for communication and synchronization. In most message-passing-based programming environments, the interactions are specified through explicit language constructs {{embedded in the}} text of the program modules. Consequently, when the interaction patterns are not trivial, the overall program structure is concealed, making the structure difficult to recognize and complicating performance optimization. Also, these environments show little regard for properties of great concern in software engineering, such as reuse, modularity, and software maintenance. To address these issues, we designed the Parallel Reconfigurable <b>Interconnectable</b> Objects environment, which offers a graphical programming tool, modular construction, high portability, a separate configuration language, and runtime support mechanisms for parallel programs. P-RIO is, in principle, independent of the programming language, operating system, and communication architecture that the programmer adopts. P-RIO basics The P-RIO methodology hinges on the configuration paradigm, 1, 2 which allows the assembly of a system or program by the external interconnection of modules from a library. P-RIO extends the configuration framework with abstractions and mechanisms for parallel programming. In addition to the language used for programming the sequential components, we use a special (textual or graphical) configuration or architectural-description language that helps the user specify the programmodule composition and the interconnection structure.

Its main purpose is to investigate {{the extent to which}} the Castilian nobles inhabited a moral universe where certain rules were applied with respect to what was morally legal; rules that generated many and constant doubts. The study thus focuses on the nobles and their activity in the world: activity that falls within some concrete and specific economic, social and political margins of the time, but also, and this is what we aim to put forward, moral margins. All of this within the context of the post-Tridentine Catholic Europe: increase in the frequency of confession, expansion of the examination of conscience, detailed analysis of sins, etc. By analysing the consultations made by the Castilian nobles to theologians, the work presents a group of nobles submitted to continuous uncertainty about practically all the aspects of their lives as lords and as individuals: the sale of offices on the manors, the payment of fair salaries to servants, the payment of debts, compliance with the legislation on luxury, the persecution of public sins, the non-shooting (game), etc. In these aspects and others, the modern noble is situated in a moral topography with well-defined contours that impose limits on their political, social, and economic action. The principles of natural law (not harming others, seeking good, distributive and commutative justice, superfluous goods, etc.), the maxims of positive divine right (thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal, etc.) and the positive human, civilian and canonical law (restitution, obligation in the knowledge of complying with human laws, etc.) are all <b>interconnectable</b> for the conscience of the nobles who must be subjected to frequent judgements in the tribunal of penance. The moral discourse is an ambivalent discourse for the Castilian nobles of the Modern Age, because, on the one hand, it legitimises their position, but, on the other hand, it sometimes restricts their capacity to act...|$|E
