The first part, namely the unequal <b>frame</b> <b>protection,</b> put more protection on the header portion of the MPEG frame and less protection on the data sample portion of the MPEG frame. The second scheme, namely the unequal sample protection, put more protection on the most significant bits (MSBs) of the quantized data samples and less protection on the least significant bits (LSBs). Simulation results show that when comparing to the equal error protection scheme, the proposed scheme reduces the frame error rate by a factor of 2 and lowers the peak-subband-error-power-to-mask ratio of the audio data by as much as 11 dB...|$|E
40|$|A new error {{concealment}} scheme {{and a new}} unequal error protection scheme for enhancing {{the quality of the}} wireless transmitted MPEG audio is introduced. The {{error concealment}} scheme uses the frame data before and after the error frame on each subband to generate a new frame to substitute the error frame by the method of interpolation and fading. The quality of decoded audio is found improved in the golden ear test. The unequal error protection scheme is divided into two parts. The first part, namely the unequal <b>frame</b> <b>protection,</b> put more protection on the header portion of the MPEG frame and less protection on the data sample portion of the MPEG frame.

In addition, and contrary to the well-known PET (Priority Encoding Transmission) system, the video data units of each layer are encoded separately. This is especially useful when all layers are not output from the video coder at the same time.

40|$|In Canada, {{recreational}} activities account for 60 % of all drowning related deaths (LSS, 2012). How can we influence people to adopt safe behaviours while engaging in recreational activity around the water? One popular method for altering or maintaining behaviours {{is through the}} use of fear appeals. Unfortunately, such appeals can be problematic. If they create too fearful a response, they compromise their own efficacy. Humour has been promoted as one possible solution to mitigate theses effects (Mukherjee & Dubé, 2012). However, in many cases, humour may be inappropriate to use in combination with fear appeals. In response to this problem, this study turns to the use of visual metaphors. This study uses the Elaboration Likelihood model (ELM; Petty & Caccioppo, 1986) and Protection Motivation theory (PMT; Rogers, 1983) as a framework for understanding persuasive communication. It tests the relationship between fear, message <b>framing,</b> <b>protection</b> motivation and the use of visual metaphors. It was hypothesized that visual metaphors will function largely like the use of humour. In particular, visual metaphors will interact with high-fear and consequently lead to increased persuasion. Results suggest that those who reported being able to swim longer distances were less likely to intend to wear a life jacket [F(3, 171) = 5. 17, p= 0. 002]. Regression suggested that two significant predictors help form intentions to wear a life jacket. Those who focused on barriers to wearing a life jacket formed weaker intentions to wear a life jacket. Also, those who reported consuming alcohol more frequently while boating were less likely to intend to wear a life jacket. Males and females differed significantly in many of their responses. Males (M= 5. 50, SD= 1. 70) were less likely to intend to wear a life jacket than females (M= 4. 50, SD= 1. 83); t(167) = 3. 50, p= 0. 001. A possible explanation is males rated perceptions of severity and vulnerability as lower as well as rating response costs higher when compared to females. New Canadians (n= 13) reported significantly lower scores for self-efficacy (M= 5. 48, SD= 1. 18) than those who have lived in Canada for more than 10 years (M= 6. 17, SD= 0. 78); t(167) =- 2. 94, p= 0. 004. However, this study fell short of meaningful findings about visual metaphors and their interaction with fear appeals.
