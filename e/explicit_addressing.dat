40|$|The main {{component}} of electronic commerce (E-commerce) is {{the exchange of}} documents and messages. In the field of commercial messages standardization, the ebXML framework offers the valid standard for message modeling. Due {{to the importance of}} standardization ebXML framework in E-commerce, creating more facilities, in the ebXML messaging is so important. Today, the exchange of messages within the ebXML framework uses <b>explicit</b> <b>addressing,</b> in which, the message ultimate recipient is determined based on message producer partner and the information existed in collaboration agreement. In case of <b>explicit</b> <b>addressing</b> Use, among the messages that are reached by the partners in the business process, only a few of them may be appropriate {{to the needs of the}} recipient and as a result the recipient is forced to discard some of them. Due to releasing a large number of relatively high-volume messaging in system, not only the bandwidth consumption will rise, but it also slows down the message precision regarding to the message received by the partner that is appropriate to its needs or not. The purpose of this paper is providing a method in order to convert an <b>explicit</b> <b>addressing</b> to the implicit addressing for ebXML messages. The proposed method is based on an algorithm called "Rendezvous", that’s one of the algorithms which have been widely used in networks based on contents and specifically in publish/subscribe systems.

The proposed overlay model, which relies on the definition of representative measurement points, the avoidance of measurement redundancy and a simple measurement methodology as main design goals, is able to articulate intra- and inter-area measurements efficiently. The distributed nature of measurement control and data confers to the model the required autonomy, robustness and adaptiveness to accommodate network topology evolution, routing changes or nodes failure. In addition to these characteristics, the avoidance of <b>explicit</b> <b>addressing</b> and routing at the overlay level, and the low-overhead associated with the measurement process constitute a step forward for deploying large scale monitoring solutions.

The resulting analysis traces gothic effects through other, more familiar texts and figures {{in order to bring}} about re-readings that disrupt certain monolithic understandings of literary and sexual identity over time. With a focus on gender transitivity and sexual dissidence, and the insights afforded by queer readings in which queer is framed as a verb, the analysis opens up ways of reading genre through the experimental theories of Deleuze and Guattari. Going beyond identifying major and minor gothic literature, I propose that we understand the literary gothic as a writing machine that produces goth-identified subjects. Tracing concepts like Minor Literature, Rhizome, Becoming-other, the Refrain, and the Body without Organs through fictional and life narratives from Charlotte Dacre, Percy Shelley, Count Eric Stenbock, and Poppy Z. Brite (Billy Martin), I suggest ways in which my reading of minor figures and their works has implications for how we might re-read works by major authors Jane Austen (Northanger Abbey) and Henry James (“The Jolly Corner”), and works by popular author Anne Rice (with a particular focus on the character Lestat and the later novel Tale of the Body Thief).

40|$|Project {{sustainability}} is {{a recent}} concept predominantly debated and employed by international aid organisations in development aid: {{the meaning of the}} term, what its time and spatial scales are, what dimensions it has, what factors it can be affected, etc. It is deemed to be a high-level examination whether the aid intervention has been successful or not. Even though all the international aid organisations examined in the thesis share the viewpoint that project sustainability {{has to do with the}} maintenance of the achieved outcomes after the aid intervention has come to an end, there are some shortages in their definitions of the term as well as the factors that can affect project sustainability. The thesis is thus concerned with analysing the sustainability of the project “Industrial and Urban Development in Viet Tri city” (Việt Trì Project), which was a part of the environmental programme “Danish Environmental Assistance to Vietnam 2000 - 2004 ” (DEA-Vietnam), financed by the Danish International Development Agency (Danida) and implemented in Việt Trì city, Phú Thọ province from July 2002 to July 2005. The main aim is to obtain deeper practical knowledge and understanding of project sustainability, the factors that can affect project sustainability in reality, and the improvement possibilities. Initially, the research problem is introduced and different methods to fulfil the study are dealt with. A discussion of sustainability is presented in order to prepare a ground for approaching the discussion of project sustainability. The dimensions of and the factors that can affect project sustainability are then explored. Seen from the theoretical perspectives, project sustainability has to do not only with the capacity of the directly involved partner stakeholders to maintain the achieved results after the aid intervention has come to an end but also their capacity to produce the results by themselves and develop/reproduce them over a period of time. Moreover, the five dimensions of project sustainability - financial, institutional, technical, social, and environmental - can be affected not only by the partner government and donor policies, the partner participation and ownership, the awareness building and training, and the external political and economic factors but also by the insufficient and <b>explicit</b> <b>addressing</b> and analysis of sustainability throughout the project cycle, corruption, and inefficient participation from the donor’s side. From the empirical analysis of Việt Trì Project, I found out that the project itself is too ambitious in terms of components and activities for a short intended time frame (24 calendar months), some project outcomes are potentially sustainable while some are not. Against the background of the theoretical framework, I suggested that Việt Trì Project should be improved by concentrating on the most necessary activities based upon the characteristics and duration of the project, enhancing the addressing and analysis of sustainability in the project cycle, improving the anti-corruption factor, and strengthening the participation of the ultimate beneficiaries in the project cycle, especially in the Identification and Preparation phase where the efficient engagement of Danida’s local staffs should also be enhanced. It is concluded from the research that firstly, as far as Việt Trì Project and other DEA-Vietnam projects are concerned, project sustainability was touched upon at a general level in Danida’s working tools. Secondly, the fieldwork in Phú Thọ province has played a crucial role to the research. I collected a lot of useful and interesting live information which is not available in the documents of Việt Trì Project. Thirdly, the professional experiences shared by Plan International and the project experts were useful for the analysis of Việt Trì Project’s sustainability problems, especially the analysis of the ultimate beneficiaries’ participation. And finally, to talk about corruption in general and corruption in connection with development projects is a taboo in Phú Thọ province...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{information}} {{technology has been}} characterized by constantly increasing performance of available hardware resources. This development allows the assignment of more and more complex tasks to software systems {{while at the same}} time leading to a massive increase of inherent complexity of applied systems. The expected further increase of complexity in the future demands for an <b>explicit</b> <b>addressing</b> of complexity. The concept of Component Orientation represents an approach for complexity reduction during the development and configuration of software through functional decomposition. With the vision of Autonomic Computing there does exist an approach for addressing complexity during the operation and maintenance of software systems. In this context, the approach is based on the idea of assigning low level-management tasks to the managed system itself. The concept of Component Orientation leads to the establishment of system architectures out of clearly distinguishable building blocks. Therefore, Component Orientation seems to provide a promising foundation for realizing the vision of Autonomic Computing. This thesis presents a realistic infrastructure for the autonomic management of component-based enterprise systems. The application area of such systems leads to special requirements for managed systems and is highly affected by the complexity problem. As a foundation for the proposed approach, a well established component standard was chosen to guarantee the practical relevance of applied concepts and techniques. The applied standard is Enterprise JavaBeans, version 3. 0. The proposed infrastructure is designed and realized in a generic fashion. It provides a platform upon which solutions for different application areas of Autonomic Computing can be realized. Autonomic entities are supported through a programming interface which represents a system on three interrelated levels and allows its management: On the top-level, the underlying software of a managed system is considered. The middle layer addresses the system architecture. Runtime interactions within the system are represented on the lowest layer. On this foundation, a system can be managed in a holistic, model-based way. The runtime management of a system is enabled through a specially developed component which must be integrated into the affected environment. This component is compliant with the applied component standard and does not require any adjustment of the underlying component platform. Finally, a tool is provided which supports the establishment of manageability through the automated execution of required adjustments of components. The management of a system is realized transparently for its constituent elements during runtime. On the whole, the development of enterprise software is not affected by a potential application of the presented infrastructure. Seit einigen Jahrzehnten ist ein stetiges Ansteigen der Leistungsfähigkeit verfügbarer Hardwareressourcen festzustellen. Dieses ermöglicht die Zuweisung immer umfangreicherer Aufgaben an Softwaresysteme, was gleichzeitig ein massives Ansteigen der inhärenten Komplexität der verwendeten Systeme zur Folge hat. Ein für die Zukunft zu erwartender weiterer Komplexitätsanstieg erfordert eine explizite Adressierung. Das Konzept der Komponentenorientierung stellt einen Ansatz zur Komplexitätsreduktion für die Entwicklung und Konfiguration von Software durch funktionale Dekomposition dar. Mit der Vision des Autonomic Computing existiert ein Ansatz zur Komplexitätsbewältigung für Betrieb und Wartung von Softwaresystemen. In diesem Zusammenhang wird der Ansatz verfolgt, Aufgaben zur Feinsteuerung eines verwalteten Systems auf das System selbst zu übertragen. Da die Komponentenorientierung zu klar voneinander abgrenzbaren Elementen innerhalb von Systemarchitekturen führt, erscheint sie als viel versprechende Grundlage zur Realisierung der Vision des Autonomic Computing. Diese Arbeit stellt eine realistische Infrastruktur für die autonome Verwaltung von komponentenbasierten Geschäftsanwendungen vor. Der Anwendungsbereich solcher Systeme stellt spezielle Anforderungen an verwaltete Systeme und ist besonders von der Komplexitätsproblematik betroffen. Um die praktische Relevanz der verfolgten Konzepte und Verfahren zu gewährleisten, wurde ein etablierter Komponentenstandard als Grundlage des Ansatzes gewählt. Bei diesem handelt es sich um Enterprise JavaBeans, Version 3. 0. Die vorgestellte Infrastruktur ist generisch konzipiert und umgesetzt. Sie stellt eine Plattform bereit, auf deren Basis Lösungen für verschiedene Anwendungsfelder des Autonomic Computing realisiert werden können. Zur Unterstützung autonomer Verwaltungseinheiten wird eine Programmierschnittstelle bereitgestellt, welche ein System auf drei Ebenen abbildet und dessen Steuerung ermöglicht: Auf oberster Ebene erfolgt die Betrachtung der einem System zugrunde liegenden Software.

Using a content-based communication service, receivers declare their interestsby means of selection predicates, while senders simply publish messages. The service consists of delivering to any and all receivers each message that matches the selection predicates declared by those receivers. In the content-based service model, message content is structured as a set of attribute/value pairs, and a selection predicate is a logical disjunction of conjunctions of elementary constraints over the values of indi-vidual attributes. For example, a message might have the following content [class=&quot;alert&quot;, severity= 6,device-type=&quot;web-server&quot;, alert-type=&quot;hardware failure&quot;] which would match a selection predicate such as this...|$|R
