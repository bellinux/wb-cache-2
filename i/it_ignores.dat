5|$|The {{decisions}} reached {{during this}} period vary, however, mostly due to the differing judicial philosophies of the time. While A.V. Dicey maintained that the prevalent philosophy was one of laissez faire thanks {{to the influence of}} philosophers and economists such as Adam Smith, Michael W. Flinn asserted that: Another common error... has been the assumption that the classical economists were the only effective influence on social and economic policy in the early and mid-nineteenth century. This is a curiously perverse view, since <b>it</b> <b>ignores</b> powerful voices like those of Bentham, Chadwick, the social novelists, many by no means inarticulate members of the medical profession, the humanitarians, the Christian Socialists and most sections of the many working class movements. There was in short, nothing approaching a consensus of opinion concerning laissez-faire and state intervention, even in the very narrow social sector represented by governments, Parliament, and the press. In practice the ears of ministers were assaulted by a confused babble of voices rather than bewitched by the soft whisper of a single plea for inaction.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>ignores</b> the {{political}} {{nature of his}} death, that he was ‘born King of the Jews’ and therefore a threat to peace under Roman rule.|$|E
25|$|Some determinists {{argue that}} materialism does not present a {{complete}} understanding of the universe, because while it can describe determinate interactions among material things, <b>it</b> <b>ignores</b> the minds or souls of conscious beings.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>ignored</b> our {{sole right}} to Eretz Israel, {{which is based}} on the {{covenant}} of the Lord with Abraham, our father, and repeated promises in the Tanach. <b>It</b> <b>ignored</b> the aliya of the Ramban and the students of the Vilna Gaon and the Ba'al Shem Tov, and the of Jews who lived in the 'Old Yishuv'.|$|R
5|$|In 2013 the William Boyd-written {{continuation}} novel Solo was released; <b>it</b> <b>ignored</b> Deaver's new timeframe and {{was set in}} 1969.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>it</b> <b>ignored</b> the {{existence}} of German death camps localized outside Poland, i.e. in Germany, Austria, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and other German-occupied countries.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>ignores</b> {{the mass}} {{transfer}} between body compartments {{and across the}} plasma membrane (i.e. intracellular to extracellular transport), which {{has been shown to}} be important for the clearance of molecules such as phosphate.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} {{deterrence}} {{is the idea}} humans are 'hedonists' who seek pleasure and avoid pain, and 'rational calculators' who weigh {{the costs and benefits}} of every action. <b>It</b> <b>ignores</b> the possibility of irrationality and unconscious drives as motivators.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>ignores</b> {{intervening}} pieces while {{jumping to}} its destination, though its destination square must of course be either empty, or occupied by an opponent's piece (in {{which case the}} opponent's piece is captured), just as with any other moving piece.|$|E
60|$|She {{was not to}} be hustled {{from her}} bypath. She had chosen her route, and she meant to travel by <b>it,</b> <b>ignoring</b> short-cuts.|$|R
5000|$|The Court of Appeal erred by {{dissecting}} {{the component}} {{parts of the}} designs, rather than considering their cumulative effect because <b>it</b> <b>ignored</b> the judge’s findings of fact.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some {{people think}} it's Egyptian," [...] Miss Maybough suggested, {{as if she}} had been leading up to the notion, and were anxious not to have <b>it</b> <b>ignored.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>ignores</b> ongoing {{scientific}} {{testing on}} alternative treatments... It {{asks us to}} trust but not to verify. It asks us to legalize the limited use of cannabidiol oil, contrary to federal law. And it asks us to look past the potential for misuse and abuse with criminal intent.|$|E
25|$|If the new-dtags {{feature is}} enabled in the linker (--enable-new-dtags), GNU ld, besides setting the DT_RPATH {{attribute}}, also sets the DT_RUNPATH attribute {{to the same}} string. At run time, if the dynamic linker finds a DT_RUNPATH attribute, <b>it</b> <b>ignores</b> {{the value of the}} DT_RPATH attribute, with the effect that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is checked first and the paths in the DT_RUNPATH attribute are only searched afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The Sarbanes–Oxley Act {{has been}} praised for {{nurturing}} an ethical culture as it forces top management to be transparent and employees {{to be responsible}} for their acts whilst protecting whistleblowers. Indeed, courts have held that top management may be in violation of its obligation to assess and disclose material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting when <b>it</b> <b>ignores</b> an employee's concerns that could impact the company's SEC filings.|$|E
60|$|VIVIE [going to {{the door}} of the kitchen and opening <b>it,</b> <b>ignoring</b> her mother] Now, about supper? [All rise except Mrs Warren] We shall be rather crowded in here, I'm afraid.|$|R
60|$|His frosty manner {{would have}} imposed {{constraint}} upon any man less master of himself than Samoval. But the Count <b>ignored</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>ignoring</b> <b>it</b> delayed {{a moment to}} exchange amiabilities politely with Miss Armytage, before taking at last an unhurried and unperturbed departure.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Chequered Past, a {{compilation}} CD was remastered with participation by {{the band and}} their original producer. Although released by Fantasy Records, <b>it</b> <b>ignored</b> the band's fourth album and their unreleased material.|$|R
25|$|The {{addition}} of one new good to a single-good market allows for opportunity costs {{to be determined}} only in relation to that other good. However, its weakness is that <b>it</b> <b>ignores</b> all other possible choices. Trying {{to solve this problem}} by adding even more goods to the market makes analysis unwieldy. Under these circumstances, economic modelers are forced to choose between goods {{in order to create a}} simple model.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimator}} can be unbiased but not consistent. For example, for an iid sample {x,..., x} {{one can use}} T(X) = x as the estimator of {{the mean}} E. Note that here the sampling distribution of T {{is the same as}} the underlying distribution (for any n, as <b>it</b> <b>ignores</b> all points but the first), so E = E and it is unbiased, but it does not converge to any value.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{approach}} has been widely criticized as ignoring several key factors involved in fisheries management and {{has led to the}} devastating collapse of many fisheries. As a simple calculation, <b>it</b> <b>ignores</b> the size and age of the animal being taken, its reproductive status, and it focuses solely on the species in question, ignoring the damage to the ecosystem caused by the designated level of exploitation and the issue of bycatch. Among conservation biologists it is widely regarded as dangerous and misused.|$|E
500|$|In {{the most}} basic terms, the edict was ignorant {{of the law of}} supply and demand: <b>it</b> <b>ignored</b> the fact that prices might vary from region to region {{according}} to product availability, and <b>it</b> <b>ignored</b> the impact of transportation costs in the retail price of goods. In the judgment of the historian David Potter, the edict was [...] "an act of economic lunacy". The fact that the edict began with a long rhetorical preamble betrays {{at the same time a}} moralizing stance as well as a weak grasp of economics – perhaps simply the wishful thinking that criminalizing a practice was enough to stop it.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the girls}} {{prepare for the}} [...] "Trial of Faith" [...] event, a bear raids the camp and Phoebe becomes {{convinced}} that it ate Roxy. They run into the bear and play dead to make <b>it</b> <b>ignore</b> them.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Haitian {{literature}} was imbued with the prestige of the French language and almost exclusively oriented towards Paris. Touching only the literate francophone minority, <b>it</b> <b>ignored</b> Haitians' daily lives, despite a strong patriotic dimension.|$|R
25|$|Critics of {{this model}} argue that <b>it</b> <b>ignores</b> {{research}} linking domestic violence to substance abuse and psychological problems. Some modern research into the patterns in DV has found {{that women are more}} likely to be physically abusive towards their partner in relationships in which only one partner is violent, which draws the effectiveness of using concepts like male privilege to treat domestic violence into question. Some modern research into predictors of injury from domestic violence suggests that the strongest predictor of injury by domestic violence is participation in reciprocal domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Faraday's law {{strictly}} holds {{only when the}} closed circuit is a loop of infinitely thin wire, and is invalid in other circumstances. <b>It</b> <b>ignores</b> the fact that Faraday's law {{is defined by the}} total, not partial, derivative of magnetic flux and also the fact that EMF is not necessarily confined to a closed path but may also have radial components as discussed below. A different version, the Maxwell–Faraday equation (discussed below), is valid in all circumstances, and when used in conjunction with the Lorentz force law it is consistent with correct application of Faraday's law.|$|E
25|$|While we {{have not}} shown the Venn {{diagrams}} for the constants 0 and 1, they are trivial, being respectively a white box and a dark box, neither one containing a circle. However we could put a circle for x in those boxes, in which case each would denote a function of one argument, x, which returns the same value independently of x, called a constant function. As far as their outputs are concerned, constants and constant functions are indistinguishable; {{the difference is that}} a constant takes no arguments, called a zeroary or nullary operation, while a constant function takes one argument, which <b>it</b> <b>ignores,</b> and is a unary operation.|$|E
50|$|In 1687, Louis XIV {{issued an}} edict against {{witchcraft}} that was rather moderate compared to former ones; <b>it</b> <b>ignored</b> black cats and other lurid fantasies of the witch mania. After 1700, {{the number of}} witches accused and condemned fell rapidly.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} many {{complaints}} about this company for cheating customers. The major complaint is that it forcibly subscribed customers to unwanted content and then deducted their balances. <b>It</b> <b>ignored</b> the government guidelines on the same and continues to do so.|$|R
50|$|One day, {{his father}} {{left him in}} the fields with a horse while he went back home. A robber tried to steal the horse. The hazel-nut child jumped on the horse and pricked <b>it</b> until <b>it</b> <b>ignored</b> the robber and galloped home. The robber was jailed.|$|R
25|$|The Principle of {{computational}} equivalence {{has been}} criticized for being vague, unmathematical, and for not making directly verifiable predictions. It has also been criticized for being contrary to the spirit of research in mathematical logic and computational complexity theory, which seek to make fine-grained distinctions between levels of computational sophistication, and for wrongly conflating different kinds of universality property. Moreover, critics such as Ray Kurzweil have argued that <b>it</b> <b>ignores</b> the distinction between hardware and software; while two computers may be equivalent in power, it does not follow that any two programs they might run are also equivalent. Others suggest it {{is little more than a}} rechristening of the Church–Turing thesis.|$|E
25|$|A. L. Goodhart, Professor at Oxford, {{opposed the}} view that, because the judges were {{appointed}} by the victors, the Tribunal was not impartial {{and could not be}} regarded as a court in the true sense. He wrote: Attractive as this argument may sound in theory, <b>it</b> <b>ignores</b> the fact that it runs counter to the administration of law in every country. If it were true then no spy could be given a legal trial, because his case is always heard by judges representing the enemy country. Yet no one has ever argued that in such cases it was necessary to call on neutral judges. The prisoner has the right to demand that his judges shall be fair, but not that they shall be neutral. As Lord Writ has pointed out, the same principle is applicable to ordinary criminal law because 'a burglar cannot complain that he is being tried by a jury of honest citizens'.|$|E
500|$|The Gesta Hungarorum {{says that}} Árpád took [...] "an oath {{of the leading}} men and warriors of Hungary," [...] and [...] "had his son, Prince Zoltán elevated" [...] to prince in his life. However, the {{reliability}} of this report and {{the list of the}} grand princes in the Gesta Hungarorum is dubious. For instance, <b>it</b> <b>ignores</b> Fajsz, who ruled when Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus was completing his De Administrando Imperio around 950.|$|E
5000|$|... (c) <b>it</b> <b>ignored</b> the {{evidence}} of such other districts, {{as well as other}} evidence that the state had decided that a way to increase black voting strength was to adopt a plan that [...] "unpacked" [...] the high concentration of minority voters in a few majority-minority districts.|$|R
5000|$|I'll Take My Stand was {{attacked}} at the time, and since, as a reactionary and romanticized {{defense of the}} Old South and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. <b>It</b> <b>ignored</b> slavery and denounced [...] "progress", for example, and some critics considered it to be moved by nostalgia.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, Kendall-Jackson {{rejected}} the California wine industry's trend toward vineyard-specific wine labeling. <b>It</b> <b>ignored</b> {{the concept of}} terroir in favor of blending wines from different regions to achieve desired wine characteristics. They reversed that direction in the mid-2000s, along with a push to upgrade their quality.|$|R
