The accuracy {{of most of the}} latest gravity <b>field</b> <b>models</b> in terms of precise orbit determination is currently at cm level. Improvement in the Earth gravity <b>field</b> <b>modelling</b> is anticipated as quantitative and qualitative data (in particular from low earth orbit satellites) become available in the future. Such expectations require that the accuracy and precision of existing gravity <b>field</b> <b>models</b> be assessed. The validation of gravity <b>field</b> <b>models</b> in terms of satellite orbit determination is often based on the difference between the observed and computed range. The resulting range residuals are considered an important index when determining the accuracy of the gravity models and hence the satellite orbits. In this contribution we investigate the general improvement in gravity <b>field</b> <b>modelling</b> over a period of 15 years. The orbit accuracy of twelve gravity <b>field</b> <b>models</b> (both satellite-only and combined models) were assessed by analysing seven months of data from LAGEOS 1 and 2 using HartRAO analysis software.

40|$|In this study, {{continuous}} <b>field</b> <b>models</b> of geochemical landscapes {{were obtained}} by interpolating stream sediment geochemical data while discrete <b>field</b> <b>models</b> of geochemical landscapes {{were obtained by}} attributing stream sediment geochemical data to their sample catchment basins. This study aimed to: (1) compare and contrast anomaly maps derived from continuous and discrete <b>field</b> <b>models</b> of stream sediment geochemical landscapes; and (2) determine which empirical frequency distributions – those of original point data or those of pixels values in models of stream sediment geochemical landscapes – are more useful in mapping of anomalies in such geochemical landscapes. Anomalies were mapped by using the mean+ 2 SDEV (standard deviation), median+ 2 MAD (median absolute deviation) and concentration–area (C–A) fractal methods of identifying threshold values in a geochemical data set. The {{results of the study}} in the Aroroy gold district (Philippines) highlight the following findings. In mapping of anomalies in either continuous or discrete <b>field</b> <b>models</b> of stream sediment geochemical landscapes, the C–A fractal method performs best, followed by the median+ 2 MAD method and then by the mean+ 2 SDEV method. Anomalies mapped in discrete <b>field</b> <b>models,</b> compared to anomalies mapped in continuous <b>field</b> <b>models,</b> of stream sediment geochemical landscapes mostly have stronger positive spatial associations with the known epithermal Au deposit occurrences in the study area. Empirical frequency distributions of either the original point data or the pixels values in the models of stream sediment geochemical landscapes are similarly useful in applying the C–A fractal method, but not in applying either the median+ 2 MAD or mean+ 2 SDEV method, to map anomalies in either continuous or discrete <b>field</b> <b>models</b> of such geochemical landscapes...|$|R

These models are based on various geomagnetic field data sets ranging from Earth surface magnetic observatory measurements to low-Earth orbit satellites equipped with highly sensitive and accurate magnetometers. Although these <b>field</b> <b>models</b> are derived by fitting harmonic functions to data distributed across the Earth, they are applied on regional scales within fixed boundaries in many instances and one can therefore question how well do these models perform on restricted areas. Three recently published global geomagnetic <b>field</b> <b>models,</b> IGRF- 12, CHAOS- 6 and POMME- 10, have been statistically evaluated over Southern Africa using repeat station data as well as measurements from 4 INTERMAGNET observatories located at Hermanus and Hartebeesthoek in South Africa as well as Tsumeb and Keetmanshoop in Namibia for 2015. Apart from the observatory data, the field survey repeat station data do not form part of the data set on which these global <b>field</b> <b>models</b> are based and therefore {{can be regarded as}} an independent test of these <b>field</b> <b>models</b> over an area like Southern Africa which is well known for its rapid change of the geomagnetic field.
