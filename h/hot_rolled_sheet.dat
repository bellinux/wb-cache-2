Within the machine the steel is passed between sets of rotating roller brushes that spin on an axis perpendicular to the sheet's direction of travel. The roller brush exterior is an engineered abrasive, similar to Scotchbrite, that makes contact with the steel under pressure. Each roller brush spins against the steel at a speed of 900 to 1000 revolutions per minute, [...] "scrubbing away" [...] the outer layers of mill scale - hematite and magnetite - {{and most of the}} inner layer, wustite. The remaining wustite layer is only a few micrometres thick and highly polished to a smooth surface. Three such roller brushes are typically applied to each surface of the steel sheet, for a total of six roller brushes per SCS brushing machine. Numerous spray nozzles within the brushing machine provide water to rinse the removed scale and any other debris from the steel surface and to cool the friction heat generated in the brushes. The water is filtered and re-used in this closed-loop rinsing/filtering system.|$|E

The present work {{studied the}} {{microstructure}} of near-surface deformed layers and their evolution from the transfer slab {{to the cold}} rolled final gauge sheet of an AA 3104 aluminium alloy. Electron microscopy of ultramicrotomed cross-sections revealed two types of near-surface deformed layers, i. e. type A and type B, both with different microstructures to the underlying bulk alloy. A typical feature of the deformed layers is the nano-sized ultrafine grains, with diameters ≤ 200 nm for the type A and ≤ 500 nm for the type B deformed layer. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) indicated that oxide particles are present along grain boundaries within the type A deformed layer, while the type B deformed layer is free of oxide particles.
