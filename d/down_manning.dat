5|$|On {{the first}} play of the drive, Tennessee {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty, pushing the Volunteers back toward their goal line. A Tennessee rush was stopped for no gain, then Stewart picked up eight yards on a running play. Needing eight yards for a first <b>down,</b> <b>Manning</b> threw an 11-yard pass to Kent for the first down. On the next play, Manning completed a 43-yard toss to Kent, driving the Volunteers into the Virginia Tech half of the field. Manning's next throw was a 35-yard touchdown throw to Marcus Nash. The extra point was good, and Tennessee took a 140 lead with 1:08 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Tennessee in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a first-and-10 at the Virginia Tech 37-yard line after a long punt return. Stewart ran twice for six yards, then Manning completed a pass to Kent at the 20-yard line for a first <b>down.</b> <b>Manning</b> then completed a pass to Nash for another first down at the Tech five-yard line. Two plays later, Stewart scored his third touchdown of {{the game with a}} five-yard run to {{the right side of the}} field.

5|$|In the playoffs, the Pittsburgh Steelers {{visited the}} RCA Dome {{for the second}} AFC divisional playoff game of the 2005 season. In the fourth quarter {{with only a few}} minutes left in the game, Manning threw what looked to be the game-ending {{interception}} to safety Troy Polamalu, but the interception was overturned (a call the NFL later admitted was incorrect). The Colts went on to score, and got the ball back down three points {{near the end of the}} game. On fourth <b>down,</b> <b>Manning</b> was sacked near his own goal line, and the game seemed to be over as the Steelers were one yard from a touchdown. On the next play, the ball was fumbled by running back Jerome Bettis and picked up by Colts defender Nick Harper who appeared to have a clear path down the sideline for what might have been the game-winning score. However, Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger dove in front of Harper and tackled him by the leg, saving a touchdown. Then the Colts drove down the field to the Steelers 27-yard line, before Mike Vanderjagt missed a field goal as time ran out.|$|E

50|$|Following another Chargers punt, Broncos {{returner}} Eric Decker broke several tackles {{as he ran}} {{the ball}} back 47 yards, but tripped himself to the ground without being touched at the San Diego 30-yard line. The Broncos then drove to the 4-yard line; on third <b>down,</b> <b>Manning</b> threw a pass to Decker in the end zone, but linebacker Darrell Stuckey knocked the ball from Deckers grasp and Donald Butler managed to intercept it near {{the back of the}} goal line. It was the first red zone interception thrown by Manning all season. Denver kick returner Trindon Holliday ran the second half kickoff 37 yards to the 36-yard line, setting up a 47-yard drive that ended with Matt Praters 45-yard field goal, increasing the teams lead to 17-0. On their next drive, the Broncos drove to the San Diego 29-yard line but this time Prater missed from 47 yards, his first miss of the season from under 50.|$|E
50|$|Manning {{erupted in}} the first half, {{completing}} 14 of 17 throws with three touchdown throws to Marvin Harrison along with an Edgerrin James rushing score while the Patriots shot themselves in the foot with penalties, ultimately committing fifteen fouls eating up 135 yards and trailing the Colts 28-7. But {{from the start of}} the second half the Patriots shut <b>down</b> <b>Manning,</b> limiting him to just four completions in 13 throws. Following a Manning interception in the third quarter a Terry Allen touchdown catch put the Patriots down 28-14, and was followed by 17 unanswered Patriots points; Marcus Pollard fumbled the ball to Ty Law and Drew Bledsoe passes to Terry Glenn led to a three-yard Ben Coates touchdown catch. After Law forced a Manning three-and-out Bledsoe marched the Patriots down field and connected with Coates for a 10-yard tying touchdown with three minutes to go. James was then hammered by Tebucky Jones and fumbled the ball to Brandon Mitchell, and from there the Patriots reached range for Adam Vinatieri's 26-yard game-winner with 35 seconds left in a 31-28 Patriots triumph.|$|E

50|$|The Colts {{suffered}} {{their first}} {{defeat of the}} season, 21-14, at {{the hand of the}} Dallas Cowboys and became the last team to lose during the 2006 NFL season. The game was full of turnovers, and neither team could take care of the scoring opportunities. Colts QB Peyton Manning threw two interceptions and one of those was returned for a touchdown by Cowboys OLB Kevin Burnett early in the second half. The first quarter was back-and-forth as each possession ended with turnover after turnover. After Cowboys QB Tony Romo was sacked by DE Dwight Freeney, Colts WR Marvin Harrison fumbled, and after the Cowboys punted, Manning was sacked by Jay Ratliff and Bradie James recovered the fumble. After a couple punts by both teams, Peyton Manning & Co. pushed the Cowboys deep in their own territory thanks to the great rushing by rookie RB Joseph Addai. The Colts reached the 4-yard line, and on third <b>down,</b> <b>Manning</b> attempted a pass to the endzone, but in a controversial situation, SS Roy Williams nudged TE Dallas Clark near the end zone, and while Clark fell down, Williams intercepted a Peyton Manning pass {{for the second time in}} his career, and gave the Cowboys the ball at their own 7-yard line. The Cowboys scored all of their points in the second half after a first half that was full of turnovers.|$|E
50|$|Lucas resumes {{the hunt}} along with Whip's friend, Mike, and another crew member. After {{enduring}} stormy weather {{they decide to}} head back to shore and continue the hunt the next day. The Squid attacks the boat before they make it to shore, pulling a crew member off with its tentacle and knocking a cargo net on Mike, injuring him. It then attacks Lucas in the helm who fires a couple of shots with his gun at its tentacles. The squid then bites a hole in the hull. With water pouring in, it pulls the entire boat underwater. Whip, after learning that Mike went out to help Lucas comes to the rescue and, finding Mike holding onto a buoy, pulls him {{out of the water and}} takes him to the hospital. Whip then agrees to go out and hunt the giant squid but only if he can use his boat and Graves goes with him. He is also accompanied by coast guard officer, Lt. Kathryn Marcus (Karen Sillas), Dr. Talley, and Manning. They plan to snare the squid, reel it in, and shoot it multiple times with darts full of cyanide. The plan succeeds and the squid appears dead. But when the ship’s engine breaks <b>down,</b> <b>Manning</b> reveals that he filled the darts with tranquilizer instead of cyanide so he could take the squid alive back to Sea Land. Whip tries to cut the squid loose, but it wakes up and attacks the ship. Talley, Graves, and Manning are eaten. A coast guard helicopter arrives in time to pick up Kathryn and Whip. As he boards the helicopter, Whip fends the squid off with an axe, chopping open several extra fuel drums and has Kathryn use a flare gun to light his boat on fire cause an explosion that incinerates the squid. The helicopter flies them back to the shore where they reunite with Whip's daughter Dana (Missy Crider).|$|E
