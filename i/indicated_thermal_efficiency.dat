Firstly, the engine performance and emissions have been explored by sweeping SOI 1 and split percentage for the load of 0. 9 [*]MPa IMEP at an engine speed of 1500 [*]rpm. Then, the double-injection strategy has been tested for load expansion compared with single-injection. The results indicate that, with the fixed CA 50, the peak HRR is reduced by advancing SOI 1 and increasing split percentage gradually.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach for}} improving the efficiency of internal combustion engines is to employ a working fluid with a high specific heat ratio such as the noble gas argon. Moreover, all harmful emissions are eliminated when the intake charge is composed of oxygen, nonreactive argon, and hydrogen fuel.

Use was made of a glow plug and a multiple-strike spark plug. The glow plug was found to provide reliable ignition and smooth engine operation. It caused the hydrogen to ignite almost immediately upon the start of injection. Indicated mean effective pressures were {{on the order of}} 1. 3 MPa for equivalence ratios between 0. 1 and 0. 4 at a compression ratio of 18.

Operation with the multiple-strike spark system yielded similar values for IMEP and efficiency, but gave rise to large cycle-to-cycle variations in the delay between the beginning of injection and ignition. Large ignition delays were associated with large amplitude pressure waves in the combustion chamber. The measured NO(x) concentrations in the exhaust gas were of the order of 50 - 100 ppm.

This theoretical study focuses on replacing the traditional condenser in a fossil fuel power station with a boiling condenser (BC), which operates {{in a similar manner}} to the core of a boiling water reactor at a nuclear power plant (Sharifpur, 2007). The system was theoretically tested at the Komati Power Station, South Africa's oldest power station. The power station presented an average low-grade waste heat source. The BC cycle was theoretically tested with several working fluids and numerous different configurations. Several of the theoretical configurations <b>indicated</b> increased <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the cycle. The BC cycle configurations were also tested in two theoretical scenarios. Thirty configurations and 103 working fluids were tested in these configurations.

A 2. 4 % increase in <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> was obtained for the mentioned theoretical implementation of this configuration. The working fluid tested in this configuration was ethanol. This configuration also indicated a 7. 6 MW generating capacity. The increased <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the power station presents benefits not only in increasing the available capacity on South Africa's strained grid, but also environmental benefits. The mentioned reduction of 7. 6 MW in heat released into the atmosphere also indicated a direct environmental benefit.

The results show that IMEP {{can be used as}} the optimization objective in the uniflow scavenging system; intake port height is the main factor to the delivery ratio, while exhaust port height is the main to engine trapping ratio, scavenging efficiency and indicated thermal efficiency; exhaust port height is the most important factor to effect the gas exchange process of OP 2 S-GDI engine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} the use of ethanol in SI engine, its performance and emission characteristics based on the works of different researchers and scientist available in the literature. The advantages of using ethanol as SI engine fuel include its greenness, renewability, higher availability and usability in near future, higher octane number, higher volumetric efficiency, higher compression ratio and biodegradability. Ethanol can be produced biologically from sugarcane, crop residues, cellulose, agricultural biomass, municipal waste etc. The experiment conducted by different researchers and their experimental results shows that brake specific fuel consumption, brake torque, <b>indicated</b> power, <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> increases or decreases depending upon the operating condition of the engine and ethanol percentage in the ethanol-gasoline blends. However, the compression ratio always increases due to enhancement of the octane number of the blend. On the other hand volumetric efficiency increases with the increase in ethanol percentage in the blends. Also there is a significant reduction in the emission of unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide with ethanol and ethanol gasoline blend. But the CO 2 emission is more with ethanol and NOx emission increases or decreases depending upon the engine operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicro-cogeneration Stirling {{engines are}} {{promising}} for residential applications. This work {{focuses on the}} experimental and numerical analyses of a commercial unit generating 8 kW of hot water and 1 kW of electricity burning natural gas. Measurements are coupled to a detailed model based on a modification of Urieli and Berchowitz's work. The results <b>indicate</b> that the <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{is influenced by the}} water loop inlet temperature, varying from 90 % at 30 °C to 84 % at 70 °C (HHV-based). The measured and simulated powers of the engine are in the 900 - 964  W range depending on the water temperature and differ by less than 4 %. Net electric efficiency of the engine is 15 % and of the whole cogeneration unit above 9 % (HHV-based). Helium instead of Nitrogen as working fluid is expected to increase the performance...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Washington State UniversityIn this study, work on {{developing}} {{a small scale}} internal combustion engine operating on a four-stroke principle is conducted. To mitigate the parasitic losses, a complaint engine concept is proposed in which the piston-cylinder assembly {{is replaced by a}} flexible cavity. This approach offers various advantages, such as mitigating friction and blow-by losses, fuel-flexibility, and a simpler design. The study encompasses mathematical modeling, feasibility analysis, and testing of a prototype engine. A physics-based lumped-parameter model is developed to predict the engine performance for a range of equivalence ratios at various load conditions in both open and closed cycle operations. The open and closed cycle results showed similarities. For instance, both the cycles showed that for a fixed load, increasing the heat input results in increase of stroke length and efficiency. However, the predictions from the cycles differed numerically in terms of efficiency, operating frequency etc. For example, the <b>indicated</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> obtained from open and closed cycles were 38. 4 % and 47. 6 %, respectively. It has been realized that when modeling the compliant engine in a more realistic way, an open cycle would be more appropriate. The open cycle results highlight some unique features of the complaint engine. For instance, the engine volume excursions are found to be dependent on the heat input or equivalence ratio and load condition. To ascertain the feasibility of a practical engine, super compliant structures fabricated from metals and, or composites that can sustain extreme pressures and temperatures are evaluated. In addition, a prototype engine is realized to practically demonstrate the compliant engine concept. The engine is motored to estimate the parasitic losses at resonant operation, and the results are presented {{in the form of an}} energy flow diagram. The results showed that friction losses associated with the flexible cavity are less than that in a piston-cylinder assembly. An example simulation based on open cycle with practical engine parameters showed that the ratio of friction work to indicated work is about 8 %; less than targeted 10 %. This result reinforces that a compliant resonant engine has the potential to outperform the contemporary engines at small scale.
