25|$|Because Wyclef {{produced}} {{the majority of}} the tracks on Can-I-Bus, Williams blamed him for the general dissatisfaction with Can-I-Bus and cut ties with him, going as far as to diss Wyclef, most notably on the title track of his second album ("You mad at the last album? <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> it / Yo, I can't call it, motherfucking Wyclef spoiled it!"). Said album, 2000 B.C., was also released to mixed feelings and reviews—the latter once more focusing on the lack of topical variety and uninspired production—and also suffered from very little promotion by Universal Records.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Getzlaf {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Calgary Flames defencemen Mark Giordano and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno. In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Selänne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official. He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to understand that there are eyes and ears on us all the time. Fortunately enough, nobody heard it. If you can read lips, it's a little bit harder, and <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> that. That's a thing that you won't hear from me again. I hope I didn't offend anybody outside the circle that we trust." ...|$|E
500|$|Press {{framing of}} Reagan changed {{from that of}} just helpmate and {{protector}} to someone with hidden power. As {{the image of her}} as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny that she was the power behind the throne. At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff. She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying [...] "In no way do <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> it." [...] She wrote in her memoirs, [...] "I don't think I was as bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted," [...] but went on, [...] "However the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. I always did that for Ronnie, and I always will." ...|$|E

500|$|Some media commentators, such as Howard Kurtz and Toby Harnden, criticized {{what they}} {{perceived}} as {{a rush to judgment}} about the shooter's motivation, disputing suggestions that the shooting {{was the result of the}} Tea Party movement or anything in connection to Palin. Paul Krugman wrote an op-ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic. With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting, Keith Olbermann said, [...] "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no place in our Democracy, and <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence." [...] Jon Stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting, but, [...] "For all the hyperbole and vitriol that's become a part of our political process—when the reality of that rhetoric, when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified. ... Maybe it helps us to remember to match our rhetoric with reality more often." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after being}} {{questioned}} by ABC about the more explicit IMs – {{and before they}} had been publicly revealed – Foley resigned from Congress.

2500|$|In a 2013 editorial, Gupta {{announced}} {{that in the}} process of working on a documentary about marijuana he had changed his mind about the drug's risks and benefits. Gupta had previously criticized laws that allowed patient access to medical marijuana, but he reversed his stance, saying, [...] "I am here to apologize," [...] and, [...] "We have been terribly and systematically misled for nearly 70 years in the United States, and <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> my own role in that."

2500|$|In 1982, Seeger {{performed}} at a benefit concert for Poland's Solidarity resistance movement. His biographer David Dunaway considers {{this the first}} public manifestation of Seeger's decades-long personal dislike of communism in its Soviet form. In the late 1980s Seeger also expressed disapproval of violent revolutions, remarking to an interviewer {{that he was really}} in favor of incremental change and that [...] "the most lasting revolutions are those that take place over a period of time." [...] In his autobiography Where Have All the Flowers Gone (1993, 1997, reissued in 2009), Seeger wrote, [...] "Should <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> all this? I think so." [...] He went on to put his thinking in context: ...|$|E
2500|$|For years afterwards, Frazier {{retained}} his bitterness towards Ali {{and suggested}} that Ali's battle with Parkinson's syndrome {{was a form of}} divine retribution for his earlier behavior. In 2001, Ali apologized to Frazier via a New York Times article, saying [...] "In a way, Joe's right. I said {{a lot of things in}} the heat of the moment that I shouldn't have said. Called him names I shouldn't have called him. <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> that. I'm sorry. It was all meant to promote the fight". Frazier reportedly [...] "embraced it", though he later retorted that Ali only apologized to a newspaper, not to him. He said: [...] "I'm still waiting [...] to say it to me." [...] To this Ali responded: [...] "If you see Frazier, you tell him he's still a gorilla." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 21, 2015, Madonna rescheduled {{the first}} five dates of the tour and moved them to January 20, 23, 24, 27 and 28 in 2016. The singer {{confirmed}} that arrangement logistics {{was the cause of}} the postponement. She released a statement saying, [...] "As my fans already know, the show has to be perfect. Assembling all the elements will require more time than we realized. <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> any inconvenience this may cause my fans." [...] According to Billboard, Rebel Heart is an all-arena tour, and would visit cities where Madonna has not performed before. The tour visited Australia and New Zealand in early 2016, and was the singer's first visit to Australia in more than 20 years, having last toured there with The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993, and her first time in New Zealand. Philippines was added to the tour itinerary, for two performances at SM Mall of Asia in February 2016.|$|E

2500|$|All of Audioslave's lyrics {{were written}} by Cornell, whilst all four members were {{credited}} with writing the music. Their songwriting process was described by Wilk as [...] "more collaborative" [...] and [...] "satisfying" [...] than Rage Against the Machine's, which was [...] "a battle creatively". Cornell, for his part, saw Soundgarden's songwriting method as inferior to Audioslave's. Cornell's lyrics were mostly apolitical; Audioslave's Morello referred to them as [...] "haunted, existential poetry." [...] They were characterized by his cryptic approach, often dealing with themes of existentialism, love, hedonism, spirituality and Christianity. Cornell's battle with addiction to prescription drugs and alcoholism was a defining factor in the writing and recording process. Even though the singer admitted that he was [...] "never able to write effectively" [...] while drinking, and attended rehab after recording the debut album, Morello stated that Revelations was [...] "the first record [...] didn't smoke, drink or take drugs through the recording." [...] However, Morello said: [...] "Chris was stone sober during the making of our Out of Exile album. Chris was also sober during the making of Revelations and prior to recording he gave up smoking as well. <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> any confusion or concern that was stirred up by the original article. Sobriety can {{be a matter of}} life or death and Chris' courage in maintaining his health for years has been an inspiration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirk Fordham, Chief of Staff to Tom Reynolds {{and former}} Chief of Staff to Foley, {{said that he}} was with Foley on September 29, 2006, when ABC confronted him with the {{explicit}} messages [...] before they were publicized. [...] Fordham then visited GOP headquarters to inform Reynolds and Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert; he returned with a one-sentence resignation letter that Foley signed. Hastert and Reynolds {{let it be known that}} if Foley didn't resign, he would be expelled from the House. That same day, Foley tendered his resignation to Hastert as well as Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Foley said in a statement, [...] "I am deeply sorry and <b>I</b> <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> letting down my family and the people of Florida I have had the privilege to represent." [...] Once the news report became more widely known, Foley's chances of retaining his seat in Congress were limited. Hastert said in an October 2 press conference that he would have demanded Foley's expulsion from the House had he tried to stay in office. (Ironically, Hastert himself was described by a Federal District Court judge as a [...] "serial child molester", and jailed in 2016, for illegally structuring bank withdrawals in an attempt to hide his own sexual abuse of four high school boys, during his pre-Congressional career [...] ). Even if Foley had tried to get his seat back, polls showed him losing badly to his Democratic opponent, Tim Mahoney.|$|E
