In patients with cancer, stimulation index showed apparently as low as an average of 38 compared with 82 of non-cancer patients. Furthermore, the level of stimulation index was a corresponding correlation to age in which low activation was presented in the elderly. According to diseased organs, the weak response of stimulation index against PHA were observed in patients with the carcinoma of the esophagus and the lung.

40|$|Based {{upon the}} knowledges of animal experiments, {{some of the}} basic {{problems}} were discussed on the application of immunotherapy in human cancers. It was stressed, from our animal experiments, that the immunological eradication of residual tumor cells was rather strictly limitted in the immune host, and the adequate cytoreduction by anticancer agents was essential for the establishment of successful immunotherapy. Since the analysis of specific antigens in individual human cancers is still difficult at present situation, it was rational to use cryoreserved autologous cancer cells as specific antigen for immunotherapy. The clinical use of <b>immunopotentiators</b> should be reevaluated carefully for dose and route of administeration, and it was proven that <b>immunopotentiators</b> might enhance the tumor death in experimental mice, de pending on the minute differences of their doses.

40|$|The authors {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} prepartum <b>immunopotentiators</b> administered during late gestation on postpartum fertility, IgG levels and calf viability. Fifty buffalo were divided into five groups (10 animals in each group). Group I was the control group. Each animal in Group II received 30 ml intramuscularly of viteselen (1. 7 mg sodium selenium and 150 mg vitamin E/ml). Each animal in Group III received a subcutaneous injection of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) at 0. 5 ml. In Group IV, each animal received 12. 5 ml of levamisole hydrochloride intramuscularly, while those in Group V received 10 ml of ultra-corn subcutaneously. The <b>immunopotentiators</b> were administered according to each group 60 days prior to the anticipated date of parturition. Postpartum fertility was assessed by close observation and rectal examination after parturition. Colostrum from the dams and sera from the newborn were collected to estimate the level of immunoglobulin (IgG). Body weight, growth rate and viability of the calves were recorded after parturition. Prepartum treatment with viteselen reduced the period of foetal membrane expulsion by 2 h {{compared to the other}} groups. Concomitantly, the uterine involution period was significantly shorter in animals treated with viteselen and ultra-corn than in the other groups. Injection of viteselen, BCG or ultra-corn significantly reduced the calving to the first oestrus interval and length of postpartum service period (by 57, 54, 48 days and 67, 57, 44 days, respectively) than the levamisole group. The IgG level was significantly higher in both the colostrum of the dam and in newborn serum after administration of immunopotentiating agents. Furthermore, the viteselen injection resulted in a significantly higher level of IgG in both dam colostrum (at parturition) and calf serum in comparison to the other groups. The calves from viteselen and ultra-corn treated dams showed a higher growth rate and better health condition than the controls. Prepartum administration of <b>immunopotentiators</b> appears to be beneficial, promising and offer improvements to postpartum reproductive performance and calf viability in Egyptian buffalo.

40|$|Vaccines have {{successfully}} eradicated {{a large number}} of diseases. However, some infectious diseases (such as HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis or Bacillus anthracis) keep spreading since there is no vaccine to prevent them. One way to overcome this issue is the development of new adjuvant formulations which are able to induce the appropriate immune response without sacrificing safety. Lymph nodes are the site of lymphocyte priming by antigen-presenting cells and subsequent adaptive immune response, and are a promising target for vaccine formulations. In this review, we describe the properties of different polymer-based (e. g., poly lactic-co-glycolic acid, poly lactic acid …) particulate adjuvants as innovative systems, capable of co-delivering <b>immunopotentiators</b> and antigens. We point out how these nanoparticles enhance the delivery of antigens, and how their physicochemical properties modify their uptake by antigen-presenting cells and their migration into lymph nodes. We describe why polymeric nanoparticles increase the persistence into lymph nodes and promote a mature immune response. We also emphasize how nanodelivery directs the response to a specific antigen and allows the induction of a cytotoxic immune response, essential for the fight against intracellular pathogens or cancer. Finally, we highlight the interest of the association between polymer-based vaccines and <b>immunopotentiators,</b> which can potentiate the effect of the molecule by directing it to the appropriate compartment and reducing its toxicity...|$|R

The immune response administrated with half-dose of monovalent vaccine plus CVCVA 5 were higher than those of one dose of monovalent vaccine without <b>immunopotentiators</b> as measured by levels of antibodies from serum, tears and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and cytokines of IFNγ and IL- 4 from serum. Vaccines included the univalent vaccine of Newcastle Disease virus (ND), Egg Drop Syndrome virus (EDS), Infectious Bronchitis virus (IB), and Infectious Bursal Disease virus (IBD). The CVCVA 5 also improved the immune response of both ND and IBD vaccines with less dosage. The sterile protective immunity was monitored with one- or a half-dose of adjuvanted ND vaccine or one dose of adjuvanted IBD vaccine, respectively. The improved immune efficacy was observed in a half-dose of adjuvanted bivalent vaccines compared to one dose of vaccines without CVCVA 5 as measured by the antibody levels, including bivalent vaccine of ND-H 9, ND-IB, and ND-IBD. The CVCVA 5 also boosted the immune efficacy of the tetravalent vaccine (ND-IB-EDS-H 9). A half-dose of adjuvanted commercial vaccine or 75 % antigen-sparing adjuvanted vaccine elicited similar antibody levels to those of one dose non-adjuvanted commercial vaccines.

SIgA serves as {{the first line of}} defense against microorganisms through a mechanism called immune exclusion. In addition, SIgA adheres selectively to M cells in intestinal Peyer's patches, thus mediating the transepithelial transport of the Ab molecule from the intestinal lumen to underlying gut-associated organized lymphoid tissue. In Peyer's patches, SIgA binds and is internalized by dendritic cells in the subepithelial dome region. When used as carrier for Ags in oral immunization, SIgA induces mucosal and systemic responses associated with production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and limits activation of dendritic cells. In terms of humoral immunity at mucosal surfaces, SIgA appears thus to combine properties of a neutralizing agent (immune exclusion) and of a mucosal <b>immunopotentiator</b> inducing effector immune responses in a noninflammatory context favorable to preserve local homeostasis of the gastrointestinal trac...|$|E
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{effectiveness}} of OK- 432, <b>immunopotentiator</b> was intravenously used. The tumor-bearing host was apparently stimulated via NK activity and {{increased the number of}} T cells and B cells. It helps immunodepressed host to level up quickly. However, further effective immunostimulation beyond the normal range could not be expected. A new combined method should be found to be immunopotentiated even for the uncompromized host. Recently, a new immunostimulant derived from streptococcus, OK- 432, was widely used for the treatment of cancer in Japan. The cytostatic and cytotoxic actions of OK- 432 for cancer cells have been made clear by in vitro and vivo study. It, however, is not clear as to how the developing immunostimulated states differ on the condition of admistering route, dosis or time-intlrval. In this series, the effects of intravenous administration of OK- 432 as the host immunostimulator were compared with those of conventional subcutaneous administration...|$|E
40|$|Nanotechnology and {{nanoparticles}} are {{one type}} of vaccine delivery system. Potentially, the most exciting nanoparticle for vaccine development is our Self-Assembling Protein Nanoparticles (SAPNs). Based off of coiled-coil oligomerization domains, SAPNs self-assemble into particles that are about {{the size and shape}} of small icosahedral viruses. Studies have demonstrated that SAPNs are effective vaccine candidates, inducing immune responses as well as protection for malaria, toxoplasmosis, influenza, and SARS. While effective, one missing component for SAPNs is the presence of an <b>immunopotentiator.</b> We have sought to resolve this problem by generating Self-Adjuvanted SAPNs. These SAPNs contain a small concentration of flagellin, a PAMP, known activate both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Self-Adjuvanted SAPNs closely mimic the benefits of both whole organism vaccines as well as subunit vaccines. They contain a high concentration of antigens and immunostimilatory molecules in a fixed unit like a whole organism, while being specifically targeted to only optimal vaccine targets...|$|E
40|$|Antitumor {{substances}} (Fractions Vi and VII) prepared {{from the}} NaOH extract of pine cone significantly stimulated the lodinatlon (incorporation of radioactive iodine into an acid-insoluble fraction) of human peripheral blood adherent mononuclear cells, polymer-phonuclear cells (PMN), and human promyelocytic leukemic HL- 60 cells. in contrast, these fractions {{did not significantly}} increase the iodination of nonadherent mononuclear cells, red blood cells, other human leukemic cell lines (U- 937, THP- 1, K- 562), human diploid fibroblast (UT 2 OLu), or mouse cell lines (L- 929, J 774. 1). lodination of HL- 60 cells, which were induced to differentiate by treatment with either retinoic acid or tumor necrosis factor, were stimulated less than untreated cells. The stimulation of iodination of both PMN and HL- 60 cells required the continuous presence of these fractions and was almost completely abolished {{by the presence of}} myeloperoxidase inhibitors. The stimu-lation activity of these fractions was generally higher than that of various other <b>immunopotentiators.</b> Possible mechanisms of extract stimulation of myeioperoxidase-containing cell lodinatlon are discussed.

40|$|Fifty-five {{patients}} with advanced lung cancer were divided at random into three groups. The {{first group of}} 19 patients was treated with OK- 432 administered intramuscularly in addition to combination chemotherapy. The second group of 18 patients was treated with PSK in addition to combination chemotherapy. The third group of 18 patients was treated with combination chemotherapy only. There {{were no significant differences}} in age, histological type, extent of disease, Performance status or initial chemotherapy between the three treatment groups. The median survival was longer in the patients who received OK- 432 (7. 5 months) than that of the patients who received either PSK (7. 0 months) or no immunotherapy (5. 8 months), but this difference was not statistically significant. The degree of myelosuppression induced by the combination chemotherapy and the frequency of febrile episodes were less in the groups administered OK- 432 and PSK. These results suggest that these <b>immunopotentiators,</b> especially OK- 432, may be useful immunotherapeutic agents in combination with chemotherapy in advanced stages of lung cancer...|$|R
40|$|Background: Currently, no {{licensed}} therapy can thoroughly eradicate hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{from the}} body, including interferon a and inhibitors of HBV reverse-transcription. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) {{seem to be}} a promising tool for treating HBV, but had no effect on the pre-existing HBV covalently closed circular DNA. Because {{it is very difficult to}} thoroughly eradicate HBV with unique siRNAs, upgrading the immune response is the best method for fighting HBV infection. Here, we aim to explore the immune response of transgenic mice to HBV vaccination after long-term treatment with siRNAs and develop a therapeutic approach that combines siRNAs with <b>immunopotentiators.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: To explore the response of transgenic mice to hepatitis B vaccine, innate and acquired immunity were detected after long-term treatment with siRNAs and vaccination. Antiviral cytokines and level of anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody (HBsAg-Ab) were measured after three injections of hepatitis B vaccine. Results: Functional analyses indicated that toll-like receptor-mediated innate immune responses were reinforced, and antiviral cytokines were significantly increased, especially in the pSilencer 4. 1 /HBV groups. Analysis of CD 80 +/CD 86 + dendritic cells in the mouse liver indicated that dendritic cell antigen presentation was strengthened. Furthermore, th...|$|R
