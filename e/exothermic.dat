5|$|Because {{they are}} {{strongly}} oxidative, many oxygen-xenon compounds are toxic; {{they are also}} explosive (highly <b>exothermic),</b> breaking down to elemental xenon and diatomic oxygen (O2) with much stronger chemical bonds than the xenon compounds.|$|E
5|$|The element iron {{can combine}} with {{chlorine}} at high temperatures {{in a strong}} <b>exothermic</b> reaction, creating a chlorine-iron fire. Chlorine-iron fires are a risk in chemical process plants, {{where much of the}} pipework that carries chlorine gas is made of steel.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, <b>exothermic</b> welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine has two solid forms, α- and β-fluorine. The latter {{crystallizes}} at −220°C (−364°F) and is {{transparent and}} soft, {{with the same}} disordered cubic structure of freshly crystallized solid oxygen, unlike the orthorhombic systems of other solid halogens. Further cooling to −228°C (−378°F) induces a phase transition into opaque and hard α-fluorine, which has a monoclinic structure with dense, angled layers of molecules. The transition from β- to α-fluorine is more <b>exothermic</b> than the condensation of fluorine, and can be violent.|$|E
5|$|Potassium is an {{extremely}} active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air. With oxygen it forms potassium peroxide, and with water potassium forms potassium hydroxide. The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent <b>exothermic</b> character {{and the production of}} hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium — NaK — are potent desiccants {{that can be used to}} dry solvents prior to distillation.|$|E
5|$|When {{dissolved}} in water, iron(III) chloride undergoes hydrolysis and gives off heat in an <b>exothermic</b> reaction. The resulting brown, acidic, and corrosive solution {{is used as}} a flocculant in sewage treatment and drinking water production, and as an etchant for copper-based metals in printed circuit boards. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is a fairly strong Lewis acid, and it {{is used as a}} catalyst in organic synthesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{fusion of}} two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an <b>exothermic</b> process that {{releases}} {{more energy than}} is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.|$|E
5|$|The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho H2 {{increases}} with increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H2 contains {{large quantities of}} the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly. The ortho/para ratio in condensed H2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to para is <b>exothermic</b> and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} is <b>exothermic</b> and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen {{in the presence}} of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with potassium hydroxide, which is a strong alkali that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm3, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium carbonate (soda ash), and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.|$|E
5|$|This {{weak point}} in the wiring also ran near a {{junction}} in an ethylene glycol/water cooling line that had been prone to leaks. The electrolysis of ethylene glycol solution with the silver anode was discovered at MSC on May 29, 1967 to be a hazard capable of causing a violent <b>exothermic</b> reaction, igniting the ethylene glycol mixture in the CM's pure oxygen atmosphere. Experiments at the Illinois Institute of Technology confirmed the hazard existed for silver-plated wires, but not for copper-only or nickel-plated copper. In July, ASPO directed both North American and Grumman to ensure no silver or silver-coated electrical contacts existed {{in the vicinity of}} possible glycol spills in the Apollo spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|When a {{protostar}} {{is formed}} from {{the collapse of}} a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust in the local interstellar medium, the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium and trace amounts of other elements, by mass. The initial mass of the star depends on the local conditions within the cloud. (The mass distribution of newly formed stars is described empirically by the initial mass function.) During the initial collapse, this pre-main-sequence star generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, energy generation is begun at the core using an <b>exothermic</b> nuclear fusion process that converts hydrogen into helium.|$|E
5|$|This <b>exothermic</b> {{reaction}} is very slow below 100°C, but at temperature above 900°C the {{reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations {{and at least one}} of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor (PWR) containment buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises.|$|E
5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very <b>exothermic,</b> the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ionisation}} {{energy of}} hydrogen (1312.0 kJ/mol) {{is much higher}} than that of the alkali metals. As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, hydrogen often behaves like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion, and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis. (The alkali metals can also form negative ions, known as alkalides, but these are little more than laboratory curiosities, being unstable.) An argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic, unlike the <b>exothermic</b> formation of halides from halogens. The radius of the H− anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens: indeed, H− is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons. It was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties; while this has been shown to not be the case, under extremely high pressures, such as those found at the cores of Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal; in this phase, it is known as metallic hydrogen. The electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at 3000 K is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 K at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetal-to-metal transition.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{reactions}} involving NBS are <b>exothermic.</b> Therefore, extra precautions {{should be}} taken when used on a large scale.|$|E

25|$|The above {{chemical}} reaction is <b>exothermic,</b> and 1.5 moles of sorbitol generate approximately 1 mole of hexane. When hydrogen is co-fed, no {{carbon dioxide is}} produced.|$|E
25|$|This {{interpretation}} ignores extremely <b>exothermic</b> and endothermic reactions {{which are}} relatively unusual and relates the transition {{state to the}} intermediates which are usually the most unstable.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{dissolution}} of sodium hydroxide is highly <b>exothermic,</b> {{and the resulting}} heat may cause heat burns or ignite flammables. It also produces heat when reacted with acids.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} is strongly <b>exothermic,</b> so the equilibrium constant decreases with temperature. However, {{a temperature of}} around 400°C is {{required in order to}} achieve a reasonable rate of reaction with currently available catalysts. Formation of ammonia is also favoured by high pressure, as the volume decreases when the reaction takes place. It {{is interesting to note that}} the same reaction, nitrogen fixation, occurs at ambient temperatures in nature, when the catalyst is an enzyme such as nitrogenase. Much energy is needed initially to break the nitrogen–nitrogen triple bond even though the overall {{reaction is}} <b>exothermic.</b>|$|E
25|$|This is then {{oxidized}} to sulfur trioxide using {{oxygen in}} the presence of a vanadium(V) oxide catalyst. This reaction is reversible and the formation of the sulfur trioxide is <b>exothermic.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} to form {{carbon dioxide and}} molybdenum is endothermic at low temperatures, becoming less so with increasing temperature. ΔH° is zero at , and the reaction becomes <b>exothermic</b> above that temperature.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{chemical}} {{experiments on}} this compound must be performed with caution {{to prevent the}} great amount of heat released in an <b>exothermic</b> reaction from causing the solution to boil-over or damage the vessel.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{combination}} of {{features of the}} bombardier beetle's defense mechanism—strongly <b>exothermic</b> reactions, boiling-hot fluids, and explosive release—have been claimed by creationists and proponents of intelligent design to be examples of irreducible complexity.|$|E
25|$|In the {{canonical}} ensemble, {{amount of substance}} (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) are conserved. It is also sometimes called constant temperature molecular dynamics (CTMD). In NVT, the energy of endothermic and <b>exothermic</b> processes is exchanged with a thermostat.|$|E
25|$|HF-SbF5 is {{extremely}} corrosive, toxic, and moisture sensitive. Like most strong acids, fluoroantimonic acid can react violently with water, {{owing to the}} <b>exothermic</b> hydration. Consequently, it cannot be used in aqueous solution, only in hydrogen fluoride as solvent.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{reaction}} {{with a strong}} acid releases heat, and hence is <b>exothermic.</b> Such acid-base reactions {{can also be used}} for titrations. However, sodium hydroxide is not used as a primary standard because it is hygroscopic and absorbs carbon dioxide from air.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} is <b>exothermic,</b> therefore the reactor must be cooled. Typically, the {{reaction is}} conducted between 50 and 150°C.
