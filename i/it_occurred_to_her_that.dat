60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she did {{not need}} a suit, and that the order might {{have been hard to}} explain to Kennicott.|$|E
6000|$|... "How is it possible?" [...] cried Emma, {{turning her}} glowing cheeks towards him; for, while she spoke, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{he might have}} called at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she {{had said}} enough. [...] "What a dignity that old gold-fish has!" [...] she remarked. [...] "He waves his tail--as {{if he were a}} beadle waving little boys out of church." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as {{a rather}} drastic means {{to this end}} that she might commit suicide.|$|R
6000|$|... "What are you saying?" [...] she cried, and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at {{last that}} Richard was afraid. He was a coward! She felt {{as she would}} faint.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} in that, but I can't accept without knowing my position, and I would not utter {{a word to}} disturb my mother till <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> of herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, whativer is the matter, sister?" [...] said Mrs. Tulliver. She was not {{an imaginative}} woman, but <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the large toilet-glass in sister Pullet's best bedroom was {{possibly}} broken for the second time.|$|E
60|$|Picotee {{waited in}} her seat until <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she could escape the lady's-maid by going off into her father's pantry in her absence. But before this had been put into effect Menlove {{appeared}} again.|$|E
60|$|Allie lied. Her {{first thought}} was to lead them astray as to her skill with a horse; and then <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> if she rode Fresno's saddle {{there might be an}} {{opportunity}} to use the gun.|$|E
60|$|She looks puzzled, casting {{about in}} <b>her</b> mind <b>to</b> find a definition, when <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that <b>it</b> {{is easier to}} point out the {{substantial}} object itself, massive against the dark-blue sky and the early stars.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{she wanted}} <b>to</b> go away. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> like a miracle, {{that she might}} go away into another world. She had felt so doomed {{up here in the}} eternal snow, as if there were no beyond.|$|R
60|$|She {{was about}} winded when <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> try working the dugout {{into the stream}} by loading the stern with ballast and then rocking the bow back and forth along the bank until the craft {{eventually}} worked itself into the river.|$|R
60|$|As {{she spoke}} she saw Rachel redden; for she remembered silly {{things she had}} said, and also, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she treated this {{exquisite}} woman rather badly, for Mrs. Dalloway had said that she loved her husband.|$|E
60|$|Mary Louise hesitated; {{then she}} hung up the {{receiver}} without reply. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the hotel office was a public place and that the telephone girl {{would be likely to}} yell out the number for all to overhear.|$|E
6000|$|She {{crept into}} Dave Dyer's. Dave {{held up his}} arms with, [...] "Don't shoot! I surrender!" [...] She smiled, but <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> for nearly five years Dave had kept up this game of pretending that she {{threatened}} his life.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{instantly}} {{that the}} more obvious remedy of sending another driver had been already discussed and rejected by them. Yet, when her own driver appeared a moment afterwards, she ascended <b>to</b> <b>her</b> seat with some dignity and a slight increase of color.|$|R
60|$|Ughtred was {{approaching}} with her father, and watching him <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{for the first}} time how well his new part in life would become him. He was tall and broad, and he moved with the free, easy dignity of a soldier accustomed to command.|$|R
60|$|Jill {{drew a deep}} breath. The Stop-and-Go sign swung round again. She {{crossed the}} avenue, and set out once more to find Nelly Bryant. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> five minutes later, that a really {{practical}} and quick-thinking girl would have noted {{the number of the}} limousine.|$|R
60|$|Alora {{stood by}} the door, irresolute, {{wondering}} what to do. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she was not much afraid of Janet Orme. She had been trapped in order to bleed her father of money; it was all her father's fault-- his fault and Janet's.|$|E
6000|$|But Lydia {{would not}} look at the lancer's horse. [...] "Paradise!" [...] she heard Skene exclaim just then with scornful incredulity. [...] "Ain't it likely?" [...] <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> if he was {{alluding}} to his own chance of arriving there, it was not likely.|$|E
60|$|Miss Ladd was {{not only}} surprised; she was also--a very rare thing with her--inclined to be suspicious. After {{what he had said}} to Emily, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Alban might be meditating some desperate project, with the hope of {{recovering}} his lost place in her favor.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman said}} that she entertained not the {{slightest}} suspicion of the man's motives until she had reached {{the doorway of the}} house, when <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> warn him not to turn the carriage so as to permit the sun to shine in the baby's eyes.|$|R
6000|$|She {{remained}} silent. And {{he still}} {{holding her hand}} looked surprised at her hesitation. It seemed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that she could not}} let him go, and she didn't know what <b>to</b> say till <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> make use of the power she knew she had over him. She would try it again. [...] "I am coming with you," [...] she declared with decision. [...] "You don't suppose I could remain here in suspense for hours, perhaps." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> try {{the effect}} of the scheme upon Susan Burnet. Susan had such a knack of seeing things from {{unexpected}} angles. She contrived certain operations upon the study blinds, and then broached the business to Susan casually in the course of an enquiry into the welfare of the Burnet family.|$|R
60|$|Presently <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{this was}} not Arthur's {{limousine}} at all. There was no speaking tube for one thing. She leaned forward and felt for the leathern pocket in which she kept a veil and her street gloves. No pocket of any sort was to be found.|$|E
60|$|When Lucy's first alarm was stayed, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Bobbie {{had come}} {{once more to}} ask her the eternal question, but the anxious {{look in his eyes}} drove the idea away. His pleasant, boyish {{expression}} was overcast with gravity; Mrs. Crowley flung herself in a chair and turned her face away.|$|E
60|$|She {{had made}} but little {{progress}} {{in the work of}} scraping, when <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the lighting of a fire, on that warm autumn day, might look suspicious if the landlady or Mr. Null happened to come in. It would be safer to wait till night-time, when everybody would be in bed.|$|E
60|$|She {{was trying}} to be brave, but her powers of {{resistance}} were small like her body. She clung to Ruth as a child clings to its mother. Ruth, as she tried <b>to</b> comfort <b>her,</b> felt curiously old. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with a suggestion almost of grotesqueness that she and Sybil had been debutantes in the same season.|$|R
60|$|He became solicitous for her. How had she got {{on while}} he was away? She asked him how one was likely to get on at Buryhamstreet; monoplanes didn't fall every day, and as she said that <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> she was {{behaving}} meanly. But he was going on to his next topic before she could qualify.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm going," [...] said Billie resolutely. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> as <b>it</b> has <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> so {{many women}} before her, how {{helpless}} men are in a crisis. The temporary withdrawal of Jane Hubbard had had the effect which the removal of a rudder has on a boat. [...] "It's {{the only thing to}} do. I shall be back in no time." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{left her}} a moment later, and, though {{she did not know}} how she was to explain the matter to Miss Rawlinson, who was of an {{independent}} disposition, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he, at least, had found a rather graceful way out of the difficulty. The more she saw of this Western farmer, the more she liked him.|$|E
60|$|At {{first she}} {{scarcely}} appreciated {{the importance of}} the undertaking. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> an effort to read {{to the bottom of the}} sea captain's romance would be a charming diversion while she resided at Millville, and in undertaking the task she laughingly accused herself of becoming an amateur detective--an occupation that promised to be thrilling and delightful.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice {{thanked him}} and blushed a little. Vaguely <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{she must have}} more than a common share of beauty, when a rough man could be so {{impressed}} with it. That was what men loved women for, their beauty, as Owen Davies loved and desired her for this same cause and this only.|$|E
60|$|Miss Miggs's {{sense of}} hearing, however, having as sharp an edge as her temper, and {{being of the}} same snappish and {{suspicious}} kind, very soon informed her that the footsteps passed her door, and appeared to have some object quite separate and disconnected from herself. At this discovery she became more alarmed than ever, {{and was about to}} give utterance to those cries of 'Thieves!' and 'Murder!' which she had hitherto restrained, when <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> look softly out, and see that her fears had some good palpable foundation.|$|R
60|$|He spoke quickly, {{his tone}} was full of nervous passion. <b>It</b> never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> doubt him.|$|R
60|$|An idea {{concerning}} {{this young man}} came into her mind, startling as all great ideas are at birth. The older it grew, the more she approved of it. She decided to put a few questions to him. She {{had a habit of}} questioning people, and <b>it</b> never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that they might resent it. If <b>it</b> had <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> she would have done it just the same. She was like that.|$|R
