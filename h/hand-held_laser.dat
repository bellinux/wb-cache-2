40|$|American crow {{populations have}} {{increased}} steadily since 1966 {{in many parts}} of the U. S. Large winter congregations of crows in urban environments have resulted in an increased number of requests for assistance in managing nocturnal roosts in New York. In 2002, the USDA APHIS Wildlife Services program initiated a large-scale non-lethal winter roost dispersal program in Troy, New York. Since that time, similar programs have been implemented in 4 other cities in New York to manage crow roosts ranging in size from 8, 000 - 63, 000 individuals. The goals of the programs were to minimize noise, accumulations of crow feces around residences, strong odors associated with droppings, property damage, clean-up costs, and potential threats to human health and safety. The primary management strategy relied on dispersing concentrated crow populations from high-impact high-conflict areas, to low-impact low-conflict areas.

40|$|Abstract. This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{experimental}} and theoretical study of novel quantum dot passively mode locked lasers. The motivation behind this endeavour was the fundamental need, of many scientific areas, for high power, ultra-short and time stabilized optical pulses, generated directly from highly integrated laser devices. Such devices could allow the study of ultra-fast chemical and physical effects, or alternatively could provide telecomm engineers and medical practitioners with <b>hand-held</b> <b>lasers</b> suitable for a variety of applications. The first step consists of a detailed mathematical investigation of the mode-locking mechanism so as to depict clearly the fundamental limitations associated with ultra-fast high power generation. Through numerical modelling a novel semiconductor material (quantum-dots) is successfully introduced, whereas the benefits of such an approach are presented. The major part of this thesis consists of a detailed experimental investigation of various quantum-dot based mode-locked semiconductor structures. Through this investigation various new effects were demonstrated, that allowed a deeper insight to new regimes of operation. These regimes that namely consist of multi-wavelength emission and mode locking, pulse-width narrowing with increasing current injection, Q-switching stabilization and feedback-free chaotic operation, unlock new areas of applications, present new design guidelines for highly integrated semiconductor lasers. Finally, these regimes originate from the unique properties of the quantum-dot material and were firstly observed and investigated during this thesis. Consequently, this thesis {{played a major role in}} the future development of this scientific field and led to more than 15 publications in peer-reviewed journals 4 conference papers and a book chapter...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of static terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in forest inventories {{is becoming more}} effective. Nevertheless, the occlusion effect is still limiting the processing efficiency to extract forest attributes. The use of a mobile laser scanner (MLS) would reduce this occlusion. In this study, we assessed and compared a <b>hand-held</b> mobile <b>laser</b> scanner (HMLS) with two TLS approaches (single scan: SS, and multi scan: MS) for the estimation of several forest parameters {{in a wide range}} of forest types and structures. We found that SS is competitive to extract the ground surface of forest plots, while MS gives the best result to describe the upper part of the canopy. The whole cross-section at 1. 3 m height is scanned for 91 % of the trees (DBH > 10 cm) with the HMLS leading to the best results for DBH estimates (bias of - 0. 08 cm and RMSE of 1. 11 cm), compared to no fully-scanned trees for SS and 42 % fully-scanned trees for MS. Irregularities, such as bark roughness and non-circular cross-section may explain the negative bias encountered for all of the scanning approaches. The success of using MLS in forests will allow for 3 D structure acquisition on a larger scale and in a time-efficient manner. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{mechanism}} by which transmyocardial laser revascularization relieves angina is not understood. One theory is that laser-induced thermal damage to cardiac nerves results in cardiac denervation. This study examined the acute effects of transmyocardial laser revascularization on reflex responses mediated by cardiac nociceptors, the left ventricular receptors with sympathetic afferent fibers that are thought to mediate anginal chest pain. Methods: Experiments were performed in 13 chloralose-anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy. Left ventricular receptors with sympathetic afferent fibers were activated by epicardial and intracoronary bradykinin before and 45 minutes after transmyocardial laser revascularization. Reflex responses elicited by bradykinin were quantitated by direct recording of efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity. Transmyocardial laser revascularization was performed in the open-chest model with a <b>hand-held</b> holmium:YAG <b>laser</b> (2. 1 -μm wavelength). Results: An average of 44. 5 ± 1. 0 channels were created. Before transmyocardial laser revascularization, reflex increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity were elicited by both epicardial and intracoronary bradykinin. After transmyocardial laser revascularization, {{there was no significant}} attenuation in the reflex responses to either epicardial (before, 66 % ± 8 %; after, 100 % ± 24 %; P =. 19) or intracoronary (before, 124 % ± 37 %; after, 108 % ± 25 %; P =. 44) bradykinin. Conclusions: Transmyocardial laser revascularization has no significant short-term effect on reflexes mediated by left ventricular receptors with sympathetic afferent fibers in anesthetized dogs. These results indicate that transmyocardial laser revascularization does not acutely interrupt the afferent nerves, which are believed to transmit the perception of anginal pain...|$|R
50|$|In April 2008, {{citing a}} series of coordinated attacks on {{passenger}} jets in Sydney, the Australian government {{announced that it would}} restrict the sale and importation of certain laser items. The government had yet to determine which classes of laser pointers to ban. After some debate, the government voted to ban importation of lasers that emit a beam stronger than 1 mW, effective from 1 July 2008. Those whose professions require the use of a laser can apply for an exemption. In Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory a laser pointer with an accessible emission limit greater than 50 mW is classified as a prohibited weapon and any sale of such items must be recorded. In Western Australia, regulatory changes have classified laser pointers as controlled weapons and demonstration of a lawful reason for possession is required. The WA state government has also banned as of 2000 the manufacture, sale and possession of laser pointers higher than class 2. In New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory the product safety standard for laser pointers prescribes that they must be a Class 1 or a Class 2 laser product.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low-cost 3 D surface scanner, {{composed of two}} fixed web cameras and a <b>hand-held</b> planar <b>laser</b> beam. Setup pre-calibration provides interior orientations of the cameras and their scaled relative orientation. Our calibration algorithm, based on bundle adjustment, uses image pairs of a chessboard, whose nodes are identified automatically and referred to the ground points. For scanning, synchronized image pairs are continuously recorded from each location of the static cameras as the laser source is slowly moved by hand; each pair thus records {{a profile of the}} 3 D surface intersected by the laser plane. Epipolar resampling reduces the search for point correspondences to finding the intersections of homologous epipolar lines with the recorded laser profile. After a smoothing operation, peaks are identified as the maxima of Gaussian curves fitted to the gray-value data along the epipolar lines; the final identification of peaks involves information from the neighbourhood of the initial estimation. An innovative aspect is that the photogrammetric triangulation of 3 D points gains in robustness by enforcing extra geometric constraints. Thus, all points of a profile must lie on a laser plane, whose coefficients are involved as unknowns in the 3 D reconstruction adjustment. This allows identifying blunders in peak detection; for epipolar lines with more peaks, only points which, when reconstructed, satisfy a distance threshold from the laser plane participate in the final 3 D data set. Furthermore, the object is placed in a corner (the equations of its two planes in the setup system are found automatically by prior scanning), which is intersected by the laser plane in two lines. Their points are identified and constrained to simultaneously satisfy both the corresponding plane equation and the equation of the laser plane. Usin...|$|R
40|$|This {{observational}} study is conducted to demonstrate optic nerve head (ONH) blood flow alterations during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) in routine on-pump cardiovascular operations {{in order to}} evaluate the perfusion status of important autoregulatory tissue vascular beds during moderate hypothermia. Twenty-one patients free from eye disease were prospectively enrolled in our database. Perioperative ONH blood flow measurements were performed using a <b>hand-held</b> portable ocular <b>laser</b> Doppler flowmeter just after administration of general anesthesia and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) upon the lowest temperature point of moderate hypothermia. Important operative flow variables were correlated to optic nerve blood flow during surgical phases. Statistical analysis showed significant reduction of 32. 1 +/- 14. 5 % of mean ONH blood flow in phase 2 (P< 0. 0001) compared to the reference flow values of phase 1. A negative univariate association between ECC time and ONH blood flow in phase 2 (P= 0. 031) is noted. This angiokinetic approach can detect changes of flow within autoregulatory vascular tissue beds like ONH, thus creating a 'window' on cerebral microvasculature. ONH blood flow is reduced during CPB. Our data {{suggest that it is}} of paramount importance to avoid extracorporeal prolongation even in moderate hypothermic cardiovascular operations.

40|$|At a {{time when}} {{resources}} are becoming increasingly scarce mobile chemical analysis gains in importance for recycling issues. Conventional procedures like spark discharge optical emission spectrometry or x-ray fluorescence are subject to limitations concerning sensitivity or sample preparation that can be overcome by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). To realise a <b>hand-held</b> spectroscopy system <b>laser</b> source and measuring probe should both be connected via an optical fibre. A fibre laser is particularly suited for this purpose since, this way, the extensive and error-prone coupling of the laser light into a transport fibre is dropped. In this thesis a fibre laser based LIBS procedure is developed and evaluated. For this purpose, issues like ablation, single pulse behaviour or effects of the repetition rate {{on the results of}} the analysis are being investigated. A comparison of the analytical capabilities performed with commercial hand-held analysers for aluminium and steel shows that similar values can be achieved in much shorter measuring times of less than 10 s compared to 25 - 150 s. By improving the optical setup even measuring times of less than 1 s are possible. With the help of the LIBS method relative root mean square errors of 5. 6 % (Cr) to 13. 7 % (Ni) for high alloyed steel and 7. 6 % (Si) to 21. 7 % (Zn) for aluminium can be achieved.

Design/methodology/approach: The process of digitalization of a human skull by means of a <b>hand-held</b> 3 D <b>laser</b> scanner has been evaluated to see the suitability of this technique. A skull has been chosen as test element as it has several characteristics that make its digitisation by optical techniques difficult, such as a non-uniform surface and a complex geometry.
