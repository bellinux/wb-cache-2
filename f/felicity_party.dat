In 1976, he became {{the head of a}} local youth branch of the Islamist National Salvation Party (MSP), led by Necmettin Erbakan, who would later go on to found the <b>Felicity</b> <b>Party.</b> This was the beginning of Erdoğan's long career in politics.|$|E
25|$|To run for election, a {{candidate}} {{needs to be}} nominated by at least 20 Members of Parliament in the Grand National Assembly, which constitutes to 3.73% of all sitting members. The parties represented in parliament are the AKP, CHP, MHP, HDP, DBP and 14 independents, meaning that smaller parties such as the <b>Felicity</b> <b>Party</b> (SP) and the Great Union Party (BBP) could not nominate their own candidates {{due to the lack}} of parliamentary representation. Three candidates obtained sufficient endorsements from parliament in order to register with the Supreme Electoral Council.|$|E
25|$|Having {{formed an}} electoral {{alliance}} {{under the name}} National Alliance (Millî İttifak), the <b>Felicity</b> <b>Party</b> (SP) and the Great Union Party (BBP) campaigned on a religious platform. SP leader Mustafa Kamalak and BBP leader Mustafa Destici held joint electoral rallies. It was reported on 29 May that an Alliance electoral rally at Bartın had been cancelled due to no turnout, though the Alliance released a statement stating {{that there had been}} no rally planned in Bartın on that day. The Alliance became the first ever party or alliance in Turkey to release a 'vocal manifesto' online. Arguing for a return to Necmettin Erbakan's ideology of National View (Millî Görüş), the Alliance blamed the AKP for having a hand in the growing unrest in the Middle East and criticised CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for accusing the Alliance of being 'enemies of Islam'. An Alliance candidate from Sivas claimed that they would complain to the Constitutional Court should they not surpass the 10% threshold.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Felicity</b> <b>Party's</b> vote {{has been}} {{weakened}} {{by the success of}} the moderately Islamic Justice and Development Party government, although it has repeatedly condemned the Turkish government's desire to join the European Union, military ties with Israel and the United States. It has argued that Turkey must adapt its military and foreign policy stance to meet what it argues are increasing threats coming from the West to all Muslim countries.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} part of the island, Laurel Lance / Black Siren takes Quentin Lance and John Diggle to a cell {{containing}} Rene Ramirez and Dinah Drake. Oliver goes with Slade and Nyssa to rescue the others while Malcolm leads the others to the plane to escape the island. However, Thea steps on a landmine. Malcolm takes her place just when Harkness and his men arrive. <b>Felicity's</b> <b>party</b> escapes while Malcolm uses the landmine to seemingly kill himself and Harkness. They arrive at the plane's location but find that the island is rigged with C4s with not enough time to deactivate them. Oliver's party arrives at the prison but Slade knocks Oliver out and gives him to Laurel, who imprisons him with the others. However, this is part of a ruse of Oliver and Slade, who free them. Nyssa meanwhile fights against Talia, defeating her.|$|R
25|$|Results {{for other}} smaller parties also {{came as a}} surprise, {{especially}} to the <b>Felicity</b> <b>Party</b> (SP). Although the SP had not been projected to pass the 10% threshold in opinion polls, it was still expected to reach 4–5% of the vote, with support mainly coming from more religious AKP supporters. Furthermore, the SP had entered the election in an alliance with the Great Union Party (BBP). These two parties, which ran separately in 2011, won a combined 2% {{of the vote in}} the last election (1.27% and 0.75% respectively). Coming fifth with 2.1% of the vote, the Alliance only managed to increase their vote share by 0.1%. Other parties that had been shown to potentially command significant support was the Patriotic Party polling at around 3%, the Independent Turkey Party, which leader Haydar Baş claimed was polling at around 11% and the Anatolia Party, which at one point was shown to be polling at around 8%. None of these parties managed to gain a significant share of the vote, ending up with 0.35%, 0.21% and 0.06% respectively.|$|E
25|$|The Nationalist Movement Party {{claimed that}} they would {{consider}} an electoral alliance with the <b>Felicity</b> <b>Party</b> (SP) and the Great Union Party (BBP), but said nothing regarding the Conservative Ascension Party (MYP), which had long called for a union of nationalist parties. In the end, the MHP decided not to pursue a formal electoral alliance, but said it was open to defectors from any party. The MYP subsequently announced support for the MHP. The BBP has since decided to contest the election under the SP banner, and will thus be absent from the ballot papers. The Nation and Justice Party (MİLAD) planned to join the SP and BBP, {{but it did not}} actualise. The new electoral alliance between these parties was named the National Alliance (Millî İttifak). The candidate lists were drawn up such that BBP candidates were placed top in electoral districts in which they won more votes than the SP in 2011, while SP candidates were placed top in provinces in which the SP had beaten the BBP in 2011. This meant that an SP candidate was placed first in 55 provinces, while a BBP candidate was placed first in 30. The remaining positions subsequently alternated between SP and BBP candidates.|$|E
25|$|The {{volunteer}} {{election monitoring}} group Oy ve Ötesi {{claimed that the}} AKP had been recorded an extra 17,880 votes, the MHP 3,666 votes, the HDP 1,091 votes and the CHP 181 votes. The group also claimed that 6,018 votes for the <b>Felicity</b> <b>Party</b> (SP) had been unrecorded. In Muş, violence broke out after several HDP activists alleged that votes had been stolen in the province, with the police firing on the activists with tear gas. The President of the Sakarya Bars Association, Zafer Kazan, claimed on Twitter that two bags of votes had been stolen in Sakarya, with false results being recorded using forged signatures. After their seats in Kocaeli fell from two to one, the MHP demanded a re-count, with some activists claiming that election fraud {{had taken place in}} the province. A stamp, used to vote on ballot papers, was stolen from a polling station in Esenyurt, İstanbul, which could have potentially allowed the culprits to vote more than once on fake ballot papers. In Adıyaman, an individual who was filmed walking out of a polling station with a bag full of votes claimed {{that he was going to}} Mosque, but was violently apprehended by many voters who had arrived on the scene. The police later escorted the individual out of the hostile crowd. The CHP raised concern over the lack of up-to-date voter records, having identified 2,860 non-existent voters on the electoral rall in the İstanbul district of Kadıköy alone.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{formulation of}} the altruism model has altruistic terms that relate solely to other <b>parties</b> <b>felicities</b> from consumption. But if those others are altruistic as well, their altruism benefits are being neglected. Total altruism takes the total utilities of others, rather than their mere felicities, {{as the basis for}} altruistic valuations. We assess total altruism in an intergenerational world. Perfect altruism, a concept due to Ramsey (1928), requires that a generation value itself relative to its successor as it would any two consecutive generations. Total altruism and perfect altruism prove to be incompatible concepts. Total altruism is only meaningful when there is some generational selfishness. The analysis considers both forward-looking and forward and backward-looking altruism...|$|R

6000|$|Later on, in {{a corner}} to which, at sight of an empty sofa, Mrs. Assingham had, after a single {{attentive}} arrest, led her with a certain earnestness, this vision of the critical was much more sharpened than blurred. Fanny had taken it from her: yes, she was there with Amerigo alone, Maggie having come with them and then, within ten minutes, changed her mind, repented and departed. [...] "So you're staying on together without her?" [...] the elder woman had asked; and it was Charlotte's answer to this that had determined for them, quite indeed according to the latter's expectation, the need of some seclusion and her companion's pounce at the sofa. They were staying on together alone, and--oh distinctly!--it was alone that Maggie had driven away, her father, as usual, not having managed to come. [...] "'As usual'--?" [...] Mrs. Assingham had seemed to wonder; Mr. Verver's reluctances not having, she in fact quite intimated, hitherto struck her. Charlotte responded, at any rate, that his indisposition to go out had lately much increased--even though to-night, as she admitted, he had pleaded his not feeling well. Maggie had wished to stay with him--for the Prince and she, dining out, had afterwards called in Portland Place, whence, in the event, they had brought her, Charlotte, on. Maggie had come but to oblige her father--she had urged the two others to go without her; then she had yielded, for the time, to Mr. Verver's persuasion. But here, when they had, after the long wait in the carriage, fairly got in; here, once up the stairs, with the rooms before them, remorse had ended by seizing her: she had listened to no other remonstrance, and at present therefore, as Charlotte put it, the two were doubtless making together a little party at home. But it was all right--so Charlotte also put it: {{there was nothing in}} the world they liked better than these snatched <b>felicities,</b> little <b>parties,</b> long talks, with [...] "I'll come to you to-morrow," [...] and [...] "No, I'll come to you," [...] make-believe renewals of their old life. They were fairly, at times, the dear things, like children playing at paying visits, playing at [...] "Mr. Thompson" [...] and [...] "Mrs. Fane," [...] each hoping that the other would really stay to tea. Charlotte was sure she should find Maggie there on getting home-- a remark in which Mrs. Verver's immediate response to her friend's inquiry had culminated. She had thus, on the spot, the sense of having given her plenty to think about, and that moreover of liking to see it even better than she had expected. She had plenty to think about herself, and there was already something in Fanny that made it seem still more.|$|R
40|$|The book is {{dedicated}} to the memory of Peter Mair. This book brings together insights from the worlds of party politics and public administration in order to analyze the role of political parties in public appointments across contemporary Europe. Based on an extensive new data gathered through expert interviews in fifteen European countries, this book offers the first systematic comparative assessment of the scale of party patronage and its role in sustaining modern party governments. Among the key findings are: First, patronage appointments tend to be increasingly dominated by the party in public office rather than being used or controlled by the party organization outside parliament. Second, rather than using appointments as rewards, as used to be the case in more clientelistic systems in the past, parties are now more likely to emphasize appointments that can help them to manage the infrastructure of government and the state. In this way patronage becomes an organizational rather than an electoral resource. Third, patronage appointments are increasingly sourced from channels outside of the party, thus helping to make parties look increasingly like network organizations, primarily constituted by their leaders and their personal and political hinterlands.
