25|$|Early musical traditions {{during the}} 17th and 18th century saw the {{emergence}} of more complex carols, away from the repetitive ceremonial songs. These carols featured complex poetry based on cynghanedd, some were sung to English tunes, but many used Welsh melodies such as 'Ffarwel Ned Puw'. The most common Welsh folk song <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> song, with lyrics pertaining to the sorrow of parting or in praise of the girl. A few employ sexual metaphor and mention the act of bundling. After love songs, the ballad was a very popular form of song, with its tales of manual labour, agriculture and the every day life. Popular themes in the 19th century included murder, emigration and colliery disasters; sung to popular melodies from Ireland or North America.|$|E

While {{the society}} of the band is {{depicted}} as driven by sexual attraction in a male hierarchy, the relationship between Pitar and Maluma leads them to break away from traditional s. Pitar is not the alpha male, but he starts a love relationship on his own, in which Maluma quits Costello's harem. The love story demonstrates love as a quite late cultural achievement of mankind. In addition, Karin Gayer emphasizes the significance of Pitar's and Maluma's love against the religious component in defining the love story and its positioning within the storyline as another concept [...] "of the beginning and the end".|$|E

500|$|In their {{academic}} publication, Queer TV, Glyn Davis and Gary Needham discuss Jack's role within Torchwood as a post-gay, romantic hero. Noting Torchwoods central gay themes, they comment that [...] "it {{is through the}} character of Captain Jack that Torchwood is able to mine its queerness." [...] Discussing Jack's brief romance with his namesake, the real Captain Jack (Matt Rippy), academic critics have noted that [...] "The Captain Jacks both share the same name and are quite similar in physical appearance, thus literalising the homo-ness of the situation. Through the time-travel device this points to a narcissistic self-fascination, the old cliché that homosexuality <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> for sameness." [...] Other relationships which have been described or alluded to (both in the television series and other media) include ex-girlfriends Estelle Cole, Duchess Eleanor, Stella Courtney, and Lucia Moretti, ex-boyfriends and Angelo Colasanto, {{as well as an}} unnamed ex-wife.|$|E

[...] She also expressed why the character seemed to loveable to her, [...] "To have Anna {{in a situation where}} she starts the movie without any friends, because her lifestyle hasn’t allowed her to have a full kingdom. She runs around, because she wants friends." [...] Bell called the film's story is [...] "another turning point" [...] for Disney animation because the love depicted in this story <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>love</b> between siblings, a non-romantic love. Anna wants the world and she wants to explore, but she also wants to nurture the relationships around her, particularly the family relationship. [...] "It's very non-traditional for a Disney movie," [...] she added.|$|E
