40|$|Abstract Background Halibuts are commercially {{important}} flatfish species {{confined to}} the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. We have determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of four specimens each of Atlantic <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus),</b> Pacific <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> stenolepis) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and assessed the nucleotide variability within and between species. Results About 100 variable positions were identified within the four specimens in each halibut species, with the control regions as the most variable parts of the genomes (10 {{times that of the}} mitochondrial ribosomal DNA). Due to tandem repeat arrays, the control regions have unusually large sizes compared to most vertebrate mtDNAs. The arrays are highly heteroplasmic in size and consist mainly of different variants of a 61 -bp motif. Halibut mitochondrial genomes lacking arrays were also detected. Conclusion The complexity, distribution, and biological role of the heteroplasmic tandem repeat arrays in halibut mitochondrial control regions are discussed. We conclude that the most plausible explanation for array maintenance includes both the slipped-strand mispairing and DNA recombination mechanisms. </p...|$|R

Characterization {{of active}} {{spawning}} season and depth for eastern Pa-cific <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> stenolepis), {{and evidence of}} probable skipped spawning. J. Northw. Atl. Fish. Sci., 41 : 23 – 36. doi: 10. 2960 /J. v 41. m 617 The eastern Pacific <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> stenolepis) fishery is prosecuted over a nine-month season with a provision to cease harvests if stock declines to historically-observed minimum spawn-ing biomass. The industry has requested to extend fishing into winter, but little information exists regarding potential impacts on spawning aggregations or effective spawning biomass. A strictly an-nual spawning cycle is presumed, but some adults fail to undertake the offshore migration associated with continental slope spawning. We examined depth records of halibut tagged with Pop-up Archival Transmitting (PAT) tags for evidence of offshore seasonal migration (n = 72). For tags that were physically recovered (n = 16) we identified the occurrence of abrupt (~ 100 m) mid-winter ascents, believed to be egg release. The active spawning season, defined by occurrence of these rises, lasted from 27 December– 8 March, at bottom depths of 278 – 594 m. Eighteen percent of tagged halibut remained onshore.

50|$|The Atlantic <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> hippoglossus) is a {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. They are demersal fish living on or near sand, gravel or clay bottoms at depths of between 50 and 2000 m. The halibut is among the largest teleost (bony) fish in the world, and is an endangered species due to a slow rate of growth and previous overfishing. Halibut are strong swimmers {{and are able to}} migrate long distances. Halibut size is not age-specific, but rather tends to follow a cycle related to halibut (and therefore food) abundance.|$|R

40|$|Mastergradsoppgave i havbruk - Høgskolen i Bodø, 2006 The {{complete}} mitochondrial DNA sequence {{was determined}} in four individuals of Atlantic <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus),</b> Pacific <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> stenolepis) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) respectively. Thirteen protein-coding genes, twentytwo tRNA genes, two rRNA genes {{and a large}} non-coding control region were identified, and the conserved vertebrate gene order was confirmed. Extensive length variation of the mtDNA genome was observed, due to variations in copy number of a 61 bp heteroplasmic repeated motif in the control region. Furthermore, 800 bp from the mtDNA genes ND 2, COI and control region respectively was sequenced in 30 individuals from the Atlantic halibut broodstock at Mørkvedbukta Reseach Station. In addition, approximately 13420 bp from Common sole (Solea vulgaris), 15012 bp from European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and 7678 bp from Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) were determined. The overall genetic variation {{based on the number}} of nucleotide substitutions was greatest in Greenland halibut, followed by Pacific halibut and Atlantic halibut. The control region and some of the ND genes had the highest nucleotide diversity, while the rRNA genes and ATP 8 (Pacific and Greenland halibut) were most conserved. Four amino acid substitutions between the three halibut species in ND 5, with a negative mutation matrix score suggest that these substitutions could have an impact on functional and structional properties of the gene. Phylogenetic investigations based on the complete mtDNA genome revealed that Atlantic halibut and Pacific halibut are closely related species, potentially separated at the sub-species level. Of all other available mtDNA genomes Greenland halibut is the closest relative to the Hippoglossus genus. Furthermore, Atlantic- and Pacific halibut was estimated to have separated 2 Ma, while divergence between Greenland <b>halibut</b> and the <b>Hippoglossus</b> genus took place approximately 6 million years ago...|$|R
