Later it was perfected by other Roma musicians, such as Kalyi Jag. When hit by palms, Cegléd jugs produce {{a wide variety of}} sounds, depending on the place hit (<b>handle,</b> <b>body,</b> rim), whether it is struck or slapped, whether the jug mouth is muffled, etc. [...] The combination of metal sound and deep dull sound of the air cavity puts the instrument in categories of idiophones and wind instruments.|$|E
50|$|The New York City {{architect}}, Harold Caparn, {{who helped}} expand the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, {{was chosen as}} chief architect of an industrial village that would house supervisors and workers for the Nitrate Plant No. 1. Construction of the village began {{in the latter half}} of 1918. The village was designed in the pattern of a handbell, with houses surrounding the <b>handle,</b> <b>body,</b> and clapper, and a school at the base. At its completion, the village contained 112 residential structures, 2 school buildings, and one large apartment building that housed unmarried officers. Maud Lindsay, a nationally-known writer of children's books, was chosen as the first kindergarten teacher at the school.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} a coordinate atlas in an exotic R^ 4 using Bizaca's construction. The main source {{for such an}} atlas is the <b>handle</b> <b>body</b> decomposition of a Casson handle, {{which of course is}} an infinite, but periodic, process. The immersion of the end-periodic manifold into R^ 4 {{is directly related to the}} exoticness of the R^ 4 and also gives rise naturally to a spinor field. Thus we obtain the interesting result that the simplest exotic R^ 4 generates an extra spinor field by exoticness. Comment: 17 pages, 8 figures, 5 appendice...|$|E
40|$|We give an {{explicit}} basis B of the quotient of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra S (Σ) on a surface Σ by {{the square of}} an augmentation ideal. As an application, it induces two kinds of finite type invariants of links in a <b>handle</b> <b>body</b> {{in the sense of}} Le. Moreover, we construct an embedding of the mapping class group of a compact connected surface of genus 0 into the Kauffman bracket skein algebra on the surface completed with respect to a filtration coming from the augmentation ideal.

40|$|A {{fluid flow}} {{director}} is disclosed. The director comprises a <b>handle</b> <b>body</b> and combed-teeth extending {{from one side}} of the body. The body can be formed of a clear plastic such as acrylic. The director can be used with heat exchangers such as a magnetic heat pump and can minimize the undesired mixing of fluid flows. The types of heat exchangers can encompass both heat pumps and refrigerators. The director can adjust the fluid flow of liquid or gas along desired flow directions. A method of applying the flow director within a magnetic heat pump application is also disclosed where the comb-teeth portions of the director are inserted into the fluid flow paths of the heat pump...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we define instanton Floer {{homology}} groups {{for a pair}} consisting of a compact oriented 3 -manifold with boundary and a Lagrangian submanifold of the moduli space of flat SU(2) -connections over the boundary. We carry out the construction for a general class of irreducible, monotone boundary conditions. The main examples of such Lagrangian submanifolds are induced from a disjoint union of <b>handle</b> <b>bodies</b> such that the union of the 3 -manifold and the <b>handle</b> <b>bodies</b> is an integral homology 3 -sphere. The motivation for introducing these invariants arises from our program for a proof of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture for Heegaard splittings. We expect that our Floer homology groups are isomorphic to the usual Floer homology groups of the closed 3 -manifold in our main example and thus {{can be used as}} a starting point for an adiabatic limit argument.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the perturbative aspects of Rozansky-Witten's 3 d σ-model using Costello's {{approach to the}} Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism. We show that the BV quantization (in Costello's sense) of the model, which produces a perturbative quantum field theory, can be obtained via the configuration space method of regularization due to Kontsevich and Axelrod-Singer. We also study the factorization algebra structure for quantum observables following Costello-Gwilliam. In particular, we show that the cohomology of local quantum observables on a genus g <b>handle</b> <b>body</b> is given by H^*(X,(∧^*T_X) ^⊗ g) (where X is the target manifold), and prove that the partition function reproduces the Rozansky-Witten invariants.

40|$|We study {{bubbling}} {{phenomena of}} anti-self-dual instantons on ^̋ 2 ×, where is a closed Riemann surface. The restriction of the instanton to each boundary slice {z}×, z∈^̋ 2 {{is required to}} lie in a Lagrangian submanifold of the moduli space of flat connections over that arises from the restrictions to the boundary of flat connections on a <b>handle</b> <b>body.</b> We establish an energy quantization result for sequences of instantons with bounded energy near { 0 }×: Either their curvature is in fact uniformly bounded in a neighbourhood of that slice (leading to a compactness result) or there is a concentration of some minimum quantum of energy. We moreover obtain a removable singularity result for instantons with finite energy in a punctured neighbourhood of { 0 }×. This completes the analytic foundations {{for the construction of}} an instanton Floer homology for 3 -manifolds with boundary. This Floer homology is an intermediate object in the program proposed by Salamon for the proof of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture for homology- 3 -spheres. In the interior case, for anti-self-instantons on ^ 2 ×, our methods provide a new approach to the removable singularity theorem by Sibner-Sibner for codimension 2 singularities with a holonomy condition.

This highlights the need for an education campaign to inform the general public how to make a complaint about inappropriate advertising, and who to make a complaint to.
