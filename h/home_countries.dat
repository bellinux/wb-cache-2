5|$|In 2009, the {{university}} {{responded to a}} series of New York Times interviews that showed a pattern of labor abuses in its fledgling Abu Dhabi location, creating a statement of labor values for Abu Dhabi campus workers. A 2014 follow-up article found that while some conditions had improved, contractors for the multibillion-endowment university were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms where workers had to sleep under beds. According to the article, workers who attempted to protest the NYU contractors' conditions were promptly arrested. Reports also claimed that those arrested by police were later abused at the police station. Many workers who were not local were then deported to their <b>home</b> <b>countries.</b> The university quickly responded to the reports with an apology to the workers.

30|$|In {{a general}} way, {{there are four}} stages of outward FDI and the impacts to the {{domestic}} economy are different. In the first stage, the <b>home</b> <b>country</b> exports the capital {{for the construction of}} production plants to the host country, which will increase the export of the <b>home</b> <b>country.</b> In the second stage, the <b>home</b> <b>country</b> exports intermediate goods to the host country for production. The capital output in these two preliminary stages leads to the export promotion effect to the <b>home</b> <b>country.</b> In the third stage, affiliates in the host country have enough productivity to satisfy the demand of local market and start to export to other countries instead of the home country; hence, outward FDI has substitution effect on export of the <b>home</b> <b>country.</b> In the last stage, the <b>home</b> <b>country</b> imports from the host country, which is called boomerang effect. This paper analyzes the impact of outward FDI on Japan’s domestic economy through these three different effects.|$|R

5|$|The {{match was}} also of {{historical}} importance {{because of the}} Welsh tactics employed. In the 1886 Home Nations Championship Wales had trialled the four three-quarter system, wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine, and instead employ an extra centre three-quarter. The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould, whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward. With Gould working in the West Indies, Wales again tried the four three-quarter system against the Natives, and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system. Within six years the other three <b>Home</b> <b>Countries</b> had adopted four three-quarter style of play.|$|E
30|$|This is {{a strong}} assumption, {{considering}} that many studies find a positive association between duration abroad and integration, which lends support to the premise that with time migrants integrate into host country society 3. Changes in <b>home</b> <b>country</b> preference may be particularly relevant for migrants who initially have weaker social attachments to the <b>home</b> <b>country,</b> such as those who migrate when single and/or meet their spouse in the host country. In this paper, I use panel data covering a 28 -year period from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and try to assess how migrants’ <b>home</b> <b>country</b> preferences change over time. This data set provides unique background information of migrants and their spouses and allows me to study three types of outcome related to <b>home</b> <b>country</b> preference: intentions to return, remittances sent and return realisations. The goal of my paper is an empirical assessment of the research question: Is marriage to a German spouse related {{to any of the}} three outcomes? My hypothesis is that migrants’ preferences change with intermarriage, i.e., marriage between a migrant and a host country national, and that intermarriage is negatively associated with <b>home</b> <b>country</b> preference 4. But to infer an association between intermarriage and migrants’ <b>home</b> <b>country</b> preference, it is empirically important to distinguish whether <b>home</b> <b>country</b> preference changes with intermarriage or whether the relationship is a spurious one and migrants who intermarry have lower preferences for the <b>home</b> <b>country</b> independent of their spouse.|$|R
