40|$|For {{recent and}} future nanometer-technology VLSIs, static and dynamic <b>delay</b> <b>variations</b> become a serious problem. In many cases, the hold constraint, {{as well as}} the setup constraint, becomes {{critical}} for latching a correct signal under <b>delay</b> <b>variations.</b> While the timing violation due to the fail of the setup constraint can be fixed by tuning a clock frequency or using a delayed latch, the timing violation due to the fail of the hold constraint cannot be fixed by those methods in general. Our approach to <b>delay</b> <b>variations</b> (in particular, the hold constraint) proposed in this paper is a novel register assignment strategy in high-level synthesis, which guarantees safe clocking by contra-data-direction (CDD) clocking. After the formulation of this new register assignment problem, we prove NP-hardness of the problem, and then derive an integer linear programming formulation for the problem. The proposed method receives a scheduled data flow graph, and generates a datapath having (1) robustness against <b>delay</b> <b>variations,</b> which is ensured by CDD-based register assignment, and (2) the minimum possible number of registers.

The <b>delay</b> <b>variation</b> means that signals consisting of multiple frequency components will suffer distortion because these components are not delayed by {{the same amount of}} time at the output of the device. This changes the shape of the signal in addition to any constant delay or scale change.
