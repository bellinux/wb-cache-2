5|$|On May 21, 2008 President George W. Bush {{signed into}} law the Genetic Information Non{{discrimination}} Act (GINA). The bill aims to protect Americans against discrimination based on their genetic <b>information</b> <b>when</b> it comes to health insurance and employment. The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research.|$|E
5|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the chip in 1.7 microsecond pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store <b>information</b> <b>when</b> there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E
5|$|The player {{interacts with}} {{characters}} and objects by clicking on them. Clicking {{on the ground}} causes the player's selected characters to move. The gameplay, though in real-time, can be paused, whereupon commands may be issued to controllable characters, who will attempt to execute them when the game is unpaused. The game can also be set to pause automatically at certain times. Dialogue is started by NPCs at certain scripted times, or by the player's clicking on NPCs who are not immediately hostile. When speaking to an NPC, the player must often choose what to say {{from a list of}} responses. The dialogue may lead to quests or important <b>information.</b> <b>When</b> the player clicks on a hostile being, the currently selected characters will advance to attack it. Information about characters, creatures, items, and buildings in the game environment is shown on a tool tip, which appears when the mouse pointer is held over game elements.|$|E

40|$|In practice, {{there are}} many dynamic {{covering}} decision information systems, and knowledge reduction of dynamic covering decision information systems is a significant challenge of covering-based rough sets. In this paper, we first study mechanisms of constructing attribute reducts for consistent covering decision <b>information</b> systems <b>when</b> adding objects using related families. We also employ examples to illustrate how to construct attribute reducts of consistent covering decision <b>information</b> systems <b>when</b> adding objects. Then we investigate mechanisms of constructing attribute reducts for consistent covering decision <b>information</b> systems <b>when</b> deleting objects using related families. We also employ examples to illustrate how to construct attribute reducts of consistent covering decision <b>information</b> systems <b>when</b> deleting objects. Finally, the experimental results illustrates that the related family-based methods are effective to perform attribute reduction of dynamic covering decision <b>information</b> systems <b>when</b> object sets are varying with time.

40|$|We {{conjecture}} new uncertainty relations which restrict {{correlations between}} {{results of measurements}} performed by two separated parties on a shared quantum state. The first uncertainty relation bounds the sum of two mutual <b>informations</b> <b>when</b> one party measures a single observable and the other party measures one of two observables. The uncertainty relation does not follow from Maassen-Uffink uncertainty relation and is much stronger than Hall uncertainty relation derived from the latter. The second uncertainty relation bounds the sum of two mutual <b>informations</b> <b>when</b> each party measures one of two observables. We provide numerical evidence for validity of conjectured uncertainty relations and prove them for large classes of states and observables. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

Conversely, spectroscopic binary stars move fast in their orbits because they are close together, usually too close to be detected as visual binaries.
