5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church <b>does</b> <b>when</b> she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
5|$|NY365 is {{the only}} post-1930 state route that once entered Hamilton County, but no longer <b>does.</b> <b>When</b> it was {{assigned}} , the route entered Hamilton County from Herkimer County, overlapping with NY28 until Blue Mountain Lake. Here, it turned off NY28 and onto NY10 (later NY30) and NY28N. The three routes overlapped to Long Lake, where NY28N split off from both NY10 and NY365. The two highways continued northward, leaving Hamilton County and passing into Franklin County north of Long Lake. NY365 was truncated in the late 1950s to end near the Oneida County village of Holland Patent, eliminating a series of overlaps between NY365 and other state routes that collectively extended from Holland Patent to Plattsburgh, Clinton County.|$|E

5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always <b>does.</b> <b>When</b> the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E

25|$|While reincarnation {{has been}} a matter of faith in some {{communities}} from an early date it has also frequently been argued for on principle, as Plato <b>does</b> <b>when</b> he argues that the number of souls must be finite because souls are indestructible, Benjamin Franklin held a similar view.

25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it <b>does</b> <b>when</b> we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} S2 is negative, {{indicating}} that the image is formed {{on the opposite side}} of the lens from where those rays are being considered. Since the diverging light rays emanating from the lens never come into focus, and those rays are not physically present at the point where they appear to form an image, this is called a virtual image. Unlike real images, a virtual image cannot be projected on a screen, but appears to an observer looking through the lens as if it were a real object at the location of that virtual image. Likewise, it appears to a subsequent lens as if it were an object at that location, so that second lens could again focus that light into a real image, S1 then being measured from the virtual image location behind the first lens to the second lens. This is exactly what the eye <b>does</b> <b>when</b> looking through a magnifying glass. The magnifying glass creates a (magnified) virtual image behind the magnifying glass, but those rays are then re-imaged by the lens of the eye to create a real image on the retina.|$|E

25|$|Santelli et al. {{explained}} {{more about}} the process after they determined the crystal structure of the PA/CMG2 complex. The structure of this complex shows the binding of CMG2 by both domain 2 and 4 of PA. This interaction demonstrates less freedom to unfold the Greek key. Further analysis shows that seven of the nine histidines in PA are on the domain 2/domain 4 interface. Protonation of these histidines causes the domains to separate enough to allow the Greek-key to flop out and help form the β-hairpin involved in insertion. In addition, when PA binds to CMG2, insertion no longer occurs at a pH of 6.5, as it <b>does</b> <b>when</b> inserted into an artificial membrane. Instead it requires a pH of 5.0 for insertion in natural cells. This difference was explained {{to be the result}} of the pocket next to the MIDAS motif in CMG2. This pocket contains a histidine buried at the bottom where domain 2 attaches. This histidine is protonated at a lower pH and adds greater stability to PA. This added stability keeps the Greek-key from being able to move until more acidic conditions are met. These histidines all work in conjunction to keep the heptamer from inserting prematurely before endocytosis occurs.|$|E
