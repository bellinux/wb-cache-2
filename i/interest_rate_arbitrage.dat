40|$|In this study, we {{assess the}} {{credibility}} of the currency board arrangement (CBA) of the Macau Special Administrative Region by studying the relationship between exchange market pressure (EMP) and the anchors of a rule-based CBA, namely, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> exchange rate arbitrage and economic discipline. A pure CBA signals its credibility by allowing the first two anchors to function automatically and by pursuing sound fiscal policies. The analysis’ results suggest that Macau’s CBA has been characterised by a state of low volatility since late 1992, with the brief exception of the East Asian financial crisis period. The paper’s main finding is that fiscal fundamentals seem to have a more pronounced role in reducing EMP’s variability during periods of low volatility whilst <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arbitrage</b> is more important in periods of high volatility. We conclude that Macau’s CBA is credible at present as reflected in the low frequency of observed EMP, in the narrowing of Macau’s interest rate differential vis-à-vis U.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> dynamics. We consider the general family of arbitrage-free positive <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models, valid on all time horizons, {{in the case of a}} discount bond system driven by a Brownian mo-tion of one or more dimensions. We show that the space of such models admits a canonical mapping to the space of square-integrable Wiener functionals. This is achieved by means of a conditional variance representation for the state price den-sity. The Wiener chaos expansion technique is then used to formulate a systematic analysis of the structure and classification of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models. We show that the specification of a first-chaos model is equivalent to the specification of an admissible initial yield curve. A comprehensive development of the second-chaos <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> theory is presented in the case of a single Brownian factor, and we show that there is a natural methodology for calibrating the model to at-the-money-forward caplet prices. The factorisable second-chaos models are particularly tractable, and lead to closed-form expressions for options on bonds and for swaptions. In conclusion we outline a general “international ” model for <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and foreign exchange, for which each currency admits an associated family of discount bonds, and show that the entire system can be generated by a vector of Wiener functionals.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} methods and the empirical results {{of various types}} of arbitrage strategies in past numerical studies. Although arbitrage can be generally dividend into two categories including risk-free arbitrage and risky arbitrage, {{there is still a}} certain level of risk which arbitrageurs should take, no matter what kinds of arbitrage. Since there are limitations and transactions costs in conducting arbitraging strategies, the profit of arbitrage may be plentiful in theory but it could be misleading in practice after considering transactions costs and potential risk. It appears that all arbitrage strategies are theoretically sound, but it is debatable that arbitrage strategies will succeed in the real world. The key factors for arbitrage strategies to succeed depend on how to identify various types of arbitrage strategies, exploit market inefficiency, to reduce transaction costs, and to evaluate potential risk.

40|$|A {{recently}} proposed model (by Ilinski et al.) for {{the dynamics}} of intermediate deviations from equilibrium of financial markets (“virtual ” arbitrage returns) is incorporated within an equilibrium (arbitrage-free) pricing method for derivatives on securities (e. g. stocks) using an equivalence to option pricing theory with stochastic <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Making the <b>arbitrage</b> return a component of a fictitious short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (while the real risk-free rate {{is assumed to be}} constant) and thus treating it as another source of uncertainty (besides the security price) in a virtual world, the influence of intermediate arbitrage returns on derivatives in the real world can be recovered by performing an average over the (non-observable) arbitrage return at the time of pricing. Using a famous result by Merton, exact pricing formulas for European call and put options under the influence of virtual arbitrage returns (or intermediate deviations from economic equilibrium) are derived where only the final integration over initial arbitrage returns needs to be performed numerically. This result, which has not been given previously and is at variance with results stated by Ilinski et al., is complemented by a discussion of the hedging strategy associated to a derivative, which replicates the final payoff but turns out to be not self-financing. Numerical examples are given which underline the fact that an additional positive risk premium (with respect to the Black-Scholes values) is found reflecting extra hedging costs due to intermediate deviations from economic equilibrium. 1...|$|R

40|$|Most {{textbook}} models {{explain the}} operation of monetary policy {{in terms of how}} the central bank influences the market rate of interest by managing the supply of its liabilities relative to the demand for them. Yet some central banks no longer operate that way and, instead, set an interest rate for their own liabilities. This raises the question of how under that modus of operation the central bank's rate is transmitted to the financial markets. Another question concerns whether advances in information technology may erode the demand for central bank money and hence threaten the ability of central banks to implement monetary policy. There are, however, some simple answers to these conundrums. In an open and efficient inancial system, the central bank can determine the market rate of interest by standing in the market at its own rate, and rely on <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arbitrage</b> to transmit that rate to the market.

However, different reserves adequacy measures based on global best practices confirm that its reserves holding is not markedly higher than what is required.

Nevertheless, Dornbusch concludes that monetary policy is still effective even if it worsens a trade balance, because a monetary expansion pushes down <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and encourages spending.

The progress in renminbi trade settlement is especially impressive. However, Hong Kong, China's offshore renminbi deposits failed to make significant progress as expected. The question of how far renminbi internationalization can go has become a common concern in the international financial community. This paper argues that while a contributing factor is {{the sheer size of}} the People's Republic of China's (PRC) trade and the convenience of using the renminbi for transaction settlements, exchange rate arbitrage and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arbitrage</b> matter also. Profits from arbitrages are the major driving forces of, but do not constitute a sustainable basis for, internationalization. A fundamental constraint for renminbi internationalization is the PRC's capital controls. Before fully opening up its capital account and making the renminbi freely convertible, however, the PRC needs first to put its own house in order. Macroeconomic stability has to be achieved; the high ratio of financial leverage should be reduced; a rational and flexible interest rate structure must be created; and risk management capacity across industries should be established. Most importantly, the PRC must make the renminbi exchange rate flexible to reflect demand for and supply of foreign exchange in the market. The renminbi can and will become a major international currency eventually, but the road to internationalization is bound to be long and bumpy...|$|E
40|$|As {{a number}} of {{developing}} countries move towards more liberalized financial systems, {{the question of how}} interest rates respond to foreign influences and domestic policies is one that policymakers in these countries have started to face. Most existing studies of interest rates typically treat only the extreme cases of either a fully open economy, where some form of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>arbitrage</b> holds, or a completely closed economy, in which interest rates are determined solely by domestic monetary factors. Developing countries, however, generally fall somewhere between these two extremes, so that the standard models of interest rate determination would not seem to be relevant to their case. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to outline a theoretical framework that can serve as a starting point for analyzing interest rate determination in those developing countries that are in the process of removing controls on the financial sector and restrictions on capital flows. The approach suggested here combines elements of the closed-economy and open-economy models, and thus is able to incorporate the influences of foreign interest rates, expected changes in exchange rates, and monetary developments on domestic interest rates. An interesting feature of the resulting model is that the approximate degree of financial openness, defined as the extent to which domestic interest rates are linked to foreign interest rates, can in fact be as certained from the data of the particular country. To illustrate the empirical validity of the proposed model it was applied to two countries [...] Colombia and Singapore. These two countries are quite different in terms of levels of financial development and degrees of openness, and thus provide a useful first test of the general nature of the model. The model is able to represent both these cases quite adequately. The estimates indicate that in Colombia both foreign and domestic factors are important, while domestic interest rates in Singapore are fully determined by foreign interest rates and variations in the exchange rate. This is precisely what would have been expected, given the characteristics of the respective financial systems in the two countries. ...|$|E
