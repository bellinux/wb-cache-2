25|$|Davis, who {{had been}} ranked the world number one for two years, and would remain in that {{position}} for another five, was strong favourite going into the event. The pair met in the semi-finals twelve months before with Davis coming through a convincing winner by 16 frames to 9. Taylor started the final strongly with a fifty plus break but Davis proved too strong by whitewashing Taylor in the first session and won the first frame of the second session to lead 8–0, Taylor won the ninth frame on the pink after Davis attempted and missed a <b>fine</b> <b>cut</b> on the green. This frame {{appeared to be the}} turning point of the match. Davis, looking tired and jaded allowed Taylor to win six of the next seven frames, producing quality break building including the highest break of the final of 98 to trail only 7–9 overnight.|$|E
2500|$|While the facet {{count is}} standard, the actual proportions—crown height and crown angle, {{pavilion}} depth and pavilion angle, and table size—are not universally agreed upon. There {{are at least}} six [...] "ideal cuts" [...] that have been devised over the years, but only three are in common use {{as a means of}} benchmarking. Developed by Marcel Tolkowsky in 1919, the American Standard (also known as the American Ideal and Tolkowsky Brilliant) is the benchmark in North America. It was derived from mathematical calculations that considered both brilliance and fire. The benchmark in Germany and other European countries is the Practical <b>Fine</b> <b>Cut</b> ( [...] , also known as the Eppler Cut), introduced in 1939. It was developed in Germany by empirical observations and differs only slightly from the American Standard. Introduced as part of the Scandinavian Diamond Nomenclature (Scan. D.

2500|$|The most remembered shot where Davis {{missed the}} <b>fine</b> <b>cut</b> {{into the corner}} pocket was {{unfortunately}} not discussed in detail. Davis states [...] "I was saying to myself, don't hit it thick" [...] and [...] "that's how you bottle it, by hitting it thick." [...] However he did not elaborate on whether {{he was forced to}} use side spin to avoid a possible in off foul stroke into the middle pocket (This would have cost him the match) or whether he played it with centre ball striking. He summarised: [...] "although I missed the black, it wasn't that shot which lost the match. There were other shots earlier in the frame." [...] In particular, Davis mentions how close he was to being able to pot a pink which he snookered himself on that changed the course of the match. David Vine closes the programme by asking both players their opinion regarding some voices claiming the match must have been fixed. This preposterous notion gives a fascinating insight into the prevailing naivety in some quarters with regard to Snooker in 1985, when it was still a comparatively young TV sport and reaching its zenith in popularity. Davis replies [...] "Well, its simple. They don't understand. If anyone ever {{came up to me and}} asked if the match was fixed, I would just say yeah it was, yeah. It's just not even worth arguing with people like that." [...] Davis allowed himself to joke about the defeat, making a joke about being asked by a petrol station attendant if he wanted glasses (free tumblers) and has now admitted that he will probably be remembered more for the final he did not win in 1985 than for the six he did. But barely months after the final he states [...] "although I lost the match, it was great to be involved in. To be involved in something like that." [...] The programme was later released on DVD as [...] "The Greatest Snooker Final Of All Time" [...] by Retro Videos. Both players now commentate on BBC's snooker coverage and are often reminded of that match. The [...] finish was voted the ninth greatest sporting moment of all time in a 2002 Channel 4 poll.|$|E
