Therefore, the specifications of a robot system for the manufacturing of wall slits, as a preliminary step of wiring and electrical installations in masonry construction, will be defined. The main motivation to reduce the manual tasks is the great difference between the high qualification of workers (especially electricians) and partly the unpretending hard work that does not require such a professional education in the same way. So, the focus of the article lays on a manufacturing process that is suitable for automation, kinematical concepts for the robot and the development of an appropriate end effector. The requirements of the closeness of space and light weight result in the necessity of other kinematical concepts and structures, because common structures of industrial robots are not suitable. The presented kinematics are based on linear components as best solution to cope with the two-dimensional area and a special developed wrist to bridge the existing clearance volumes of the main axes and to allow the accessibility of corners. Furthermore, the robot {{has to be able to}} reach working heights near to ceilings and simultaneously to pass a door. Besides this, a robotized process will be explained in order to reduce manual refinishing operations as much as possible because of economical reasons. Consequently, the design of an appropriate end effector based on a <b>joint</b> <b>cutter</b> will be shown. Finally, the sequence of work preparation tasks for the set-up of the robot will be described and a proof for the efficiency of the system will be given. ...|$|E

Base on the theories of multi-body small deformation, the point of transfer matrix and the Jacobi matrix, the integrated stiffness model of machining system is established by space force ellipsoid in 3 D particular to 5 -axis NC machining center. The force ellipsoid method is {{used to analyze the}} effect of machine tool <b>joints,</b> <b>cutter</b> and <b>joint</b> of tool holder/cutter on the integrated stiffness field of machining system. And then, the integrated stiffness field distribution of impeller blade in cutting plane is analyzed. Finally, this theoretical model can be effectively optimized path of machining of integral impeller, which is tested by optimization experiments of working table posture...|$|R
50|$|Norwitch {{was born}} in Odessa, Russia (present-day Ukraine) in 1894 and emigrated to the United States with his family as a child. Initially {{settling}} in Baltimore, Norwitch {{went to work at}} a clothing factory from the age of 13. He married Mae Schreiber in about 1917; they had two children, Mildred and Bernard. Norwitch became affiliated with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers union and moved to Philadelphia in 1926 to work as a business agent for the <b>Joint</b> Board <b>Cutters</b> and Trimmers Local 110. His union work brought him into local politics, and he became active in the Nonpartisan League, a socialist group, in 1934. He joined the Democratic Party and served as a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where President Harry S. Truman was nominated for a new term.|$|R
