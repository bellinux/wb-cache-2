5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{decided to}} publish a photo story for their January 15, 1951 edition, which would document {{the results of the}} competition and feature a photograph of the protesters. Life initially wanted to photograph the painters {{on the steps of the}} Metropolitan, with their paintings. They refused on the grounds that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> they were trying to enter the museum, but were being rebuffed. The magazine capitulated; art editor for Life, Dorothy Seiberling, sent photographer Nina Leen to photograph them at a studio on 44th Street. They assembled there on November 24. Only three of the original signatories were absent: Weldon Kees, Hans Hofmann, and Fritz Bultman. Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} {{to create the}} racing modes of the game had been present {{from the start of}} the project and Battle Mode was developed from the desire to create a one-on-one mode where victory was not determined simply by competing for rank. The game did not start out as a Mario series game and the first prototype featured a generic man in overalls in the kart; the team decided that characters three heads tall would best suit the design of the karts. They did not decide on incorporating Mario series characters into the game until two or three months after the start of development. The choice was made after the development team, when observing how one kart looked to another driving past it, decided to see what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> with Mario in the kart. Thinking that having Mario in the kart looked better than previous designs, the idea of a Mario themed racing game was born.|$|E
25|$|A {{slightly}} different {{edition of the}} fragment of the Thalia from De Synodis is given by G.C. Stead, and served {{as the basis for}} a translation by R.P.C. Hanson. Stead argued that the Thalia was written in anapestic meter, and edited the fragment to show what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> in anapests with different line breaks. Hanson based his translation of this fragment directly on Stead's text. Here is Stead's edition with Hanson's translation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} issue of Huxley's Natural History Review, an article by George Rolleston on the {{orangutan}} brain showed the features that Owen claimed apes lacked, and when Owen responded {{in a letter to}} the Annals and Magazine of Natural History that the issue was a matter of definition rather than fact, Huxley made a public dissection of a spider monkey that had died at the zoo, to support his case. In the following issue John Marshall provided detailed measurements making the same point about the chimpanzee, as well as explaining how a chimpanzee's brain could be distorted by not being properly preserved and removed from the skull, so that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the one in Owen's illustration.|$|E
25|$|During filming, it was {{considered}} that the customized 1975 Captain Kirk mask be reused for this film. However, the mask was long gone and a new one was purchased from a local costume shop. The producers wanted to test and see what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> without the edits. The school scene was filmed and when reviewing the producers did not like how the mask turned out. It was allegedly customized again but did {{not live up to}} the original, and the producers felt it was too old and went for a new mask. Some scenes had to be re-shot with the new mask. The only scene left in is when Loomis is thrown through a glass door; as Michael comes up behind him, the unaltered face and blonde hair is visible.|$|E

[...] He {{acquired}} a broken-down carousel in a junk yard in Los Angeles, and some broken horses in Kansas City. He and his entourage then headed for Drury, Kansas. The original working title of the film was Around. While exploring film title designs for the picture, Carradine came across a style called Americana. [...] "I {{was trying to figure}} out what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> if it said Around. Suddenly, I said to myself, 'Why am I doing this, anyway? It's right here in front of me.'

500|$|Various other titles were {{suggested}} {{for the series}} such as Cardcaster Sakura and Card Character Sakura before Nekoi suggested Cardcaptor Sakura. While Ohkawa planned out Cardcaptor Sakura from beginning to end, she never consulted the plot with the other members, instead giving them the script one chapter at a time. Mokona initially drew Tomoyo so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> {{she was in love}} with Toya, which led to her surprise when she received the script for the chapter which reveals Tomoyo loves Sakura. The story was planned to have the theme of [...] "if you try your best, it'll work out", but Ohkawa did not start out with Sakura's [...] "It'll definitely be okay" [...] mindset. Ohkawa wanted to write a story that [...] "minorities would feel comfortable with," [...] referring to the same-sex and taboo relationships featured in the manga. The series' main theme is expressed through Sakura, a main character designed to be open-minded about different family structures and kinds of love. Ohkawa addressed the relationships featured in the series by using Tomoyo and Sakura as an example. She explained that the reason Tomoyo and Sakura did not end up together was not because Tomoyo is a girl, but rather because Sakura did not love Tomoyo in a romantic way.|$|E
500|$|The {{deaths of}} Ana Lucia and Libby caused {{speculation}} {{that they were}} killed off due to the DUIs that actresses Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros received within fifteen minutes of each other on December 1, 2005. Watros pleaded guilty, was fined $370, and had her license suspended for 90 days. Rodriguez initially pleaded innocent, but in April pleaded guilty, {{and was sentenced to}} five days in Oahu correctional facility, but ended up serving only 65 hours due to jail overcrowding. In February 2006, US Weekly claimed that an insider told them that the Lost producers were frustrated with Rodriguez's behavior and were going to kill her character off. Soon after, [...] "Two for the Road" [...] aired, writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse told TV Guide that when talking to Rodriguez about the part of Ana Lucia, she said that she would be interested, but only for a year. After sitting down with her, the two were very impressed with her energy, and decided to adjust their plan to make her character only last one season. Since audiences had a negative reaction to Ana-Lucia, the producers thought her death would not generate enough sympathy from fans, so they decided that Libby, who was well liked, should also be killed for emotional impact. [...] Lindelof recalled that after they found out that both Rodriguez and Watros got the DUIs, he was concerned that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> killing Ana and Libby was the producers attempt to say [...] "Don't drive drunk!", and even considered re-writing the script so it wouldn't seem that way, but the producers decided just to keep it like it was. Lindelof also denied rumors that Rodriguez was killed off because she was hard to deal with, saying that Michelle was [...] "totally professional and got along well with all the other actors." [...] According to Lindelof and Cuse, Watros was very sad about Libby being killed off, and the producers felt bad for her, so they helped her get in a pilot for a show on CBS called My Ex-Life, although it was not picked up by the network.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{variants}} of Stuxnet targeted five Iranian organizations, with the probable target widely suspected to be uranium enrichment infrastructure in Iran; Symantec noted in August 2010 that 60% of the infected computers worldwide were in Iran. Siemens {{stated that the}} worm has not caused any damage to its customers, but the Iran nuclear program, which uses embargoed Siemens equipment procured secretly, has been damaged by Stuxnet. Kaspersky Lab concluded that the sophisticated attack {{could only have been}} conducted [...] "with nation-state support". This was further supported by the F-Secure's chief researcher Mikko Hyppönen who commented in a Stuxnet FAQ, [...] "That's what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> yes".|$|E
2500|$|The final {{building}} was considered excessively large. The Guardian described it in 1978 as [...] "an awful warning against thinking too big in Britain's cities", and [...] "so castle-like in its outer strength that any passing medieval army would automatically besiege {{it rather than}} shop in it...". The underground railway scheme was abandoned by 1976 and the only deck access was across Corporation Street to another Town &City development in the Shambles. At the official opening, one of its champions, Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw, Mayor of Manchester, commented, [...] "I didn't think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> that when I saw the balsa wood models". [...] The [...] "unrepentant" [...] architects responded that they had provided {{what they had been}} asked to provide. Kenneth Stone said in 1978 [...] "We're not responsible for everything in there, but we're not sorry about the decisions we took as opposed to those which were forced upon us." [...] The critics' opinion did not mellow with time, and it was described as [...] "aggressive externally" [...] in 1991. The Economist noted in 1996 that it had [...] "long been regarded as one of Europe's ugliest shopping centres.... the epitome of lousy modern architecture... was hated". The Financial Times in 1997 called it [...] "outstandingly ugly" [...] and in 2000 [...] "one of Britain's least-loved buildings".|$|E

2500|$|Many wrestling fans, {{and several}} within the business, believe the Montreal Screwjob was a work, and that Hart was acting in {{collaboration}} with McMahon. Longtime pro wrestling journalist Bill Apter, along with industry veterans Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Bam Bam Bigelow, Road Dogg, George Steele, Chris Kanyon, Steve Corino,Steve Corino: [...] "I think this [...] is a contrived plan, it's the greatest work of all time."Tony Mamaluke: [...] "Just {{like everything else in}} wrestling, it's a work." [...] Tony Mamaluke, Justin Credible, Paul Bearer, and Sunny,Road Warrior Animal: [...] "Could I believe they worked the whole thing? Yeah.Sunny: [...] "t was way too quick for Vince to have such a black eye... It was set up beforehand, they knew it was gonna happen and we [...] always said, 'We betcha that Vince had his own son punch him in the eye, make it look good, and make it come out, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Bret did it." [...] have gone on record saying they believe this to have been the case (Sunny reported that her former boyfriend, Chris Candido, also subscribed to this notion). Shawn Michaels recalled people saying that the screwjob [...] "had to be a work", and claimed that McMahon [...] "took a dive" [...] and [...] "sold like he sells on TV" [...] when struck by Hart backstage following the incident. Jerry Lawler, who served as ringside commentator for the match, found it plausible that Hart was working with McMahon, as did Hart's former colleagues Demolition (Ax and Smash), Road Warrior Animal, Steve Blackman, and Sean Waltman. Waltman felt there was a [...] "high possibility" [...] of the screwjob being a work, and believed Hart would not have told anyone, including his wife, about his involvement.|$|E
2500|$|Ian Meckiff: [...] The biggest culprit in English {{eyes was}} the [...] "jerky erratic Meckiff". who took 17 wickets (17.17) in the series, but dragged {{his foot and}} his [...] "action was {{generally}} conceded to constitute a throw". Several former English and Australian Test players stated that his action was illegal; Jack Fingleton, Keith Miller, Alf Gover, Ernie McCormick, Ian Peebles and Johnny Wardle, as did many in the England team; [...] Trevor Bailey, Jim Laker, Peter Richardson and Fred Trueman. Meckiff was defended by his captain Richie Benaud said he was [...] "completely satisfied that his delivery was fair and legitimate". and Jack Pollard, who wrote [...] "Meckiff, in fact, went to the crease with a beautifully relaxed approach, paused momentarily with his arm absolutely straight, and then let the ball go with a blurred swing of the arm that was impossible to follow from 60 yards away, even {{with the aid of}} good binoculars". The England manager Freddie Brown wanted to make an official complaint about Meckiff's bowling after the First Test, but captain Peter May declined as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> sour grapes. Instead they talked unofficially to the Australian chairman of selectors Sir Donald Bradman who retorted [...] "And what of the action of the England bowlers Tony Lock and Peter Loader?" [...] and that they should [...] "first of all put their own house in order". May never did make an official complaint, but [...] "Englishmen who fell to Meckiff's speed and lively lift were hardly happy at being victims of deliveries that began with a bent arm and finished with a pronounced wrist-whip". He was subsequently no balled for throwing twice in the Sheffield Shield, but his career was ended when Australian umpire Colin Egar no balled him four times in his first over against South Africa in the First Test at Brisbane in 1963-64. Some thought this was arranged for the benefit of sporting relations, but Meckiff never played cricket again.|$|E
