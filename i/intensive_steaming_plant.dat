50|$|The Fitchburg Central <b>Steam</b> <b>Plant</b> (locally {{known by}} its nickname: the PLT) was built in 1928 to provide steam and {{electricity}} to the many local paper mills. As the paper mills were abandoned or improved the Central <b>Steam</b> <b>Plant</b> fell into disuse and was abandoned. In 2008, the EPA designated the Central <b>Steam</b> <b>Plant</b> a brownfield site due to contamination of the site soil and groundwater with metals and inorganic contaminants. The EPA provided the City of Fitchburg $50,500 in grant money to help clean up hazardous substances on the site.|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 31 - 36 During the {{oil crisis}} in the 1970 s, many {{electric}} utilities assigned their base load portion of electric generation requirements to nuclear and coal fired <b>steam</b> <b>plants.</b> The intermediate duty in some cases was assigned to combined cycles or to oil fired <b>steam</b> <b>plants.</b> The peak duty under 1000 hr was assigned in many cases to combustion turbines. By innovative boiler modification, the peaking combustion turbine can be combined with a <b>steam</b> <b>plant</b> to provide the combustion air for the <b>steam</b> <b>plant</b> boiler with a wide load variation at good efficiency. In addition to maintaining high efficiency at part load, it increases the plant capacity 6 to 7 percent at full load, decreases NO(subscript x) generation, varies the air flow to an existing boiler 10 percent and up to 20 percent using a new combustion turbine and provides a system such that the gas turbine can automatically {{be removed from the}} cycle without tripping the steam cycle...|$|R

25|$|In {{a thermal}} power station, {{water is the}} working medium. High {{pressure}} steam requires strong, bulky components. High temperatures require expensive alloys made from nickel or cobalt, rather than inexpensive steel. These alloys limit practical steam temperatures to 655°C while the lower temperature of a <b>steam</b> <b>plant</b> is fixed by {{the temperature of the}} cooling water. With these limits, a <b>steam</b> <b>plant</b> has a fixed upper efficiency of 35–42%.|$|R

The primary fuel is natural gas (740 mscf/yr); the secondary fuel {{in the event}} of a natural gas interruption is diesel fuel. Two storage tanks provide a diesel fuel reserve of 1. 5 million gallons. The <b>Steam</b> <b>Plant</b> has been in continuous operation since 1949, and some of the boilers are past their design life. Each of the boilers is controlled through a central Digital Control System (DCS). The DCS design is based on the stoichiometric equation, where the O{sub 2 } stack concentration and load rate are set points and the combustion air and gas flow are adjusted based on the equation. The DCS was installed and programmed in 1992, but has not been updated since. Long range studies are being conducted to determine the fate of the <b>steam</b> <b>plant,</b> but implementation of any of these options is at least 5 years in the future. Because it is a major source of air emissions, water and chemical use, and waste water at SNL/NM, the <b>steam</b> <b>plant</b> pursued immediate solutions to reduce costs and pollutant releases, while still providing uninterrupted, quality service to its customers. This paper will summarize the ongoing efforts to conserve water, and reduce air and wastewater discharges at the SNL/NM <b>Steam</b> <b>Plant.</b> These improvements were identified through a Pollution Prevention Opportunity Assessment, an Emissions Reduction Study...|$|R
