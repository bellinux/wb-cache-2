50|$|Vinehall School is a co-educational day and {{boarding}} school {{located near the}} town of Robertsbridge, East Sussex. It takes children from ages 2 to 13. The school received an <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Inspection</b> of the Early Years Foundation Stage and of Boarding by the Independent Schools Inspectorate in January 2015. The School was judged to be 'Outstanding' in every single EYFS category area. Vinehall School was also judged to meet all the requirements for the National Minimum Standards for Boarding.|$|E

The fuel pellets, of conventional pressurised water reactor (PWR) dimensions, were encapsulated in zircaloy cladding, before being shipped to KWO Obrigheim for irradiation. The capsule was loaded in a guide tube of a conventional uranium MOX assembly, where it was irradiated for four reactor cycles, reaching a burnup of 37. 7 GWd/tonne. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>inspections</b> of the rodlet were made between each reactor cycle, and on completion of irradiation.

40|$|Intermediately {{inspecting}} the statistical data of a running experiment is justifiably {{referred to as}} a bad research practice. With only a few <b>intermediate</b> <b>inspections,</b> Type I error rates inflate to a multiple of the previously defined critical falpha. On the other hand, there are research areas where intermediately inspecting data is extremely desirable if not even necessary. For this reason, in medical research, mathematical methods are known as "group-sequential testing" which compensate Type I error cumulation by adjusting critical alpha. In the field of psychological research, these methods are widely unknown or at least used very rarely. One reason may be that group-sequential tests focus on test statistics based on the normal distribution, mainly the t-test, while in psychological research often more complex experimental designs are used. The computer program APriot has been developed to enable the user to conduct Monte-Carlo simulations of what happens when intermediately {{inspecting the}} data of an ANOVA. The simulations show clearly how bad a research practice intermediately inspecting data (without adjusting alpha) is. Further, it is shown that in many cases adjusted values of alpha can be found by simulations such that the ANOVA can be used together with group-sequential testing similarly as the t-test. A last set of demonstrations shows how the power and the required number of participants of a group-sequential test can be estimated and that group-sequential testing can be favorable from an economic point of view...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this article is to present a case study of {{aircraft}} production customer inspection process and analyze the needs and benefits for such market practice. Enabling operators and owners to closely follow certain production process milestones contributes to a more reliable operation, compliance with customer expectations and proper detection, documentation and rectification of production discrepancies. Nevertheless, although often required by customers, few airframe manufacturers dispose of a formal production inspection program to guide operators and owners through the process. The production inspection program implemented by a large commercial aircraft manufacturer is thoroughly analysed, discussed and benchmarked for future references. The scope of such work includes observations of <b>intermediate</b> <b>inspection</b> activities throughout the aircraft final assembly line up to the end of the aircraft delivery process and consequent technical acceptance. Airframe and systems assembly processes are subject to either visual, operational or functional checks. As a result, production concessions are assessed and dealt with in such a manner to avoid future negative impacts on the aircraft operation, maintenance and airworthiness. Best practices and key tasks are discussed. A customer-oriented, flexible and thorough schedule of activities is perceived as a positive industry practice in the aviation business...|$|E

The safety evaluation concluded that continued plant operation, without repair or <b>intermediate</b> <b>inspection</b> of the NMP 2 core shroud, was acceptable for at least one operating cycle after RFO 6. The NRC letter mentioned that Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NMPC) would be submitting the NMP 2 core shroud reinspection plan for the next refueling outage (RFO 7) at least three months before performing the reinspection and that {{the results of the}} reinspection would be submitted within 30 days of its completion. By letter dated December 2, 1999, NMPC submitted the core shroud reinspection plan for RFO 7, which occurred in March-April 2000. As outlined in that reinspection plan, only welds H 4 and H 5 were required to be reinspected during RFO 7. This reinspection was performed using the General Electric (GE) OD Tracker on all accessible areas of the welds. Attachment 1 to this letter provides the reinspection results. These results demonstrate that the average crack growth in welds H 4 and H 5 is well within the predicted growth range.

40|$|In this {{irradiation}} test, {{the performance}} safety of (Th,Pu) O 2 fuel was evaluated. The fuel pellets were synthesised from powders prepared using a sol gel method {{to give a}} product exhibiting an atomically homogeneous distribution of the elements. The fuel pellets, of conventional pressurised water reactor (PWR) dimensions, were encapsulated in zircaloy cladding, and irradiated during four reactor cycles, reaching a burnup of 37. 7 GWd/tonne in the KWO pressurised water reactor at Obrigheim, Germany. The irradiation test was performed under representatives conditions. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>inspection</b> of the fuel pin during reactor outages revealed a cladding creep down within the bounds observed for UO 2 fuels under similar conditions. Hydriding of the cladding was found predominantly on the outer liner of the duplex cladding. Fission gas analysis revealed a fission gas release of about 0. 5 %, which is somewhat lower than U-MOX fuels at the same burnup, but they were operated at higher linear heating rate. The Xe/Kr ratio of 11 is much lower than (U,Pu) O 2 fuel (typically 16), indicating significant 233 U generation and fissioning thereof during the irradiation experiment. Examination of the microstructure indicates that the pellet – cladding gap is almost closed. The grain size remained similar to the fresh fuel (4 µm) and no intragranular porosity was observed. JRC.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{structure}} of L-ribulose- 5 -phosphate 4 -epimerase from E. coli has been solved to 2. 4 Å resolution using X-ray diffraction data. The structure is homo-tetrameric and displays C 4 symmetry. Each subunit {{has a single}} domain comprised of a central â-sheet flanked on either side by layers of R-helices. The active site is identified by {{the position of the}} catalytic zinc residue and is located at the interface between two adjacent subunits. A remarkable feature of the structure is that it shows a very close resemblance to that of L-fuculose- 1 -phosphate aldolase. This is consistent with the notion that both enzymes belong to a superfamily of epimerases/aldolases that catalyze carbon-carbon bond cleavage reactions via a metal-stabilized enolate <b>intermediate.</b> Detailed <b>inspection</b> of the epimerase structure, however, indicates that despite the close overall structural similarity to class II aldolases, the enzyme has evolved distinct active site features that promote its particular chemistry.

40|$|Abstract: X-ray imaging is a {{suitable}} technique for nuclear waste drums inspection, especially large and highly attenuating ones. It requires an energy source greater than 6 MeV and dose rate over 0. 1 Gy/s. Controlling waste drums {{calls for a}} multi-level strategy: from systematic and fast controls to specific or detailed examinations. Using a high energy (8 MeV) experimental set-up, we have studied and validated different modalities for X-ray inspection of these drums: radiography, radioscopy, tomosynthesis, and tomography. Various types of detectors can be used, all of them dedicated to high energy: large screen imager, CdTe-unit detector, linear array. They differ on induced geometry acquisition, global acquisition time, resolution, and possible modalities. Data collection therefore also differs from one device to another. Introduction: X-ray imaging is an attractive technology for both low level and <b>intermediate</b> nuclear waste <b>inspection,</b> and may even deal with high level ones in some cases. Due to the density and size of nuclear waste drums, a high energy source is required. A 2 MeV system is transportable on a trailer, but does not allow to inspect drums that are too attenuating. The leader in this technology is BIR, that produces the WIT system, a truck mounted system capable o...|$|R
40|$|Objective: As Americans {{consume more}} meals outside the home, food safety of {{restaurants}} is more critical. The {{purpose of this}} study is to examine the effect of food service establishment (FSE) inspection frequency on FSE performance. In this study, the U. S. Air Force (USAF) public health system is compared to Ohio local public health departments (Ohio LPHDs). The USAF inspects FSEs more frequently than Ohio LPHDs do. The goal is to determine if this increased frequency leads to higher food safety in the FSEs. Methods: We reviewed 1482 reports from three USAF bases and 1909 reports from six Ohio LPHDs for the years 2011 and 2012. Data evaluated includes: total, critical, and non-critical food safety violations and inspection frequency. We looked at violations per inspection, which were determined by dividing violations (total, critical, and non-critical) by the total number of inspections. Annual frequency for both groups is determined by taking the total number of inspections for both years divided by two. Test for significance of the violations and frequency differences are performed by t-test using the 95 % confidence level. Results: The USAF shows significantly lower rates in total, critical, and non-critical violations, and inspects at significantly higher frequency. Conclusion: The results show that frequent inspections coincide with fewer violations. The more frequent schedule affords greater opportunities to conduct food safety education. Further research might determine if an <b>intermediate</b> <b>inspection</b> schedule could offer similar protection as observed with the USAF schedule...|$|E
40|$|The growing use of {{antimony}} (Sb) {{compounds in}} {{industry and the}} consequent {{increase in the number}} of exposed workers make it important to carry out a health risk assessment. The main goal of this study was to assess the genotoxicity of Sb 2 O 3 in occupationally exposed workers. Genotoxicity was evaluated by the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus tests, ond the enzyme (Fpg) -modified comet ossay. In addition, antimony exposure levels were established by environmental monitoring with personal air samplers. We studied 23 male workers assigned to different fire retardant treatment tasks in the car upholstery industry and a control group of 23 healthy nonexposed males. The exposed workers were divided into two groups on the basis of their tasks and the work cycle: Group A comprised finishing and <b>intermediate</b> <b>inspection</b> operators who directly handled a mixture containing Sb 2 O 3; Group B were jet operators, not directly exposed to the compound. Environmental monitoring detected low Sb exposure levels but significant differences between the two groups, with Group A having the higher exposure level. Cytogenetic analyses showed no difference between exposed workers and controls for micronuclei ond SCE. The enzyme-modified comet assay showed a probable relation between moderate levels of oxidative DNA damage ond exposure to antimony, with a significantly higher proportion of workers in Group A having oxidative DNA damage compared to controls. The results support the theory that oxidative DNA damage is involved in the genotoxicity of antimony and indicate the need for further research in this field. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Collaborations between {{components}} can bemodeled in {{the coordination}} language Paradigm[3]. A collaboration solution is specified by loosely coupling component dynamics to a protocol via their roles. Not only regular, foreseen collaboration can be specified, originally unforeseen collaboration can be modeled too [4]. To explain how, we first look very briefly at Paradigm’s regular coordination specification. Component dynamics are expressed by state-transition diagrams (STDs), see Figure 1 (a) for a mock-up STD MU in UML style. MU {{contributes to a}} collaboration via a role MU(R). Figure 1 (b) specifies MU(R) through a different STD, whose states are so-called phases of MU: temporarily valid, dynamic constraints imposed on MU. The figure mentions four such phases, Clock, Anti, Inter and Small. Figure 1 (c) couplesMU and MU(R). It specifies each phase as part of MU, additionally decorated {{with one or more}} polygons grouping some states of a phase. Polygons visualize so-called traps: a trap, once entered, cannot be left as long as the phase remains the valid constraint. A trap having been entered, serves as a guard for a phase change. Therefore, traps label transitions in a role STD, cf. Figure 1 (b). Single steps from different roles, are synchronized into one protocol step. A protocol step can be coupled to one detailed step of a so-called manager component, driving the protocol. Meanwhile, local variables can be updated. It is through a consistency rule, Paradigm specifies a protocol step: (i) at the left-hand side of a ?? the one, driving manager step is given, if relevant; (ii) the right-hand side lists the role steps being synchronized; (iii) optionally, a change clause [2] can be given updating variables, e. g. one containing the current set of consistency rules. For example, a consistency rule without change clause, MU 2 :A!B ?? MU 1 (R) :Clock triv ! Anti, MU 3 (R) : Inter toSmall ! Small where a manager step ofMU 2 is coupled to the swapping ofMU 1 from circling clockwise to anti-clock-wise and swapping MU 3 from <b>intermediate</b> <b>inspection</b> into circling on a smaller scale...|$|E
40|$|U. S. Army {{helicopter}} maintenance {{condition is}} affected by operation environment and high flight hours. Due to the environmental conditions and high operation tempo of Afghanistan and Iraq, U. S. Army Aviation created the RESET aviation maintenance program to provide restorative maintenance following deployments in theater. The RESET maintenance program was created {{in addition to the}} existing two-level maintenance programs. Following deployment, RESET is a thorough cleaning to remove contaminants, inspection of airframe and components, and repair cycle to restore the condition of the helicopter to acceptable condition. Based on the original intent of RESET, it was projected that at the conclusion of military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the RESET maintenance program could be discontinued. Because of the presumed safety, reliability, and mission readiness created by RESET, this thesis appraised the RESET maintenance program as a permanent addition to U. S. Army Aviation maintenance programs. The hypothesis was that RESET does improve safety, reliability, and mission readiness of the Army UH- 60 Black Hawk fleet. The design was a quantitative survey of three variables: safety, reliability, and mission readiness. The survey featured Likert scale and open-ended questions of three groups: UH- 60 maintenance test pilots, UH- 60 AVUM/AVIM maintenance supervisory personnel, and ACE (Airframe Condition Evaluation) technical evaluators. Data from each of the three survey groups verified the hypothesis that RESET improved safety, reliability, and mission readiness. Data from open-ended questions indicated that the additional disassembly and special inspections of RESET are more extensive than the aviation unit and <b>intermediate</b> Phased Maintenance <b>Inspection</b> (PMI). Therefore, given the disassembly and special inspections of RESET, and the verification that RESET improves safety, reliability, and mission readiness, it was concluded that RESET is a successful program that should be continued. Based on the effectiveness of RESET in discovering these deficiencies, RESET should be a permanent addition to the Army aviation maintenance programs...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional cytoskeletal {{organization}} of detergent-treated epithelial African green monkey kidney cells (BSC- 1) and chick embryo fibroblasts was studied in whole-mount preparations visualized {{in a high}} voltage electron microscope. Stereo images are generated at both low and high magnification to reveal both overall cytoskeletal morphology and details of the structural continuity of different filament types. By {{the use of an}} improved extraction procedure in combination with heavy meromyosin subfragment 1 decoration of actin filaments, several new features of filament organization are revealed that suggest that the cytoskeleton is a highly interconnected structural unit. In addition to actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules, a new class of filaments of 2 - to 3 -nm diameter and 30 - to 300 -nm length that do not bind heavy merymyosin is demonstrated. They form end-to-side contacts with other cytoskeletal filaments, thereby acting as linkers between various fibers, both like (e. g., actin- actin) and unlike (e. g., actin-intermediate filament, intermediate filament-microtubule). Their nature is unknown. In addition to 2 - to 3 -nm filaments, actin filaments are demonstrated to form end-to-side contacts with other filaments. Y-shaped actin filament “branches” are observed both in the cell periphery close to ruffles and in more central cell areas also populated by abundant intermediate filaments and microtubules. Arrowhead complexes formed by subfragment 1 decoration of actin filaments point towards the contact site. Actin filaments also form end-to-side contacts with microtubules and <b>intermediate</b> filaments. Careful <b>inspection</b> of numerous actin-microtubule contacts shows that microtubules frequently change their course at sites of contact. A variety of experimentally induced modifications of the frequency of actin-microtubule contacts can be shown to influence the course of microtubules. We conclude that bends in microtubules are imposed by structural interactions with other cytoskeletal elements. A structural and biochemical comparison of whole cells and cytoskeletons demonstrates that the former show a more inticate three-dimensional network and a more complex biochemical composition than the latter. An analysis of the time course of detergent extraction strongly suggests that the cytoskeleton forms a structural backbone with which a large number of proteins of the cytoplasmic ground substance associate in an ordered fashion to form the characteristic image of the “microtrabecular network” (J. J. Wolosewick and K. R. Porter. 1979. J. Cell Biol. 82 : 114 - 139) ...|$|R
