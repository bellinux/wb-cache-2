Taking dynamic <b>load</b> <b>Tank</b> Simulator as the research object, this paper analyzes the coupling of 6 -DOC parallel robot considering the degree of freedom of the 6 -DOF parallel manipulator. The coupling angle and coupling velocity are derived based on inverse kinematics model. It uses the mechanism-model combined method which takes practical moving track that considering the performance of motion controller and motor as its input to make the study.

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} system is ineffective with heavy or viscous oils and {{not recommended for}} greater than 15-degree Baumé. Heating coils must be placed {{near the top of}} tanks, where they are less efficient. An hydraulic tanker requires a larger volume of void space for buoyancy than conventionally <b>loaded</b> <b>tanks,</b> because the empty, or ballasted, condition of tanks filled with water is heavier than the <b>loaded</b> condition of <b>tanks</b> filled with oil. A heavier ballasted condition may also increase round trip fuel consumption.|$|R

50|$|The film is {{available}} in lengths for varying numbers of exposures. The standard full-length roll has always been 36 exposures (assuming a standard 24&times;36 frame size). Through about 1980, 20 exposure rolls were the only shorter length with widespread availability. Since then, 20 exposure rolls have been largely discontinued in favour of 24 and 12 exposure rolls. With most cameras {{it is possible to}} get 3 more exposures than the nominal capacity on the film if the camera is loaded in a darkroom and some cameras allow this with <b>daylight</b> <b>loading.</b> 27 exposure disposable cameras are loaded in the dark with standard 24 exposure cassette.|$|R

It was much easier to move the large, heavy artillery and tanks that this kind of modern warfare required using train-ferries as opposed to repeated loading and unloading of cargo.

40|$|Abstract: Skylight roofing {{construction}} isa practical {{complement to}} electric lighting even in various climatic conditions. However, a purely energy efficient building that ignores what the environment can contribute, particularly in tropical regions, will consume more energy. This {{problem can be}} found in landed houses specifically in Malaysia due to high impact of solar radiation and the length of the daylight period all year round. The lack of understanding the potential of skylight design {{is one of the main}} challenges. This paper aims to examine several passive glazing materials in the form of glass and plastic as well as dimensions and orientations under the Malaysian environmental conditions to determine the efficiency of this skylight construction design. The study was carried out by computer simulation to specify the thermal and <b>daylighting</b> <b>loads</b> in a specific room size. The resultsshow the significance of polycarbonate glazing as an efficient skylight material in the tropical houses. This materialdelivers well distributed natural light with less heat impact. This study provides useful quantitative and qualitative information for building professionals and architects in the tropics...|$|R
50|$|In the {{earliest}} days, the photographer had {{to load the}} film into reusable cassettes and, at least for some cameras, cut the film leader. In 1934, Kodak introduced a 135 daylight-loading single-use cassette. This cassette was engineered {{so that it could}} be used in both Leica and Zeiss Ikon Contax cameras along with the camera for which it was invented, namely the Kodak Retina camera. The Retina camera and this <b>daylight</b> <b>loading</b> cassette were the invention of Dr. August Nagel of the Kodak AG Dr. Nagel Werk in Stuttgart. Kodak bought Dr. August Nagel's company in December, 1931, and began marketing the Kodak Retina in the summer of 1934. The first Kodak Retina camera was a Typ 117. The 35 mm Kodak Retina camera line remained in production until 1969. Kodak also introduced a line of American made cameras that were simpler and more economical than the Retina. Argus, too, made a long-lived range of 35mm cameras; notably the Argus C3. Kodak launched 135-format Kodachrome color film in 1936. AGFA followed with the introduction of Agfacolor Neu later in the same year.|$|R
