50|$|A {{benefit of}} <b>damp-proofing</b> rods {{compared}} with <b>damp-proofing</b> creams and liquids {{is that it}} is possible to guarantee a consistent dose of active ingredient into each hole drilled in the mortar course - i.e. it is impossible to under-fill the holes.|$|E

40|$|The present Australian Masonry Code {{states that}} the shear {{capacity}} of a masonry wall containing <b>damp-proof</b> course is to be taken as zero. <b>Damp-proof</b> course {{is used in the}} building industry as a means of preventing moisture through masonry walls. The inclusion of a <b>damp-proof</b> course within a mortar joint creates a plane of weakness. If the <b>damp-proof</b> course is not sandwiched within the mortar (placed directly on the block), the bond between the mortar and masonry block is broken. Although this bond has been broken the mortar joint still possess some frictional shear capacity. The University of Newcastle has proved the existence of shear capacity for various membrane type <b>damp-proof</b> courses using clay bricks. A study has also been done by W. Kelly of Central Queensland University on the effects of <b>damp-proof</b> course positioning and mortar types for masonry walls using concrete blocks and Supercourse 500. In plane shear tests will be conducted on 36 specimens with variables including the inclusion and omission on <b>damp-proof</b> course, three Central Queensland mortar sands and three precompression loads. The provisions of the Australian Masonry Code shall be reviewed {{on the basis of these}} test results combined with Kelly's (2) previous research...|$|R
5000|$|Where {{a rising}} damp problem {{is caused by}} a lack of a <b>damp-proof</b> course (common in {{buildings}} over approximately 100 years old) or by a failed <b>damp-proof</b> course (comparatively rare) there are a wide range of possible solutions available. These include: ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Damp-proofing</b> rods use similar active {{ingredients}} {{to those found}} in liquid or cream-based rising damp treatments, but contained in a solid rod. They are generally considered to be easier to use than other types of rising damp treatment as the method of installation is simply to insert them into the correct sized holes drilled into a mortar bed. <b>Damp-proofing</b> rods are available with BBA approval.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2014 the British Board of Agrément {{confirmed}} {{that it would}} consult with manufacturers and holders of BBA certificates {{with a view to}} updating the MOAT No.39 test {{in light of the fact}} that it was not originally designed to test damp proofing creams and these have become the most popular type of rising damp treatment. This replaces a draft BBA guidance note that said <b>Damp-proofing</b> creams differ from fluid-based <b>damp-proofing</b> treatments in a number of ways: ...|$|E
50|$|Rising damp is a {{condition}} caused by ground moisture rising up a masonry wall by capillary action. It often occurs {{where there is no}} <b>damp-proof</b> course (DPC) or where the DPC has been damaged or bridged. Older houses, such as depicted in the show, were built without <b>damp-proof</b> courses or with a barrier material that is liable to failure.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} to provide <b>damp-proof</b> insulation in horizontal outer constructions such as balconies, terraces and loggias, both in new buildings and existing structures requiring renovation. A newly prepared textile geo-composite is proposed for this purpose. Presented are results of experimental examination of the geo-composite prepared, made on a laboratory-and semi-technical scale to identify its physical properties {{in relation to the}} curing of concrete during maturation, and to the <b>damp-proof</b> function in exploitation expected...|$|R
50|$|Walls are not {{subjected}} to standing water, and the water-resistant membranes used as housewraps {{are designed to}} be porous enough to let moisture escape. Walls also have vapor barriers or air barriers. Damp proofing is another aspect of waterproofing. Masonry walls are built with a <b>damp-proof</b> course to prevent rising damp, and the concrete in foundations needs to be <b>damp-proofed</b> or waterproofed with a liquid coating, basement waterproofing membrane (even under the concrete slab floor where polyethylene sheeting is commonly used), or an additive to the concrete.|$|R
50|$|<b>Damp-proofing</b> rods {{are usually}} {{supplied}} in 180mm lengths suitable for inserting into a 9-inch thick wall. For treating half-brick thick (4.5 inch) walls, the rods are simply cut in half.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{products}} developed for <b>damp-proofing</b> was Por-Seal, Stone-Tex, Stone-Backing, and Plaster Bond. Water Proofing Paste, an ingredient used {{in the making of}} stucco cement and plaster, was developed for waterproofing. Another waterproofing product was named Water Proofed Cement Stucco.|$|E
5000|$|In {{more recent}} years {{patented}} <b>damp-proofing</b> creams [...] {{have taken over}} from liquid products due to improved ease of application. As with liquid products these are based on silane/siloxane active ingredients which line the pores of the mortar to repel damp.|$|E
50|$|The rods {{are placed}} into holes drilled in the mortar {{course and the}} active {{ingredients}} diffuse along the mortar line before curing to form a <b>damp-proof</b> course.|$|R
5000|$|Engineering bricks are a type {{of brick}} used where strength, low water {{porosity}} or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed. Engineering bricks {{can be used for}} <b>damp-proof</b> courses.|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{assessing}} damp is to check for standing water. Removing water with good drainage will remove any form of dampness. Once done, and dampness remains, {{the next step is}} to look for the presence of a <b>damp-proof</b> course. If a <b>damp-proof</b> course is present, it is likely to be functioning, as the materials from which damp proof courses are manufactured tend to have a long lifespan. However, it should be acknowledged that there are cases where existing damp proof courses fail for one reason or another.|$|R
50|$|Truscon Laboratories was a {{research}} and development chemical laboratory of the Trussed Concrete Steel Company ("Truscon") of Detroit, Michigan. It made waterproofing liquid chemical products that went into or on cement and plaster. The products goals were to provide <b>damp-proofing</b> and waterproofing finishing for concrete and Truscon steel to guard against disintegrating action of water and air.|$|E
50|$|Regular {{repairs and}} <b>damp-proofing</b> {{have been carried}} out since the church was completed: the {{decision}} to build around the remains of the 13th-century walls meant that damp was able to permeate and the new walls cracked. The roof also caused problems: in 1961 the timberwork had to be renewed after a woodworm infestation. Internal reorganisation and renewal was carried out throughout the 1960s and 1970s as well.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} purpose of wainscoting was {{to cover the}} lower part of walls, which, in houses constructed with poor or non-existent <b>damp-proof</b> courses, are often affected by rising dampness. Its purpose is now decorative.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>damp-proof</b> {{membrane}} (DPM) is a {{membrane material}} applied to prevent moisture transmission. A common example is polyethylene sheeting laid under a concrete slab {{to prevent the}} concrete from gaining moisture through capillary action. A DPM {{may be used for}} the DPC.|$|R
5000|$|Rising damp {{is widely}} {{referred}} to in Victorian literature and the Public Health Act of 1875 introduced the requirement for a <b>damp-proof</b> course in walls to prevent rising damp. An entry in the British Medical Journal from 1872 describes the phenomenon of rising damp as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|From Truscon {{laboratories}} viewpoint waterproofing {{was considered}} methods {{and means of}} protecting underground construction like foundations and footings. It also pertains to structures intended for retaining water like water tanks and containing water under hydrostatic conditions like in water pipes, tunnels, reservoirs, and cisterns. <b>Damp-proofing</b> was considered the methods of keeping dampness out of {{the main part of}} concrete buildings. It involves the methods of treating exposed walls above ground level to avoid the entrance of moisture into the building. These definitions then qualified their various products as servicing particular needs.|$|E
50|$|Old farm {{buildings}} may show the following signs of deterioration: rotting in timber-framed constructions due to damp, {{cracks in the}} masonry from movement of the walls, e.g. ground movement, roofing problems (e.g. outward thrust of it, deterioration of purlins and gable ends), foundation problems, penetration of tree roots; lime mortar being washed away due to inadequate weather-protection. Walls made of cob, earth mortars or walls with rubble cores are all highly vulnerable to water penetration, and replacement or covering of breathable materials with cement or <b>damp-proofing</b> materials may trap moisture within the walls.|$|E
5000|$|BRE Digest 245 {{suggests}} {{that with the}} exception of replacement physical DPCs, only methods of treatment with third party accreditation (e.g. British Board of Agrement Certificate) should be considered for the treatment of rising damp. It then goes on to state that the only method of currently satisfying this requirement is DPC injection (liquid or cream - although <b>damp-proofing</b> rods have subsequently been made available with BBA approval) and that [...] "this is the only method which BRE considers suitable where insertion of a physical DPC is not possible." ...|$|E
50|$|After the 1982 {{introduction}} of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Hong Kong trading company Locumals commissioned Intelligent Software, headed by international chess player David Levy, to develop a home computer in the UK. During development the machine had the codename DPC, which stood for <b>damp-proof</b> course, to confuse potential competitors. The machine was also known by the names Samurai, Oscar, Elan and Flan before the Enterprise name was finally chosen.|$|R
5000|$|Konrad Fisher's article [...] "The Fraud of Rising Damp" [...] {{points out}} that the {{historic}} city hall in Bamberg stands in the river Regnitz and its bridge remains dry without any chemical, mechanical or electronic <b>damp-proof</b> course. However, evidence suggests that not all walls are capable of supporting rising damp, so merely observing that rising damp does not occur in a particular wall does not disprove its existence in other walls.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>damp-proof</b> course (DPC) is {{a barrier}} through the {{structure}} {{designed to prevent}} moisture rising by capillary action such as through a phenomenon known as rising damp. Rising damp {{is the effect of}} water rising from the ground into property. The damp proof course may be horizontal or vertical. A DPC layer is usually laid below all masonry walls, regardless if the wall is a load bearing wall or a partition wall.|$|R
50|$|From {{the initial}} idea of {{protecting}} against water damage developed {{the science of}} integral waterproofing—the introduction of some element into the wet cement {{during the process of}} making causing a high degree of impermeability and imperviousness. Water in masonry does harm structurally because of its solvent properties and because it expands when frozen breaking concrete. Water is observed into concrete walls like a sponge absorbs water through capillary action. A wet wall produces damp and clammy conditions that promote and spread disease. While structural <b>damp-proofing</b> and waterproofing to prevent decay was a motive of the Truscon laboratories chemicals, the side benefit was that it provided better hygienic conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Replastering {{may not be}} {{necessary}} where salt contamination is not severe. BS6576:2005 states that [...] "Where the plaster {{appears to be in}} sound condition, the extent of plaster to be removed may be minimised by delaying any decision to replaster until the drying period is complete." [...] Avoiding the need to replaster in this way can reduce disruption and mess and has the advantage of allowing the original lime or gypsum-based plaster to be maintained. However, the deficiencies of any remedial damp-proof course will be more apparent if the wall is not covered with a waterproof render. For this reason it is important to check the BBA certificate of the <b>damp-proofing</b> system to ensure that it is valid for use where replastering is not being carried out.|$|E
50|$|Even with {{functioning}} {{sump pumps}} or low water tables, basements may become wet after rainfall, due to improper drainage. The ground {{next to the}} basement must be graded such that water flows away from the basement wall. Downspouts from roof gutters should drain freely into the storm sewer or directed away from the house. Downspouts should not {{be connected to the}} foundation draintiles. If the draintiles become clogged by leaves or debris from the rain gutters, the roof water would cause basement flooding through the draintile. <b>Damp-proofing</b> or waterproofing materials are typically applied to outside of the basement wall. It is virtually impossible to make a concrete wall waterproof, over the long run, so drainage is the key. There are draining membranes that {{can be applied to the}} outside of the basement that create channels for water against the basement wall to flow to the foundation drains.|$|E
50|$|In early {{military}} engineering, a saucisson (French for a large, dry-filled sausage) was {{a primitive}} type of fuse, {{consisting of a}} long tube or hose of cloth or leather, typically about an inch and half in diameter (37 mm), <b>damp-proofed</b> with pitch and filled with black powder. It was normally laid in a protective wooden trough, and ignited by use of a torch or slow match. Saucissons were used to fire fougasses, petards, mines and camouflets.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{forms of}} {{dampness}} {{can be prevented}} by thoughtful building design and careful construction. In the UK, well built modern houses include damp proofing {{in the form of}} a synthetic <b>damp-proof</b> course (DPC), about 15 cm above ground level, to act as a barrier through which water cannot pass. Slate or [...] "engineering bricks" [...] with a low porosity were often used for the first few courses above ground level, and these can help minimise the problem.|$|R
2500|$|A {{new south}} door was added in 1626: wrought iron nails in the {{woodwork}} {{spell out the}} date [...] [...] Earlier, during the Jacobean era, a pulpit with scrollwork-decorated panelling was installed. [...] A wooden gallery was built at the west end in 1723. [...] Re-shingling of the spire {{was carried out in}} 1731 (by craftsmen from Rotherfield, well-known locally for its shingling industry), 1734 and 1741, when part of the south wall of the chancel was also shingled to make it <b>damp-proof.</b>|$|R
