40|$|A {{dilution}} series of water extracts made from 13 <b>gelling</b> <b>agents</b> {{commonly used in}} tissue culture was screened for root-stimulating activity using the mungbean bioassay. The <b>gelling</b> <b>agents</b> were grouped according to their rooting response as good (30 roots or more per cutting), intermediate (20 – 30 roots per cutting) or poor (less than 20 roots per cutting). The best rooting response, comparable to rooting with exogenously applied IBA at 10 − 3 M, was detected in extracts from Agar Bacteriological, Difco Bacto Agar, Difco BiTek™ Agar and Malt Extract Agar. Malt Extract Broth and Mueller- Hinton Agar extracts inhibited rooting when applied at high dilutions (100 % and/or 50 %). Extraction of Gelrite with water was problematic and a poor rooting response was observed.

5000|$|Jellies and gums:Jellies and gums are thick {{liquid sugar}} candies. [...] Gums, such as wine gums, are drier than jellies.

The most popular forms of <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> are gelatin, agar-agar, starch (more typical of American jelly candies), and pectin (more typical of European candies).
