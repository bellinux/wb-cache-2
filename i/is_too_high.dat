5|$|April 5: At Los Alamos, Emilio Segrè {{receives}} the first sample of reactor-bred plutonium from Oak Ridge, and within ten days discovers that the spontaneous fission rate <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> {{for use in}} a gun-type fission weapon (because of Pu-240 isotope present as an impurity in the Pu-239).|$|E
5|$|Bats may avoid flying {{during the}} day to prevent {{overheating}} in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. Bats {{may not be able}} to dissipate heat if the ambient temperature <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>high.</b> Unlike birds which have air sacs or other mammals which have sweat glands, bats have no means to cool themselves by evaporation, though they may use saliva to cool themselves in an emergency.|$|E
5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E

25|$|Classical {{models of}} {{unemployment}} occurs when wages <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> for employers {{to be willing}} to hire more workers. Wages may <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.|$|R

I ought never to have thought of touching her.) But we two <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>high,</b> our aims and work and obligations <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> for any ordinary love making. That sort of thing would embarrass us, would spoil everything.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>high,</b> the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E
5|$|Thermal {{disruption}} at {{elevated temperature}} increases {{the rate of}} depurination (loss of purine bases from the DNA backbone) and single-strand breaks. For example, hydrolytic depurination {{is seen in the}} thermophilic bacteria, which grow in hot springs at 40–80°C. The rate of depurination (300 purine residues per genome per generation) <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> in these species to be repaired by normal repair machinery, hence a possibility of an adaptive response cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic phases {{are those}} that occur in a certain {{temperature}} range. If the temperature rise <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>high,</b> thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional isotropic liquid phase. At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal. Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, on heating {{a particular type of}} LC molecule (called mesogen) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para-azoxyanisole.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{any other}} element, helium will remain liquid down to {{absolute}} zero at normal pressures. This {{is a direct}} effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy of the system <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> to allow freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5K (about −272°C or −457°F) at about 25 bar (2.5MPa) of pressure. It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%. With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214±0.006g/cm3 at 1.15K and 66atm; the projected density at 0K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187±0.009g/cm3. At higher temperatures, helium will solidify with sufficient pressure. At room temperature, this requires about 114,000 atm.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic model}} can be {{extended}} to incorporate a supra-game played by {{the governments of the}} respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating the reaction of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of subsidy that <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>high</b> and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an export tax., where m is a competitively produced numéraire good This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.|$|E

25|$|A second common {{reason for}} this kind of {{discrimination}} is when the worker or consumer is not cost-efficient.
