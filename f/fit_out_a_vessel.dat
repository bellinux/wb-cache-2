6000|$|Dr. Cook had a {{great friend}} in Mr. John R. Bradley, a man of means, who was a {{well-known}} traveler and hunter. The two talked the matter over, and decided to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> and make a trip {{as far north as}} possible. In the main, the project was kept secret, and neither boasted of what they were about to attempt to do. At Gloucester, Mass., they found a ship that suited their purpose, and she was thoroughly overhauled and renamed the John R. Bradley. Suitable provisions for a long trip were taken on board, and the vessel left Gloucester harbor July 3, 1907. It did not look at all like a [...] "North Pole" [...] expedition, and its departure excited very little comment. It was thought that Mr. Bradley and Dr. Cook had merely gone off on a hunting trip after bears and walrus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, truly, signorini miei. This fellow-captive of {{mine was}} a cavaliere in his own land, {{but he had been}} betrayed and sold by his enemies, and he mourned piteously for la sposa sua--his bride, as they say here. A goodly man and a tall, piteously cramped in the narrow deck, I grieved to leave him there when the good confraternita at Genoa paid my ransom. Having learnt to speak il Tedesco, and being no longer able to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel,</b> I made my venture beyond the Alps; but, alas! till this moment fortune has still been adverse. My mules died of the toil of {{crossing}} the mountains; and, when with reduced baggage I came to the river beneath there--when my horses fell and my servants fled, and the peasants came down with their hayforks--I thought myself in hands no better than those of the Moors themselves." ...|$|E

60|$|But Blackbeard became {{tired of}} playing {{the part of a}} make-believe respectable citizen, and having spent the greater part of his money, he wanted to make some more. Consequently he <b>fitted</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> small <b>vessel,</b> and declaring that he was going on a {{legitimate}} commercial cruise, he took out regular papers for a port in the West Indies and sailed away, {{as if he had been}} a mild-mannered New England mariner going to catch codfish. The officials of the town of Bath, from which he sailed, came down to the ship and shook hands with him and hoped he would have good success.|$|R
50|$|USS Raven was a {{transport}} and supply ship that {{served in the}} United States Navy from 1813 to 1815. Raven was serving as the merchant schooner Mary on Lake Ontario when the U.S. Navy purchased her on 6 February 1813 {{for use in the}} War of 1812. Renamed Raven, she was <b>fitted</b> <b>out</b> as <b>a</b> bomb <b>vessel,</b> but instead served as a {{transport and}} supply ship during the war.|$|R
60|$|In {{attempting}} to regain our lost commerce and carrying trade I have heretofore {{called attention to}} the States south of us offering a field where much might be accomplished. To further this object I suggest that a small appropriation be made, accompanied with authority for the Secretary of the Navy to <b>fit</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> naval <b>vessel</b> to ascend the Amazon River to the mouth of the Madeira; thence to explore that river and its tributaries into Bolivia, and to report to Congress at its next session, or as soon as practicable, the accessibility of the country by water, its resources, and the population so reached. Such an exploration would cost but little; it can do no harm, and may result in establishing a trade of value to both nations.|$|R
50|$|The {{schooner}} {{remained in}} that vicinity, {{ready to help}} to defend {{the seat of the}} Federal Government in the event that Robert E. Lee's army — which had crossed the Potomac River into Maryland — attack. After the Union stand at Antietam had repelled this invasion of the North, Arletta left Washington on 18 September to begin operations downstream with the Potomac Flotilla. She continued this duty until returning to the Washington Navy Yard at the end of October to have her mortar removed and to be <b>fitted</b> <b>out</b> as <b>an</b> ordnance <b>vessel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Green {{was born}} at Blackwall in December 1803, the son of George Green, by his first {{marriage}} with Miss Perry, daughter of a shipbuilder of repute at Blackwall. On {{the introduction of the}} elder Green into Perry's business, he became <b>a</b> shipowner, and <b>fitted</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> number of <b>vessels</b> in the whaling trade, thus laying the foundation of the house which {{at the time of his}} son's admission to the firm was styled Green, Wigram, & Green. Increasing their operations the partners took advantage of the East India Company's charter to build East Indiamen, for which they became well known.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{species of}} whale were hunted in {{southern}} Labrador, the North Atlantic right whale and the bowhead whale. The former were {{taken during the}} [...] "early" [...] season in the summer, while the latter was caught from the fall to early winter (October–January). DNA analysis of the old bones after a comprehensive search of Basque whaling ports from the 16th to the 17th century, in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St. Lawrence found that the right whale was by then less than 1% of the whales taken. During the peak of Terranova whaling (1560s–1580s) the Spanish Basques used well-armed galleons of up to 600–700 tons, while the French Basques usually <b>fitted</b> <b>out</b> smaller <b>vessels.</b> <b>A</b> 450-ton Basque ship carrying 100 or more men required about 300 hogsheads of cider and wine and 300–400 quintals of ship's biscuit, {{as well as other}} dry provisions. In Labrador the men subsisted mainly on locally caught cod and salmon, as well as the occasional caribou or wild duck. This diet was supplemented with dried peas, beans, chickpeas, olive oil, mustard seed, and bacon. Before leaving for Terranova sometime in the months of May or June, a priest went aboard the ships to bless them and say a special mass for the success of the expeditions. Sailing across the stormy North Atlantic must have been a very unpleasant experience for the crew of up to 130 men and boys, as they slept on the hard decks or filthy, vermin-invested straw palliasses. Halfway there the smell of refuse in the bilge would have been unbearable. After a voyage of two months the ships would anchor in one of the twelve harbors on the southern shore of Labrador and eastern Quebec. Archaeological evidence has been found for ten of these harbors – Middle Bay and Blanc-Sablon in Quebec, and Schooner Cove, West St. Modeste, East St. Modeste, Carrol Cove, Red Bay, Chateau Bay, Pleasure Harbour, and Cape Charles in southern Labrador. Once the ice had disappeared the ships entered the harbors where the coopers went ashore and erected their dwellings and workshops, while most of the crew lived aboard ship. The boys were also sent ashore to chop wood and prepare meals.|$|R
