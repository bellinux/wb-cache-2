30|$|Fastening screws {{with the}} {{appropriate}} torque {{is very important for}} the success of an implant. First, fastening is done with a <b>hand</b> <b>driver,</b> and then final fastening must be done at a certain torque with a torque wrench. It is very important that to know whether we can exert a torque of how much with <b>hand</b> <b>driver</b> in advance. However, dentists may not have the same torque wrench that is used in the implant system of another dental clinic. There are also implant systems that do not have a torque wrench, and it is important for each dentist to know what torque can be exerted with the <b>hand</b> <b>driver.</b> Doing so requires the use of a torquemeter (Shiigai 2007), but it is not realistic for a general-practice dentist to be equipped with a torquemeter. Therefore, we have developed and introduce here a simple adapter that makes it possible to use a standard torque wrench already in one’s possession to measure the torque that can be exerted with a <b>hand</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E

So we may use standard deviation of <b>driver</b> <b>hands</b> position to recognize driver turn behavior.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the overall {{design and implementation}} of a video sensor {{for the detection of}} risky behaviors of car drivers near previously identified and georeferenced black spots. The main goal is to provide the driver with a visual audio alert that informs of the proximity of an area of high incidence of highway accidents only if their driving behavior could result in a risky situation. It proposes a video sensor for detecting and supervising driver behavior, its main objective being manual distractions, so <b>hand</b> <b>driver</b> supervision is performed. A GPS signal is also considered, the GPS information is compared with a database of global positioning Black Spots to determine the relative proximity of a risky area. The outputs of the video sensor and GPS sensor are combined to evaluate a possible risky behavior. The results are promising in terms of risk analysis in order to be validated for use {{in the context of the}} automotive industry as future work...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Some clinicians use a {{handheld}} screw driver {{instead of a}} torque wrench to definitively tighten abutment screws. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the removal torque of one-piece and two-piece abutments tightened with {{a handheld}} driver and a torque control ratchet. Methods: 40 ITI implants were placed in acrylic blocks and divided into 4 groups. In groups one and two, 10 ITI one-piece abutments (Solid®) and in groups three and four, 10 ITI two-piece abutments (Synocta®) were placed on the implants. In groups one and three abutments were tightened by 5 experienced males and 5 experienced females using a handheld driver. In groups two and four abutments were tightened using a torque wrench with torque values of 10, 20 and 35 N. cm. Insertion torque and removal torque values of the abutments were measured with a digital torque meter. Results: The insertion torque values (ITVs) of males in both abutments were significantly higher than those of females. ITVs in both Solid® and Synocta® abutments tightened with a handheld screwdriver were similar to the torque of 20 N. cm in the torque wrench. Removal torque values (RTVs) of solid® abutments were higher than those of synocta® abutments. Conclusion: The one- piece abutments (solid®) showed higher RTVs than the two-piece abutments (synocta®). <b>Hand</b> <b>driver</b> does not produce sufficient preload force for the final tightening of the abutmen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{vehicular}} ad-hoc network (VANET) aims to make {{road traffic}} {{safer and more}} efficient. Security and privacy are two important but somewhat contradictory objectives. On the one hand, vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) authentication requires drivers to present some individual credentials. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>drivers</b> need privacy protections on their identities, physical loca-tions, and other contextual information. No sensitive information should be unnecessarily exposed during the authentication phase. Therefore, anonymous authentication is expected to {{play a critical role}} in VANET. In this paper, we propose a novel biometrics-based anonymous mutual authentication with provable link-layer location privacy preservation. During its authentication phase, two vehicles negotiate their temporary session key and generate two temporary MAC addresses. These two addresses, instead of the real ones, are used in all future communication frames. We further protect the biometric privacy with the help of a biometric encryption technique. Our analysis and simulation results show that the protocol is superior and lightweight with strong security and privacy protection. I...|$|R
