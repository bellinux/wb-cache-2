25|$|The terrorists {{from the}} second floor, from {{apartment}} number one, had a clear view <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> we moved out, walked along the lawn without running or zigzagging but in strong and confident legs.

25|$|Mélisande is at {{the tower}} window, singing a song (Mes longs cheveux) as she combs her hair. Pelléas appears and asks her to lean out so he can kiss her hand as he is going away the next day. He cannot reach her hand but her long hair tumbles down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> he kisses and caresses it instead. Pelléas playfully ties Mélisande's hair to a willow tree {{in spite of her}} protests that someone might see them. A flock of doves takes flight. Mélisande panics when she hears Golaud's {{footsteps}} approaching. Golaud dismisses Pelléas and Mélisande as nothing but a pair of children and leads Pelléas away.|$|E
500|$|... "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" [...] and {{the older}} still [...] "The Story of the Three Bears" [...] are two {{variations}} of a 19th-century fairy tale. The original tale tells of a badly-behaved old woman who enters the forest home of three bachelor bears whilst they are away. She sits in their chairs, eats some of their porridge, and sleeps {{in one of their}} beds. When the bears return and discover her, she starts up, jumps <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> is never seen again. The other major version brings Goldilocks to the tale (replacing the old woman), and an even later version retained Goldilocks, but has the three bachelor bears transformed into Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear.|$|E

500|$|Darwin {{described}} [...] "the {{most remarkable}} of all Orchids", Catasetum, and showed how in these flowers, [...] "as throughout nature, pre-existing structures and capacities [...] utilised for new purposes". He explained the mechanism {{in which the}} pollen masses of the pollinium were connected by a bent stalk or pedicel to a sticky disc kept moist {{at the back of}} the flower. When an insect touched an [...] "antenna" [...] projecting from the back of the flower, this released the bent pedicel which sprang straight and fired the pollinium, sticky disc first, at the insect. In experiments, Darwin had imitated this action using a whalebone spring. He vividly illustrated how the flower ejected the pollinium with considerable force: [...] "I touched the antennæ of C. callosum whilst holding the flower at about a yard's distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> the pollinium hit the pane of glass, and adhered to the smooth vertical surface by its adhesive disc." ...|$|E
500|$|The pre-title {{sequence}} {{lasts for}} about 14 minutes, the longest pre-title sequence in the Bond series to date. In the [...] "making of" [...] documentaries on the Ultimate Edition DVD release, director Michael Apted {{said that the}} scene was originally much longer than that. Originally, the pre-credits sequence was to have ended with Bond's leap <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> descent to the ground, finishing as Bond rushes away from the area as police cars approach. Then, after the credits the sequence in MI6 headquarters would have been next, with the boat scenes the next major action sequence. However, the pre-credits scenes were viewed as lacklustre when compared to ones from previous 007 films, so the credits were pushed back to appear after the boat sequence. The Daily Telegraph claimed that the British Government prevented some filming {{in front of the}} actual MI6 Headquarters at Vauxhall Cross, citing a security risk. However, a Foreign Office spokesperson rejected the claims and expressed displeasure with the article.|$|E
500|$|On 19 May 1724, Sheppard {{was arrested}} for a second time, {{caught in the act}} of picking a pocket in Leicester Fields (near present-day Leicester Square). [...] He was {{detained}} overnight in St Ann's Roundhouse in Soho and visited there the next day by Lyon; she was recognised as his wife and locked in a cell with him. [...] They appeared before Justice Walters, who sent them to the New Prison in Clerkenwell, but they escaped from their cell, known as the Newgate Ward, within a matter of days. [...] By 25 May, Whitsun Monday, Sheppard and Lyon had filed through their manacles; they removed a bar <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> used their knotted bed-clothes to descend to ground level. [...] Finding themselves in the yard of the neighbouring bridewell, they clambered over the 22-foot-high (6.7m) prison gate to freedom. [...] This feat was widely publicised, not least because Sheppard was only a small man, and Lyon was a large, buxom woman.|$|E

60|$|It {{was growing}} dark when the party on horseback {{approached}} the ranch. Already lights were streaming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> automobile {{stood in front}} of the wide veranda which ran around two sides of the building.|$|R
500|$|The video later {{shifts to}} a night scene on a {{building}} rooftop, where half of Gaga's body is inside a car, while her legs protrude <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> {{onto the roof}} of the car. She has blonde hair and wears a black plastic leather outfit. She gets her full body into the car, kissing a [...] "Marry the Night" [...] tape and inserting it into the audio player. The song begins playing as Gaga smokes on the driver's seat. As the chorus begins, vehicles in the background explode aflame and Gaga exits the car and dances. In a new dance studio setting as the second verse begins, Gaga enters with her dancers, and warms up to do an intricate choreography during the chorus with her team. During the bridge, she and her dance team take a break and warm up to perform another choreography. The rooftop car parking scene and a bath scene intersperse. Gaga and her dancers repeat the choreography [...] during the final chorus, as one dancers falls and is helped up by Gaga. During the breakdown, Gaga and her team dance on a street while interspersing scenes show her causing chaos, including falling down the stairs, attempting to get into a car with a ridiculously oversized hat and pouring water over herself with a marble plant pot in the bath. She enters a car and reveals [...] "Interscope Records; Hollywood, CA; 4p.m." [...] written on her palm. The last scene shows Gaga in couture and surrounded by flames. The video ends with Gaga suddenly vanishing.|$|E
2500|$|The Mexico City police {{department}} {{noticed that the}} Matamoros killings were similar to murders carried out in Mexico City between 1987 and 1989. After consulting local witchcraft practitioners and sorcerers, the police heard that Constanzo was probably hiding in Cuauhtémoc, one of the city's boroughs. Another contact told the police {{that there was an}} address of interest in the [...] neighborhood, next to Cuauhtémoc. The {{police department}} sent 16 officers to search the area. At a supermarket, they interrogated a shoemaker who claimed to have seen a woman who matched Aldrete's description. The police then spotted a man at the supermarket who was attempting to buy large amounts of groceries with U.S. dollars. They followed the man and saw that he was living at an apartment on Río Sena. By the end of the week, the police concluded that the man was De León and that he was buying groceries for Constanzo. On May 6, 1989, the police surrounded the building and waited for traffic to subside before raiding the premises. However, a black vehicle {{pulled up in front of}} the apartment complex and the police walked over to investigate. Constanzo noticed the police from the window of his apartment and opened fire at the officers who were at ground level. Constanzo threw golden coins and paper money <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> burned some of his money on a stove. Constanzo eventually ran out of ammunition and began to lose his patience. After about 45 minutes, and worried of his imminent capture, Constanzo ordered De León to kill him and Quintana Rodríguez.|$|E

60|$|Finishing {{the meal}} very quickly, people congregated in the hall, where they felt more secure {{than in any}} other place because they could retreat far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> {{although}} they heard the thunder, they could not see anything.
