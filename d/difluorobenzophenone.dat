A series of semi-IPNs combining a fluorinated hexane network and a linear sulfonated poly(aryl ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) has been obtained by varying the SPEEK content from 50 to 80 wt. %. A telechelic functionalized acrylate oligomer was obtained by acrylation of, -fluorinated hexanediol, while SPEEK was synthesized by polycondensation of sulfonated <b>difluorobenzophenone</b> with the bisphenol 6 F. These semi-IPN membranes have been characterized by infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering. A semi-IPN containing 60 wt. % SPEEK has been tested as a fuel cell membrane...|$|E
40|$|Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is a {{well-known}} polymer used for implants and devices, especially spinal ones. To overcome the biomaterial related infection risks, 4 - 4 ′- <b>difluorobenzophenone,</b> the famous PEEK monomer, was modified in order to introduce binding sites for silver ions, which are well known for their antimicrobial activity. The complexation of these new monomers with different silver salts was studied. Crystal structures of different intermediates were obtained with a linear coordination between two pyridine groups and the silver ions in all cases. The mechanical and thermal properties of different new polymers were characterized. The synthesized PEEKN 5 polymers showed similar properties than the PEEK ones whereas the PEEKN 7 polymers showed similar thermal properties but the mechanical properties are {{not as good as}} the ones of PEEK. To improve these properties, these polymers were complexed with silver nitrate in order to “cross-link” with silver ions. The presence of ionic silver in the polymer was then confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). Finally, a silver-based antimicrobial compound was successfully coated on the surface of PEEKN 5...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} reduction {{of a series}} of halogenated benzophenones X-C 6 H 4 COC 6 H 4 -Y(1) was studied in aprotic solvents, in the absence and presence of CO 2, by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and controlled-potential electrolysis. The mechanism of electroreduction in dimethylformamide (DMF) has been investigated in some detail. Most of the compounds undergo reductive carbon-halogen bond cleavage in the time window of CV. The radical anions derived from <b>difluorobenzophenones</b> (X = Y = 4 -F; X = 2 -F, Y = 4 -F) {{as well as from the}} 3 -chloro derivative are quite stable with a cleavage rate constant (kc) of the order of 0. 01 s- 1 or less. With 4 -chloro-, 2 -chloro-, 4, 4 '-dichloro- and 2, 4 '-dichorobenzophenones, kc of 1 radical anion has values in the range 4 - 254 s- 1 in DMF. In the presence of CO 2 all radical anions react quite rapidly with CO 2, carboxylation of 1 radical anion being much faster than dehalogenation. Controlled-potential electrolyses were carried out in DMF, MeCN and N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP) in an undivided cell using a compact graphite cathode and an aluminium sacrificial anode. The principal product under these conditions was always the a-hydroxyacid X-C 6 H 4 C(OH) (CO 2 H) C 6 H 4 -Y. In NMP under 1 atm of CO 2, acid yields around 90...|$|R
