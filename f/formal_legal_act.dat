Kastel is one of six districts of Mainz on the right-hand side of the Rhine which were separated from Mainz in this way. The separation from Mainz is the issue of intense debates by local patriots in three districts (Kastel, Amöneburg and Kostheim). Many Kastel residents feel like they belong to Mainz which reflects, apart from the administrative affiliation, the reality of everyday life. The city center of Wiesbaden is about ten kilometers from Kastel whereas the city center of Mainz is just {{on the opposite side of}} the Rhine. The three mentioned districts of Wiesbaden still bear the designation [...] "Mainz- ..." [...] because until today no closed <b>formal</b> <b>legal</b> <b>act</b> has been made up. The signs, when entering the districts, are a curiosity because they say [...] "Federal State Capital Wiesbaden District Mainz-Kastel". On the other hand, many inhabitants of Kastel feel like they belong to the German state Hesse (Mainz was a part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse from 1815-World War II) and do not identify with Rhineland-Palatinate whatsoever.|$|E

Therefore, this research aims {{to focus on the}} history of the development of judicial customary law in Indonesia since the colonial period 1602 till the period after the MoU Helsinki in Aceh. The historic legal approach is applied by exploring how acts provide space for enhancing the system.

40|$|Freedom to {{contract}} and its restriction in business obligations (Summary) This thesis deals with freedom {{to contract}} and its limitations {{in the field of}} business obligations. It introduces the possibilities that parties have when entering into contracts as well as it outlines the boundaries which they cannot cross. It aspires to clarify the topic by referring to a wide scope of related judicial decisions which have evolved throughout the years. The first chapter briefly describes and classifies business obligations; hence it specifies cases in which {{freedom to contract}} and its restriction apply. The second chapter then characterizes freedom to contract and sets it to the context of other fundamental principles governing private law. It also clarifies the normative roots of this freedom and describes the nature of legal rules that can be freely deviated from in a contract. The following chapter reviews particular manifestations of freedom to contract with special focus on free determination of contract's content. The last chapter looks into various kinds of restrictions that limit contracting parties entering into business obligations. It deals with certain issues regarding mandatory rules and mentions some <b>formal</b> requirements regarding <b>legal</b> <b>acts.</b> Then the analysis of restriction of freedom to contract set [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{economic}} relationships between farmers and middlemen in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta {{and places it}} in the context of the new rule of law movement. The new rule of law movement, which has grown in the wake of the collapse of formerly centrally planned economies, argues that the rule of law is a prerequisite for economic growth and that transition economies can only succeed by adopting strong <b>formal</b> <b>legal</b> rights and institutions. Notwithstanding more than two decades of an aggressive rule of law reform program, Vietnam’s <b>formal</b> <b>legal</b> system remains weak. Using survey data from a sample of fruit farmers and middlemen we find that participants in the farm-gate market for pomelos carry out relatively complex transactions by granting buyers credit with little explicit reliance on <b>formal</b> <b>legal</b> structures. The development of complex markets for fruit in the Mekong Delta in the absence of strong legal rights provides lessons for proponents of the new rule of law movement. First, in the absence of formal structures, private parties find ways of structuring transactions in order to assure contract performance. Second, development of <b>formal</b> <b>legal</b> structures is a very long term proposition with uncertain results. And finally, the experience of farmers and middlemen suggests that formal law and the development of <b>formal</b> <b>legal</b> institutions appear to trail economic development and should not therefore be considered an essential component of short-term economic reform efforts...|$|R
