5|$|There was no {{indication}} that the aircraft's Ballistic Recovery Systems <b>emergency</b> <b>parachute,</b> designed to bring the small plane down safely, was deployed. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the plane circled the Statue of Liberty before flying north up the East River and disappeared from radar near the Queensboro Bridge. The FAA confirmed that the plane was flying under visual flight rules (VFR) and had attracted no special attention from air traffic controllers or NORAD before the crash. The aircraft took a hard U-shaped turn before it hit the building.|$|E
5|$|Henri L'Estrange, {{known as}} the Australian Blondin, was an Australian {{successful}} funambulist and accident prone aeronautical balloonist. Modelling himself on the famous French wire-walker Charles Blondin, L'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s, culminating in three walks across Sydney's Middle Harbour in 1877. He remains the only tightrope performer ever to have walked across a part of Sydney Harbour. L'Estrange was an early balloonist, and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s – one being successful, one ending in Australia's first <b>emergency</b> <b>parachute</b> descent, and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage, personal injury and a human stampede. He tried {{to return to his}} original career of tightrope walking but, with new forms of entertainment, humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators, he found success elusive. Public benefits were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1894.|$|E
500|$|... {{but there}} are some hazards. Although {{training}} and safe procedures are central to the ethos of the sport, a few fatal accidents occur every year, almost all caused by pilot error. In particular there is a risk of mid-air collisions between gliders, because two pilots might choose to fly to the same area of lift and so might collide. Because of this risk, pilots usually wear parachutes. To avoid other gliders and general aviation traffic, pilots must comply with the Rules of the Air and keep a good lookout. In several European countries and Australia, the FLARM warning system is used to help avoid mid-air collisions between gliders. A few modern gliders have a ballistic <b>emergency</b> <b>parachute</b> to stabilize the aircraft after a collision.|$|E
50|$|Calipt'Air AG was a Swiss {{aircraft}} manufacturer based in Spiez. The company specialized {{in the design}} and manufacture of paragliders and also produced a line of <b>emergency</b> <b>parachutes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The company {{produced}} {{a range of}} paragliders, including the Calipt'Air Serenis intermediate glider, the Calipt'Air Vectis performance intermediate and competition wing and the Calipt'Air Walabis Bi for the tandem flight training role. It also made the SOS line of <b>emergencies</b> <b>parachutes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Assuming that Cooper {{was not a}} paratrooper, but was an Air Force veteran, Carr {{suggested}} {{the possibility that he}} was an aircraft cargo loader. Such an assignment would have given him knowledge and experience in the aviation industry; and loaders—because they throw cargo out of flying aircraft—wear <b>emergency</b> <b>parachutes</b> and receive rudimentary jump training. Such training would have given Cooper a working knowledge of parachutes—but [...] "not necessarily sufficient knowledge to survive the jump he made." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Cirrus SR22 is {{equipped}} with a whole-plane <b>emergency</b> recovery <b>parachute</b> system: the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). This has contributed to its market success and has given it the name [...] "the plane with the parachute".|$|R
5000|$|On May 10, 1926, while {{a student}} at the ASTS, he {{collided}} in mid-air during a flight formation with fellow student, Major Harold Geiger.

5000|$|Canadian Rigger As {{are limited}} to {{assembling}} and packing sport parachutes. They can replace components and do simple hand-sewing. At {{the end of the}} Rigger A Course candidates can choose to be tested on round or square parachutes and they can choose which type of container for their practical test (one-pin sport, two-pin sport, Pop-Top or chest). New CSPA Rigger A licensees are issued a temporary rating and must pack 10 reserves within the next 12 months to earn their [...] "continuous" [...] rating. Additional certifications are available to permit rigger As to pack tandem and Pilot <b>Emergency</b> <b>Parachutes</b> (PEP). The Rigger A1 and A2 sub-classes allow use of sewing machines to patch parachutes and change lines.|$|R
5000|$|United States Air Force {{parachute}} riggers {{are trained}} at Sheppard AFB in Texas. The career field is classified under [...] "Aircrew Flight Equipment" [...] Airmen attend a 3½-month course learning to inspect, pack, and repair <b>emergency</b> <b>parachutes,</b> {{as well as}} a wide variety of other types of aircrew equipment. Once graduated from this technical school, students are assigned to a duty location where they are further instructed using on the job training. USAF aerial delivery riggers (2T2X1) packed training airdrop loads for airlift units. In recent years, Aerial Delivery Air Force riggers have been replaced by contract civilian employees since the mission does not require deployment overseas, and instead consists of supporting training missions at home station.|$|R
2500|$|To {{protect the}} crew during an aborted launch, the HL-20 PLS {{incorporates}} several safety features. Its interior layout with a ladder and hatch arrangement {{was designed to}} permit rapid egress of passengers and crew for emergencies on the launch pad. For emergencies during which the crew must leave at once (launch vehicle fire or explosion), the HL-20, in a manner much similar to Apollo program rockets, would be equipped with emergency escape rockets to push the PLS away from the booster. Once at a safe distance, three <b>emergency</b> <b>parachutes</b> would open to slow the vehicle's descent into the ocean. [...] Upon splashdown, inflatable flotation devices would ensure {{that at least one}} of the PLS's two hatches is above the water and available for emergency crew egress.|$|R

50|$|Just {{after the}} escape tower pulled the descent module away, the booster exploded. Its remains burned {{on the pad}} for nearly 20 hours. Four grid fins {{on the outside of}} the shroud opened and the descent module {{separated}} from the orbital module at an altitude of 650 meters (2132 feet), dropping free of the shroud. The descent module discarded its heat shield, exposing the solid-fuel landing rockets, and deployed a fast-opening <b>emergency</b> <b>parachute.</b> Touchdown occurred about four kilometers (2.4 miles) from the launch pad. The two crew members were badly bruised after the high acceleration, but were otherwise in good health and did not require any medical attention. Upon being greeted by recovery crews, they immediately asked for cigarettes to steady their nerves. The cosmonauts were then given shots of vodka to help them relax.|$|E
