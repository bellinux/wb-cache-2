This connection would be useful with deep deck (thickness greater than 3 in.) composite slabs as well as with commonly used deck where floor-to-floor height needs to be minimized. Five girder specimens were loaded until yielding during the initial phase of the research. The analysis section consists of the yield line theory and finite element study that were used to develop a model to predict the collapse loads of the girder sections. These results from the model were then compared to the experimental loads. A design procedure utilizing the proposed model and future work recommendations are then presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Rail {{transportation}} plays a {{major role}} in the transportation sector of South Africa and many other countries of the world. Trains are locomotives and carriages that travel on rail tracks. The trains steer with the wheel flange against the inside vertical face of the rail head or crown. This steering action produces wear due to the friction between the two steel surfaces moving relative to one another. It is observed that wear at curves is severe due to the high lateral forces of the wheel <b>flange</b> <b>bearing</b> against the rail crown, with very undesirable economic consequences. This study investigated steel rail material degradation at play between the sliding and the rubbing surfaces of the wheel flange on track by characterising some worn rail samples from Mayfair, Johannesburg, South Africa, rail line, with the aim to gain a better understanding of their wear mechanism. Chemical composition analysis of steel rail sample was conducted. Hardness and tensile behaviour of steel rail were measured and calculated, respectively. Microstructure features of the worn rail samples were also examined, using the stereoscope, microscope, and the Scanning Electron Microscope. Topography and roughness test analyses were also conducted. It was discovered that the examined worn out rail, which was originally produced from high carbon steel with pearlites and ferrites microstructure, undergoes a micro-structural evolution to form martensitic structure over the years of usage and exposure to environmental conditions mostly at the surface of the rail, which tends to become brittle. Some welded particles were also found to be interlocked in between the surfaces of the rail, causing gradual degradation and breakdown of the rail. These were caused by pressure shock and impact forces between the movement of the rail and the wheel flange. Hardness tests carried out on the top surfaces of 429, 432 and 591 VHN readings of steel rail compared to that of the sub inner part of 359, 352 and 338 VHN readings of steel track, found the top-surface to be harder. The surface worn-out particles were found to be oxidised. Topography tests were conducted to consider the roughness rate of steel rail track.

In previous papers, gearboxes are most often modeled by simple rectangular boxes if they are numerically optimized. In this paper, however, arather realistic FE model of a gearbox is presented, which includes <b>flanges</b> and <b>bearing</b> bores. The thickness distribution of predefined modification domains is optimized by a sequence of iteratively repeated FE analyses and objective function evaluations so as to minimize the mean level of structure borne sound in the frequency range 0 - 1000 Hz, subject to suitable constraints. Due {{to the size of}} the FE model (about 1700 nodes and 51200 DOFs) and to the huge number of design variables and constraints (821 and 1643, respectively), this constitutes a rather challenging optimization problem that requires enormous computation times. As a result of the optimization, the mean level of structure borne sound is reduced by 5, 7 dB (- 73 %), whereas the structural mass does not increase...|$|R

According to the special requirement of high reliability, long life of wind power bearing, the current manufacturing defects {{of it has been}} analyzed, such as flange, pits, fish-tail, folding, and comparing with its current manufacturing method, which is called ring rolling, therefore, a new method called rolling and bulging-matching techniques is proposed, as wind power bearing ring should be released stress after rolling, then sized through bulging and once again to stress. Ring bulging is still a blank space in China; this project plans to research bulging process kinematics and dynamics analysis first. This paper gives a brief introduction of bulging processing and focus on the analysis of wind power bearing ring bulging forming. Preface At present, the main forming method of large different section ring parts is ring rolling. Ring rolling is a new special forming process to produce seamless ring, it is widely used in the production of ring parts or blanks like <b>flange</b> ring, <b>bearing</b> ring, gear ring, and train wheels [6].

50|$|A sex bolt, (also {{known as}} a barrel nut, barrel bolt, Chicago screw, post and screw or {{connector}} bolt), {{is a type of}} fastener (nut) which has a barrel-shaped flange and protruding boss that is internally threaded. The boss sits within the components being fastened, the <b>flange</b> provides the <b>bearing</b> surface. The sex bolt and accompanying machine screw sit flush {{on either side of the}} surfaces being fastened. It is normally chosen because of its low profile compared to other nuts. The sex bolt often has a built-in feature, such as a slot, to aid in tightening the fastener. Some sex bolts, more commonly known as 'architectural bolts', have knurled barrels to allow one-sided assembly. 'Binding posts' are similar to architectural bolts in that they are designed to be assembled from one side, but they have teeth on the flanged surface to keep them fixed.|$|R
40|$|Classification rules {{regarding}} the dimensioning of CP-mechanism {{has been found}} to be conservative based on experience. This thesis studies the load transmitted into CP-mechanism resulted from ultimate blade failure load (Fex) in heavy ice load condition, mainly focusing on the force on crank pin (Fcrp). Various FE simulations are carried out to investigate the load transmission in CP-mechanism for two hub models. Firstly, a simplification is come up with by using a remote force instead of blade geometry, in order to make the simulations more efficient. Then, initial simulations on the complete hub mechanism are implemented for both models. The results are compared with the results followed the procedure in DNV Classification Notes 51 - 1 and IACS UR I 3. It is found that crank pin force from FE analysis is smaller compared to the result from rules calculation, meaning that the classification rules are conservative. There have been different versions of the application points of ultimate blade failure load and friction coefficient between blade <b>flange,</b> blade carrier <b>bearings</b> and crank disk. In order to achieve a clearer understanding on these factors, further research is implemented by studying three parameters, which are 1) application points of ultimate blade failure load, i. e. spindle arm, 2) geometry gap between blade flange and blade carrier bearings and 3) friction coefficient between blade flange and blade carrier bearings, crank disk and blade carrier bearings. Results show that different forces on crank pin are obtained from FE simulations when applying same spindle arm close to leading edge (LE) or trailing edge (TE). By running simulations of different geometry gaps and friction coefficients between blade <b>flange,</b> blade carrier <b>bearings</b> and crank disk, the purpose is to investigate the friction loss. The result indicates that the geometry gap has slight influence on the force on crank pin and friction coefficient affects the results significantly. Apparently, a bigger friction coefficient will cause more friction loss and smaller force on crank pin. However, the tendency of force on crank pin changing with friction coefficient differs with the relation described in DNV rules. In conclusion, more accurate rules could be suggested based on empirical formulas and FE simulations...|$|R

The Erskine Bridge {{played an important role in}} preserving year round links between the towns of Adelaide and Callington and its associated mines. The bridge is a utilitarian structure that remains largely in its original form, except for the replacement of timber decking by concrete. The bridge is typical of its type and demonstrates the simple use of stone piers and rivetted cast iron trusses. The bridge was named after Mr West-Erskine MP. The current bridge was opened in 1890 and comprises sandstone piers topped with iron trusses. The piers are ashlar faced with some tooling to quoins at the abutments. The road deck was originally timber, spanning across the two rivetted wrought iron trusses. The timber deck was replaced in 1943 with a concrete deck; further extensive repairs were carried out in 1979 to replace expansion <b>bearings,</b> <b>flange</b> plates and to provide corrosion protection to the bridge superstructure. The Erskine Bridge is relatively short and narrow and is supported by a central pier. The abutments and pier are rusticated and the former are battered against the river face.

5000|$|Wheels {{sometimes}} need replacing. The grinder is unplugged, {{and then}} the outer guard is removed. Typically a large nut holds the wheel on the arbor. The handedness (sense) of each nut is assigned to avoid any loosening tendency during grinder use. Thus on a typical grinder the nut is left-handed {{on the left side}} of the grinder from the operator's viewpoint, with wheel rotation [...] "toward" [...] the operator (if the wheel could travel), whereas on the other side the nut is right-handed. [...] "In other words, to remove the nut, it must be turned in the direction that the spindle revolves when the wheel is in operation." [...] Holding the wheel against the wrench's turning action is difficult, but usually the wrench is gently tapped with a hammer instead, which neatly taps the nut loose. A large steel flange is on either side of the wheel, then a paper washer (blotter), then the wheel. The paper is conventionally held to be absolutely necessary to prevent the steel <b>flange</b> from <b>bearing</b> directly against the wheel and tending to crack it; trained workers are expected to know and obey this rule. Thus the entire contact area between flange and wheel is covered, either with paper or with compressible coating (rubber or gasket) on the flange. The wheel's inner diameter may meet the arbor precisely or may be larger with a bushing (sleeve) to reduce it. Before the new wheel is mounted it is ring tested, which involves gently tapping it with a fingernail or tool handle (wood or plastic) to hear its high-pitched ring (comparable to a bell's ring, although not loud), indicating that it is not cracked. It is rung in various spots to be sure. A [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "hoarse" [...] sound (failing to [...] "sing") indicates a crack. With the wheel having passed the ring test, the bushing (if any), wheel, paper blotters, steel flanges, and nut are assembled, and the nut is tightened, not as hard as possible, but enough to be firmly fastened in place. The guard is reinstalled, {{and then the}} grinder can be plugged in again. Dressing may be needed afterward. When the wheel is first started, the operator stands a bit off center, so that if it were to explode, less pathway for injury exists.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on hollow flange beams {{has led to}} the development of an innovative rectangular hollow flange channel beam (RHFCB) for use in floor systems. The new RHFCB is a mono-symmetric structural section made by intermittently rivet fastening two torsionally rigid closed rectangular hollow flanges to a web plate element, which allows section optimisation by selecting appropriate combinations of web and flange widths and thicknesses. However, the current design rules for cold-formed steel sections are not directly applicable to rivet fastened RHFCBs. To date, no investigation has been conducted on their web crippling behaviour and strengths. Hence an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs under End Two Flange (ETF) and Interior Two Flange (ITF) load cases. It showed that RHFCBs failed by web crippling, flange crushing and their combinations. Comparison of ultimate web crippling capacities with the predictions from the design equations in AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 showed that the current design equations are unconservative for rivet fastened RHFCB sections under ETF and ITF load cases. Hence new equations were proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs. These equations can also be used to predict the capacities of RHFCBs subject to combined web crippling and flange crushing conservatively. However, new capacity equations were proposed in the case of flange crushing failures that occurred in thinner <b>flanges</b> with smaller <b>bearing</b> lengths. This paper presents the details of this web crippling experimental study of RHFCB sections and the results...|$|R
40|$|The two-axis joint is a {{mechanical}} device that provides two-degrees-of-freedom motion between connected components. A compact, moment-resistant, two-axis joint {{is used to}} connect an electromechanical actuator to its driven structural members. Due {{to the requirements of}} the overall mechanism, the joint has a low profile to fit within the allowable space, low friction, and high moment-reacting capability. The mechanical arrangement of this joint can withstand high moments when loads are applied. These features allow the joint to be used in tight spaces where a high load capability is required, as well as in applications where penetrating the mounting surface is not an option or where surface mounting is required. The joint consists of one base, one clevis, one cap, two needle bearings, and a circular shim. The base of the joint is the housing (the base and the cap together), and is connected to the grounding structure via fasteners and a bolt pattern. Captive within the housing, between the base and the cap, are the rotating clevis and the needle bearings. The clevis is attached to the mechanical system (linear actuator) via a pin. This pin, and the rotational movement of the clevis with respect to the housing, provides two rotational degrees of freedom. The larger diameter flange of the clevis is sandwiched between a pair of needle bearings, one {{on each side of the}} flange. During the assembly of the two-axis joint, the circular shims are used to adjust the amount of preload that is applied to the needle bearings. The above arrangement enables the joint to handle high moments with minimal friction. To achieve the high-moment capability within a low-profile joint, the use of depth of engagement (like that of a conventional rotating shaft) to react moment is replaced with planar engagement parallel to the mounting surface. The needle bearings with the clevis flange provide the surface area to react the clevis loads/moments into the joint housing while providing minimal friction during rotation. The diameter of the <b>flange</b> and the <b>bearings</b> can be increased to react higher loads and still maintain a compact surface mounting capability. This type of joint can be used in a wide variety of mechanisms and mechanical systems. It is especially effective where precise, smooth, continuous motion is required. For example, the joint can be used at the end of a linear actuator that is required to extend and rotate simultaneously. The current design application is for use in a spacecraft docking-system capture mechanism. Other applications might include industrial robotic or assembly line apparatuses, positioning systems, or in the motion-based simulator industry that employs complex, multi-axis manipulators for various types of motions...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} six {{papers with}} the overall theme of measurement, assessment and control of diesel engine noise, with an emphasize on control. The radiation of noise is shown {{to be dominated by}} {{the low end of the}} engine sides and by the engine front. The mode shapes of the crankcase, the oil sump and the timing transmission cover are investigated. The vibrations are measured and analysed through running mode, modal analyses and SEA. The noise radiation is explored in detail with near-field measurements of sound intensity. In the engine front, the noise radiation is shown to have contributions from the timing casing, the oil-sump front and the crankshaft torsion vibration damper. The radiation from the torsion damper is analysed by a regression analysis of measured intensity data and the vibrations of the damper are investigated with a laser-doppler vibrometer. The results show that the damper vibrates in the axial directions with vibration modes that both radiate noise and interfere with the radiation from the engine structure. It is shown that there in the engine front are strong coupled vibration modes between the timing cover and the oil sump front m the frequency range 500 Hz - 1 kHz. The importance of the strong vibration modes in the crankcase and the oil-sump sides is shown. The propagation paths of noise and vibration to the engine front have been examined with an SEA powerflow analysis and by opening the front cover to measure the sound power from the timing gears. The main excitations of the front cover are found to be by engine block vibrations below 1. 25 kHz and by tuning gears noise above 2 kHz. Various constructions to control the noise are tested. Two stiffeners are designed and tested to reduce vibrations m the engine low end, one ladder frame introducing stiffness at the crankcase <b>flange</b> and one <b>bearing</b> beam introducing stiffness at the main bearing caps. The stiffeners have hem evaluated by sound intensity measurements and mobility measurements. The ladder frame gave good noise reductions but the bearing beam merely caused frequency shifts of the bearing modes. A decoupling of the oil sump resulted in significant noise and vibration reductions. The timing cover is modified by increasing the damping and by decrease the radiation efficiency. Various interior panels are tested, like plexiglass and aluminium panels of different thicknesses, a rubber damping layer and a combined rubber/steel-sheet damping layer. A thin plastic sheet has low radiation efficiency and may thereby lower the noise emission. A slightly improved model for calculation of radiation efficiency of small irregularly shaped plates is suggested. The traditional SEA prediction model is shown to be ill-conditioned for engine applications. An improved model using geometric averaging is suggested and evaluated. The results show that the new SEA model is working well for frequencies down to 800 Hz for predictions of damping treatments, decoupling of the oil sump and for power-flow determinations. The concept of equivalent mass is found valuable and validations are made according to the consistency and reciprocity theories. A hemi-anechoic engine laboratory is constructed and evaluated. New efficient low-cost diffusing absorbers have been designed, the performance is evaluated with standard deviation analysis of sound pressure measurements. The performance of the absorbers is found to be compeatable with much more expensive commercial designs. Measured sound intensity in three-dimensional vectors is a powerful tool to identify and illustrate sound fields. When used in near-fields to identify complex noise sources large errors may occur. It is shown that the low relative levels of vector components and the reactivity of the sound field give large errors m repeated measurements. Analyses and comparisons are performed on a simple source and on an engine. A two- and a six-microphone probe were used that were hand-held and robot-controlled. It is concluded dig in point-intensity measurements on engineering noise sources, a 4 - 6 microphone probe and a precision positioner should be used to get reliable measurements.
