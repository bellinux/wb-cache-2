5|$|The LCS also lacked {{knowledge}} of MI5's <b>Double-Cross</b> System and its double agents. The department were unaware that no uncontrolled German operatives {{were active in}} the UK, and so incorrectly believed any deception {{would have to be}} highly realistic to appear genuine.|$|E
5|$|Ike {{began to}} fear that word of his {{possible}} cooperation had leaked, threatening to compromise his standing among the Cowboys. Undercover Wells Fargo Company agent M. Williams suspected a deal, and said something to Ike, who was fearful that other Cowboys might learn of his <b>double-cross.</b> Ike now began to threaten Wyatt and Doc Holliday (who had learned of the deal) for apparently revealing Ike's willingness to help arrest his friends.|$|E

Mahone returns to help Lincoln, Self, T-Bag and Gretchen retrieve Scylla. When Gretchen is shot while trying to <b>double-cross</b> the team, Mahone and the others leave her for the authorities.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} a {{classified}} S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, tensions among the agents are high due to poor communication during the fight. This concerns Reyes, who decides to <b>double-cross</b> Coulson and secure the 0-8-4 for her government. Together, the agents devise a plan to activate the weapon, blowing {{a hole in the}} Bus. The drop in pressure opens the interior doors, allowing the agents to subdue the soldiers. At the facility, Reyes and her men are incarcerated and the 0-8-4 is launched into the sun in a rocket. The team watch the launch together, celebrating their combined efforts, while Ward agrees to supervise Skye's S.H.I.E.L.D. training. Skye secretly confirms her allegiance to the hacktivist group the Rising Tide.|$|E
5|$|Bodyguard of Lies {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} to Ultra, the codename for decrypted signals intelligence. It goes on to document {{the origins of the}} London Controlling Section (LCS) and the work of Dudley Clarke in the Middle East. In late 1942, Allied high command in London became aware of Clarke's successes during the North African Campaign. Based on his theories of deception, the LCS was created under Colonel John Bevan and granted broad powers to plan deception strategy. The introduction finishes with a discussion of how the Allies evolved deception strategy prior to 1943, including the <b>Double-Cross</b> System (the Allied system of double agents). The second section of the book introduces the German intelligence forces, in particular Admiral Canaris and his Abwehr intelligence agency. Brown discusses early deceptions, such as those surrounding Operation Torch, conducted against the Germans, and how the Abwehr struggled to decipher the information it was being fed.|$|E

5|$|By {{early morning}} White had {{expected}} further assaults from the VC 40th Battalion, but his opponents {{had moved out}} towards Khâm Đức {{with the rest of}} the PAVN 2nd Division. Simultaneously, the AC-47 flying overhead continued to direct fighter-bombers against suspected Viet Cong positions around Ngok Tavak, but the garrison continued to receive sporadic mortar, RPG, and small-arms fire. In addition to close air support missions, medivac helicopters flew in to evacuate the wounded, and U.S. aircrews reported that they did not receive fire while flying over the enemy's area of operations. Captain Silva and Lieutenant Adams, who were both wounded during the main battle, were also evacuated. While the wounded were being flown out, the surviving elements of the 11th MSF Company and the Marines re-consolidated their positions, even though cohesion had broken down between the allied soldiers as a result of the <b>double-cross</b> that occurred earlier in the battle. At the same time, Makowski's 12th MSF Company had departed Khâm Đức and was approaching Ngok Tavak onboard four U.S. Marine CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters.|$|E

Archie tells Janine that they should skip Christmas dinner as {{he has made a}} surprise treasure hunt for her. Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her out onto the street telling her he knows how she and Ryan tried to <b>double-cross</b> him. Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him and she would not care if he died. Archie throws her out onto the street reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.|$|E

25|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Žilina is {{a golden}} <b>double-cross</b> (so-called cross of Lorraine) with roots and two golden stars on an olive-green background. The <b>double-cross</b> is of Byzantine origin and stems from Cyrillic-methodic tradition. This {{is one of the}} oldest {{municipal}} coat of arms, not only in Slovakia, but in Europe. It has been used as the city's symbol since 1378.|$|E

25|$|For a time British {{authorities}} threatened Masterman {{with legal}} action, {{but in the}} end bowed to the inevitable and allowed publication, with the proviso that sixty passages in the manuscript be deleted. Kerr would only acquiesce to a dozen. The book, The <b>Double-Cross</b> System in the War of 193945, was finally published in February 1972, with a foreword by Pearson, who guardedly did not refer to his work in the Committee. Masterman himself wrote the book without revealing anything about Ultra, still highly secret, that greatly aided the <b>double-cross</b> system. The ban on Ultra would be lifted in 1974.|$|E

25|$|Intelligence {{gained from}} these Abwehr decrypts played an {{important}} part in ensuring the success of <b>Double-Cross</b> operations by MI5 and MI6, and in Operation Fortitude, the Allied campaign to deceive the Germans about D-Day.|$|E
25|$|However, Masterman {{was not to}} be deterred. Revelations {{about the}} Cambridge Spy Ring in the 1960s {{resulted}} in low morale throughout the intelligence community, and Masterman felt that the publication of a book about the <b>double-cross</b> system would restore public confidence. He pressed his suit once again on the matter.|$|E
25|$|Another defence {{against the}} V-2 {{campaign}} was {{to destroy the}} launch infrastructure—expensive in terms of bomber resources and casualties—or to cause the Germans to aim at the wrong place through disinformation. The British were able to convince the Germans to direct V-1s and V-2s aimed at London to less populated areas east of the city. This was done by sending deceptive reports on the damage caused and sites hit via the German espionage network in Britain, which was controlled by the British (the <b>Double-Cross</b> System).|$|E

25|$|When World War II broke out, Masterman {{was drafted}} into the Intelligence Corps. After {{investigating}} and producing a report into the evacuation of Dunkirk. Masterman was appointed as a Civil Assistant in MI5. Within MI5 he {{was the chairman of}} the Twenty Committee, which was a group of British intelligence officials, including wartime amateurs, who held the key to the Double Cross System, which turned German spies into double agents working for the British. Its name was a pun based on the Roman numeral XX and its <b>double-cross</b> purpose.|$|E
25|$|Great Moravia {{also became}} a {{prominent}} theme of the Czech and Slovak romantic nationalism of the 19th century. The Byzantine <b>double-cross</b> {{thought to have been}} brought by Cyril and Methodius is part of the symbol of Slovakia until today and the Constitution of Slovakia refers to Great Moravia in its preamble. Interest about that period rose {{as a result of the}} national revival in the 19th century. Great Moravian history has been regarded as a cultural root of several Slavic nations in Central Europe and it was employed in attempts to create a single Czechoslovak identity in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Stecher, {{although}} an able booker, {{was afraid of}} losing his championship, refusing to wrestle many contenders as a result. This {{made it impossible for}} the Trio to retrieve it. They responded by calling the Munn-Zbyszko match illegitimate, and reinstated Munn as champion, but quickly had him drop it to Lewis. This left two champions, Ed Lewis and Joe Stecher, who were regarded as the dominant wrestlers of the period. Stecher and Lewis agreed to a unification match years later, in 1928, when Stecher gave in and lost the title to Lewis. By this time, the Zbyszko <b>double-cross</b> had already caused irreparable damage, detracting from the Trio's dominance over the wrestling industry. In addition, the build-up of Munn followed by such a humiliating loss had devalued his title and credibility as a major wrestling superstar permanently.|$|E
