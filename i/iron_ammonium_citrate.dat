Duboue (1879) is stated by Gamaleia (1887) to have urged axonal transmission to the complete exclusion of other pathways. In more recent times experimental support for this pathway has been forthcoming from Goodpasture and Teague (1923) working with herpes, Good-pasture (1925) working with rabies, and Fairbrother and Hurst (1930) working with poliomyelitis.

3000|$|Encapsulation of {{magnetic}} nanoparticles in inorganic matrixes. An appropriate tuning {{of the magnetic}} properties {{is essential for the}} potential use of the superparamagnetic composites. In this way, the use of inorganic matrixes, in particular of silica, as dispersion media of superparamagnetic nanocrystals has been reported to be an effective way to modulate the magnetic properties by a simple heating process [125]. Another advantage of having a surface enriched in silica is the presence of surface silanol groups that can easily react with alcohols and silane coupling agents [126] to produce dispersions that are not only stable in nonaqueous solvents, but also provide the ideal anchorage for covalent bonding of specific ligands. The strong binding makes desorption of these ligands a difficult task. In addition, the silica surface confers a high stability to suspensions of the particles at high volume fractions, changes in pH, or electrolyte concentration [127]. Recently, we have been successful in preparing submicronic silica-coated maghemite hollow and dense spheres with a high loading {{of magnetic}} material by aerosol pyrolysis [128]. Silica-coated γ-Fe 2 O 3 hollow spherical particles with an average size of 150 nm were prepared by aerosol pyrolysis of methanol solutions containing <b>iron</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> and tetraethoxysilane [TEOS] at a total salt concentration of 0.25 M [129]. During the first stage, the rapid evaporation of the methanol solvent favors the surface precipitation (i.e., formation of hollow spheres) of the components [130]. The low solubility of the <b>iron</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> in methanol when compared with that of TEOS promotes the initial precipitation of the iron salt solid shell. During the second stage, the probable continuous shrinkage of this iron salt solid shell facilitates the enrichment at the surface of the silicon oxide precursor (TEOS). In the third stage, the thermal decomposition of precursors produces the silica-coated γ-Fe 2 O 3 hollow spheres. The formation of the γ-Fe 2 O 3 is associated with the presence of carbonaceous species coming from the decomposition of the methanol solvent and from the <b>iron</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> and TEOS. On the other hand, the aerosol pyrolysis of iron nitrate and TEOS at a total salt concentration of 1 M produced silica-coated γ-Fe 2 O 3 dense spherical particles with an average size of 250 nm. The increase in salt concentration to a value of 1 M favors the formation of dense spherical particles. Sedimentation studies of these particles have shown that they are particularly useful for separation applications [131]. A W/O microemulsion method has also been used for the preparation of silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles [132]. Three different non-ionic surfactants (Triton X- 100, Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI, USA; Igepal CO- 520, and Brij- 97) have been used for the preparation of microemulsions, and their effects on the particle size, crystallinity, and the magnetic properties have been studied [...]...|$|E

Although serum ferritin level is usually measured as a marker of the efficacy of DFX, we sometimes experienced unexplainable changes in other serum markers for iron. We hypothesized that photometric assays for serum iron (sFe) and unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) might be affected by DFX. Methods Measurement of sFe and UIBC was performed using 4 different assay systems. The samples were prepared by adding 0 – 300  μM DFX to pooled human serum or 15 randomized human serum samples. In some experiments, DFX-iron complex (DFX-Fe) was prepared by mixing <b>iron</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> solution and DFX solution. Results Measurement of sFe was influenced by DFX-Fe, while iron-free DFX showed no effect on the value of sFe; DFX-Fe was measured as sFe, undistinguishable from transferrin-bound iron. On the other hand, measurement of serum UIBC was influenced by DFX itself; DFX might have been bound to iron in the reagent used for the assay, leading to an increase in UIBC values. Conclusions DFX affected the sFe and UIBC assay systems. We must be careful in observing these markers during iron chelation therapy with DFX...|$|E

Human THP 1 and mouse J 774 macrophages were infected in vitro with P. marneffei conidia and treated with different doses of drugs for 24 to 48 h followed by cell lysis and the counting of P. marneffei CFU. CQ and amodiaquine exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth, whereas quinine and artemisinin were fungistatic and not fungicidal. The antifungal activity of CQ was {{not due to}} an impairment of fungal iron acquisition {{in that it was}} not reversed by the addition of iron nitrilotriacetate, FeCl 3, or <b>iron</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate.</b> Perl's staining indicated that CQ did not alter the ability of J 774 cells to acquire iron from the medium. Most likely, CQ's antifungal activity is due to an increase in the intravacuolar pH and a disruption of pH-dependent metabolic processes. Indeed, we demonstrate that (i) bafilomycin A 1 and ammonium chloride, two agents known to alkalinize intracellular vesicles by different mechanisms, were inhibitory as well and (ii) a newly synthesized 4 -amino- 7 -chloroquinoline molecule (compound 9), lacking the terminal amino side chain of CQ that assists in drug accumulation, did not inhibit P. marneffei growth.

40|$|Most of the {{problems}} of iron therapy which have troubled physicians during the past half century are fundamentally traceable to our ignorance of the mechanism by which iron is absorbed from the intestinal tract. Had that mechanism been understood, the discussions centering about the relative efficacy of inorganic and organic iron preparations would not have occurred, and hematologists would not now be troubled by the clinical observation that simple ferrous salts are apparently utilized more completely for hemoglobin formation than are the complex ferric salts, such as <b>iron</b> and <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> (5 to 11 inc.). Adequate experimental analysis of the factors involved in iron absorption has been delayed by the lack of a method sufficiently dependable to measure immediate absorption from the intestinal tract. Investigators have been forced to utilize indirect procedures which measure: (1) the difference, in a given period of study, between the amount of iron ingested and the amount excreted in the urine and feces (12, 13); (2) the amount of iron which "disappears " from an isolated segment of intestine (14); or (3) the total increase in circulating hemoglobin resulting from the therapeutic administration of iron in various forms.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of anæmia among London infants {{is shown by}} an investigation extending {{over the last three}} years and comprising about 770 cases with 3, 100 hæmoglobin estimations. This anæmia is largely nutritional in origin and is due to a deficiency of iron, possibly associated with other factors. It is known that an infant obtains its necessary iron not only from its milk, which is poor in iron, but also from a store in the liver. Our results lead us to suppose that this store may be unduly low in many London infants. The average hæmoglobin percentage in the blood of fairly healthy artificially-fed London infants shows a sharp fall from its high level at birth to about 65 per cent. at 2 to 3 months of age, a rise to about 70 per cent. by 5 to 6 months, and then a steady fall reaching about 65 per cent. at 12 months. The continuous administration of iron, beginning when the infant is under 2 months old, raised the average hæmoglobin percentage to 80 per cent. at 4 months of age and onwards. Infants whose birth-weight is under 6 lb., twins and premature infants are specially in need of iron treatment.

Anaplasmosis is also called "Yellow bag" or yellow fever, where the affected animals usually develop a jaundiced appearance. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the clinical findings, treatment and gross pathology of a severe anaplasmosis in a dairy cow. Materials and methods: In this report, a rare case of fatal anaplasmosis in a 4 year old Jersey-Friesian cow, weighing about 200 kg was reported. Diagnosis was done based on clinical symptoms, blood examination for the presence of A. marginale, and biochemical analyses of blood. Leishman staining was done to check the A. marginale at the margin of erythrocytes. Treatment was instituted with blood transfusion and Oxytetracyline dosed at 20 mg/kg body weight and iron supplement containing 20 mL Cobaphos (containing Phosphorus 125 mg + Cyanocobalamine 0. 05 mg) and 20 mL Fercobsang containing <b>Iron</b> (as <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate)</b> 1. 75 mg, Cyanocobalamine (Vitamin B 12) 0. 025 mg, Nicotinamide (vitamin PP) 20 mg, Cobalt (as digluconate) 0. 0067 mg, Benzyl Alcohol (E 1519) 20. 8 mg) were given intramuscularly. Results: The cow did not survive the infection as it eventually died of the disease. Post mortem examination showed gross evidence of splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, distended bile duct and generalized jaundice. Conclusion: Based on the consequence of this case report, preventive vector control, prompt and appropriate treatment and improved management practices are recommended in order to prevent clinical anaplasmosis cases among cattle.

However, serum is essential to most mammalian cells growth, and its removal implies a very time-consuming process for cell adaptation. Thus, the aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate different strategies for cell adaptation to serum-free medium. Three cell types were used to assess the impact of transfection on adaptation: one common CHO-K 1 cell line and two CHO-K 1 cells transfected with different technologies for antibody production. Cultures were started with a known cell concentration in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10 % serum. The effect of five combinations of supplements, that could support cells during adaptation, was tested. These supplements included insulin and trace elements (copper sulfate, zinc sulfate, sodium selenite, <b>ammonium</b> <b>iron</b> <b>citrate,</b> ferrous <b>ammonium</b> sulfate, ammonium metavanadate, nickel chloride and stannous chloride). A methodology of gradual adaptation was followed, consisting on sequential steps of serum reduction, after assuring good cell adaptation from the previous step. After reaching 0. 625 % serum, medium was gradually switched to the chemically defined serum-free EX-CELL CHO DHFR- medium. It was observed that supplements influence cell adaptation to serum-free medium. Indeed, the combinations containing the trace element <b>ammonium</b> <b>iron</b> <b>citrate</b> gave the worst results, with cell death at 2. 5 % serum. In contrast, the combination of ammonium metavanadate, nickel chloride and stannous chloride proved to be the most favorable to the three cell lines. Comparing the cells, it seems that the ability to produce antibody and the transfection methodology used does not have a great impact on adaptation. During the study, some procedure details were identified as particularly important and should be carefully considered in the process of cell adaptation to serum-free medium. These include the use of a higher initial cell concentration that will allow the survival of an increased number of cells during the process; avoiding harsh procedures to the cells such as centrifugation and the use of enzymes (i. e. trypsin), due to a higher cell sensibility during adaptation; and to give enough time for a full cell adaptation at each step...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. The local {{enhancement}} of infection by exogenous ferric <b>iron,</b> as ferric <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate,</b> and by ferrous iron as guinea-pig haemoglobin, was assessed in studies with 55 strains of bacteria {{injected into the}} skin of guinea-pigs. The test organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli and Pseudo-rnonas aeruginosa. Four strains of Bacteroides spp. were tested with haemoglobin only. As previously reported with other strains, enhance-ment of infection by members of a given species by ferric iron was variable; in this study infection with only 1 1 of 59 strains was enhanced. Haemoglobin either of equal or lesser iron content was a more potent enhancer, affecting 27 of the 59 strains. The enhancement ranged from two-fold to 80 -fold, the higher figures on the whole being characteristic of haemoglobin enhancement. Some few instances of depression by both haemoglobin and ferric <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> were noted. A few tests were made with systemic haemoglobin but the concentrations attainable were largely ineffective. Enhancement of infection {{did not appear to}} be related to the capacity of a strain to lyse or digest host red blood cells. In so far as guinea-pigs, whose antibacterial defences are lowered by ferric or ferrous iron, represent human subjects at risk of infection because of clinical circumstances characterised by excess of available iron-either exogenous or as a result of haemolysis-our results with organisms of a kind commonly associated with infection in hospitals suggest that only a small proportion of environmental bacteria can take advantage of any decreased resistance associated with iron excess...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Neuroblastoma (NB) is an extra-cranial {{solid tumour}} of childhood. In {{spite of the}} good {{clinical}} response to first-line therapy, complete eradication of NB cells is rarely achieved. Thus, new therapeutic strategies are needed to eradicate surviving NB cells and prevent relapse. Sodium ascorbate has been recently reported to induce apoptosis of B 16 melanoma cells through down-regulation of the transferrin receptor, CD 71. Since NB and melanoma share the same embryologic neuroectodermal origin, we used different human NB cell lines to assess whether the same findings occurred. Results We could observe dose- and time-dependent induction of apoptosis in all NB cell lines. Sodium ascorbate decreased the expression of CD 71 and caused cell death within 24 h. An increase in the global and specific caspase activity took place, {{as well as an}} early loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Moreover, intracellular iron was significantly decreased after exposure to sodium ascorbate. Apoptotic markers were reverted when the cells were pretreated with the <b>iron</b> donor ferric <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> (FAC), further confirming that iron depletion is responsible for the ascorbate-induced cell death in NB cells.

We found that CAPs increased binding of bacteria by both primary AMs and J 774 cells (66. 7 � 10. 6 % and 58. 9 � 4. 0 %, respectively, n � 4). In contrast to bacterial binding, CAPs decreased internalization in both AMs and J 774 (55. 4 � 8. 5 % and 54. 7 � 5. 1 %, respectively, n � 4).

Our perception of non-human nature is filtered through photographic representations that reinforce this primacy of human agency.

Results showed that 49 % reduction of cadmium concentration was achieved in the case of soil saturated (washed) with <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> as well as purging solution also was <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate.</b> The soil pH and washing solutions were the most important factors in controlling the removal of cadmium in electrokinetic remediation process...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{administration}} of iron to rats {{has been previously}} shown to induce liver ferritin synthesis by increasing the translation of inactive cytoplasmic ferritin mRNAs for both heavy (H) and light (L) subunits by mobilizing them onto polyribosomes. In this report rat hepatoma cells in culture are used to explore the relationship of this response to intracellular iron levels. After adding <b>iron</b> as ferric <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> to the medium, latent ferritin H- and L-mRNAs were extensively transferred to polyribosomes, accompanied by increased uptake of [35 S]methionine into ferritin protein. Because total cellular levels of L- and H-mRNA were not significantly changed by exposure to iron, the increased ferritin mRNAs on polyribosomes most probably come from an inactive cytoplasmic pool, consistent with the inability of actinomycin-D and of cordycepin to inhibit iron-induced ferritin synthesis. When deferoxamine mesylate, an intracellular iron chelator, was added after the addition of iron to the medium, ferritin mRNA on the polyribosomes was reduced, while the free messenger pool increased, and ferritin synthesis diminished. In contrast, the extracellular iron chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid failed to inhibit the induction of ferritin protein synthesis. Addition of iron {{in the form of}} hemin also caused translocation of mRNA to polyribosomes, a response that could be similarly quenched by deferoxamine. Because hemin does not release chelatable iron extracellularly, we conclude that the level of chelatable iron within the cell has a regulatory role in ferritin synthesis through redistribution of the messenger RNAs between the free mRNA pool and the polyribosomes...|$|R

40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{incinerator}} (MSWI) bottom ash often cannot be recycled as construction material in Flanders, because leaching of Cu exceeds the limit value of 0. 5 mg/kg. Leaching of other components such as Mo and Sb is critical as well, but limit values for these elements are to date only informal. A treatment technique was investigated to lower pollutant leaching: extraction with solutions of organic complexants to remove Cu. Six different solutions were used, of which washing with citric acid and <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> decreases Cu leaching to below the limit value. Extraction was then performed with different concentrations of <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate.</b> Subsequent washing of the extracted material with distilled water {{appears to be}} vital to remove all residual <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate.</b> Extraction with a 0. 2 M solution of <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> followed by three washing steps decreases metal leaching to below the limit values.

However, little is known so far on {{the consequences of a}} treatment of brain cells with such nanoparticles. In order to study the biocompatibility of iron oxide nanoparticles and the accumulation of iron from such particles in brain cells, we have used astrocyte-rich primary cultures as model system. Iron oxide nanoparticles were chemically synthesized with a yield of about 80 % regarding the iron content. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles had a diameter of about 10 nm. Exposure of astrocyte cultures to 100 mu M iron that were supplied as citrate-coated iron oxide nanoparticles did not cause any acute loss in cell viability but resulted in an almost linear increase in the cellular iron content that reached after 6 h of incubation at 37 degrees C a total cellular iron content of about 300 nmol/mg protein. The rate of iron accumulation from iron oxide nanoparticles was significantly higher than that from the low molecular weight <b>iron</b> complex ferric <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> (FAC). Lowering the incubation temperature from 37 degrees C to 4 degrees C reduced the iron accumulation rate from iron oxide nanoparticles or FAC by about 60 %. In addition, presence of ferric or ferrous iron chelators did not affect the cellular iron accumulation from iron oxide nanoparticles. These data suggest that cultured astrocytes are able to accumulate intact iron oxide nanoparticles...|$|R

The levels of receptor were reduced by at least 50 and 35 % of that of the control in cells treated with diferric Tf and ferric <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate,</b> respectively. These changes were of total cellular receptors with no alteration {{in the proportion of}} receptors found on the cell surface. The half-lives of the receptor were identical in cells treated with desferrioxamine, diferric Tf, or ferric <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate.</b> Cells metabolically labeled with [35 S]methionine showed a 2. 5 -fold increase in the rate of receptor synthesis when treated with desferrioxamine and a 35 and 65 % decrease when treated with ferric <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> and diferric Tf, respectively. In vitro translations of polyadenylated mRNA isolated from cells incubated with desferrioxamine showed a 2. 5 -fold increase in translatable mRNA for the receptor, whereas treatment of cells with ferric <b>ammonium</b> <b>citrate</b> and diferric Tf resulted in a 25 and 50 % reduction, respectively, in translatable mRNA for this receptor...|$|R
