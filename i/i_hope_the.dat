It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen.

500|$|In the album's liner notes, Gaye {{explained}} {{his views on}} the themes of sex and love, stating [...] "I can't {{see anything wrong with}} sex between consenting anybodies. I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> music that I present here makes you lucky." ...|$|E

500|$|The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom {{applauded the}} {{differences}} between the characters in Storybrooke and their fairytale counterparts; she felt that this narrative device would help prevent viewers from getting frustrated if Snow and Charming grew further apart in one land but closer in the other. Prudom also enjoyed the writers' decision to make David [...] "indecisive and, as a result, also somewhat selfish," [...] while James is ready to leave his fiance for Snow. Prudom concluded that the episode [...] "expertly combined all the elements that make Once Upon a Time one of the most addictive and heartfelt new shows of the season, blending emotion, mystery and narrative thrust while giving us a deeper understanding of our favorite characters. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> next batch of episodes can keep up the momentum established this week." ...|$|E
500|$|Hood and Fox were {{in dispute}} on the film's direction. One of the {{disputes}} involved {{the depiction of}} Wolverine as an Army veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, with the executives arguing that audiences would not be interested in such heavy themes. The studio had two replacements lined up before Richard Donner, husband of producer Lauren Shuler Donner, flew to Australia to ease on-set tensions. Hood remarked, [...] "Out of healthy and sometimes very rigorous debate, things get better. [...] <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> film's better because of the debates. If nobody were talking about us, we'd be in trouble!" [...] Hood added he and Thomas Rothman were both [...] "forceful" [...] personalities in creative meetings but they {{had never had a}} [...] "stand-up" [...] argument. In January 2009, after delays due to weather and scheduling conflicts, such as Hugh Jackman's publicity commitments for Australia, production moved to Vancouver, mostly at Kitsilano Secondary School and in University of British Columbia. Work there included finishing scenes with Ryan Reynolds, who had been working on two other films during principal photography.|$|E

And all the tape in the world isn't going to bring Duane back." [...] In a {{retrospective}} review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the record a solid five stars, calling the record a showcase of [...] "the Allmans at their peak." [...] David Quantick of BBC Music also considered it their [...] "creative peak," [...] praising the album's [...] "well-played, surprisingly lean bluesy rock." [...] The album is mentioned as the band's top studio recording in the 2008 book 1,000 Recordings To Hear Before You Die (2008), with author Tom Moon praising the record's [...] "sedate, beautifully contemplative studio material." ...|$|E

500|$|The actress went on {{to explain}} that the storyline showed how Toyah regretted her actions and that young female viewers could learn from her mistake. She added [...] "Anyone {{watching}} can see Dobber is just using Toyah and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> message gets across to other girls not to fall into the same trap." [...] Toyah did not use protection with Dobber, so her sister, Leanne, persuaded her {{to go to the doctor}} for the morning-after pill. Taylor praised Leanne for being Toyah's [...] "conscience and the voice of common sense". She thought that Leanne had given her good and responsible advice on how to deal with what happened. The Daily Record's John Millar agreed with Taylor and wrote that the storyline was [...] "building to a stark warning for the millions of teenagers tuning into the Street." [...] Millar believed at no time did the viewers get the impression that Toyah was doing something [...] "admirable" [...] and proclaimed that Toyah was [...] "the sort of girl who needs care and affection, which explains why the poor soul was coaxed into losing her virginity after a holiday romance convinced her that she was in love." ...|$|E
500|$|Langford {{later said}} that Neighbours {{is doing a}} [...] "fairly decent job" [...] with Chris's coming out story. He wished that viewers got {{to see more of}} Chris's {{thoughts}} and feelings and less of how his situation affected the people around him. Langford added [...] "I do like that Chris isn't a perfect kid. Many shows tend to make gay teens near saints. Instead, he's a fairly average kid who makes mistakes and messes up, like starting a fight at a basketball game. In July 2011, Langford revealed that he had seen some comments from people thinking that Lucas and Chris should be paired up. He opined {{that there is not a}} hint of romance between the two and wondered why people assumed that if a gay character shares a scene with another guy, they must get together. Langford revealed that he liked Chris and Lucas's mentor and mentee relationship as it is. The writer also commented on the introduction of Chris's father and said that he was [...] "delighted" [...] that Chris was finally getting his own drama, that was [...] "pretty realistic." [...] He added [...] "It's nice to see the father/son dynamic play out. I have the feeling that a lot of Chris's dad's issues stem from the fact that his son is gay and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> show will delve into those unresoved issues." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E
