5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a gastrostomy tube {{can also be}} given a <b>ketogenic</b> diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the <b>ketogenic</b> formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid <b>ketogenic</b> diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic <b>ketogenic</b> diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid <b>ketogenic</b> diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E
5|$|A 2013 review {{said that}} there is enough {{suggestion}} of potential benefit from <b>ketogenic</b> diets in cancer therapy that establishing clinical trials is probably warranted. At present the only evidence of benefit is anecdotal, but designing effective trials to measure the effect of adopting a <b>ketogenic</b> diet could prove challenging.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, the <b>ketogenic</b> diet was {{available}} from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less restrictive variants, {{such as the}} modified Atkins diet, were in use, particularly among older children and adults. The <b>ketogenic</b> diet was also under investigation {{for the treatment of}} a wide variety of disorders other than epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Clinical {{trials and}} studies in animal models (including C. elegans) suggest that <b>ketogenic</b> diets provide neuroprotective and disease-modifying {{benefits}} {{for a number}} of adult neurodegenerative disorders. As of 2012, there is limited clinical trial data in these areas, and, outside of paediatric epilepsy, use of the <b>ketogenic</b> diet remains at the research stage.|$|E
5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The <b>ketogenic</b> diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the <b>ketogenic</b> diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall <b>ketogenic</b> ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the <b>ketogenic</b> diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the <b>ketogenic</b> diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, {{the normal}} diet {{includes}} rice and noodles {{as the main}} energy source, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians, will not eat root vegetables or avoid beef. The Indian <b>ketogenic</b> diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their <b>ketogenic</b> diets typically have a lower <b>ketogenic</b> ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, {{they appear to be}} just as effective.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic <b>ketogenic</b> diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a <b>ketogenic</b> diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic <b>ketogenic</b> diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic <b>ketogenic</b> diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic <b>ketogenic</b> diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E
5|$|Short-term {{results for}} the LGIT {{indicate}} that at one month {{approximately half of the}} patients experience a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, with overall figures approaching that of the <b>ketogenic</b> diet. The data (coming from one centre's experience with 76 children up to the year 2009) also indicate fewer side effects than the <b>ketogenic</b> diet and that it is better tolerated, with more palatable meals.|$|E
5|$|The Johns Hopkins Hospital {{protocol}} for initiating the <b>ketogenic</b> diet {{has been widely}} adopted. It involves a consultation with the patient and their caregivers and, later, a short hospital admission. Because {{of the risk of}} complications during <b>ketogenic</b> diet initiation, most centres begin the diet under close medical supervision in the hospital.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ketogenic</b> diet is {{indicated}} as an adjunctive (additional) treatment {{in children with}} drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the <b>ketogenic</b> diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the <b>ketogenic</b> diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the <b>ketogenic</b> diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E
5|$|The low {{glycaemic}} index treatment (LGIT) {{is an attempt}} to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic <b>ketogenic</b> diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the <b>ketogenic</b> diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic <b>ketogenic</b> diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a {{glycaemic index}} lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run <b>ketogenic</b> diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E
5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the <b>ketogenic</b> diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the <b>ketogenic</b> ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating <b>ketogenic</b> diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} <b>ketogenic</b> diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the <b>ketogenic</b> diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E
5|$|Because the <b>ketogenic</b> diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a {{first-line}} therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The <b>ketogenic</b> diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A person with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the <b>ketogenic</b> diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E
5|$|Because {{tumor cells}} are inefficient in {{processing}} ketone bodies for energy, the <b>ketogenic</b> diet {{has also been}} suggested {{as a treatment for}} cancer, including glioma, as well as multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{when the}} only {{anticonvulsant}} drugs were the sedative bromides (discovered 1857) and phenobarbital (1912), the <b>ketogenic</b> diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when H. Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam discovered phenytoin (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of sodium valproate in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across {{a broad range of}} epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the <b>ketogenic</b> diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, declined further.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ketogenic</b> diet is {{a medical}} {{nutrition}} therapy that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include a registered paediatric dietitian who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric neurologist who is experienced in offering the <b>ketogenic</b> diet; and a registered nurse who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a medical social worker who works with the family and a pharmacist who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in {{many aspects of the}} diet for it to be safely implemented.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ketogenic</b> diet is {{calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The <b>ketogenic</b> ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the <b>ketogenic</b> diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen <b>ketogenic</b> ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ketogenic</b> diet {{may be a}} {{successful}} treatment for several rare metabolic diseases. Case reports of two children indicate {{that it may be}} a possible treatment for astrocytomas, a type of brain tumour. Autism, depression, migraine headaches, polycystic ovary syndrome and diabetes mellitus type 2 have also been shown to improve in small case studies. There is evidence from uncontrolled clinical trials and studies in animal models that the <b>ketogenic</b> diet can provide symptomatic and disease-modifying activity in a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and may be protective in traumatic brain injury and stroke.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ketogenic</b> diet reduces seizure {{frequency}} by {{more than}} 50% in half of the patients who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial {{of at least three}} months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the <b>ketogenic</b> diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug. There is some evidence that adolescents and adults may also benefit from the diet.|$|E
5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of <b>ketogenic</b> diet {{in children and}} young people with epilepsy, as well as six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among {{children and young people}} for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and only one of the trials compared a group assigned to <b>ketogenic</b> diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients treated with the <b>ketogenic</b> diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the <b>ketogenic</b> diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
5|$|At {{the initial}} consultation, {{patients}} are screened for conditions that may contraindicate the diet. A dietary history is obtained and {{the parameters of}} the diet selected: the <b>ketogenic</b> ratio of fat to combined protein and carbohydrate, the calorie requirements and the fluid intake.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term <b>ketogenic</b> diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the <b>ketogenic</b> diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ketogenic</b> diet {{is not a}} benign, {{holistic}} {{or natural}} treatment for epilepsy; as with any serious medical therapy, there may be complications. These are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery. Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include constipation, low-grade acidosis and hypoglycaemia {{if there is an}} initial fast. Raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60% of children and cholesterol levels may increase by around 30%. This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and, if persistent, by lowering the <b>ketogenic</b> ratio. Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many micronutrients.|$|E
5|$|Anticonvulsants {{suppress}} epileptic seizures, {{but they}} neither cure nor prevent {{the development of}} seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) {{is a process that}} is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants (valproate, levetiracetam and benzodiazepines) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The <b>ketogenic</b> diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the <b>ketogenic</b> diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the <b>ketogenic</b> diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|In many {{developing}} countries, the <b>ketogenic</b> diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat {{are more expensive}} than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more <b>ketogenic</b> than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT <b>ketogenic</b> diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E
5|$|Recently, a {{saturated}} medium-chain {{fatty acid}} called decanoic acid (C10) has shown promise {{in both the}} control of seizures and of neurodegeneration. Decanoic acid is a major constituent of the MCT <b>ketogenic</b> diet, and the authors suggest its action may be through inducing mitochondrial biogenesis and helping provide more ATP to maintain the resting membrane potential of the neuron.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ketogenic</b> diet {{is usually}} {{initiated}} {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. There is some evidence of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or with the drug zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketone bodies}} are {{possibly}} anticonvulsant in themselves; in animal models, acetoacetate and acetone protect against seizures. The <b>ketogenic</b> diet results in adaptive changes to brain energy metabolism {{that increase the}} energy reserves; ketone bodies are a more efficient fuel than glucose, {{and the number of}} mitochondria is increased. This may help the neurons to remain stable in the face of increased energy demand during a seizure, and may confer a neuroprotective effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} Atkins diet reduces seizure frequency by {{more than}} 50% in 43% of patients who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in 27% of patients. Few adverse effects have been reported, though cholesterol is increased and the diet has not been studied long term. Although based on a smaller data set (126 adults and children from 11 studies over five centres), these results from 2009 compare favourably with the traditional <b>ketogenic</b> diet.|$|E
5|$|Variations on the Johns Hopkins {{protocol}} are common. The initiation can {{be performed}} using outpatient clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital. Often there is no initial fast (fasting {{increases the risk of}} acidosis and hypoglycaemia and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size but alter the <b>ketogenic</b> ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 2005 of 88 {{paediatric}} neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after {{three or more}} drugs had failed; 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort; 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases; and 16% had never prescribed the diet. There are several possible explanations for this gap between evidence and clinical practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians, who are needed to administer a <b>ketogenic</b> diet programme.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ketogenic</b> diet is a {{mainstream}} therapy {{that does not}} use pharmaceutical drugs, which was developed to reproduce the success and remove {{the limitations of the}} non-mainstream use of fasting to treat epilepsy. Although popular in the 1920s and 30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs. Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures with medication. However, 20–30% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs. For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.|$|E
