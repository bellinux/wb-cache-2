40|$|Four locally {{available}} {{crop residues}} viz., jowar stover (JS), maize stover (MS), red gram straw (RGS) and black gram straw (BGS) were evaluated for carbohydrate and protein fractions using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein (CNCP) system. Lignin (% NDF) <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> legume straws {{as compared to}} cereal stovers while Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) (% DM) followed the reverse trend. The carbohydrate fractions A and B 1 <b>were</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> BGS while B 2 <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> MS as compared to other crop residues.

5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success.

Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E

5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm {{below the}} soil surface. Pupae are brown in color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality <b>is</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high death rates among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E

5|$|The {{key role}} women have in farming is to {{maintain}} ownership of the main sources of production in rural areas. In traditional China, women {{were not allowed to}} own land or property. Land was inherited through the sons, and if there was no son in the family, it was taken by a close male relative. In less populated areas, women do more agricultural work than men because of shifting cultivation. In more populated areas, men do more work than women because extensive plough cultivation is used. Female involvement <b>is</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> the double-cropping rice area. Other types of work women perform in the countryside include pig and poultry rearing, spinning, weaving, basket-making, and other handicrafts. This type of work supplements agricultural income.|$|E
