5|$|Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so {{the actors}} would {{know where they}} should be looking in any {{particular}} scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production. Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming. The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with Red Epic 3D cameras set on camera <b>dollies</b> and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a steadicam, which was used only occasionally.|$|E

5000|$|In cinematography, the <b>dolly</b> grip is a {{dedicated}} technician trained {{to operate the}} camera <b>dolly.</b> This technician places, levels, and moves the <b>dolly</b> track, then pushes and pulls the <b>dolly</b> and usually a camera operator and camera assistant as riders.

25|$|It is {{important}} to examine the types of materials to be used while handling the collection. If collection objects are to be moved, the use of flatbeds, carts, <b>dollies,</b> or pallet lifters may be warranted, with these objects being dubbed structurally sound prior to use. Tote pans or support trays are sometimes used for smaller objects, and liners such as polyethylene foam pads, quilted furniture pads, and acid-free tissue are commonly used as an added layer of protection. When necessary, handlers may also don lab coats, safety glasses, dust masks, or respirators.|$|E
25|$|The IS-1 Sęp was {{constructed}} of wood throughout with steel for high-stress areas and fittings. The fuselage was a plywood-covered semi-monocoque structure with smooth lines. Incorporated in the fuselage was the cockpit, which {{was covered by}} a built-up plexi-glass canopy, and an integral fin which supported the plywood stressed-skin tailplane just above the fuselage top decking level. The undercarriage consisted of a long pneumatically-sprung ash skid under the nose and a rubber-sprung tail skid. For take-off a jettisonable two-wheeled dolly {{was attached to the}} front skid. As with all drop-off <b>dollies</b> it was important to release the dolly at the right moment to avoid the dolly bouncing into the structure, causing damage. An aero-tow hook was provided in the extreme nose, as well as a bungee hook and twin winch-launch hooks either side of the fuselage.|$|E

This gave them an elegant grace, especially in their hand movements.

500|$|In addition, CAPS {{allowed an}} easier {{combination}} of hand-drawn art with computer-generated imagery, which before {{had to be}} plotted to animation paper and then xeroxed and painted traditionally. This technique was put to significant use during the [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] waltz sequence, in which Belle and Beast dance through a computer-generated ballroom as the camera <b>dollies</b> around them in simulated 3D space. The filmmakers had originally decided {{against the use of}} computers in favor of traditional animation, but later, when the technology had improved, decided it could be used for the one scene in the ballroom. The success of the ballroom sequence helped convince studio executives to further invest in computer animation.|$|E
500|$|Gray and cinematographer Wally Pfister worked {{together}} to develop a visual style for the film before production began. They viewed car commercials and magazine photographs, as well as chase sequences from The French Connection (1971), Ronin (1998), and The Bourne Identity (2002) as visual references. Pfister wanted [...] "dark textures and undertones and strong contrast"; he collaborated with production designer Charlie Wood on the color palette, and the two would confer with Gray on their ideas. Paramount preferred that The Italian Job not be shot in the anamorphic format, despite Pfister's wishes to do so. Gray wanted a widescreen aspect ratio, so they chose to shoot the film in Super 35 for a 2.4:1 aspect ratio. Once principal photography began, Gray frequently utilized <b>dollies,</b> as well as Steadicams and a Technocrane, to keep the cameras almost constantly moving.|$|E
500|$|The weapon {{fire on the}} set was {{considered}} dangerous, which led the crew {{to build a new}} bulletproof plexiglas shield that could be bolted to the camera. This shield was useful particularly for one sequence in Hard Target where Van Damme empties a magazine of ammo into the camera. These camera <b>dollies</b> were nicknamed by the crew as [...] "the Woo-Woo Choo-Choo". Russell Carpenter found difficulty in filming the huge gunfight scenes. Carpenter specifically noted the Mardi Gras parade warehouse by recollecting that [...] "just the lighting for a space like that, with all those strange shapes and shadows was difficult enough, but John then added the further complication of wanting the scene shot from several angles at once—often with more than one of the cameras moving". Producer James Jacks supported this style of filming finding it the most economical way to shoot these types of action scenes.|$|E

5000|$|A camera <b>dolly</b> is a wheeled cart {{or similar}} device used in filmmaking and {{television}} production to create smooth horizontal camera movements. The camera is mounted to the <b>dolly</b> {{and the camera}} operator and focus puller or camera assistant usually ride on the <b>dolly</b> to push the <b>dolly</b> back and forth. The camera <b>dolly</b> is generally used to produce images which involve moving the camera toward or away from a subject while a take is being recorded, a technique known as a [...] "dolly shot."

500|$|Soderbergh {{shot the}} films {{back-to-back}} {{in the beginning}} of July 2007 with Guerrilla shot first in Spain for 39 days and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days. The director conceived The Argentine as [...] "a Hollywood movie" [...] shot in widescreen 'scope aspect ratio, with the camera either fixed or moving on a dolly or a Steadicam. Guerrilla was shot, according to Soderbergh, [...] "in Super-16, 1.85:1. No <b>dollies,</b> no cranes, it's all either handheld or tripods. I want it to look nice but simple. We'll work with a very small group: basically me, the producer Gregory Jacobs and the unit production manager". According to the director, the portion set in Cuba was written from the victor's perspective and as a result he adopted a more traditional look with classical compositions, vibrant color and a warm palette. With Guerrilla, he wanted a sense of foreboding with hand-held camerawork and a muted color palette. Soderbergh told his production designer Antxon Gomez that the first part would have green with a lot of yellow in it and the second part would have green with a lot of blue in it.|$|E
500|$|Every shot in {{the film}} passed through the hands of eight {{different}} teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting. Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting {{the location of the}} virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, <b>dollies,</b> tripods, and cranes. Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and Ash Brannon, each shot went to the animation department from the layout. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical. The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or [...] "keyframes") was created, the software would build poses for the frames in-between. The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing. To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey {{stated that}} he {{composed}} the frame with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio {{to cope with the}} varying heights of the main characters, explaining that [...] "shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss [...] knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important." [...] The film was McGarvey's first venture shooting with a digital camera, the Arri Alexa. The Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 7D digital SLR cameras were used for some shots, and high-speed shots were captured on 35 mm film with the Arriflex 435. About his visual approach, McGarvey remarked, [...] "Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on <b>dollies</b> to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery." ...|$|E

500|$|Legion {{was filmed}} with Arri Alexa cameras, with two Alexa XT cameras and an Alexa Mini {{used for the}} pilot and then Minis used {{for the rest of}} the season; the footage was {{captured}} in 4K Ultra-high-definition. Gonzales described the series as [...] "essentially a one-camera show", but [...] "if we can get a bonus view [...] that doesn’t compromise the look of A-camera, that’s great." [...] Lenses for the series were a mixture of spherical and anamorphic, including a 9.8 Kinoptik camera lens to film [...] "some of the more bizarre mindscapes", which Kubrick used to film A Clockwork Orange. The Kinoptik lenses caused vignetting, which Gonzales would crop out of the image in post-production, though sometimes [...] "we just left it" [...] to add character. The series changes aspect ratio to reflect Haller's state of mind, [...] "going narrower when he feels boxed in by the nefarious forces pursuing him", though Gonzales [...] "didn’t always want the anamorphics to make the audience feel this big jump, but I wanted these subtle differences like the background bokeh to be a little different." [...] The season's [...] "memory work" [...] sequences were filmed with anamorphic lenses, but were then cropped to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Gonzales and Hawley both [...] "don’t care too much for" [...] steadicams, and instead relied on jib arms, <b>dollies,</b> and 30-foot technocranes, both on set and location. The production also made extensive use of a Ronin camera stabilizer, allowing the camera to be moved around by camera men and transitioned between hand use and cranes without endangering the camera operators.|$|E
500|$|The Ben-Hur {{production}} utilized 300 sets {{scattered over}} [...] and nine sound stages. Several sets still standing from Quo Vadis in 1951 were refurbished {{and used for}} Ben-Hur. By {{the end of the}} production more than [...] of plaster and [...] of lumber were used. The budget called for more than 100,000 costumes and 1,000 suits of armor to be made, for the hiring of 10,000 extras, and the procurement of hundreds of camels, donkeys, horses, and sheep. Costume designer Elizabeth Haffenden oversaw a staff of 100 wardrobe fabricators who began manufacturing the costumes for the film a year before filming began. Special silk was imported from Thailand, the armor manufactured in West Germany, and the woolens made and embroidered in the United Kingdom and various countries of South America. Many leather goods were hand-tooled in the United Kingdom as well, while Italian shoemakers manufactured the boots and shoes. The lace for costumes came from France, while costume jewelry was purchased in Switzerland. More than [...] of hair were donated by women in the Piedmont region of Italy to make wigs and beards for the production, and [...] of track laid down for the camera <b>dollies.</b> A workshop employing 200 artists and workmen provided the hundreds of friezes and statues needed. The mountain village of Arcinazzo Romano, [...] from Rome, served as a stand-in for the town of Nazareth. Beaches near Anzio were also used, and caves just south of the city served as the leper colony. Some additional desert panoramas were shot in Arizona, and some close-up inserts taken at the MGM Studios, with the final images photographed on February 3, 1958.|$|E
