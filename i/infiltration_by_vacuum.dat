40|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of composites {{of a new}} type prepared <b>by</b> <b>infiltration</b> under <b>vacuum</b> of melted copper into empty sap channels (aligned with the sample length) of high-porosity biocarbon preforms of white pine tree wood has been studied in the temperature range 5 – 300 K. The biocarbon preforms have been prepared by pyrolysis of tree wood in an argon flow at two carbonization temperatures of 1000 and 2400 °C. From the experimental values of the composite thermal conductivities, the fraction due to the {{thermal conductivity}} of the embedded copper is isolated and found to be substantially {{lower than that of}} the original copper used in preparation of the composites. The decrease in the thermal conductivity of copper in the composite is assigned to defects in its structure, namely, breaks in the copper filling the sap channels, as well as the radial ones, also filled by copper. A possibility of decreasing the thermal conductivity of copper in a composite due to its doping by the impurities present in the carbon preform is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Infiltration of {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) synovial tissue (ST) by differentiated dendritic cells (DC) is a consistent feature {{in patients with}} active disease. However, mononuclear cells (MNC), including DC, may be nonspecifically chemoattracted to inflammatory sites regardless of etiology, Therefore, to evaluate the specificity of ST <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> differentiated DC, synovial biopsies from patients with RA, spondylarthropathy (SpA), osteoarthritis (OA), and gout were examined. Methods. Formalin-fixed ST sections were analyzed by double immunohistochemical staining for vascularity and <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> differentiated DC, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Results, DC containing nuclear RelB were found in perivascular MNC aggregates from patients with all arthritides studied. <b>Infiltration</b> <b>by</b> differentiated DC was similar in RA and SpA ST, but reduced in OA ST. Differentiated DC were always observed in close association with lymphocytes, and the correlation between these variables suggested that the infiltration of inflammatory sites by DC and lymphocytes was associated. Conclusion, Perivascular <b>infiltration</b> <b>by</b> DC, lymphocytes, and macrophages is nonspecifically related to inflammation, but signals present in RA and SpA ST lead to more intense cellular infiltration and accumulation...|$|R
