The appointments and the government's unrealistic 1998 budget created further currency instability, rumours and panic led to a run on stores and pushed up prices.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2008 {{financial}} tsunami, existing methods and tools for managing financial risks have been criticizedfor weaknesses in monitoring and alleviating risks at the systemic level. A 2009 article in Nature suggested newapproaches to modeling <b>economic</b> <b>meltdowns</b> are needed to prevent future financial crises. However, existing studieshave not focused on analysis of systemic risk at the individual bank level in a banking network, which is essential formonitoring and mitigating contagious bank failures. To this end, we develop a network approach to risk management(NARM) for modeling and analyzing systemic risk in banking systems. NARM views banks as a network that is linkedthrough financial relationships. It incorporates network and financial principles into a business intelligence (BI) algorithm to analyze systemic risk attributed to each individual bank via simulations based on real-world data from theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Our research demonstrates the feasibility of modeling and analyzing systemicrisk at the individual bank level in a banking network using a BI-based approach. In terms of business impacts, NARMoffers a new means for predicting contagious bank failures and determining capital injection priorities in {{the wake of}}financial crises. Our simulation study shows that under significant market shocks, the interbank payment relationshipbecomes more influential than the correlated bank portfolio relationship in determining an individual bank’s survival. These insights should help financial regulators devise more effective policies and mechanisms to prevent the collapseof a banking system. Further, NARM and the simulation procedure driven by real-world data proposed in this study haveinstructional value to similar research areas such as bank stress testing, where time series data and business networksmay be studied...|$|R

The Wall Street Journals editorial [...] "Bankrupt Canada?" [...] attracted much media attention in Canada and was taken as a sign that all was not well with the national finances. In particular by early 1995 the rising interest rates started to make achieving the target of reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP more and more impossible to achieve, and thus pressured the government to introduce a budget that would assure the markets that the deficit would be eliminated, not reduced in the near-future. Through not directly impacting on the Canadian economy very much, the Mexican <b>economic</b> <b>meltdown</b> in December 1994 served as a graphic and terrifying example of what happened when a nation did not manage its finances properly, and perhaps made elements of the Canadian public more open to the goal of eliminating the deficit despite the short-term pain than what they would have otherwise been. Further applying pressure on Canada was a warning from Moody's that Canada's debt rating would downgraded again if the 1995 budget did not contain a credible deficit elimination plan. Martin went on a tour of various world financial centers in early 1995 to drum up interest in buying Canadian bonds, and found that investors had no such interest, telling him that Canada had promising since the 1970s to deal with the deficit, and they wanted action, not words this time.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{economic}} {{crisis of the}} late 2000 's had numerous social and political repercussions on most European countries. In this paper we aim to study {{the influence of the}} austerity measures deemed by the <b>economic</b> and financial <b>meltdown</b> {{on one of the most}} vulnerable and important systems in any country: healthcare. The empiric approach uses panel data analysis to highlight the effects of the {{economic crisis}} on each of the 34 analyzed countries, during the time span 2006 - 2012. The advantage of this method resides in the ability to offer both cross-time and cross-section results, as well as interactions. Our findings show a consistent tendency of European governments to diminish the spending on healthcare during the crisis, leading to the increase of out of pocket payments is some countries, which do not have a robust health insurance policy and a decrease in the number of people accessing healthcare services in the other countries. Another notable result is that there is a consistent delay between the economic crisis and the impact on healthcare, yet, when the shock is felt it is most likely to have an influence for some time, even after the economy has recovered. Some side effects could even be permanent as it is the case with hospitals being closed or personnel being laid off. The findings in this paper suggest that in times of economic crisis, the right approach is to maintain the spending levels in healthcare, since otherwise people are exposed to even greater risks such as catastrophic spending, disease or even death...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the causes, cures {{and consequences of}} the Asian financial crisis. Since mid- 1997 a number of Southeast Asian economies {{have been in the}} grip of a severe financial crisis that has thrown the region into a deep recession. On the basis of expected diminishing returns this has raised doubts about the durability of the region's rapid growth rates which were realized since the 1980 's. Its very success made it attractive to private capital inflows which were borrowed in dollars on short terms but lent out domestically for long periods and intermediated through poorly regulated domestic financial systems. Large current account deficits due to overvalued currencies and overinvestment in the nontradable sector created an asset bubble which had to burst. The crisis started in Thailand in July 1997 but has not been predicted and alarm bells did not ring although the ratio of short-term debt to foreign reserves had increased to unsustainable heights and falling stock prices gave some indication of growing concern. A key feature of the crisis has been the contagion and spillover to other countries in the region. After six months of currency and stockmarket turmoil the process of cleaning up shattered financial systems did start, but some obstacles obstruct a rapid clean up. On the basis of IMF projections world output growth in 1998 has been estimated at 2 % (down from 4 % in 1997) and global growth is to recover only moderately in 1999. There are reasons to believe that the IMF rescue packages added rather than ameliorated the panic. Now financial and economic conditions in Asia are improving and the period of <b>economic</b> and financial <b>meltdown</b> is largely over. Real activity has reached a bottom and much of this reflects the improvement in current account balances. Incipient signs of recovery are emerging but the path to recovery remains rocky with significant head wind. While the symptoms of the crisis have abated and the underlying malaise is better understood, the treatment is only just beginning. ...|$|R
40|$|Once {{again the}} {{economic}} experts {{are telling us}} that the current (October 2008) financial “crisis” {{will lead to a}} deep recession or depression. The financial press is even claiming that we are headed for “global meltdown”. Heard it all before? The last time was in 1998 when we were told that the financial difficulties in the East would generate the “East Asian meltdown”, which would last for at least a decade and would generate a “global economic crisis”. The economic summit called by President Bush for later in 2008 is reminiscent of the G 7 and G 22 meetings called to discuss similar issues in 1998. And yet nothing happened. Of course the financial gurus, such as Alan Greenspan were quick to claim the credit, {{but the truth is that}} financial crises are supply-side happenings that generate a lot of excitement among the stock market speculators but have little real-world fallout as long as the dynamic strategies being pursued by the world’s leading societies are viable. The stock market crash of 1987 is another case in point: nothing serious happened in the real economy. Depressions only occur when dominant dynamic strategies are finally exhausted and new ones are slow to emerge: as happened in the USA during the 1920 s and 1930 s. The conventional wisdom among the orthodox economic fraternity, that the Great Depression was the outcome of the 1929 Wall Street crash, is totally incorrect. Economists and their political masters will only understand the relationship between recession, depression, and financial crisis, when they have developed a realist general dynamic theory of human society. Until then, economic policy will be confused, ineffective, and distorting. A general dynamic theory is presented in this paper and used to analyse financial crises and economic downturns. To the degree that the real global economy is in trouble, it is due not to financial mismanagement, but to the misconceived policy of inflation targeting pursued for the past decade or so. Once again, our compulsion to intervene exceeds our capacity to understand the implications of our actions. financial crisis, depression, dynamic-strategy theory, inflation targeting, <b>economic</b> policy, global <b>meltdown.</b> ...|$|R
