25|$|Singh's studies {{spanned the}} fields of high energy physics, quantum {{mechanics}} and particle physics and he has made reportedly significant contributions on S-matrix theory and symmetry theories of hadrons. His collaboration with Virendra Gupta resulted {{in the development of}} Gupta-Singh coupling constant sum rule related to baryon decuplet and he worked along M. A. Beg to develop the Beg-Singh SU (6) mass formula. His theoretical work on scattering amplitudes have helped widen the understanding of high energy total cross-sections in hadronic processes. He proposed Singh lemma, a method of calculating the threshold value of the amplitude from the gauge condition. His other contributions include Singh-Pais theorems and Singh-Roy bounds related to compton scattering and scattering amplitudes. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and the article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 84 of them. Besides, he has contributed chapters to books published by others including a lecture in a book edited by B. V. Sreekantan and Scientific Realism and Classical Physics, a <b>general</b> <b>article</b> published in History and Philosophy of Physics published by Indian Council of Philosophical Research. His work has also drawn citations from other authors.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{submissions}} {{raised by}} the appellants was that the prohibition and deregistration orders were made in breach of the natural justice principle of audi alteram partem, or [...] "hear the other side". This {{is regarded as a}} cardinal principle of natural justice, requiring that no person shall be condemned unless he or she has been given prior notice of the allegations against him or her and a fair opportunity to be heard. In <b>general,</b> <b>Article</b> 12(1) of the Constitution protects rights such as this. Audi alteram partem has been referred to by the Court of Appeal as one of the two rules that make up the administrative law rules of natural justice, the other being nemo iudex in causa sua ("no man a judge in his own cause").|$|E

2500|$|West {{was charged}} with violating Articles 128 (assault) and 134 (<b>general</b> <b>article)</b> of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During a hearing held {{as part of an}} Article 32 {{investigation}} in November 2003, West stated, [...] "I know the method I used was not right, but I wanted {{to take care of my}} soldiers." [...] The charges were ultimately referred to an Article 15 proceeding rather than court-martial, at which West was fined $5,000. West accepted the judgment and retired with full benefits as a lieutenant colonel in the summer of 2004. Asked if he would act differently under similar circumstances, West testified, [...] "If it's about the lives of my soldiers at stake, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can." [...] At his hearing, West said that there were no ambushes against American forces in Taji until he was relieved of his leadership post a month later. After West's retirement he received more than 2,000 letters and e-mails offering him moral support. A letter supporting West was signed by 95 members of the U.S. Congress and sent to the Secretary of the Army.|$|E
