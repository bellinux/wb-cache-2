25|$|From the 15th to the 17th century, {{the formula}} seems {{to copy the}} ancient Roman naming {{convention}} with the classic tria nomina used by the Patricians: praenomen (or given name), nomen gentile (or gens/Clan name) and cognomen (surname), following the Renaissance fashion. Thus, Jan Jelita Zamoyski, forming a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name</b> (nazwisko złożone). Later, the <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name</b> would be joined with a hyphen: Jan Jelita-Zamoyski.|$|E
25|$|A Polish {{marriage}} certificate lists three fields, the surnames for the husband, wife, and children. The partners {{may choose to}} retain their surnames, or both adopt the surname of either partner, {{or a combination of}} both; the children must receive either the joint surname or the surname of one of the partners. However, a married woman usually adopts her husband's name and the children usually bear the surname of the father. The wife may keep her maiden name (nazwisko panieńskie) or add her husband's surname to hers, thus creating a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name</b> (nazwisko złożone). However, if she already has a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name,</b> she must leave one of the parts out—it is illegal to use a triple- or more-barrelled name. It is also possible, though rare, for the husband to adopt his wife's surname or to add his wife's surname to his family name (an example is businessman Zygmunt Solorz-Żak, who did both, taking his wife's name on his first marriage, and later appending his second wife's name to it).|$|E
25|$|A {{separate}} {{class of}} surnames {{derive from the}} names of noble clans. These are used either as separate names or {{the first part of}} a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name.</b> Thus, persons named Jan Nieczuja and Krzysztof Nieczuja-Machocki might be related. Similarly, after World War I and World War II, many members of Polish underground organizations adopted their war-time pseudonyms as the first part of their surnames. Edward Rydz thus became Marshal of Poland Edward Śmigły-Rydz and Zdzisław Jeziorański became Jan Nowak-Jeziorański.|$|E

50|$|<b>Double-barrelled</b> <b>names</b> may {{be formed}} {{for a variety}} of reasons, {{including}} combining of spouses' surnames upon marriage or, more commonly in the past, adding another family's surname as a condition of inheritance.|$|R
25|$|Family names first {{appeared}} in Poland around the 13th century and were only used by the upper social classes of society. Originally the Polish nobility belonged to heraldic clans (Polish ród herbowy) whose names survived in their shared coats of arms. Eventually, members of one clan would split into separate families with different surnames, usually derived from {{the name of their}} holdings or estates. Sometimes the family name and the clan name (associated with the arms) would be used together and form a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 21st-century Finland, {{the use of}} {{surnames}} {{follows the}} German model. Every person is legally obliged to have a first and last name. At most, three first names are allowed. A Finnish married couple may adopt the surname that either spouse had as non-married, in which case this name will be the surname of their children. A spouse changing his or her name may decide to use a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name</b> consisting {{of his or her}} former and current official surname. In the case where both spouses keep their names they may choose either name for their children, but all siblings must share the same surname.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{married couples}} compose a new surname (sometimes {{referred}} to as a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name)</b> for their new family by combining their two surnames with a hyphen. Jane Doe and John Smith might become Jane and John Smith-Doe, or Doe-Smith, for instance. In some countries only the woman hyphenates her birth surname, appending her husband's surname. (See also Spanish naming customs#Hyphenation and Portuguese name#Hyphenation.) ...|$|E
50|$|Many <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>names</b> {{are written}} without a hyphen (this can cause {{confusion}} {{as to whether}} the surname is double-barrelled or not). Notable persons with unhyphenated <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>names</b> include David Lloyd George (born with Lloyd as a middle name, but self-transformed into a double barrelled surname), the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, astronomer Robert Hanbury Brown, actors Kristin Scott Thomas and Helena Bonham Carter (although she has said the hyphen is optional,) comedian Sacha Baron Cohen (however, his cousin Professor Simon Baron-Cohen opted for the hyphen), former United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton (who only occasionally used the middle name), and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.|$|R
25|$|After the First and Second World Wars some {{resistance}} fighters added their wartime noms de guerre {{to their original}} family names. This was yet another reason for creating <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>names.</b> Examples include Edward Rydz-Śmigły, Jan Nowak-Jeziorański, and Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski. Some artists, such as Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, also added their noms de plume to their surnames.|$|R
5000|$|As passed, the Act did {{not include}} names for the new boroughs. Keith Joseph, the Minister, asked local councils for {{suggestions}} as to possible names, asking that they be a single word if possible, and noting that [...] "the best name will be the place recognised as {{the centre of the}} new borough". <b>Double-barrelled</b> <b>names</b> were to be prohibited.|$|R
2500|$|The {{characters}} {{are based on}} the personae of the three characters: Garden, a bright but bizarre [...] "mad scientist"; Brooke-Taylor as a conservative, vain, sexually-repressed deniable, upper-class royalist coward, and Oddie as a scruffy, occasionally violent, left-leaning rebel from Lancashire. The characters played up to their stereotypes, debunking them but were not necessarily based on the actor playing the character, even though the actors played characters with their own names, and had some minor characteristics in common. In reality, Garden is a medical doctor, Brooke-Taylor is a lawyer who is not at all conservative ("But I had the <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name</b> so I was always going to play the Tory") and Oddie is a pacifist, ornithologist and active environmentalist.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lines of}} the RB were mainly built with Moroccan labour. Many of the {{stations}} {{were not in the}} settlements they purported to serve. Often a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name</b> indicated that the station lay between two places. Leaving Carhaix, the railway shared the trackbed with the line to Guingamp until it curved to the left and crossed the D787 road. The first station was Plounézéval Halte, (...) [...] The halt actually stood in Le Frostel, some [...] from Plounézéval. Pouallaouen (...) was the next station. The Ulne was crossed on a high stone arch bridge before Huelgoat-Locmaria (...) was reached. This station stood in Locmaria-Berrien and was some (...) from Huelgoat. The d'Argent was crossed by a steel bridge before Kervallon Halte (...) was reached. Here, the line passed to the east of the Forêt Domaniale de St-Ambrose. Scrignac-Berrien station (...) was about (...) from Scrignac and Berrien. Kermarzin [...] (...) and Le Cloître-Lannéanou [...] (...) stations were followed by the summit of the line (over [...] ) before Ploungonven-Plourin [...] (...) was reached.|$|E
2500|$|In the Middle Ages, when a {{man from}} a lower-status family married an only {{daughter}} from a higher-status family, he would often adopt the wife's family name. In the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, bequests were sometimes made contingent upon a man's changing (or hyphenating) his family name, so that {{the name of the}} testator continued. It is rare but not unknown for an English-speaking man to take his wife's family name, whether for personal reasons or as a matter of tradition (such as among matrilineal Canadian aboriginal groups, such as the Haida and Gitxsan); it is exceedingly rare but does occur in the United States, where a married couple may choose an entirely new last name by going through a legal change of name. As an alternative, both spouses may adopt a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name.</b> For instance, when John Smith and Mary Jones marry each other, they may become known as [...] "John Smith-Jones" [...] and [...] "Mary Smith-Jones." [...] A spouse may also opt to use his or her birth name as a middle name. An additional option, although rarely practiced, is the adoption of a last name derived from a blend of the prior names, such as [...] "Simones", which also requires a legal name change. [...] Some couples keep their own last names but give their children hyphenated or combined surnames.|$|E

2500|$|Gabay said portmanteaux [...] "...giv {{people an}} essence {{of who they}} are within the same <b>name.</b> In <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>names,</b> the hyphen is almost pushing one name away from the other. Meshing says 'I am you and you are me', which is rather romantic". Occasionally, even anti-fans come up with names for couples, such as General Hospital's Sonny Corinthos and Emily Quartermaine. The unpopular pairing of the mob boss and his enforcer's sweet younger sister became known as [...] "Soily". Similarly, name-blending exists with celebrities' first names. Said to be a sign of {{commitment}} and togetherness, meshing is also seen by some as an attempt to banish what might be considered a [...] "sexist" [...] tradition of a woman taking her husband's name when she marries.|$|R
500|$|A {{name for}} the {{metropolitan}} borough proved problematic. The Redcliffe-Maud Report had used the <b>name</b> Ashton-Hyde, but <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>names</b> were prohibited for the new districts. Had Ashton-under-Lyne been a county borough, or had had a less common name, [...] "it might have been chosen as the new name" [...] for the new district. The eight other towns objected, adamant that [...] "a new name should be found". Thirty suggestions were put forward, including Brigantia, Clarendon, Hartshead, Kayborough, Tame, Ninetowns, and West Pennine, with Hartshead (with reference to Hartshead Pike) being the most popular {{throughout most of the}} consultation period. However, the name Tameside (with reference to the River Tame, but a [...] concocted name with no historical basis) won 15 votes to Hartshead's 10 in a final stage of voting.|$|R

Never marry a man, my dear, with a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name</b> and no visible means of subsistence; above all, if he's {{generally}} known by a nickname. So you're poor Tom Cayley's daughter, are you? Well, well, we can settle this little matter between us. Mind, I'm a person who always expects to have my own way.

5000|$|In English-speaking {{and some}} other Western countries, a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name</b> (or double surname) is a family name with two parts, {{which may or may}} not be joined with a hyphen.

5000|$|When {{a person}} is born, the custom {{is for them to}} take the first surname of the father and then the first surname of the mother. Thus, when D. Julio Iglesias de la Cueva and Dª Isabel Preysler Arrastía had a son called Enrique, he legally was Enrique Iglesias Preysler. Where the {{optional}} conjunction y (and) is used, the example would become [...] "Enrique Iglesias y Preysler" [...] (never used in the case of Enrique Iglesias; see for example José Ortega y Gasset). On the other hand, actual <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>names</b> exist (called apellidos compuestos), such as García-Huidobro, Cruz-Coke. For example, Luciano Cruz-Coke Carvallo is the son of Mr. Carlos Cruz-Coke Ossa and Ms. Lucía Carvallo Arriagada. In every day use Mr. Cruz-Coke Carvallo is Mr. Cruz-Coke, never Mr. Cruz. Such names usually reflect the same case as in Anglo-Saxon tradition: the survival of a family name that would be lost without this practice. Another common case is to find <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>names</b> {{with the use of the}} conjunction [...] "de" [...] (of). In Iberian tradition this commonly indicates a toponymic surname or a noble family name. Toponymic family such as the surnames García De las Heras, Pérez de Arce or the very common Ortiz de Zárate combine a regular family name with the place that family resides. For example, the [...] "Ortiz" [...] resides in the Basque town of Zarate, in Euskal Herria. The least common double-barreled names that use the particle [...] "de" [...] are the nobiliary ones, such as the Álvarez de Toledo, Ramírez de Arellano or Fernández de Córdoba. In these cases, the first surname indicates the original name of the family, whereas the second surname denotes the nobiliary feud of that family. In this case, the conjunction [...] "de" [...] (of) reflects that the family used to be the feudal lords of that place. Thus, the Ramírez were the lords of the village of Arellano, in Navarre.|$|R
5000|$|The {{family name}} is of ancient {{heritage}} in Greater Poland. It is presently traceable {{to at least}} the fifteenth century, but may have roots further back {{in the kingdom of}} Hungary. Legend has it that genealogy connects it to a Roman tribune in the province of Dacia in the late Roman Empire. The Szymanowski name relates to a place identified as [...] "Szymany". According to composer Karol Szymanowski's exacting biographer, Teresa Chylińska, Szymany is a village in the Szczuczyn district of the Podlasie region of Eastern Poland and the land is recorded as having been inherited by Mikołaj (Nicholas) Szymanowski who died before 1544. The family later moved to the Rawa Voivodeship. The first part of the name, Korwin, is a later 19th c. addition, shared by several other Polish families using the late medieval Korwin clan denomination, such as the Korwin-Kossakowski or Korwin-Piotrowski families. The use of the hyphen in Polish <b>Double-barrelled</b> <b>names</b> is a 20th c. development, hence prior to that names were not hyphenated.|$|R

5000|$|Established by the Marquis d'Alesme in 1585, {{the estate}} was {{originally}} planted in 1616.

2500|$|Her father, Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston (21 November 188916 October 1980), was a British subject born in Auschitz, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary.

In 1923-24, Joseph had briefly been an honorary British consul in Samarang in the Dutch East Indies and prior to his {{marriage}} to Hepburn's mother he had been married to Cornelia Bisschop, a Dutch heiress. Although born with the surname Ruston, he later <b>double-barrelled</b> his <b>name</b> to the more [...] "aristocratic" [...] Hepburn-Ruston, mistakenly believing himself descended from James Hepburn, third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Vlissingen as son of {{pharmacist}} Joris Teerlink and Christina Bekker. As {{his mother was a}} sister of the 18th century Dutch writer Elisabeth (Betje) Wolff-Bekker (1738-1804), he could call one of the celebrities of Dutch literature his aunt. Jan Bekker Teerlink was named, both for his first and <b>double-barrelled</b> last <b>name,</b> after his maternal grandfather, the broker of spices and herbs, Jan Bekker sr. (1694-1783), Betje Wolff’s father. Towards the end of her life, Betje Wolff says in one of her letters that she dearly loves her nephew, whom she considers a thoroughly decent person. At his departure for another long sea voyage, she wept with grief. Apart from proper, his documents at National Archives show us Bekker Teerlink also as an agreeable person, a man who played the violin aboard his ship.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, it {{is common}} for women in {{professional}} fields to keep their maiden name after they get married, often without pronounced feminist influences. In these cases, children may be given the father’s surname, the mother's surname or a both surnames hyphenated (see <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name).</b>|$|E

The wretch forgot his poor altogether, and killed his old nag by always riding over to Brandyball; where he revelled in the maddest passion for Lady Fanny. He ordered the neatest new clothes and ecclesiastical waistcoats from London; he appeared with corazza-shirts, lackered boots, and perfumery; he bought a blood-horse from Bob Toffy: was seen at archery meetings, public breakfasts,--actually at cover; and, I blush to say, that I saw him in a stall at the Opera; and afterwards riding by Lady Fanny's side in Rotten Row. He <b>DOUBLE-BARRELLED</b> his <b>name,</b> (as many poor Snobs do,) and instead of T. Sniffle, as formerly, came out, in a porcelain card, as Rev. T. D'Arcy Sniffle, Burlington Hotel.|$|R
50|$|Born John Turner in Birmingham, {{he adopted}} the <b>double-barrelled</b> stage <b>name</b> John Nathan-Turner {{in order to}} {{distinguish}} himself from the British actor John Turner. He was educated at King Edward VI School, at Aston in Birmingham, where he showed an early interest in acting and theatre. His earliest television acting work was as an extra (supporting artist) in TV productions for ITV, including Crossroads and Flying Swan. Both shows were made in Birmingham (the former at ATV's Aston studios). On leaving school, he initially worked as an actor and assistant stage manager at Birmingham's Alexandra Theatre. He was later taken on by the BBC as a television floor assistant, working on every type of show (from light entertainment to news and current affairs), including - more importantly for his later career - drama. Shows produced by the BBC's drama department that he worked on included The Pallisers, How Green Was My Valley, Angels, and All Creatures Great and Small (on which he worked extensively with future Doctor Who star, Peter Davison). An assignment to the BBC's light entertainment department also led to him spending two years working on The Morecambe and Wise Show, prior to Eric and Ernie's 1978 move to ITV.|$|R
5000|$|One side-effect of {{this unique}} {{arrangement}} {{was that it}} became customary to refer to noblemen by both their family name and their coat of arms name (or clan name). For example: Jan Zamoyski herbu Jelita means [...] "Jan Zamoyski of the Jelita coat of arms" [...] (though it is often translated as [...] "of the clan Jelita" [...] or herbu is Latinized de armis).From the 15th to 17th centuries, the formula {{seems to have been}} to copy the ancient Roman naming convention: praenomen (or given name), nomen gentile (or Gens/Clan name) and cognomen (surname), following the Renaissence fashion. So we have: Jan Jelita Zamoyski, forming a <b>double-barrelled</b> <b>name</b> (nazwisko złożone, literally [...] "compound name").
