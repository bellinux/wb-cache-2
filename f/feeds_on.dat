5|$|Unlike other Bungarus species, who are {{primarily}} snake-eaters, the many-banded krait usually <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> fish, {{but it is}} also preys on other species of snakes, including members of its own species. This species also <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> rodents, eels, frogs, and occasionally lizards.|$|E

5|$|Paranemertes peregrina, which <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> polychaetes, {{can follow}} the prey's trails of mucus, and find its burrow by {{backtracking}} along its own trail of mucus.|$|E
50|$|We {{just saw}} that the <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> {{relation}} is not transitive, but it still contains some transitivity: for instance: humans <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> rabbits, rabbits <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> carrots, and humans also <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> carrots.|$|R
50|$|For instance, in {{the food}} chain, wolves <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> deer, and deer <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> grass, but wolves do not <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> grass. Thus, the <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> {{relation}} among life forms is intransitive, in this sense.|$|R
50|$|They <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> {{trees and}} shrubs, {{except in the}} {{subfamily}} Dioptinae, which <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> herbaceous plants (Miller, 1992). The larvae typically <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> only one family of trees, but closely related species will <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> distantly related plants; for example different members of the genus Datana <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Juglandaceae, Hamamelidaceae, Ericaceae and Anacardiaceae (Miller 1992).|$|R
5|$|Because the hairy-legged {{vampire bat}} <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> bird blood {{and it is}} the ancestral vampire bat, it is likely that all vampire bats {{initially}} fed on bird blood.|$|E
5|$|Honeyguides {{are among}} the few birds that feed on wax. They are named for the greater honeyguide which leads {{traditional}} honey-hunters to bees' nests and, after the hunters have harvested the honey, <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> the remaining contents of the hive.|$|E
5|$|Other pest {{include the}} coconut hispine beetle, Brontispa longissima, which <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> young leaves, {{seedlings}} and mature coconut trees, causing serious economic {{damage in the}} Philippines. The mountain pine beetle is a destructive pest of mature or weakened lodgepole pine, sometimes affecting large areas of Canada.|$|E

5|$|The swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> {{the fallen}} fruit of P.lanceolata and disperses the seed through its scat (dung). A field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that 88% of {{seeds in the}} scat were still viable {{although}} dormant. The red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> drupes and is a likely seed dispersal agent. Animals can convey seed {{for one or two}} kilometres from where they have fed. Rodents such as the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) and black rat (Rattus rattus) eat the drupes but chew the seed so that only fragments leave their digestive system. Foxes have been reported to eat the fruit, and kangaroos and large birds such as currawongs are thought to as well.|$|E
5|$|Zino's petrel, {{like its}} relatives, <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> small squid and fish. The vomited stomach {{contents}} of one bird contained cephalopods, the bioluminiscent fish Electrona risso and small crustaceans. Like other small petrels, Zino's does not normally follow ships.|$|E
5|$|Black-headed sugar ants are nocturnal foragers of food. The {{species is}} {{sometimes}} considered a household pest since ants can enter human homes {{at night in}} search of food. During the day, these ants are not active and have exhibited sleep-like behaviours until it is night. The black-headed sugar ant predominantly <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> sweet secretions and sugar water; insects {{and a variety of}} foodstuffs in human homes are also consumed.|$|E
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Siphonoglossa pilosella in Texas. They {{have been}} {{recorded}} <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> various yellow Asteraceae species in Mexico. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> flower nectar.|$|R

50|$|Lutzomyia arthrophora <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> both {{carbohydrates}} and blood. Females that <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> carbohydrates fare better reproductively {{than those that}} do not. After <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> these sugar solutions L. arthrophora will wait twenty four hours before feeding again. Females will then <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> blood two to four days post eclosion. The main hosts for blood meals are small mammals such as wood-rats, white footed mice, rabbits, squirrel, and opossum. They also will <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> chickens if available. They tend to <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> the hairless regions of the ears.|$|R
5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during {{daylight}} hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a dominant male. This camel <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second sting into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow, where an egg is laid on it. The wasp larva <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> the subdued living cockroach.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea, {{commonly}} known as the corn earworm, is a species (formerly in the genus Heliothis) in the family Noctuidae. The larva of the moth Helicoverpa zea is a major agricultural pest. Since it is polyphagous (<b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> many different plants) during the larval stage, the species has been given many different common names, including the cotton bollworm and the tomato fruitworm. It also consumes a wide variety of other crops.|$|E
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Succisa pratensis and Scabiosa columbaria. They first <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> the seeds. Later, they <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> {{the lower}} leaves from within a {{portable}} case.|$|R
40|$|Food {{plants and}} {{information}} on life history are presented for six species of Argidae and four species of Tenthredinidae in Costa Rica. The Argidae include cocoons of Atomacera josefernandezi Smith, sp. n., found on Hampea appendiculata (Donn. Sm.) Standl. (Malvaceae) and likely <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> its leaves before pupation, and larvae of Eriglenum tristum Smith <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> Machaerium seemanii Benth. Ex Seem.

50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> canola. First <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> the leaves, {{but later}} also <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> the pods. Full-grown larvae {{drop to the}} ground in mid to late August to pupate.|$|R
5|$|Iridomyrmex {{primarily}} <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> sweet {{foods such}} as nectar and honeydew. They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young, and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes. They collect these seeds, remove the elaiosomes, and then discard the seeds. The seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants, giving them {{a better chance of}} survival. Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex; no evidence for any kind of relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Juvenile cane toads are often preyed on, as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. ruburrus are immune to the toxins released by the cane toads. As a result, placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling the cane toad population. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> guano.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the smoothtooth blacktip shark's natural history; it likely inhabits shallow waters and <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> small bony fishes. It is presumably {{viviparous}} like other members of its family. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) last assessed this species as Endangered. Although more specimens have since been discovered, the conservation status of this species remains precarious due to heavy fishing and habitat degradation within its range.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> plankton. The tentacles of the dactylzooids are {{normally}} extended all the time. If an object is waved about above the coral, {{it will cause}} the tentacles to retract and then the coral can be handled without experiencing the painful stings caused by the cnidocytes.|$|E
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Rhizophoraceae species. They <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> {{the closed}} apical leaf buds of their host plant when young. Later, they <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> newly {{expanding}} leaves which they web together.|$|R
50|$|The larvae of sap flies <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> the sap of {{deciduous}} and {{coniferous trees}} (sap runs) and <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> micro-organisms within the sap. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> nectar, and other fermenting substances.|$|R
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Arundinaria tecta. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> flower nectar.|$|R
5|$|Numerous nectar-feeding {{insects are}} {{attracted}} to the flower spikes, which in turn attract honeyeaters, silvereyes and sunbirds, many of which consume both nectar and insects. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> nectar. B.dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D.signata.|$|E
5|$|Other {{arthropods}} {{may make}} use of the antlion larva's ability to trap prey. The larva of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> the prey caught, and the female chalcid wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax.|$|E
5|$|Other {{means are}} also used to garner prey. Some species such as the red-naped sapsucker sally into the air to catch flying insects, and many species probe into crevices and under bark, or glean prey from leaves and twigs. The rufous {{woodpecker}} specialises in attacking the nests of arboreal ants and the buff-spotted woodpecker <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> and nests in termite mounds. Other species such as the wrynecks and the Andean flicker feed wholly or partly on the ground.|$|E
