5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method <b>is</b> <b>find</b> certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Lincoln's performance was one of the episode's drawbacks. He wrote: [...] "One drawback in [...] is that Lincoln plays his emotion a little too close to his deputy's badge. We're told– by him– that all he wants to do <b>is</b> <b>find</b> his wife and kid.

2500|$|At King's College, Wilkins pursued, {{among other}} things, X-ray {{diffraction}} work on ram sperm and DNA {{that had been}} obtained from calf thymus by the Swiss scientist Rudolf Signer. The DNA from Signer's lab was much more intact than the DNA which had previously been isolated. Wilkins discovered {{that it was possible}} to produce thin threads from this concentrated DNA solution that contained highly ordered arrays of DNA suitable for the production of X-ray diffraction patterns. Using a carefully bundled group of these DNA threads and keeping them hydrated, Wilkins and a graduate student Raymond Gosling obtained X-ray photographs of DNA that showed that the long, thin DNA molecule in the sample from Signer had a regular, crystal-like structure in these threads. Gosling later said [...] "When... I first saw all those discrete diffraction spots ...emerging on the film in the developing dish was a truly eureka moment....we realised that if DNA was the gene material then we had just shown that genes could crystallize!" [...] This initial X-ray diffraction work at King's College was done in May or June 1950. It was one of the X-ray diffraction photographs taken in 1950, shown at a meeting in Naples a year later, that sparked James Watson’s interest in DNA causing him to write [...] "suddenly I was excited about chemistry.....I began to wonder whether it would be possible for me to join Wilkins in working on DNA". At that time Wilkins also introduced Francis Crick to the importance of DNA. Crick advised him to work on proteins telling Wilkins [...] "what you ought to do <b>is</b> <b>find</b> yourself a good protein". Wilkins knew that proper experiments on the threads of purified DNA would require better X-ray equipment. Wilkins ordered a new X-ray tube and a new microcamera. He also suggested to Randall that the soon-to-be-appointed Rosalind Franklin should be reassigned from work on protein solutions to join the DNA effort.|$|E
2500|$|While {{sharing a}} flat with Barry Gibb in London in late 1967, Young was {{encouraged}} to write songs. Gibb taught him that [...] "there are no rules in song-writing, there is a structure, but {{what you need to}} do <b>is</b> <b>find</b> the 'hook', and it could be in the melody, the chorus, the words or even an identifiable riff, and that can be the difference in writing a hit record." [...] During 1968, back in Australia, Young wrote [...] "The Real Thing" [...] as a reaction against a Coca-Cola jingle, [...] "Coke is the real thing". Young envisaged the song as a low-key acoustic ballad (in the style of The Beatles [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever") and he originally intended it for his friend and fellow singer Ronnie Burns. Young was practising the song in a dressing room during taping of TV pop music show Uptight when pop producer and fellow Go-Set writer Ian Meldrum heard it. Meldrum (who was also manager for solo singer Russell Morris (ex-Somebody's Image) was greatly impressed by the song and immediately insisted that Young cut a demo of it for Morris. Under Meldrum's production and with the collaboration of engineer John L. Sayers the song was radically transformed into a seven-minute psychedelic epic, with a elaborately edited backing track performed by an all-star band including ex-Zoot guitarist Roger Hicks (who composed the acoustic guitar intro), members of Melbourne band The Groop and backing vocalist Maureen Elkner. Reportedly the most expensive single ever recorded in Australia up to that time, it became one of the biggest Australian pop hits of 1969, peaking at numberone in May and was numberone on Go-Set Top Records for the Year of 1969, and made Morris an immediate national star. It was later covered by Kylie Minogue and by Midnight Oil. Young's next song for Morris, [...] "The Girl That I Love", was released as a double-A-side with [...] "Part Three into Paper Walls" [...] (another epic extended production co-written by Morris and Young) which reached numberone in October.|$|E

For while no spectator can deny their claims to a most solemn and superstitious consideration, no more than my firmest resolutions can decline to behold the spectre-tortoise when emerging from its shadowy recess; yet even the tortoise, dark and melancholy as it is upon the back, still possesses a bright side; its calipee or breast-plate being sometimes of a faint yellowish or golden tinge. Moreover, every one knows that tortoises as well as turtle are of such a make, that if you but put them on their backs you thereby expose their bright sides without the possibility of their recovering themselves, and turning into view the other. But after you have done this, and because you have done this, you should not swear that the tortoise has no dark side. Enjoy the bright, keep it turned up perpetually if you can, but be honest, and don't deny the black. Neither should he, who cannot turn the tortoise from its natural position so as to hide the darker and expose his livelier aspect, like a great October pumpkin in the sun, for that cause declare the creature to be one total inky blot. The tortoise is both black and bright. But let us to particulars.|$|E
60|$|In such {{a village}} as my colored brother drove me {{through on the}} way to the beach it was of an {{absolute}} fitness; and I wish I could convey a due sense of the exquisite keeping of the place. Each white house was more or less closely belted in with a white fence, of panels or pickets; the grassy door-yards glowed with flowers, and often a climbing rose embowered the door-way with its bloom. Away backward or sidewise stretched the woodshed from the dwelling to the barn, and shut the whole under one cover; the turf grew to the wheel-tracks of the road-way, over which the elms rose and drooped; and from one end of the village to the other you could not, as the saying <b>is,</b> <b>find</b> a stone to throw at a dog. I know Holland; I have seen the wives of Scheveningen scrubbing up for Sunday to the very middle of their brick streets, but I doubt if Dutch cleanliness goes so far without, or comes from so deep a scruple within, as the cleanliness of New England. I felt so keenly the feminine quality of its motive as I passed through that village, that I think if I had dropped so much as a piece of paper in the street I must have knocked at the first door and begged the lady of the house (who would have opened it in person after wiping her hands from her work, taking off her apron, and giving a glance at herself in the mirror and at me through the window blind) to report me to the selectmen in the interest of good morals.|$|E

he could not write a novel Longfellow Look of challenge, of interrogation, almost of reproof Looked as if Destiny had sat upon it Love and gratitude are only semi-articulate at the best Love of freedom and the hope of justice Lowell Made all men trust him when they doubted his opinions Malevolent agitators Man who may any moment be out of work is industrially a slave Man is strange to himself as long as he lives Man who had so much of the boy in him Mark Twain Marriages are what the parties to them alone really know Meet here to the purpose of a common ostentation Mellow cordial of a voice that was like no other Memory will not be ruled Men who took themselves so seriously as that need Men read the newspapers, but our women read the books Men's lives ended where they began, in the keeping of women Met with kindness, if not honor Might so far forget myself as to be a novelist Mind and soul were with those who do the hard work of the world Mock modesty of print forbids my repeating here More zeal than knowledge in it Most desouthernized Southerner I ever knew Most serious, the most humane, the most conscientious of men Most journalists would have been literary men if they could Motley Napoleonic height which spiritually overtops the Alps Nearly nothing as chaos could be Neatness that brings despair Never saw a dead man whom he did not envy Never quite sure of life unless I find literature in it Never paid in anything but hopes of paying Never saw a man more regardful of negroes No rose blooms right along No man ever yet told the truth about himself No man ought to live by any art No time to make money No man more perfectly sensed and more entirely abhorred slavery Noble uselessness Not much patience with the unmanly craving for sympathy Not a man who cared to transcend; he liked bounds Not quite himself till he had made you aware of his quality Not lack of quality but quantity of the quality Not much of a talker, and almost nothing of a story-teller Not possible for Clemens to write like anybody else Now death has come to join its vague conjectures NYC, a city where money counts for more and goes for less Odious hilarity, without meaning and without remission Offers mortifyingly mean, and others insultingly vague Old man's tendency to revert to the past Old man's disposition to speak of his infirmities One could be openly poor in Cambridge without open shame Only one concerned who was quite unconcerned Openly depraved by shows of wealth Ought not to call coarse without calling one's self prudish Our huckstering civilization Our deeply incorporated civilization Pathos of revolt from the colorless rigidities People have never had ideals, but only moods and fashions People might oftener trust themselves to Providence People of wealth and fashion always dissemble their joy Person who wished to talk when he could listen Picturesqueness which we should prize if we saw it abroad Plagiarism carries inevitable detection with it Plain-speaking or Rude Speaking Pointed the moral in all they did Polite learning hesitated his praise Praised it enough to satisfy the author Praised extravagantly, and in the wrong place Public whose taste is so crude that they cannot enjoy the best Pure accident and by its own contributory negligence Put your finger on the present moment and enjoy it Put aside all anxiety about style Quarrel was with error, and not with the persons who were in it Quebec was a bit of the seventeenth century Reformers, who are so often tedious and ridiculous Refused to see us as we see ourselves Remember the dinner-bell Reparation due from every white to every black man Results of art should be free to all Reviewers Reward is in the serial and not in the book--19th Century Rogues in every walk of life Secret of the man who is universally interesting Seen through the wrong end of the telescope Shackles of belief worn so long Should sin a little more on the side of candid severity Should be very sorry to do good, as people called it Shy of his fellow-men, as the scholar seems always to be So refined, after the gigantic coarseness of California So many millionaires and so many tramps So touching that it brought the lump into my own throat Solution of the problem how and where to spend the summer Some superstition, usually of a hygienic sort Some of us may be toys and playthings without reproach Some of it's good, and most of it isn't Sometimes they sacrificed the song to the sermon Sought the things that he could agree with you upon Spare his years the fatigue of recalling your identity Standards were their own, and they were satisfied with them Stoddard Study in a corner by the porch Stupidly truthful Summer folks have no idea how pleasant it is when they are gone Superiority one likes to feel towards the rich and great Take our pleasures ungraciously The ornament of a house is the friends who frequent it The old and ugly are fastidious as to the looks of others The world is well lost whenever the world is wrong Their consciences needed no bossing in the performance There is small love of pure literature They are so many and I am so few Things common to all, however peculiar in each Thoreau Those who work too much and those who rest too much Those who have sorrowed deepest will understand this best Those who decide their fate are always rebelling against it Times when a man's city was a man's country Tired themselves out in trying to catch up with him Trouble with success is that it is apt to leave life behind True to an ideal of life rather than to life itself Truthful Turn of the talk toward the mystical Two branches of the novelist's trade: Novelist and Historian Unfailing American kindness Used to ingratitude from those he helped Vacuous vulgarity of its texts Visited one of the great mills Visitors of the more inquisitive sex Wald with the lurch and the sway of the deck in it Walter-Scotticized, pseudo-chivalry of the Southern ideal Warner's Backlog Studies Wasted face, and his gay eyes had the death-look We who have neither youth nor beauty should always expect it We have never ended before, and we do not see how we can end We cannot all be hard-working donkeys Welcome me, and make the least of my shyness and strangeness Well, if you are to be lost, I want to be lost with you What he had done he owned to, good, bad, or indifferent Whatever choice you make, you are pretty sure to regret it When to be an agnostic was to be almost an outcast Whether every human motive was not selfish Whitman's public use of his privately written praise Wit that tries its teeth upon everything Women's rights Wonder why we hate the past so--"It's so damned humiliating!"
