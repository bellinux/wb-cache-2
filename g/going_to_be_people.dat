They've both just left marriages (to Amber and Daniel, though Cane's wasn't legal), their exes are living together, and Cane is older than Lily. Yet, the adorable Aussie and the cute coed make a charming match." [...] The magazine praised the couple because they united the core families, the Winters and the Chancellors.

50|$|The Hoboken {{election}} of 2005 {{is an election}} that was held on May 10, 2005 in Hoboken, New Jersey for Hoboken residents, in which the Mayor of Hoboken was chosen {{based on the number}} of votes. However, no mayoral candidate was able to obtain at least 50% of the vote. The top two vote-getters, David Roberts and Carol Marsh, ran on June 14 in a runoff election, and Roberts won 5,761 to 4,239 (votes). In the May 10 election, Roberts got 39% of the votes and Marsh got 27% of the vote. There were 5 people running for mayor, 3 of which did not make it to the runoff. There were also 17 people running for 3 at-large seats on the Hoboken City Council, but in the same manner as those running for mayor, no candidate could get a majority, so the 6 people running for council that got the most votes were in the June 14 runoff election (everyone on Robert's team and everyone on Marsh's team). Since the start of the election, there were only 3 spots available on the council, so only 3 of the 17 running for Hoboken City Council (17.6%) would be successful. Those 3 people are now <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>people</b> from Roberts' team. Each position that the candidates were running for is a 4-year term.|$|E

Ultimately, while making the movie, I realized {{how important it}} <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> put their own beliefs in the end and not foreclose that.

5000|$|Comparisons {{were also}} {{made to the}} dress worn by Prince William's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.

Sarah Burton channelled a new take on classicism for a modern-day bride who will one day be queen." [...] Diana's wedding dress maker, Elizabeth Emanuel, has suggested: [...] "Exactly as it happened in 1981, there are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>people</b> watching as she walks down the aisle with their sketch pads, with the machinists and pattern cutters all ready and waiting. By the next morning you'll see copies in High Street." [...] Emanuel says the dress would fit many body shapes.There were many suggestions that the style of the dress would influence wedding fashion for the next few years. Alison McGill, the editor-in-chief of Weddingbells Magazine: [...] "I think her choice to wear long sleeves signals a big goodbye to strapless wedding gowns." [...] Meanwhile, Veronica Di Santo-Abramowicz, of the Toronto-based Ines Di Santo label opined [...] "Kate's dress will influence so much of the bridal style that we will see over the next few years. It always happens that when a person of royalty or high stature gets married, this sets trends for several years. For example, Princess Diana's gown and Carolyn Bessette's gown are two noteworthy brides that come to mind." ...|$|E

[...] Former Pinellas County Republican Party Chairman Tony DiMatteo said that Crist was more likely to receive a primary challenge to if he ran for the Senate because: [...] "In Tallahassee, there's a conservative Republican Legislature to balance the governor... A lot of people around the state feel the same way I do. We didn't leave Charlie; Charlie left us." [...] Conversely, Republican consultant Adam Goodman said: [...] "He's looked upon as such a popular and compelling figure that the sky's the limit.

40|$|Envelope]:Dorothy Six 8 Brookside AvenuePelham 65, New York A/C W. Judson ClarkClass 45 -ASpence FieldMoultrie, Ga. [Transcription begins]:Saturday My darling, Just got all {{parked in}} my little old {{hospital}} bed. Had to wait for hours because they forgot all about me. Honey, I love you so. Last night after we left you Mother 2 ̆ 6 I went to some restaurant {{and as soon as}} we got there they played “Making Believe. ” Lord, I’m so lonesome 2 ̆ 6 miss you so much. Gee, honey, I love you so. Just ran out of ink. I hope that you’ll be able to read this, hon—I know that pencil smears. Mother just managed to get me some more ink. They’re trying to starve me to death here, honey. The nurses are walking down the hall with trays of food but they won’t bring me any. Still haven’t seen the doctor so haven’t any idea when they’ll operate or anything. Gee darling it was so hard to leave you yesterday. I miss you so, honey. It’s terrific! You looked so adorable last night. Of course you always do but I just couldn’t believe that you were leaving for the old South. I actually expect to see you next weekend the way I used to. Golly, honey, who ever would have thought on that first night when you called me that we would get engaged and be married before another year. Everything happened so fast but it doesn’t seem that way at all. It seems as we’d always gone around together in a way. As though there’d never been another boy that I went out with. (There goes my English again). Sweetheart, I don’t know how to write you really. There are so many millions of things that I want to tell you but somehow I just can’t find the words for. The only thing I can say is I love you. That seems so inadequate. I want to tell you how very much I love you, honey, but there just aren’t words enough. All the way down to this dump (hope the nurses can’t read) I thought about you and getting married 2 ̆ 6 how wonderful things will be. Just think, next time you’re home we’ll be married. Golly, that sounds marvelous. Wish you were coming home this weekend. Wonder if you’ll get tight that night. Suppose some of the fellers get home 2 ̆ 6 want you to have a few drinks with them. Just don’t get too tight. That will be too important a night. Honey, this week sure changed me. Remember how I wanted to get tight at the reception. Well, you’ve certainly changed my mind about that 2 ̆ 6 everything. You can’t imagine how I felt before but now everything is wonderful. Some intern just came in and took my blood pressure. I hope they don’t say anything to mother about it’s [sic] being low. I almost drove him crazy telling him all the things I had when I was a kid. They’re arguing now about whether I’m going to be operated on at one or not. What a place. They were all set to prepare me for the operation 2 ̆ 6 I kept trying to tell them that I hadn’t even seen a doctor yet. It’s a madhouse. Don’t know when the doctor’s coming but it’s three minutes of one 2 ̆ 6 they have me scheduled to be operated on at one. Oh, well, nothing ever happens to me. This is really some place. They brought me up to the sixth floor and left me sitting in a waiting room. Said they’d be right back. That right back turned out to be three quarters of an hour 2 ̆ 6 finally I said something to one of the nurses who was roaming around. She had forgotten all about me. Great place. Golly, honey, I hope that they don’t give me ether because there’s no telling what I’ll say. That would be bad! Called Woody today 2 ̆ 6 she hadn’t mailed the letter. I hope she remembers to today because that has to pay part of the doctor’s bill. Honey, I miss you so much. It sure has been perfect being with you so much. This was an almost perfect week. There was only one thing it needed to be complete. Of course you wouldn’t know what that was. We really should have gotten married, Sweetheart. It was so wonderful to be with you almost every minute. Can you imagine what we’ll be like after we’re married? It will really be pityful [sic] then. We certainly won’t have any friends. Maybe we’ll change but I sure hope not. You’re still on the train, now, darling. Gee, I wish you were here with me. Honey, everything was so nice this week. It was almost as though we were married. It was the funniest feeling that night at Nanny’s when we got lost and went to New York, remember[?] To come upstairs with you 2 ̆ 6 be staying at the same house—It will be so nice to be married. Nice is putting it rather mildly. But think how convenient it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>People</b> won’t have to worry about conventions any more. Gee, honey this isn’t the type of letter I planned to write you. This certainly isn’t a very romantic atmosphere to write in but I sure love you. I hate to leave you last night. It was so awful to go home without you. And this morning it was even worse when you weren’t there to kiss me as soon as I woke up. That was awful. That was such a beautiful way to wake up at your house. I love you so, honey. Gee, being married to you {{is going to be the}} most wonderful thing that ever happened. It would have to be because you’re the most wonderful man in the whole world. Honestly, Judd, whenever I think of any of the other boys I ever went out with I wonder how I ever lived without you. You have everything I’ve ever admired in a man and more. Besides being so darned good looking 2 ̆ 6 so nice 2 ̆ 6 manish [sic] you’re so[,] I guess[,] versatile is the word—maybe convertable [sic]. Anyway, honey, you’re just perfect. Of course you’re stubborn but I love you more for it. You’re nice and tall. Just exactly right and sensative [sic] and sweet 2 ̆ 6 thoughtful. You’re a musician and a marvelous one at that. Wish I could tell you how much I admire you 2 ̆ 6 respect you. As long as I’ve known you I’ve [crossed-out word] you (wrong word) idolized [you] and you’ve been my ideal (my secret love). Honey, guess what—since the last line I’ve had my tonsils out! The nurse came 2 ̆ 6 said the doctor wanted to look at me 2 ̆ 6 they got me all bandaged up in those hospital rags 2 ̆ 6 before I know it my tonsils were out. I feel fine. My writing is a little shaky because they have so much junk on the table. Honey, it’s so funny—my mouth feels as though I had millions of marbles 2 ̆ 6 about four times it’s [sic] normal size. The whole thing didn’t take more than ten minutes. It was all very disappointing. You know in the movies how it’s all so dramatic—well, the movies are crazy. This wasn’t. He sat me in a chair. Well, first of all, there was a lovely build up. The nurse came in 2 ̆ 6 dressed me in real sanitary stuff. You could almost feel the germlessness. So then she wrapped my feet in big booties. All white and tied a rag around my hair. It was all nice 2 ̆ 6 dramatic because they were hurrying like a movie 2 ̆ 6 I couldn’t get the back of the thing buttoned—more fun. Then a guy came with a wheelchair 2 ̆ 6 wrapped me in a white sheet—sarong style. Then they threw me in the wheel chair cause the sarong was so tight around me [sic] knees. Well, he pushed me down the hall 2 ̆ 6 I felt real sharp 2 ̆ 6 like I was impressing everyone with the seriousness of my condition. We rode up to the seventh floor and there were loads of rooms with tables in them 2 ̆ 6 lights over them 2 ̆ 6 instruments hanging all around. Well, that was fine. I began to feel mighty important and sorry for myself. Thinking how glad I was he was only going to look at my throat. Well, I got into his office after passing about five rooms with all the tables 2 ̆ 6 gagets [sic] in them. It had a chair like the dentist’s office and they put me in it. The doctor was nice. There was a nurse with a thing around her nose 2 ̆ 6 mouth. That all added to the impression. So far it was all good. He looks down my throat 2 ̆ 6 says it’s not bad—inflamed or anything. So he gets out the huge needle. Honestly, honey it was miles long 2 ̆ 6 stabs my throat with it. He jabed [sic] around half a dozen times 2 ̆ 6 I was chatting merrily away to him about whether it was going to hurt or not. Then he told me to listen that my voice would go away. It did 2 ̆ 6 you should hear me. I’m much worse than Kenneth ever was. Honestly, hon, it’s a riot. I began to laugh 2 ̆ 6 he had to laugh with me. Well, it’s beginning to hurt like the devil now. Have to stop writing now. [Transcription ends...|$|E

While being asked if [...] "Devil Pray" [...] could run the risk of being misunderstood as a song encouraging drugs, Madonna replied: [...] "I'm certainly not judging people who take drugs or saying 'don't do drugs', however, I'm saying you can do all of these things to connect to a higher level, but ultimately you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lost. <b>People</b> who <b>are</b> getting high are instinctively also trying to connect to a higher level of consciousness, but are doing {{it in a way that}} will not sustain them." ...|$|R

Sunni Arabs became guilty by association with the Ba'ath Party’s crimes, and in turn Sunni Arabs became defensive, and isolated from other communities. [...] This fragmentation was also noted as a detrimental side effect of the de-Ba'athification policy by Juan Cole, who stated that [...] "Sunni Arabs need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reassured that they <b>are</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the low <b>people</b> on the totem pole in the new Iraq." ...|$|R

This point is clearly stated in a martyrdom video by Dani Dwi Permana, a suicide bomber in the July 2009 attack in Jakarta, who says, [...] "This is not suicide. This is what our enemies fear. It is an {{obligation}} for all (Muslims). Those who do not execute this obligation are sinners." [...] By declaring his action <b>to</b> <b>be</b> obligatory for Muslims, he is using his martyrdom video to present the religious justification for his action. This view is upheld by many radical scholars fatwas. [...] The call against fitna is suspended in radical fatwas as proclaimed by the martyrdom video of Tanvir Hussain, [...] "I don’t hold any person <b>to</b> <b>be</b> innocent for the slaughter of the Muslim. Collateral damage <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inevitable. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die." ...|$|R

On the caf&eacute; opening, he told the crowd, [...] "In this book, I wrote about how the way <b>to</b> change politics <b>is</b> not depending on the existing political class and the existing political system, but for us ourselves to start grassroots movements like what has happened on the New Era estate...this caf&eacute; <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> run by <b>people</b> in abstinence-based recovery.

Abaddon <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sue Amy, and she’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sue them. I think it'll <b>be</b> fun <b>to</b> do the send-up of the legal world {{in the way we}} did with the {{corporate}} stuff," [...] White said. There will be depositions and testimony and character witnesses - and Amy's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> need her flak jacket.
