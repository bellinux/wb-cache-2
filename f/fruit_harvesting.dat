In this present study, the pineapple fruits of treatment and control (open field) were harvested twice (in winter and summer, respectively) to detect the aroma components.

40|$|Tarocco {{blood oranges}} (Citrus sinensis Linn. Obsek) were {{harvested}} monthly from November to April and dipped in water at 53 °C for 3 min before storage at 3 °C for 10 weeks and 1 additional week at 20 °C, which simulated a marketing period (SMP). Untreated fruit {{were used as}} control. No treatment damage was observed in <b>fruit</b> <b>harvested</b> in March. In contrast, hot water dipping caused severe damage to the peel in fruit picked earlier {{and later in the}} season. Susceptibility to chilling injury (CI) was greatest in <b>fruit</b> <b>harvested</b> between November and January, less in February, and negligible in March and April. Prestorage hot water dipping effectively alleviated CI in all samples, especially those which showed greater susceptibility. There was little rotting in <b>fruit</b> <b>harvested</b> between November and Januay, while <b>fruit</b> <b>harvested</b> between February and April exhibited a greater susceptibility, which varied with picking date. Hot water dipping gave beneficial effects on decay control of <b>fruit</b> <b>harvested</b> in February and March but was detrimental for <b>fruit</b> <b>harvested</b> in April. <b>Fruit</b> mass loss gradually increased with maturity stage and was seen to be promoted by hot water dips during both cold storage and SMP. The influence of hot water dipping on respiration rate, endogenous ethylene, maturity index (evaluated by °Brix/juice titratable acidity ratio), ethanol concentration in the juice, and electrolyte leakage from the flavedo tissue was nonsignificant. It was concluded that prestorage hot water dipping at 53 °C may be viable in limiting CI and decay control of Tarocco oranges during 10 weeks of cold storage and subsequent SMP when they are harvested at mid-season, January−February, but may be harmful to <b>fruit</b> <b>harvested</b> early or late in the season...|$|R

40|$|Growth stage {{specific}} {{crop coefficient}} for greenhouse tomatoes {{grown in the}} semi arid Mediterranean was evaluated. The evaluation consisted of two simultaneous field trails: 1) Data accumulation of the water consumption of round and cherry tomato plants {{with the use of}} drainage lysimeters. 2) Irrigation of tomatoes planted in local sandy soil with either reduced or excess irrigation water doses using the lysimeter water consumption data as the reference criteria. Crop coefficients of between 0. 3 - 1 for the time period from seedling establishment until first <b>fruit</b> <b>harvest</b> and 0. 8 for the <b>fruit</b> <b>harvest</b> period were recorded for the winter season round tomato crop. During the summer season, coefficients of between 0. 2 - 0. 9 for the time period from seedling establishment until first <b>fruit</b> <b>harvest</b> and 0. 8 for the <b>fruit</b> <b>harvest</b> period were measured for the round tomato crop.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the postharvest quality evolution of gamma-irradiated &# 8216;Tahiti&# 8217; limes.

In a preliminary assay, <b>fruits</b> <b>harvested</b> in April 2011 were exposed to a gamma radiation range from 0 to 750 Gy. The 250 and 750 Gy doses negatively affected skin quality and pulp of exposed fruits. For this reason, new assays were carried out using lower doses to irradiate <b>fruits</b> <b>harvested</b> in July 2011 (off-season) and January 2012 (regular <b>harvest</b> period). <b>Fruit</b> <b>harvested</b> in both periods were selected and exposed to radiation doses of 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 Gy. All irradiations occurred {{at a rate of}} 0. 46 Gy/h. After fruit irradiation, physical and chemical analyses were performed along a 20 -day storage period at room temperature (24 ± 1 ºC and 80 ± 5 % RH). Irradiation of <b>fruits</b> <b>harvested</b> in July 2011 and January 2012 and treated with doses of up to 200 Gy did not affect the ascorbic acid content, but doses > 100 Gy caused skin yellowing of <b>fruits</b> <b>harvested</b> on both periods. Gamma radiation at doses = 50 Gy reduced the total soluble solids content in off-season fruits. Exposure of <b>fruits</b> <b>harvested</b> in the main harvest period to radiation doses = 150 Gy increased weight loss.

5000|$|The Murumuru palm (Astrocaryum murumuru) is {{abundant}} in the Brazilian Amazon, extending to the borders of Bolivia and Peru. It prefers to grow in periodically flooded areas, especially on islands and in lowlands along the rivers throughout the Amazon River estuary and its tributaries, in dense or semi-open forests.It is also frequently found in the lowlands of Marajo Island. The stem, leaves and fruit stalks are covered with hard, black spines that can reach over 20 cm in length, complicating <b>fruit</b> <b>harvesting.</b> When the fruit is ripe, the inflorescence (cluster of flowers) drops to the ground. The fruit contains a yellow flesh often consumed by rodents as food, which leave the seeds clean. The seed’s hard shell is only separable from the kernel when dry. In general, 100 kg of dry seeds (12%- 15% water) yields 27 kg to 29 kg of kernels, which must be further dried to prevent deterioration during storage. These kernels then yield 40% to 42% oil. A single Murumuru palm produces about 11 kg of dry seeds. Hydraulic extraction can produce 35% oil relative to the dry weight of the kernel, which is equivalent to about 3.8 liters of oil per Murumuru palm. The kernels must be ground with grinding discs before hydraulic extraction. A kilogram of fruit pulp contains approximately 50 seeds.
