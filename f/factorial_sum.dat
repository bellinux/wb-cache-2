In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the functional equation for alternating <b>factorial</b> <b>sum</b> and its particular solutions (alternating Kurepa’s function A(z) [11] and function A 1 (z)). We determine an extension of domain of functions A(z) and A 1 (z) {{in the sense of}} Cauchy’s principal value at point. Using the methods from [4] and [12] we give a representation of alternating Kurepa’s function A(z) which is an analog of Slavić’s representation of Kurepa’s function K(z) [4]. Also, we consider some representations of functions A(z) and A 1 (z) via incomplete gamma function and we consider differential transcendency of previous functions too. 1. The functional equation for alternating <b>factorial</b> <b>sum</b> and its particular solutions The main object of consideration in this paper is the functional equation for alternating <b>factorial</b> <b>sum</b> (1) A(z) + A(z − 1) = Γ(z + 1), with respect to the function A: D − → C with domain D ⊆ C −, where Γ is the gamma function, C is the set of complex numbers and Z − is set of negative integer numbers. A solution of functional equation (1) over the set of natural numbers (D = N) is the function of alternating left factorial An. R. Guy introduced this function, in the book [8] (p. 100), as an alternating sum of factorials An = n! − (n − 1) ! + [...] . + (− 1) n− 11 !. Let us use the notation n∑ A(n) = (− 1) n−i (2) i!. i= 1 Sum (2) corresponds to the sequence A 005165 in [13]. We call the functional equation (1) the functional equation for alternating <b>factorial</b> <b>sum.</b> In consideration which follows we consider two particular solutions of the functional equation (1). 1. 1.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} some problems, {{the solution of}} which requires a massive computation. One {{of them is the}} question: are there infinitely many primes of the form�n i= 1 (− 1) n−ii!? Another interesting problem is to determine the set of absolute values of (0, 1) determinants of order n, for n as large as possible. The question is answered for n ≤ 8. There are many simply formulated questions, that can be answered only by a very hard computation. Here we consider the two such problems. The first group of questions concerns testing hypotheses about <b>factorial</b> <b>sums,</b> among which is the Kurepa hypothesis on left factorials. We are also interested in finding the set of determinant absolute values of (0, 1) matrices of order n — for n as large, as possible. There is some difference between these two problems. The first of them requires a small memory, but the computation is time consuming. The solving process of the second problem requires both the large memory, and the long computation time; one is forced to make some trade-off while advancing towards its (partial) solution. 1. Left factorial hypotheses 1. 1. Problem formulation. Let N and P denote the set of positive integers and the set of prime numbers, respectively. For integers m, n let (m, n) denote their greatest common divisor, and let m mod n denote the remainder from division of m by n. The fact that m divides (does not divide) n is written as m | n (m ∤ n). For n ≥ 1 let n� An+ 1 = (− 1) n−i i! and let i= 1 n− 1 �!n = i! (left factorial function defined by Kurepa [17]). The following table lists a few first members of these sequences...|$|R
40|$|Gibbs {{partition}} {{models are}} the largest class of infinite exchangeable partitions of the positive integers generalizing the product form of the probability function of the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet family. Recently those models have been investigated in a Bayesian nonparametric approach to species sampling problems as alternatives to the Dirichlet and the Pitman-Yor process priors. Here we derive marginals of conditional and unconditional multivariate distributions arising from exchangeable Gibbs partitions to obtain explicit formulas for joint falling factorial moments of corresponding conditional and unconditional Gibbs sampling formulas. Our proofs rely on a known result on <b>factorial</b> moments of <b>sum</b> of non independent indicators. We provide an application to a Bayesian nonparametric estimation of the predictive probability to observe a species already observed {{a certain number of}} times.

40|$|AbstractLet u be a {{sequence}} of non-decreasing positive integers. A u-parking function of length n is {{a sequence}} (x 1,x 2,…,xn) whose order statistics (the sequence (x(1),x(2),…,x(n)) obtained by rearranging the original sequence in non-decreasing order) satisfy x(i) ⩽ui. The Gonc̆arov polynomials gn(x;a 0,a 1,…,an− 1) are polynomials defined by the biorthogonality relation:ε(ai) Dign(x;a 0,a 1,…,an− 1) =n!δin,where ε(a) is evaluation at a and D is the differentiation operator. In this paper we show that Gonc̆arov polynomials form a natural basis of polynomials for working with u-parking functions. For example, the number of u-parking functions of length n is (− 1) ngn(0;u 1,u 2,…,un). Various properties of Gonc̆arov polynomials are discussed. In particular, Gonc̆arov polynomials satisfy a linear recursion obtained by expanding xn as a linear combination of Gonc̆arov polynomials, {{which leads to a}} decomposition of an arbitrary sequence of positive integers into two subsequences: a “maximum” u-parking function and a subsequence consisting of terms of higher values. Many counting results for parking functions can be derived from this decomposition. We give, as examples, formulas for sum enumerators, and a linear recursion and Appell relation for <b>factorial</b> moments of <b>sums</b> of u-parking functions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Recalled Parental Rearing Behavior {{questionnaire}} (FEE, [1, 2]) assesses perceived parental rearing behavior {{separately for}} each parent. An ultra-short screening version (FEE-US) {{with the same}} three scales each for {{the mother and the}} father is reported and factor-analytically validated. Methods N = 4, 640 subjects aged 14 to 92 (M = 48. 4 years) were selected by the random-route sampling method. The ultra-short questionnaire version was derived from the long version through item and factor analyses. In a confirmatory factor analysis framework, the hypothesized three-factorial structure was fitted to the empirical data and tested for measurement invariance, differential item functioning, item discriminability, and convergent and discriminant factorial validity. Effects of gender or age were assessed using MANOVAs. Results The a-priori hypothesized model resulted in mostly adequate overall fit. Neither gender nor age group yielded considerable effects on the factor structure, but had small effects on means of raw score <b>sums.</b> <b>Factorial</b> validities could be confirmed. Scale sums are well-suited to rank respondents along the respective latent dimension. Conclusion The structure of the long version with the factors Rejection & Punishment, Emotional Warmth, and Control & Overprotection could be replicated for both father and mother items in the ultra-short screening version using confirmatory factor analyses. These results indicate that the ultra-short screening version is a time-saving and promising screening instrument for research settings and in individual counseling. However, the shortened scales do not necessarily represent the full spectrum covered by the full-scale dimensions. </p...|$|R
