5|$|The {{report states}} {{that there were}} two {{critical}} errors made during the planning stages. Firstly, the parking lot for the mall was located {{on the roof of the}} building without there being sound waterproofing, and secondly the structural inefficiency of the <b>hollow</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs which prevented the installation of effective waterproofing later on.|$|E
25|$|On warm windy days air {{is drawn}} in through {{passages}} in the curved <b>hollow</b> <b>concrete</b> floor slabs. Stack ventilation naturally rising {{out through the}} stainless steel chimneys enhances the air flow through the building. The movement of air across the chimney tops enhances the stack effect.|$|E

The viaduct has two {{abutments}} and four intermediate supports of <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete,</b> supported by deep foundations of <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> with a bridge deck formed of a composite structure made of a metal frame and a triangular tubular reinforced concrete slab.|$|R
30|$|The {{reversed}} {{cyclic loading}} tests {{are said to}} simulate a loading history due to earthquakes. However, the behavior of <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> and prestressed concrete bridge columns is complicated because {{of the interaction between}} flexure and shear, and the reversed cyclic loads. Therefore, to investigate the real seismic behavior of <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> and prestressed concrete bridge columns, it is necessary to carry out a hybrid earthquake loading test.|$|R

In order to enhance the tunnel insulating layer heat insulation effect, thermal insulation glazed <b>hollow</b> bead <b>concrete</b> {{will be used in}} tunnel wall thermal insulation layer, the characteristics of thermal insulation glazed <b>hollow</b> bead <b>concrete</b> will be discussed and the appropriate mixture ratio and coefficient of heat conductivity will also be determined, {{as well as in the}} basis of reasonable theoretical analysis and derivation, prediction of the thermal insulation material of surrounding rock after exhaust heat will drop significantly, and it is proved that the thermal insulation glazed <b>hollow</b> bead <b>concrete</b> used in deep mine roadway can produce the benefit and have broad prospects...|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} utilizes five vertical shafts as {{an integral}} part of the ventilation and cooling strategy. The main components of these stacks are a south facing glass-block wall, thermal mass walls and stainless steel round exhausts rising a few meters above roof level. The chimneys are connected to the curved <b>hollow</b> <b>concrete</b> floor slabs which are cooled via night ventilation. Pipes embedded in the floor can provide additional cooling utilizing groundwater.|$|E
25|$|Designed by architects Feilden Clegg Bradley, the BRE offices aim {{to reduce}} energy {{consumption}} and CO2 emissions by 30% from current best practice guidelines and sustain comfortable environmental conditions {{without the use}} of air conditioning. The passive ventilation stacks, solar shading, and <b>hollow</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs with embedded under floor cooling are key features of this building. Ventilation and heating systems are controlled by the building management system (BMS) while a degree of user override is provided to adjust conditions to occupants' needs.|$|E
25|$|With Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, Owen {{helped create}} the first life-size sculptures {{depicting}} dinosaurs as he thought they might have appeared. Some models were initially created for the Great Exhibition of 1851, but 33 were eventually produced when the Crystal Palace was relocated to Sydenham, in South London. Owen famously hosted a dinner for 21 prominent men of science inside the <b>hollow</b> <b>concrete</b> Iguanodon on New Year's Eve 1853. However, in 1849, {{a few years before}} his death in 1852, Gideon Mantell had realised that Iguanodon, of which he was the discoverer, was not a heavy, pachyderm-like animal, as Owen was proposing, but had slender forelimbs; his death left him unable to participate {{in the creation of the}} Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, and so Owen's vision of dinosaurs became that seen by the public. He had nearly two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework; two Iguanodon, one standing and one resting on its belly, were included.|$|E

30|$|Results {{from all}} two test units show good {{correlation}} between the flexural plus the shear displacements and the total top displacement. For each of the test <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> bridge columns, the predicted and the measured maximum loads were in good agreement. The analysis not only correctly predicted the stiffness, load, and deformation at the peak, but also captured the post-peak softening well. The predictions of the failure modes of all the <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> bridge column specimens also agree with the experimental results.|$|R
500|$|Construction on the {{extension}} began after a groundbreaking ceremony held on April 26, 2013, using 1,166 crane-lifted <b>hollow</b> <b>concrete</b> segments that are cinched {{together to make}} bridge spans on the [...] elevated guideway. A $30 million design-built contract was awarded to Harbor Pacific/Graham in February 2014 to design and construct Angle Lake station's 1,050-stall parking garage and plaza. Construction of the station and garage began in September 2014. During construction, several nearby businesses complained of lost revenue from blocked access and vibrations from work causing minor damage; they sought compensation from Sound Transit, but the claims were not awarded because of a potential violation of the state constitution regarding illegal gifting of public funds.|$|E

2500|$|In 1940, the {{destroyed}} granite dam on the Colorado River {{was finally}} {{replaced by a}} <b>hollow</b> <b>concrete</b> dam that formed Lake McDonald (now called Lake Austin) and which has withstood all floods since. In addition, the much larger Mansfield Dam was built by the LCRA upstream of Austin to form the flood-control lake, Lake Travis. [...] In the early 20th century, the Texas Oil Boom took hold, creating tremendous economic opportunities in Southeast Texas and North Texas. The growth generated by this boom largely passed by Austin at first, with the city slipping from fourth largest to 10th largest in Texas between 1880 and 1920.|$|E
30|$|This {{paper has}} {{attempted}} to establish a framework for assessment of the seismic performance of <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> and prestressed concrete bridge columns. An experimental and analytical {{study was conducted to}} quantify performance measures and to examine one aspect of detailing for hollow bridge columns. A comparison with test data confirms that good predictions were obtained in regards to load capacities, failure modes, and load-deformation responses of <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> and prestressed concrete bridge columns. The RCAHEST can be used for examining the seismic performance of structures that have been previously designed.|$|R
30|$|An {{evaluation}} method for the seismic performance of <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> and prestressed concrete bridge columns is proposed. The proposed method uses a nonlinear {{finite element analysis}} program RCAHEST (Reinforced Concrete Analysis in Higher Evaluation System Technology) developed by the authors (Kim et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2010). To assess the ability of the RCAHEST program to predict the seismic performance of <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> and prestressed concrete bridge columns, computed results using the program were compared with the test results.|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the seismic {{performance}} of <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> and prestressed concrete bridge columns, and to provide data for developing improved seismic design criteria. By using a sophisticated nonlinear finite element analysis program, the accuracy and objectivity of the assessment process can be enhanced. A computer program, RCAHEST (Reinforced Concrete Analysis in Higher Evaluation System Technology), is used to analyze reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete structures. Tensile, compressive and shear models of cracked concrete and models of reinforcing and prestressing steel were used to account for the material nonlinearity of reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete. The smeared crack approach was incorporated. The proposed numerical method for the seismic performance assessment of <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> and prestressed concrete bridge columns is verified by comparing it with the reliable experimental results. Additionally, the studies and discussions presented in this investigation provide an insight into the key behavioral aspects of <b>hollow</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> and prestressed concrete bridge columns.|$|R

2500|$|North Reef Light is {{an active}} {{lighthouse}} located on North Reef, a [...] planar reef, about [...] northeast of Gladstone, Queensland, Australia in the Capricorn and Bunker Group. The lighthouse was constructed on a migratory patch of sand inside a fringing coral reef, which over the years disappeared and reappeared, as sand was washed away and accumulated, {{and is now a}} vegetated sandy island. Its construction is unique, having a <b>hollow</b> <b>concrete</b> base that both gives it resistance to the shifting nature of the sandbar and serves as a fresh water tank. As such, it {{is considered one of the}} major achievement in Australian lighthouse construction. It is also notable in that due to the harsh conditions, only bachelors were allowed to serve as lighthouse keepers. At [...] it is also the tallest of Queensland's timber framed iron clad lighthouses.|$|E
2500|$|The CN Tower {{consists}} of several substructures. The main {{portion of the}} tower is a <b>hollow</b> <b>concrete</b> hexagonal pillar containing the stairwells and power and plumbing connections. The Tower's six elevators {{are located in the}} three inverted angles created by the Tower's hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way through the Tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the Tower; the Tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the Tower is a [...] tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying TV and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: the Glass Floor and Outdoor Observation Terrace which are both located at an elevation of , the Indoor Lookout Level (formerly known as [...] "Indoor Observation Level") located at , and the higher SkyPod (formerly known as [...] "Space Deck") at , just below the metal antenna. The hexagonal shape can be seen between the two areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large tripod.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hollow</b> core {{reinforced}} <b>concrete</b> columns {{are generally}} preferred in use {{to decrease the}} cost and weight/stiffnesss ratio of members, such as bridge columns and piles. With a simplified stress state assumption, strengthening a <b>hollow</b> core reinforced <b>concrete</b> column with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wrapping provides a biaxial confinement to the concrete, {{which leads to a}} need of defining the effect of FRP wrapping on the strength and ductility of the <b>hollow</b> core reinforced <b>concrete</b> columns. In this study, two groups of four <b>hollow</b> core reinforced <b>concrete</b> columns (205 mmouter diameter, 56 mmhollow core diameter, and 925 mmheight) were tested under concentric, eccentric (25 and 50 mmeccentricity) and bending loads to observe the effect of carbon FRP (CFRP) wrapping. All the columns had internal steel reinforcement. Half of the columns had three layers of circumferential CFRP wrapping, whereas the other half had no external confinement. Axial load-bending moment (P–M) diagrams of each group were drawn using the obtained experimental results for both groups. It was observed that, CFRP wrapped columns had higher load and moment carrying capacities than the other group. An analytical model is proposed for drawing the P–Mdiagram of CFRP wrapped <b>hollow</b> core reinforced <b>concrete</b> columns...|$|R
