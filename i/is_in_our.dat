5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

25|$|Horizontal {{segregation}} {{refers to}} differences {{in the number of}} people of each gender present across occupations. Horizontal segregation is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy (post-industrial society), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the care work of their children and their homes, they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> society.|$|E

25|$|What commends it (Quran) so powerfully to the {{historian}} is its authenticity, {{not as the}} Word of God, of course, as the Muslims believe but as the secular historian cannot and should not, {{but rather as a}} document attesting to what Muhammad said at that time and place, early seventh-century Mecca. It is not a transcript, however; our present Quran is the result of an edition prepared under the orders of Uthman... but the search for significant variants in the partial versions extant before Uthman's standard edition, what can be called the sources behind our text, has not yielded any differences of great significance. Those Uthmanic clues are fragmentary, however, and large 'invented' portions might well have been added to our Quran or authentic material deleted. So it has been charged in fact by some Muslims who failed to find in the present Quran any explicit reference to the designation of a successor to the Prophet and so have alleged tampering with the original texts. But the argument is so patently tendentious and the evidence adduced for the fact so exiguous that few have failed to be convinced that what <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> copy of the Quran is in fact what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words.|$|E

I am pro-environment: I think that climate change is a major threat that we need to address. I am pro-free trade: I think we should be concluding new trade treaties rather than pulling out of old ones. I am strong on defense: I {{think we need to}} beef up our military to cope with multiple enemies.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} planned as {{a documentary about}} Thirty Seconds to Mars' creative process while recording their next album, but upon {{the advent of the}} lawsuit, was retooled as a documentary about making that album {{in the face of a}} legal battle that might prevent it from being released. Leto described the film as [...] "a really special, DIY project." [...] He explained, [...] "We all shared a part of our lives that we've never shared on-screen before, a very intimate and personal part of our lives. We take you ... inside the studio, and in our hearts, and in our minds, to share how difficult this point <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> lives—just battling this massive corporation, and fighting for what we believe in."

500|$|Bennett {{wrote his}} first film {{treatment}} in November 1980. In his version, entitled The War of the Generations, Kirk investigates a rebellion on a distant world and discovers {{that his son}} {{is the leader of}} the rebels. Khan is the mastermind behind the plot, and Kirk and son join forces to defeat the tyrant. Bennett then hired Jack B. Sowards, an avid Star Trek fan, to turn his outline into a film-able script. Sowards wrote an initial script before a writer's strike in 1981. Sowards' draft, The Omega Syndrome, involved the theft of the Federation's ultimate weapon, the [...] "Omega system". Sowards was concerned that his weapon was too negative, and Bennett wanted something more uplifting [...] "and as fundamental in the 23rd century as recombinant DNA <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> time", Minor recalled. Minor suggested to Bennett that the device be turned into a terraforming tool instead. At the story conference the next day, Bennett hugged Minor and declared that he had saved Star Trek. In recognition of the Biblical power of the weapon, Sowards renamed the [...] "Omega system" [...] to the [...] "Genesis Device".|$|E

500|$|She {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{the writing of the}} far right American theorist Francis Parker Yockey, in particular his 1962 work Imperium, in which he lamented the defeat of Nazi Germany and blamed it on the influence of Jews in Europe and the U.S. Influenced by Yockey, Christensen came to believe that Aryan culture had reached its [...] "senility phase", personified by the ideologies of Christianity, communism, and capitalism, the belief that all human beings are equal, and the internationalist erosion of the distinct cultures of different races. She also read Oswald Spengler's Decline of the West, however she rejected Spengler's pessimistic view that this decline was terminal, instead opining that the Aryan civilization could be rejuvenated through its adoption of a new religion - Odinism. She deemed Odinism to be a religion that had a natural and intrinsic relationship with what she perceived to be a Northern European race, stating that the [...] "primary source" [...] of the faith was [...] "biological: its genesis <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> race, its principles encoded in our genes." [...] She also believed that this Odinism should use Norse names for the deities rather than Anglo-Saxon or Teutonic ones {{in order to avoid the}} post-war animosity between England and Germany.|$|E
500|$|It also {{received}} praise by IGN's Jeremy Mullin, {{who gave it}} an overall 9 over 10, having had good opinion of the graphics used during the film and how the film expands Fullmetal Alchemists story. The film was compared to The End of Evangelion due to how both titles expand their anime's endings, resulting in a [...] "proper ending" [...] due to the characters' development featured in the film. Mullin also liked the audio from Conqueror of Shamballa, but added {{that some of the}} English voice actors lacked accents. DVD Talk writer Todd Douglass Jr. also liked the film as he was [...] "pleased to report that the story was handled nigh-flawlessly. The inclusion of real world events helps ground the fact that Edward <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> world, but there was just something surreal about that after seeing it." [...] He found the film's ending to be fitting for Fullmetal Alchemist and said it will be well received by fans from the series. While reviewing the special edition DVD, Douglass commented the extras featured in the DVD [...] "are worth the price." [...] However, he also added that [...] "some people just don't care about the extras" [...] and concluded that [...] "this is a strong reissue that could have possibly been better, but is fine just the same." ...|$|E

[...] Accordingly, sinners, themselves, cause their own loss. It is thus proper for people to mourn for their sins and for the evil consequences that they have brought upon their own souls. Jeremiah continues that since free choice <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hands and our own decision prompts us to commit wrongs, it is proper for us to repent and abandon our wickedness, for the choice <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hands.
