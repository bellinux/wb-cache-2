The first train of the morning, departing Bangor at 04:20, and the 19:35 from Amlwch also carried mail {{to and from the}} island. The majority of trains still terminated at Gaerwen.

Comedian Harold Lloyd highlighted the popularity and utility of the system in an extended sequence in his 1924 film Girl Shy, where, after finding one Red Car too crowded, he commandeered another and drove at high speed through the streets of Culver City and Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|The {{third phase}} of Second Avenue Line construction, not {{currently}} funded, is proposed {{to include a}} separate connection between the IND 63rd Street Line and the Second Avenue Line, turning southwest from 63rd Street onto Second Avenue. This connection would allow trains coming from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to run on the Second Avenue Line to Midtown Manhattan and Lower Manhattan. However, the MTA currently {{has no plans to}} run passenger trains through this connection and it would be used only for movements by non-passenger trains, although passenger service could be possible if subway capacity in Queens is increased to accommodate <b>extra</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{terminal}} implements a {{client-server architecture}} with the server {{running on a}} multiprocessor Unix platform. The client, used by end users {{to interact with the}} system, is a Windows application that typically connects directly through a router provided by Bloomberg and installed on-site. End users can also make use of an <b>extra</b> <b>service</b> (Bloomberg Anywhere) to allow the Windows application to connect via internet/IP, or Web access via a Citrix client. There are also applications that allow mobile access via Android, BlackBerry, and iOS. The server side of the terminal was originally developed using mostly the programming languages Fortran and C. Recent years have seen a transition towards C++ and embedded JavaScript on the clients and servers.|$|E
25|$|CrossCountry, {{aspiring}} {{to improve their}} overall network and services, aims to increase services between Sheffield and Leeds. East Midlands Trains also plans to make service improvements to its services between Liverpool and Norwich via Sheffield with two-car Class 158 trains doubling in capacity to four cars. Coupled with newly acquired Class 156 trains, this will lead to an extra 1,500 seats being available each day on this service. Northern, responsible for operating most local services in the Sheffield area, announced in August 2011 that extra services between Sheffield and Manchester Piccadilly would begin in December that year. The Hope Valley Line, which will see an <b>extra</b> <b>service</b> in each direction during the peak evening period, is a key commuter route and currently has a two-hour gap in its evening schedule, which will be filled by the new services.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decreased}} traffic {{caused the}} airport to reduce {{the plans for the}} size of the new terminal, cutting it to [...] and a cost of NOK10 million. NOK2 million was financed through an interest-free loan from the county. To save NOK600,000 in conjuncture tax, it was decided that the terminal would be built by the municipality, as it would then be regarded as a public, rather than private, investment. In late 2000 and early 2001, Widerøe put in a Dash 8-100 with two weekly services to cater week commuters from Eastern Norway. From February 2001, Widerøe terminated the service, but the <b>extra</b> <b>service</b> was partially replaced with a Monday morning service to Oslo by Danish Air Transport, using an ATR 42. The new terminal was opened on 1 August 2001, having cost NOK7 million. By that year, the patronage had fallen to 20,000.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, the Thames Expresss future looked {{positive}} {{as it was}} supplemented with another passenger service that ran from Thames to Frankton to provide a connection with the Night Limited that ran between Auckland and Wellington. [...] This <b>extra</b> <b>service</b> was sometimes a carriage train hauled by locomotives such as the UD class and sometimes a railcar service employing the experimental Sentinel-Cammell steam railcar. [...] However, {{the opening of the}} East Coast Main Trunk Railway through to the Bay of Plenty in 1928 significantly reduced Thames's importance as a terminus. [...] With the introduction of a direct express to the Bay of Plenty, the Taneatua Express, the Thames Express was superfluous and unnecessary, and accordingly ceased to operate. The Night Limited feeder service did not long outlive it, and by 1947, even the mixed trains to Thames had ceased to operate and passenger services to the town were never reinstated in any form.|$|E
2500|$|Murie {{helped to}} enlarge {{existing}} national park boundaries {{and to create}} additional new units. Testimony on the boundaries of Olympic National Park helped to convince President Franklin D. Roosevelt to add the temperate rain forest of the Bogachiel River and Hoh Rain Forest in the Hoh River valley. Lobbying for a natural boundary for the elk of the Grand Teton area, Murie helped to create Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943 (it was upgraded to national park status several years later, then incorporated into the Grand Teton National Park). The Jackson Hole National Monument was especially near to his heart because he had studied the elk in this region {{for a long period}} of time. Before it was distinguished as a national park, Murie and others encouraged John D. Rockefeller, Jr to purchase the land and donate it to the federal government. During this time Murie was unaware that Rockefeller intended to create [...] " [...] a wildlife display" [...] so tourists could easily view wild animals without actually putting in much effort. Murie greatly opposed this measure, believing that it would actually reduce the value and appreciation of nature by making it so available and convenient for people. [...] In his article [...] "Fenced Wildlife for Jackson Hole" [...] he stated that [...] "commercialized recreation has tend more and more to make us crave <b>extra</b> <b>service,</b> easy entertainment, pleasure with the least possible exertion." [...] He believed instead that [...] "national parks were created for preservation in their primitive conditions." ...|$|E
