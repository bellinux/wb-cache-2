40|$|This {{study will}} brief the readers about the {{physical}} layer for a infrared communication system for portable devices, it will discuss the infrared physical layer from few perspectives, e. g: power consumption, link distance, radiation pattern etc. Few vital mathematics equations will be outline briefly along the discussion. It then follows by the infrared emitter and detector analysis. Lastly, it will discuss some relevent method to increase the link distance for more effective system. Infrared light, {{commonly referred to as}} “IR”, is a common, easy-to-use, low power and low-cost media to transmit information. Among the few “wireless” communication choices, IR has the significant advantage of compatibility with hundreds of millions of electronic devices with <b>IR</b> <b>ports</b> (i. e., laptop PCs, PDAs). The vast majority of IR-capable devices are compatible with a set of standards established by the Infrared Data Association, or IrDA®. These standards include guidelines for implementing the IR Physical Layer (IrDA Serial Infrared Physical Layer specification), ensuring that IR communication can be established through free space between two dissimilar devices...|$|R
50|$|Nintendo later {{developed}} an infrared (IR) adapter called the NES Satellite for the NES. Released in 1989, it used infrared {{to extend the}} length of up to four wired controllers, which would plug into {{the base of the}} unit rather than the console. The base could then be positioned anywhere within a certain range of the NES without the need for a cable. However, the extension base still needed a direct line of sight with the NES console; line of sight is a significant limitation of IR technology, requiring a clear space between an <b>IR</b> <b>port</b> and controller.|$|E

40|$|Today, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of electron storage rings delivering synchrotron radiation for general user operation offer a dedicated infrared port. There is growing interest expressed by various scientific communities to exploit the mid-IR emission in microspectroscopy, as well as the far infrared (also called THz) range for spectroscopy. Compared with a thermal (laboratory-based source), IR synchrotron radiation sources offer enhanced brilliance of about two to three orders of magnitude in the mid-IR energy range, and enhanced flux and brilliance in the far-IR energy range. Synchrotron radiation also has a unique combination of a broad wavelength band together with a well defined time structure. Thermal sources (globar, mercury filament) have excellent stability. Because the sampling rate of a typical IR Fourier-transform spectroscopy experiment is in the kHz range (depending on the bandwidth of the detector), instabilities of various origins present in synchrotron radiation sources play a crucial role. Noise recordings at two different <b>IR</b> <b>ports</b> located at the Swiss Light Source and SOLEIL (France), under conditions relevant to real experiments, are discussed. The lowest electron beam fluctuations detectable in IR spectra have been quantified and are shown to be much smaller than what is routinely recorded by beam-position monitors...|$|R
40|$|The Canadian Light Source (CLS) {{storage ring}} has been {{operating}} routinely since commissioning was completed {{in the spring of}} 2004. Beam currents up to 230 mA have been achieved with the single superconducting RF cavity. With steady improvement beam lifetimes (1 /e) of 14 hours at 200 mA and 0. 5 % coupling are now possible. In the last year the vertical tune was increased by 1 integer to produce a smaller vertical beam size in the insertion device (ID) straight sections. This year the horizontal tune will be increased to reduce the beam emittance. The vertical coupling has been reduced both globally and locally using a skew quadrupole response technique. A wide range of photon energies are provided by an initial complement of five IDs and two infrared (<b>IR)</b> <b>ports.</b> The 5 m straights have room for two IDs. The light cones from these IDs are separated by about 1. 5 mrad by “chicaning ” the electron beam in the straights. To date two IDs have been installed in one straight using the chicaning technique.

In LHD IRVBs at Ports 6 -T and 1 -O have been upgraded. Both of the ? 1 micron × 70 mm × 90 mm gold foils have been replaced with ? 2. 5 micron Pt foils of the same area for greater sensitivity (Pt vs Au) and absorption of higher energy photons estimated up to 8. 2 keV. Also the IR cameras have been replaced; an FLIR/SC 500 (? 100 mK, 60 fps, 320 × 240 pixels) <b>IR</b> camera at <b>Port</b> 1 -O with a FLIR/Phoenix (? 16 mK, 345 fps, 320 × 256 pixels) <b>IR</b> camera at <b>Port</b> 10 -O and an AGEMA/THV 900 LW (? 190 mK, 15 fps, 136 × 272 pixels) ] with a FLIR SC- 4000 (? 19 mK, 327 fps, 320 × 256 pixels) <b>IR</b> camera at <b>port</b> 6 -T.

50|$|A {{number of}} devices from vendors such as Samsung, LG and Nokia include a {{built-in}} <b>IR</b> <b>port</b> {{that can be}} used as a remote, while others require a physical attachment, or 'dongle', be connected on to the phone when used as a remote. The dongle is required to convert the electrical control signals from the phone into infra red signals that are required by most home audio visual components for remote control. However it is also possible to implement a system that does not require a dongle. Such systems use a stand-alone piece of hardware called a 'gateway', which receives the electrical control signals from the smartphone in Bluetooth or wi-fi form and forward them on in infra red form to the components to be controlled.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{generation}} of Lego Mindstorms was built around a brick known as the RCX (Robotic Command eXplorers). It contains an 8-bit Renesas (then a part of Hitachi) H8/300 microcontroller as its internal CPU. It included 32K of RAM to store the firmware and user programs. The brick is programmed by uploading a program (written in one of several available programming languages) from a Windows or Mac computer to the brick's RAM via a special infrared (IR) interface. After the user starts a program, an RCX-enabled Mindstorms creation can function totally on its own, acting on internal and external stimuli according to the programmed instructions. Also, two or several more RCX bricks can {{communicate with each other}} through the IR interface, enabling inter-brick cooperation or competition.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for systems that can process queries, {{combining}} both structured data and text. One way to provide such functionality is to integrate information retrieval (IR) techniques in a database management system (DBMS). However, both IR and database research have been separate research fields for decades, resulting in different - even conflicting - approaches to data management. Each DBMS has a component called a "query optimizer", which {{plays a crucial role}} in the efficiency and flexibility of the system. So, for successful integration the IR techniques and data structures, as well as the DBMS query optimizer, should be adapted to enable mutual cooperation. The author concentrates on top-N queries - a common class of IR queries. An IR top-N query asks for the N best documents given a set of keywords. The author proposes processing the data in batches as a compromise between IR and DBMS query processing. Experiments with this technique show that <b>porting</b> <b>IR</b> optimization techniques is (still) not a promising option due to the additional administrative overhead.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple, low-cost, and {{low-power}} alpha-particle detection system for environmental radioactivity monitoring. The system exploits a previuosly-developed high- resistivity-silicon detector with internal amplification capability {{based on the}} bipolar-transistor (BJT) effect and readout electronics based on commercial IC's. Two-dimensional numerical device simulations are adopted to assess the feasibility of the BJT detector as an alpha-particle detector that can be operated, without losing its internal signal amplification capability, with floating base and low collector voltages, so that device technology can be kept simple, very small DC power consumption can be achieved, and a single 5 -V power-supply voltage {{can be used for}} readout electronics and detector biasing. The charge amplification accomplished by the BJT detector allows a single, commercial chip to be adopted, to perform charge preamplification and 20 -bit A/D conversion.

40|$|This {{project has}} been created to study and to solve two goals. The main goal has been {{streaming}} real video from a smartphone to a laptop and the second goal has been to control the airship electronics from the smartphone. To achieve the main goal of the project, firstly has been necessary realize a technologies study to select the better choice. The chosen technology has been to use of wi-fi, mainly due to the high transmission speed. Once the technology has been chosen, an ad-hoc wi-fi network has been created {{to be able to}} transmit wirelessly. After that, it has been necessary to study how to do the sending of the information. The first idea was using the User Datagram Protocol or Transport Control Protocol, at the beginning it seemed a good choice, because of was possible to achieve a communication between the smartphone and the laptop and a camera in record mode application was created. However, when the real video was to be sent to the laptop, it was not possible because it was not way to open the file while it was been created and there was not any temporal file. Then, another possibility had to be studied and it was the use of streamers. The Live 555 Streaming Media is a set of C++ libraries which allows to stream real time from a device to a computer. After the hard work to run this application, it was running fine on the laptop, as well as, the laptop’s webcam was working fine. However, after try to develop a smartphone’s application was discovered that these libraries are not support for Windows Mobile. Therefore, a new way was discovered, the use of DirectShow which is architecture for streaming media, it seemed would work fine, but after the difficulty to compile a code, the smartphone was not detected and there weren’t so much information about how to solve the related problems. Finally, a real time software has been used to stream real video from the smartphone to a laptop. There have been two possibilities, Qik or AtekSoft Web CameraPlus. However, the second one was descarted due to the obligation to pay for use the software. The second goal was studied to develop a serial port application to be used by Infra Red port. However, it was possible that smartphone wouldn’t have <b>IR</b> <b>Port,</b> so a second alternative was studied and it was using the mini USB connection to achieve through a mini USB to USB adapter and an USB to serial port converter to communicate using serial port communication, but this possibility was not support by Windows Mobile. Then, a possible solution is described, it is using the smartphone like an USB device {{and on the other side}} (electronics) the use of an USB host and through drivers allows the communication. The smartphone used has been HTC Touch 3 G which uses Windows Mobile 6. 1 Operative System. The laptop used has been Dell XPS M 1330, which uses Windows Vista Operative System the programming software has been Visual Studio 2008. In conclusion, the project has helped me to improve knowledge, on the one hand in my studies and on the other hand in my foreign language. It has been a good experience to work in a real project in the RDC department...|$|E
