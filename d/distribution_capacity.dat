2500|$|A new Rural Electrification Decree was {{approved}} in 2005 (...) [...] This new decree aims at increasing rural access through the extension and densification of electric networks, development {{of renewable energy}} and {{a change in the}} energy mix (substitution of diesel by natural gas, biomass and other renewable energies) and an increase in <b>distribution</b> <b>capacity.</b> The Rural Electrification Decree and its associated regulatory framework encourages stakeholders in the energy sector to establish partnerships with other government agencies to implement the rural electrification plan. An agreement between the Ministry of Public Works, Services and Housing and the Ministry of Education will allow for the installation of solar PV systems in rural areas in conjunction with the literacy program, “I can” (Yo, sí puedo). Under the pilot phase, 500 solar panels are expected to be installed.|$|E
2500|$|The move to Nuclear Blast was {{controversial}} {{among many}} black metal enthusiasts who pertained to {{the tenets of}} an 'underground black metal scene', however Gorgoroth sought to utilise Nuclear Blast's <b>distribution</b> <b>capacity</b> for their own ends. The first album recorded and released for Nuclear Blast was Destroyer (1998). New singer Gaahl joined the band at this time, but was heard on only one song, the title track [...] "Destroyer". The music and lyrics on the album were mainly written by Infernus, but guitarist Tormentor also contributed as composer, most notably on the title track, and former vocalist Pest wrote the lyrics on 4 tracks. In May 1998, Gorgoroth played five dates in Germany on Cradle of Filth's European tour, with support from Old Man's Child and Einherjer. Gorgoroth also performed at Wacken Open Air in summer 1998, and performed at the Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in Helsinki, Finland, and in Oslo, Norway with Gehenna and Dødheimsgard.|$|E

40|$|Modeling the Internet {{is vital}} for network researches. Recent {{measurement}} studies on the Internet topology show that the degree distribution obeys the power-law distribution. However, only the degree distribution does not determine the performance of network control methods. As previous studies have shown, one of important factors to characterize the performance of network control methods in the Internet is a structure of topologies. However, other characteristics, which are even more important, are link capacities and node processing capacities of the network because these characteristics are particular to communication networks. In this paper, we investigate how to model the link capacity in the router-level topologies. We first reveal that the link <b>capacity</b> <b>distribution</b> of ISP’s backbone network in Japan obeys a power-law with exponent - 1. 1. To clarify {{the reason for the}} link <b>capacity</b> <b>distribution,</b> we evaluate throughput of networks having various kinds of link <b>capacity</b> <b>distributions.</b> Our numerical results show that the network with power-law link <b>capacity</b> <b>distribution</b> can accommodate much more traffic than the network with exponential <b>distributions</b> of link <b>capacities...</b>|$|R
30|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of first simulations which provided estimates of entry <b>capacity</b> <b>distributions</b> for different roundabouts, once the probability distributions of the critical headways and the follow-up headways were assumed. A deterministic capacity model was then used for performing many runs; in each run, the values of the contributing parameters were randomly drawn from the corresponding distributions. For the examined roundabouts, simulations with the Crystal Ball software provided the probability <b>distributions</b> of entry <b>capacity</b> when varying the circulating flow. Thus, the results of the analysis were expressed probabilistically, meaning that the probability <b>distributions</b> of <b>capacity</b> at each entry lane rather than the simple point estimates of the performance measure were obtained.|$|R

PescaPeru aggressively overfished the anchoveta, a fish used primarily as material for fishmeal production {{and a key}} element in the Peruvian sea ecosystem, which resulted in record production {{for a couple of years}} but combined with an El Niño event in 1972 led to an absolute collapse that would take over a decade to partially recover. The badly mismanaged agrarian reform resulted in the creation of thousands of capital-poor and mostly uneducated small farmers whose production and <b>distribution</b> <b>capacities</b> fell substantially short of the pre-reform production. This, coupled with the trade restrictions, led to periodic shortages, rationing, and increased social unrest..|$|R

5000|$|In 1899, the Berliner Elektrizitäts-Werke (BEW), a Berlin {{electrical}} utility, {{decided to}} greatly increase its <b>distribution</b> <b>capacity</b> by switching to 220 volt nominal distribution, {{taking advantage of}} the higher voltage capability of newly developed metal filament lamps. The company was able to offset the cost of converting the customer's equipment by the resulting saving in distribution conductors cost. This became the model for electrical distribution in Germany and the rest of Europe and the 220-volt system became common. North American practice remained with voltages near 110 volts for lamps.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} years of {{operation}} the water was routed through the system's two earlier-built reservoirs, Dalecarlia and Georgetown, which were designed to settle sediment out of the water. In 1873 the Army began construction of a new water supply tunnel, known as the Washington City Tunnel, to provide more storage, sedimentation and <b>distribution</b> <b>capacity</b> for the system. Construction of the tunnel was halted in the 1880s due to a variety of problems including funding shortages, cost overruns, bribery and fraud associated with the construction process. During that period some improvements were made to the Dalecarlia portion of the system, and work on the tunnel finally resumed in 1898. The tunnel was completed in 1901 and the McMillan Reservoir began operation in 1902.|$|E
