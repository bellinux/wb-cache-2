5|$|Beecher {{enjoyed the}} company of women, and rumors of extramarital affairs {{circulated}} as early as his Indiana <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was believed to have {{had an affair with}} a young member of his congregation. In 1858, the Brooklyn Eagle wrote a story accusing him of an affair with another young church member who had later become a prostitute. The wife of Beecher's patron and editor, Henry Bowen, confessed on her deathbed to her husband of an affair with Beecher; Bowen concealed the incident during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|When {{he scored}} his debut hundred, Bangladesh's Mohammad Ashraful became the {{youngest}} player to score a century in Test cricket, {{at the age of}} 17 years and 61 days. Adam Voges is the oldest player to have done so, aged 35 years and 243 <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> scored 130 not out for Australia against the West Indies in June 2015. The 100th player to score a century on Test debut is South African Stephen Cook, who scored 115 against England in Centurion in January 2016. The most recent player to score a century on debut is the English batsman Keaton Jennings.|$|E
5|$|Barrow became {{manager of}} the Boston Red Sox in 1918. As the team lost many of its better players during World War I, Barrow {{encouraged}} owner Harry Frazee to purchase Stuffy McInnis, Wally Schang, Bullet Joe Bush, and Amos Strunk from the Philadelphia Athletics for $75,000 ($ in current dollar terms). During the season, Barrow feuded with his assistant, Johnny Evers, who undermined Barrow's leadership. The Red Sox won the 1918 World Series. Recognizing that star pitcher Babe Ruth was also a great power hitter, Barrow had Ruth pinch hit on <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wasn't scheduled to pitch. When Ruth told Barrow that he could only pitch or hit, Barrow decided that Ruth's bat was more useful than his pitching, and transitioned him from a pitcher into an outfielder.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1960–61 NBA season, Robertson {{made himself}} {{eligible}} for the 1960 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals as a territorial pick. The Royals gave Robertson a $33,000 signing bonus, {{a far cry from}} his childhood <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was too poor to afford a basketball. In his rookie season, Robertson averaged 30.5 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.7 assists (leading the league), almost averaging a triple-double for the entire season. He was named NBA Rookie of the Year, was elected into the All-NBA First Team – which would happen in each of Robertson's first nine seasons – and made the first of 12 consecutive All-Star Game appearances. In addition, he was named the 1961 NBA All-Star Game MVP following his 23-point, 14-assist, 9-rebound performance in a West victory. However, the Royals finished with a 33–46 record and stayed in the cellar of the Western Division.|$|E
5|$|Since {{their first}} {{competitive}} match, more than 750 players {{have made a}} competitive first-team appearance for the club, {{many of whom have}} played between 25 and 99 matches. Dimas, Tahar El Khalej and Nemanja Matić all fell one short of 100 appearances, as they all moved elsewhere while the season was ongoing. Four former players went on to be first-team managers: Cosme Damião, Ribeiro dos Reis, Vítor Gonçalves and Cândido Tavares. Hugo Leal, who appeared 41 times for the club, is the youngest player to have played for Benfica. He was 16 years and 335 <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> played against Sporting de Espinho on 20 April 1997. Axel Witsel and Ederson hold the club record sale at €40 million each, while Raúl Jiménez is the record purchase at €21.8 million. Nemanja Matić is the only player listed to have been selected as Primeira Liga Player of the Year. Of the players still at the club, Raúl Jiménez is the closest to 100 appearances; he has played in 94 matches.|$|E
5|$|When the German {{offensive}} had begun, Hill {{had been}} in hospital, undergoing reconstructive plastic surgery; this meant that {{he was unable to}} join the 3rd Parachute Brigade for two <b>days.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> had recovered, however, he and his batman were flown to the Ardennes {{and he was able to}} rejoin the brigade. The 5th Parachute Brigade launched several attacks against German positions in the village of Bure, which resulted in heavy British casualties, and both brigades conducted a large number of offensive patrols. The 3rd Parachute Brigade did not see any action, as those German units occupying positions opposite to it withdrew without fighting. By the end of January, however, the division was transferred back to the Netherlands and set up new positions along the Maas river, where it conducted more patrolling against elements of the German 7th Parachute Division, which held positions on the other side of the Maas. These operations came to an end in late February, when the 6th Airborne Division was withdrawn back to England to prepare for a major airborne operation in March.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{his earlier}} <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> played works in {{progress}} at gatherings of The Five, Balakirev composed in isolation.

The poem was started in 1802 following the publication of Southey's epic Thalaba the Destroyer. After giving up on the poem for a few years, he returned to it after prompting by the poet Walter Savage Landor encouraged him to complete his work. When it was finally published, it sold more copies than his previous works.|$|E
