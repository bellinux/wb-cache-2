50|$|The <b>double-striped</b> <b>thick-knee</b> (Burhinus bistriatus) is a stone-curlew, a {{group of}} waders in the family Burhinidae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>double-striped</b> <b>thick-knee</b> eats large {{insects and}} other small {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate prey. It is sometimes semi-domesticated because of its useful function in controlling insects, and has benefited from the clearing of woodlands to create pasture.|$|E
50|$|The <b>double-striped</b> <b>thick-knee</b> is {{striking}} in flight, {{with a white}} patch on the dark upperwing, and a white underwing with a black rear edge. However, it avoids flying, relying on crouching and camouflage for concealment. The song, given at night, is a loud kee-kee-kee.|$|E
50|$|The <b>double-striped</b> <b>thick-knee</b> is a medium-large wader with {{a strong}} black and yellow bill, large yellow eyes, which give it a reptilian appearance, and cryptic plumage. The {{scientific}} genus name refers to the prominent joints in the long greenish-grey legs, and bistriatus to the two stripes of the head pattern.|$|E
50|$|The river's {{upper reaches}} form the {{northern}} {{border of the}} Carara Biological Reserve. It is a habitat for American crocodiles, while the marshes located at the river's mouth have many waterfowl and wading birds. Among the many herons and egrets are the boatbill and bare-throated tiger heron, and other birds found here include <b>double-striped</b> <b>thick-knee,</b> mangrove warbler and American pygmy kingfisher.|$|E
50|$|The Ireng River {{region is}} home to such reptile species as the Antilles Leaf-toed Gecko (Hemidactylus palaichthus)and Rainbow Whiptail (Cnemidophorus lemniscatus); {{amphibians}} such as The Sapo Dorado (Bufo guttatus) and Leptodactylus bolivianus; birds including The Muscovy Duck (Cairina moschata), The Black Vulture (Coragyps atratus), The Southern Crested Caracara (Caracara plancus), The <b>Double-striped</b> <b>Thick-knee</b> (Burhinus bistriatus)and numerous other; mammals include The South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris),jaguar (Panthera onca) and the red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta leporina).|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{reptiles}} and amphibians. Snakes include fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), palm pit-vipers (Bothriechis species), coral snakes (Micrurus genus), boa constrictors (Boa constrictor) and bushmasters (Lachesis muta). There are many green iguanas (Iguana iguana) and tegus lizards (Tupinambis genus).486 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, a reltively low number for the Amazon region.They include the endemic grey-legged tinamou (Crypturellus duidae), crestless curassow (Mitu tomentosum), <b>double-striped</b> <b>thick-knee</b> (Burhinus bistriatus), oilbird (Steatornis caripensis), tawny-tufted toucanet (Selenidera nattereri), Orinoco piculet (Picumnus pumilus), Yapacana antbird (Myrmeciza disjuncta), grey-bellied antbird (Myrmeciza pelzelni), spot-tailed nightjar (Hydropsalis maculicaudus), azure-naped jay (Cyanocorax heilprini), and white-naped seedeater (Dolospingus fringilloides).|$|E
50|$|Burhinus {{are mainly}} silent during the day, with the {{majority}} of call occurring during the night. Their call is penetrating and far-carrying and has been described as eerie, mournful and plaintive. They can produce remarkable vocal performances including wailing and whistling. Eurasian stone-curlews often make short sharp notes like oyster-catchers (Haematopodidae), which are repeated, accelerating to up more prolonged curlew like calls and then dies away. Senegal stone-curlew is more nasal; while the <b>Double-striped</b> <b>thick-knee</b> produces shorter but still strident calls. Peruvian Stone-curlews are locally called ‘Huerequeque” which is a transliteration of their voice, while the Aborigine name for Bush stone-curlew is “Willaroo” which is onomatopaeic to the long drawn out whistling scream. Several individuals will join in a prolonged chorus, especially at the beginning of breeding season.|$|E
5000|$|Location of Burhinus’ nests {{can vary}} {{and may be}} near {{vegetation}} or out in the open. The nest usually consists of a simple scrape that is sometimes lined with stones or shells. [...] Placement of nest site in different habitats such as heath-land or farmland can vary {{from year to year}} by the same pairs. If the vegetation becomes too tall, as can occur if nesting occurs within a crop, Burhinus will abandon the nest site. Senegal thick-knee will use grit, straw, wood and shells to line its nest, while Spotted thick-knee uses smaller animal dung and vegetation to line the nest. <b>Double-striped</b> <b>thick-knee</b> may also use dung to line their nest. Water thick-knee will use more lining than other species and usually place the nest near a piece of driftwood or vegetation, sometimes on elephant dung. [...] Bush stone-curlews nest under trees of open woodland with understorey of short sparse or lush grass, often near dead timber.|$|E

Electroretinograms (ERGs) were obtained from anesthetized live birds at different light intensities in photopic and scotopic conditions, and the retinae were subsequently processed for histological analysis. The scotopic ERG b-waves of B. bistriatus, at all light intensities, were always of larger amplitude than those of V. chilensis. However, the a-waves of both species were of similar amplitude.

The scotopic ERG b-waves of B. bistriatus, at all light intensities, were always of larger amplitude than those of V. chilensis. However, the a-waves of both species were of similar amplitude. Under photopic conditions, V. chilensis yield highest a- and b-wave amplitudes than B. bistriatus. The latter has a larger dialated pupil diameter and a greater axial length/equatorial diameter ratio than V. chilensis. Likewise, the rod density of B. bistriatus significantly exceeds that of V. chilensis. In the latter, cone density tends to be higher than in B. bistriatus while the rods:cones ratio were lower. Rod outer segments of B. bistriatus strongly exceed in length those of any other Charadriiformes species studied so far, but are thinner than those of V. chilensis. In contrast, the latter has thicker cone outer segments and outer and inner plexiform layers than B. bistriatus. Similarly, ganglion cells are more abundant per unit area in V. chilensis. Our combined results reveal a higher retinal sensitivity of B. bistriatus under low light conditions, in accordance with their crepuscular and nocturnal foraging strategies. V. chilensis, although mainly active during daylight, appears to have a moderate retinal sensitivity under low light conditions. Thus, we conclude that Southern Lapwings present visual adaptations that enable them to function in nocturnal as well as in diurnal conditions...|$|E
