500|$|Nagy {{said it was}} {{important}} that the screenplay remained authentic to the early 1950s. [...] "There was a different protocol then, a different etiquette, a different way people related to each other physically", she said. [...] "It does you no service to spoon-feed a contemporary audience their own emotional codes and value systems." [...] While various directors and investors had input in the script throughout the long gestation period, Nagy rejected recurrent suggestions that Carol or Therese [...] "should feel guilty about being gay and suffer some kind of breakdown scene about it." [...] "What I knew <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the adaptation", Nagy said, [...] "was that Pat's lack of psychologizing about Carol and Therese's sexual attraction and ultimately their love, had to be maintained. It could not be corrupted by an impulse to indulge in any number of dramatic narrative cliches about guilt concerning one's sexuality or the like." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first leg}} {{took place at}} Celtic Park on 13 March 2003. This clash was again billed as the [...] "Battle of Britain". Before kick off, Gerry Marsden led both sets of {{supporters}} in a rousing version of [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone". Celtic then started the match on the attack, John Hartson hitting the crossbar after only 12 seconds. Henrik Larsson, in his first match back after recovering from a broken jaw, then opened the scoring after 100 seconds, netting from close range. Emile Heskey equalised for Liverpool on 16 minutes, latching on to a John Arne Riise cross from the left and shooting past Rab Douglas from a tight angle. The match finished at 1–1, with the away goal giving Liverpool the advantage <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> their home tie at Anfield. Liverpool player El Hadji Diouf spat at a Celtic supporter during the match, and was later fined £5,000 at Glasgow's Sheriff Court for the incident.|$|E

Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic also praised the episode, calling it [...] "one of its most entertaining episode's yet".

She said, [...] "This partnership just keeps getting better and the visual {{of the two of them}} in bio-hazard suits was so comical. I look forward to more of these two as the show continues". She was also [...] "glad" [...] that Dr. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) had a bigger role, summarising that the [...] "character interaction sells this show". Like Banov, Orlando praised Hendricks guest role, saying it was [...] "lovely" [...] and that [...] "she and real life husband Geoffrey Arend had a sweet sort of chemistry".

500|$|After Germany resumed {{unlimited}} submarine {{warfare in}} early 1917, many considered U.S. {{entry into the}} war inevitable, though Borah expressed hope it might still be avoided. Nevertheless, he supported Wilson on legislation to arm merchant ships, and voted in favor when the president requested {{a declaration of war}} in April 1917. He made it clear that in his view, the U.S. was <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> defend its own rights and had no common interest with the Allies beyond the defeat of the Central Powers. He repeated this often through the war: the United States sought no territory, and had no interest in French and British desires for territory and colonies. Borah, though a strong war supporter, was possibly the most prominent wartime advocate of progressive views, opposing the draft and the Espionage Act of 1917, and pressing Wilson for statements of limited war aims. Borah's term was to expire in 1919; never a wealthy person and hard-hit by the high cost of living in wartime Washington, he considered leaving the Senate and practicing law in a major New York firm. However, he felt needed in the Senate and in Idaho, as both of the state's seats would be up for election in November 1918 due to the death of Borah's junior colleague, James H. Brady. Even President Wilson urged Borah's re-election in a letter to former senator Dubois. [...] Borah received two-thirds of the vote in his bid for a third term, while former governor Gooding narrowly won Brady's seat. Nationally, the Republicans retook control of the Senate with a 49–47 majority.|$|E
2500|$|The crisis {{over the}} {{increasing}} European-American {{presence on the}} northern Great Plains caused growing dissension among the various Lakota bands as they debated what to do.

[...] A portion led by Lame Deer chose to remain out. [...] Lone Horn struggled to maintain dialogue between the various factions of Minneconjou and their relatives, part of his long record as a Lakota diplomat. After Lone Horn died in 1875, the mantle of leadership fell to his son, just as the US Army was beginning its campaign against the non-treaty Cheyenne and Lakota bands.|$|E

She used to sashay down the corridor and I was quite taken by her. She was very erudite and she made documentaries on flamenco.

2500|$|Opeth {{were signed}} by Candlelight without a demo. For them, {{to go into}} the studio to record a demo was as big a step as <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> record an album. Åkerfeldt explained, [...] "We didn't have any money to spend on things like that. That would cost us, at least, a couple of hundred bucks... We didn't know where to go to record a demo." [...] Åkerfeldt had sent out {{rehearsal}} tapes to several labels, but never received a reply. But the band received an offer from Lee Barrett to record an album. Åkerfeldt found it [...] "quite weird". Anders Nyström (of Katatonia) said Candlelight was interested, based on a rumor from Samoth (of Emperor). Samoth had sent out a tape of unsigned bands to Barrett at Candlelight. It only had a few seconds of [...] "The Apostle in Triumph". Barrett liked it so much he wanted to sign the band. Later, Åkerfeldt received a call from Barrett, who wanted to release a full-length album by Opeth.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 24, Strahorn sought {{adventure}} and fame in the Great Sioux War of 1876 as a war correspondent for the New York Times, Chicago Tribune and the Rocky Mountain News. Strahorn was embedded with General George Crook’s Big Horn and Yellowstone Expedition {{for over a year}} and reported the people and events of the Great Sioux War to the public. [...] “I insisted that I was <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> fight. It was my business as a correspondent to get the news, and I couldn’t think of getting it from the rear.” At the time, war correspondents rode into battle with the troops. [...] General Cook said, “Strahorn worked as well with his rifle as with his pen.” [...] Strahorn was commended by Secretary of War for distinguished bravery and gallantry in action against hostile Indians during the Great Sioux War. Strahorn fought and reported the Horsemeat March, Battle of Powder River, Battle of the Rosebud, Battle of Slim Buttes, Dull Knife Fight and Battle of Wolf Mountain. [...] Strahorn also reported the Battle of the Little Big Horn and witnessed the surrender of Crazy Horse at Fort Robinson on May 6, 1877.|$|E

When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E

2500|$|Mozart himself, {{during his}} short stay in Dresden, {{was an almost}} daily visitor to the Körners' house. For the charming and witty Doris he was all aflame and with his south German vivacity he paid her the naïvest compliments. He {{generally}} came shortly before dinner and, after he had poured out a stream of gallant phrases, he sat down to improvise at the pianoforte. In the next room the table was meanwhile being set and the soup dished up, and the servant announced that dinner was served. But who could tear himself away when Mozart was improvising! The soup was allowed to grow cold and the roast to burn, simply {{so that we could}} continue to listen to the magic sound which the master, completely absorbed in what he was doing and unaware {{of the rest of the}} world, conjured from the instrument. Yet one finally grows tired even of the highest pleasures when the stomach makes known its demands. After the soup had grown cold a few times while Mozart played, he was briefly taken to task. [...] "Mozart", said Doris, gently laying her snow-white arm on his shoulder, [...] "Mozart, we are <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> dine; do you want to eat with us?" [...] But it was precisely Mozart who never did come; he played on undisturbed. Thus we often had the rarest Mozartian musical accompaniment to our meal, Doris concluded her narrative, and when we rose from table we found him still sitting at the keyboard.|$|E
2500|$|Jarrett {{played his}} first {{international}} for Wales on 15 April 1967 against England, aged eighteen years. [...] He {{had been selected}} at full back {{even though he had}} never played senior rugby in that position. [...] Newport were asked to play him at full back against Newbridge on the weekend before the international to give him some experience. [...] He {{did not seem to be}} much of a success in his new position and at half time, his captain David Watkins, switched him to centre. The following week Jarrett played in his first international and scored a breathtaking try. [...] England won a line-out in their own 25 (as it was then). [...] The ball was passed down the line to English centre, Colin McFadyean, who kicked towards the halfway line. [...] The ball bounced once and was seemingly <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> touch. [...] Instead, Jarret sprinted onto the ball, taking it without breaking stride. He sprinted down the touchline, outflanking the whole of the astonished England defence, to score in the left corner. [...] He converted his own try from just inside the touchline. Besides scoring a try, he kicked two penalty goals and five conversions for a total of 19 points. [...] His performance on the field was so impressive that the match has been known ever since as the Keith Jarrett match and he made the cover of Rugby World magazine two months later. The try has been voted seventh in a poll of the top ten Welsh tries and he is listed on the Welsh Rugby Union Official Website as the scorer of the [...] "Greatest Ever Welsh try".|$|E

[...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and get out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E
