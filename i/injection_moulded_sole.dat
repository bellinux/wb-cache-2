For designing <b>soles</b> and <b>injection</b> <b>moulds</b> for <b>soles,</b> various dedicated CAD/CAM systems have been developed, such as: Delcam Shoe Solution (3 D), Delcam PowerSHAPE-e (2 D and 3 D), Padsy II (2 D) and Padsy III (3 D), Shoemaster System (2 D and 3 D), Lectra System (2 D and 3 D), Parmel System (2 D) and ATOS II System (3 D). These systems are equipped with colour displays, plotters, digitizers, terminals and other equipment dedicated for computer aided design activities. Designing 3 D soles models using computer systems enables the prevention of ambiguities inherited from 2 D drawings, thus reducing errors and remanufacturing. Depending on the design complexity of soles, the technical means available for copying shoe soles and the technologies at the disposal of the soles manufacturers, <b>soles</b> and <b>injection</b> <b>moulds</b> designers adopt various design methods. Not all CAD/CAM systems are accessible for all users, because often their purchasing costs are high.

Design/methodology/approach: Powder metallurgy, powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding,</b> sintering, microstructure examination, symulation of <b>injection</b> <b>moulding.</b> Findings: Simulation of powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> was preceded by the rheological tests, which made obtaining possible of the data indispensable for modelling, pertaining to the polymer-powder slurry viscosity. The portion of particles reinforcing the composite is usually lower than powder portion in mixtures used for forming and next binding agent degradation and sintering. The big powder portion is often the reason for the high viscosity of the mixture and problems with its forming. However, simulation results revealed that the fabricated polymerpowder mixture may be injected, which was confirmed by carrying out powder <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> on a typical Arburg <b>injection</b> <b>moulding</b> machine using in the industry.
