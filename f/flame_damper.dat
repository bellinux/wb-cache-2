50|$|The NR-30 was a single-barrel, short recoil {{operated}} cannon, {{essentially an}} enlarged {{version of the}} 23 mm NR-23 weapon introduced in 1949. It fired a massive projectile (more than twice {{the weight of the}} NR-23's 23 mm shell), requiring a muzzle brake with an integrated <b>flame</b> <b>damper</b> to prevent airframe damage from its firing. Before this gun, the Soviet standard fighter armament was two 23 mm and one 37 mm gun, that were ballistically quite different. The 23 mm was quite powerful, but with a relatively low initial velocity, while the 37 mm was lacking in rate of fire and ammunition reserve.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{pollutant}} regulation {{have led}} to a trend towards lean combustion systems which are prone to thermo-acoustic instabilities. The ability of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to handle complex industrial heavy-duty gas turbines is evidenced during this thesis work. First, LES is applied to an academic single burner in order to validate the modeling against measurements performed at TU Berlin and against OpenFoam LES simulations done at Siemens. The coupling between acoustic and combustion is modeled with the Flame Transfer Function (FTF) approach and swirl number fluctuations are identified changing the FTF amplitude response of the flame. Then, an industrial gas turbine is analyzed for two different burner geometries and operating conditions. The FTF is only slightly influenced for the two operating points but slight modifications of the swirler geometry do modify the characteristics of the FTF showing that a simple model taking only into account the flight time is not appropriate and additional mechanisms are at play. Those mechanisms are identified being the inlet velocity, the swirl and the inlet mixture fraction fluctuations. The latter is caused by two mechanisms: 1) the pulsating injected fuel flow rate and 2) the fluctuating trajectory of the fuel jets. Although the diagonal swirler is designed to provide good mixing, effects of mixing heterogeneities at the combustion chamber inlet occur. Mixture perturbations phase with velocity (and hence with swirl) fluctuations and combine with them to lead to different FTF results. Another FTF approach linking heat release to inlet velocity and mixture fraction fluctuation (MISO model) shows further to be a good solution for complex systems. A nonlinear analysis shows that the forcing amplitude not only leads to a saturation of the flame but also to changes of the delay response. Flame saturation is only true for the global FTF and the gain increases locally with increasing forcing amplitude. Both, the linear and the nonlinear flames, are not compact: flame regions located right next to each other exhibited significant differences in delay meaning that at the same instant certain parts of the <b>flame</b> <b>damp</b> the excitation while others feed it...|$|R
60|$|Hydrogen {{gives rise}} to no {{substance}} that can become solid, either during combustion or afterwards {{as a product of}} its combustion. But when it burns, it produces water only; and if we take a cold glass and put it over the <b>flame,</b> it becomes <b>damp,</b> and you have water, produced immediately in appreciable quantity; and nothing is produced by its combustion but the same water which you have seen the flame of the candle produce. It {{is important to remember that}} this hydrogen is the only thing in nature which furnishes water as the sole product of combustion.|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis is}} made of combustion instabilities of three combustor configurations. The equations governing aeroacoustics and combustion are derived, arriving at an acoustic analogy {{in terms of the}} pressure and total enthalpy. A solution for the acoustic analogy is determined in terms of a Green's function and initial instability results are presented for the pressure Green's function. These predictions are limited by assumptions made about the combustion zone. Finally a `reduced complexity' equation is derived accounting for a generalised combustion zone. The equation is nonlinear and furnishes limit cycle solutions for finite amplitude burner modes. It is a generalisation to combustion flows of the Fant equation used to investigate the production of voiced speech (G Fant. Acoustic Theory of Speech Production. Mouton, The Hague, 1960). The Fant equation governs the unsteady volume flow past the flame holder which, in turn, determines the acoustics of the entire system. The equation includes a fully determinate part that depends on the geometry of the flameholder and the thermo-acoustic system, and terms defined by integrals involving thermo-aerodynamic sources, such as the flame and vortex sound sources. Illustrative numerical results are presented for both the linearised equation and the full nonlinear equation. The linearised equation governs the growth rate of the natural acoustic modes, which are excited into instability by unsteady heat release from the <b>flame</b> and <b>damped</b> by large scale vorticity production and radiation losses. The full nonlinear equation, however, governs the `limit cycle' formation when absorption of sound by vortex shedding at trailing edges equally opposes sound generation by the flame. Limit cycle modes are of particular interest because they cannot be captured in linear predictions and are the primary source of combustor instabilities.
