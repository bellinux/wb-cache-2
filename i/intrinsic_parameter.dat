5000|$|When {{introducing}} the iPhone 4, Steve Jobs said {{the number of}} pixels needed for a Retina Display is about 300 PPI for a device held 10 to 12 inches from the eye. One way of expressing this as a unit is pixels-per-degree (PPD) which takes into account both the screen resolution and the distance from which the device is viewed. Based on Jobs' predicted number of 300, the threshold for a Retina Display starts at the PPD value of 57 PPD. 57 PPD means that a tall skinny triangle with a height equal to the viewing distance and a top angle of one degree will have a base on the device's screen that covers 57 pixels. Any display's viewing quality (from phone displays to huge projectors) can be described with this size-independent universal parameter. Note that the PPD parameter is not an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>parameter</b> of the display itself, unlike absolute pixel resolution (e.g. 1920×1080 pixels) or relative pixel density (e.g. 401 PPI), but {{is dependent on the}} distance between the display and the eye of the person (or lens of the device) viewing the display; moving the eye closer to the display reduces the PPD, and moving away from it increases the PPD in proportion to the distance.It can be calculated by the formulawhere [...] is the distance to the screen, [...] is the resolution of the screen in pixels per unit length, and [...] is the aperture of a cone having the apex on focus, height , and the base in the eye lens [...] - the optical correspondent to a cone inside the eye having the same base and the apex in the other focus, the fovea.

In most works, the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>parameters</b> {{are supposed to be}} constant and the extrinsic parameters (C-arm motion) are deduced either from the orientation sensors of the C-arm or from additional sensors.

40|$|Abstract- A line {{in space}} is {{projected}} to a conic in a central catadioptric image, and such a conic is called a line image. This paper proposes a novel approach to calibrating catadioptric camera and detecting line images simultaneously by using Hough transform. Previous approaches to catadioptric cameras calibration employ the traditional conic detecting or fitting methods for line images, and then use these recovered conics to estimate the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>parameters</b> based on some properties of line images. However, the type of a line image can be line, circle, ellipse, hyperbola or parabola, and in general only a small arc of the conic is visible in the image, which brings novel challenges for conic detection and fitting where traditional conic detecting and fitting methods may fail. As we know, {{the accuracy of the}} estimated <b>intrinsic</b> <b>parameters</b> highly depends on the accuracy of the extracted conics. The main contribution of this work is we show that all line images from catadioptric cameras with the same <b>intrinsic</b> <b>parameters</b> must belong to a family of conics with only two degree-of-freedom, and such a family is called a line image family. Therefore, we present a novel special Hough transform for line images detection which ensures that all detected conics must belong to a line image family related to certain <b>intrinsic</b> <b>parameters.</b> For all possible values of the unknown <b>intrinsic</b> <b>parameters,</b> the line image special Hough transform are performed. The one with the highest confidence is chosen as the estimated values for these unknown <b>intrinsic</b> <b>parameters,</b> and the corresponding results of line image detection are chosen as the estimated values for line images. In order to make the searching process more efficient, the hierarchical approaches are employed in this paper. The validity of our proposed approach is illustrated by experiments.
