5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. <b>If</b> <b>held</b> too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E

25|$|Rollerball pens {{employ the}} same ballpoint mechanics, {{but with the}} use of {{water-based}} inks instead of oil-based inks. Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the water-based inks will blot <b>if</b> <b>held</b> stationary against the writing surface. Water-based inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to smearing—posing problems to left-handed people (or right handed people writing right-to-left script)—and running, should the writing surface become wet.|$|E
25|$|Top flight {{basketball}} leagues elsewhere also {{employ a}} playoff system mimicking the NBA's. However, most leagues are not divided into divisions and conferences, and employ a double round robin format akin to league association football, unlike the NBA where teams {{are divided into}} divisions and conferences, which leads to different strengths of schedule per team. Teams are seeded on regular season record. The playoff structure can be single-elimination or a best-of series, with the higher seed, <b>if</b> <b>held</b> the playoffs are not held at a predetermined venue, having the home court advantage.|$|E
25|$|The iPhone 4 {{received}} generally positive reception, with critics praising its revamped {{design and}} more powerful hardware in comparison to previous models.

25|$|In the West, a man often cannot {{acknowledge}} or display {{sexual attraction}} for another man without the homosexual or bisexual label being attached to him. The same pattern of shunning the homosexual identity, while still {{having sex with}} men, is prevalent in the non-West, where sexual attraction between men is often seen as a universal male phenomenon—and practised, either quietly or openly—even <b>if</b> <b>held</b> morally wrong in the larger society, sexual attraction between men being seen as a universal male quality, not something limited to a minority.|$|E
25|$|The image {{can be read}} as a petrified {{synthesis}} of all the stages during and after the Descent from the Cross: the lowering of the corpse, the Deposition, Lamentation and the Entombment. Christ's feet appear to be still nailed together, while the spread of His arms retains the position of His body on the Cross. Christ's body is shown as <b>if</b> <b>held</b> out for the concentrated gaze of the viewer. Joseph of Arimathea looks across the body towards the skull of Adam. Joseph appears as a sumptuously dressed burgher and has the most portrait-like appearance of the figures in the painting; his gaze links the hands of Christ and his mother, the new Adam and Eve, with the skull of Adam. Thereby visualising the essence of the Redemption.|$|E
25|$|For {{things that}} may be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text {{on a piece of paper}} appears reversed <b>if</b> <b>held</b> up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|E

500|$|There are two {{shooting}} modes: Precision and Slingshot. In Precision, players {{control the}} shot by sliding their {{fingers along the}} bottom of the screen, which calculates the arc and direction of the shot. In Slingshot, like Angry Birds, players draw back their shots like slingshots. The shot grows in power the longer the screen is held, and the shot is fired when the player lets go. Weak shots will also arc down with gravity, and strong shots will decrease in power <b>if</b> <b>held</b> too long. There are no power-ups, no gamified micropayments, and no pause function, but there are achievements such as living to see the end of the universe.

500|$|Darling {{announced}} that he was taking steps to freeze the assets of Landsbanki in the UK. The Landsbanki Freezing Order 2008 was passed at 10am on 8 October 2008 and came into force ten minutes later. Under the order the UK Treasury froze the assets of Landsbanki within the UK, and introduced provisions to prevent the sale or movement of Landsbanki assets within the UK, even <b>if</b> <b>held</b> by the Central Bank of Iceland or the Government of Iceland. The freezing order took advantage of provisions in sections 4 and 14 and Schedule 3 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, and was made [...] "because the Treasury believed that action {{to the detriment of the}} UK's economy (or part of it) had been or was likely to be taken by certain persons who are the government of or resident of a country or territory outside the UK." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{longer the}} player charges their shot, the more {{powerful}} the projectile becomes. A tap of the button shoots a small, low-impact projectile that disintegrates upon impact. A medium tap, about a second long, creates a larger, persistent triangle that dribbles the ball {{as long as the}} two continue to make contact. The third charge level shoots a large triangle that fires the ball with explosive force. This [...] "slam" [...] can be reversed by an opponent by firing any projectile into the slammed ball. <b>If</b> <b>held</b> for an additional second, the fourth level of a charged shot creates a defensive square barrier for the player to place on the playing field. These square barriers will disintegrate upon absorbing player projectiles. Player triangles that collide with balls or projectiles are knocked back and briefly incapacitated. Many of the game's common actions are named. For instance, players hit by projectiles are [...] "tackled" [...] and projectiles that hit projectiles are [...] "intercepted".|$|E

2500|$|Eric Diep of XXL said, [...] "Oxymoron fits {{as another}} chapter in Q's journey for rap supremacy. It's {{hard to tell}} if Q will take Kendrick's throne off this debut, but you'd {{be hard-pressed to find}} anyone who hasn't already thought about it. The LP ends with [...] "Fuck LA", an outro that embodies both his appeal and {{potential}} to be an even bigger threat in rap." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters said, [...] "Unlike his previous efforts Oxymoron picks a brand of momentum and sticks to it, avoiding the peaks and surprises that have so often signified a ScHoolboy Q project. But once the songs open up, once the mind begins latching onto whatever phrases happen to stand out from track to track alongside the larger personal narrative and getting lost in the blunted haze provided by Mike Will, Sounwave, Alchemist and Nez & Rio among others, it's hard to remain as aloof as initial impressions might feel." [...] Omar Burgess of HipHopDX stated, [...] "Ultimately the good moments are on par with what will be considered 2014's high-water marks, and <b>if</b> <b>held</b> they weren't held to the high standards of Setbacks and Habits & Contradictions, Q's low points would be acceptable from another rapper. Given TDE's ever-increasing appeal, Oxymoron isn't quite an elite offering, but it meets the difficult task of attracting casual fans without straying too far from the formula that attracted ScHoolboy Q's core audience." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "The wonders never cease on this adventurous and street-tough effort, but they never sort themselves well, either, and with accessible highlights like [...] "Blind Threats," [...] "Break the Bank," [...] and [...] "Man of the Year" [...] all bundled toward the end, this LP requires a surprising amount of patience, especially for an album with [...] "featuring 2 Chainz" [...] on its track list." ...|$|E
