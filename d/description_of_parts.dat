This research shows the process followed in the documentation of the cultural heritage of that Canary engineer, especially in the geometric documentation of a machine for cutting grass in waterways presented in England in 1795 after three years researching on theory of machines. The baseline information has been recovered from the Canary Orotava Foundation of History of Science who has spent years collecting information about the Project Betancourt, in particular, planimetric information as well as a small report on its operation and <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> of machine.

40|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of modeling the manufacturing deviations reliably, the existing geometric models, to date, have only considered the exact <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> and assemblies. Yet, the tolerance representation and propagation issues in assemblies are crucial to answer parallel design of product and process queries. Many formal and informal methods have been developed. However, most proved special cases of the ANSI Y 14. 5 M- 82 specification standard. Also, the descriptions provided in actual solid and feature based design modelers are inadequate to ascertain a clear taxonomy of tolerance specifications, neither do they help address the assembly tolerance analysis and/or synthesis issues. The paper purposes to discuss the tolerance representation schemes as well as their underlying philosophies. Then, because tolerance analysis and tolerance synthesis in assemblies are required, among other tasks, to assign functional tolerances, measure the manufacturability and the interchangeability of parts in assemblies, ease tolerance inspection and evaluate costs of alternative assembly sequences, we shall assess deterministic and statistical methods.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of generic shape recognition, in which exact models are not available. We propose an {{original}} approach, in which learning and recognition are intimately linked, as recognition is based on previous observation. The input to our system {{is in the form of}} segmented descriptions of objects in terms of parts. In 2 -D, the shape is incrementally decomposed into parts suggested by curvature sign changes, and for each part an axial description is derived from both local and global information. The parts are organized into a connection hierarchy. For 3 -D objects, we intend to use segmented tridimensional descriptions, the parts being modeled by generalized cylinders. In this case, the connection graph is not necessarily a hierarchy, but can still be used with our algorithms. The part description obtained at this point is still too detailed and fine grained in order to easily categorize and compare shapes. Hence, we use a simplified <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts,</b> capturin [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} support non-visual exploration of graphically represented information. We used a hierarchical structure to organize the information encoded in a relational diagram and designed two alternative audio-only interfaces for presenting the hierarchy, each employing different levels of verbosity. We report on an experimental study that assessed the viability of our proposed approach {{as well as the}} efficiency and learnability of each interface. Our results show that the relational information encoded in a diagram could be non-visually navigated and explored through a hierarchy, and that substituting verbal <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> such information with nonverbal sounds significantly improve performance without compromising comprehension...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of transitive and inverse roles {{is important in}} a range of applications, and is crucial for the adequate representation of aggregated objects, allowing the simultaneous <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> by means of the whole to which they belong and of wholes by means of their constituent parts. In this paper we present tableaux algorithms for deciding concept satisfiability and subsumption in Description Logics that extend ALC with both transitive and inverse roles, a role hierarchy, and functional restrictions. In contrast to earlier algorithms for similar logics, those presented here are well-suited for implementation purposes: using transitive roles and role hierarchies in place of the transitive closure of roles enables sophisticated blocking techniques to be used in place of the cut rule, a rule whose high degree of non-determinism strongly discourages its use in an implementation. As well as promising superior computational behaviour, this new approach is shown to be sufficie [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{fundamental}} book the authors devise {{a framework that}} describes the working of the brain as a whole. It presents a comprehensive introduction {{to the principles of}} Neural Information Processing as well as recent and authoritative research. The books´ guiding principles are the main purpose of neural activity, namely, to organize behavior to ensure survival, as well as the understanding of the evolutionary genesis of the brain. Among the developed principles and strategies belong self-organization of neural systems, flexibility, the active interpretation of the world by means of construction and prediction as well as their embedding into the world, all of which form the framework of the presented description. Since, in brains, their partial self-organization, the lifelong adaptation and their use of various methods of processing incoming information are all interconnected, the authors have chosen not only neurobiology and evolution theory as a basis for the elaboration of such a framework, but also systems and signal theory. The most important message of the book and authors is: brains are evolved as a whole and a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> although necessary lets one miss the wood for the trees...|$|E
