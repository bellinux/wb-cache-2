40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} I provide novel {{arguments}} for the predicative approach to <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> which claims that argument <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are definite descriptions containing a naming predicate (the individual called X). I first argue that modified <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> {{such as the}} incomparable Maria Callas or the other Francis Bacon cannot be handled on the hypothesis that argument <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> have no internal structure and uniformly denote entities. I then discuss cases like every Adolf, which would normally be interpreted as every individual named Adolf and show that the predicative approach to <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> can straightforwardly account for the distribution of a detectable <b>naming</b> component in <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> Finally, I {{address the issue of}} <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> used as common nouns (such as a Rembrandt or the new Madonna) and plural <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> (e. g., the Beatles) and demonstrate that they do not form a homogenous group yet can be clearly distinguished on both syntactic and semantic grounds from <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> involving a detectable naming component...|$|R

The paper examines how the use of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> (personal names, place names, names for institutions) adopted by people of Hungarian minority in Slovakia identifies ethnic identity. <b>Proper</b> <b>names</b> might refer to individual or collective ethnic/language affiliation; they might function as ethnic symbols. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{distinction}} is normally made in current linguistics between proper nouns and <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> By this strict distinction, because the term noun {{is used for}} a class of single words (tree, beauty), only single-word <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are <b>proper</b> nouns: Peter and Africa are both <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> and <b>proper</b> nouns; but Peter the Great and South Africa, while they are <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> are not <b>proper</b> nouns. The term common name is not much used to contrast with <b>proper</b> <b>name,</b> but some linguists have used the term for that purpose. Sometimes <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are called simply names; but that term is often used more broadly. Words derived from <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are sometimes called proper adjectives (or proper adverbs, and so on), but not in mainstream linguistic theory. Not every noun or noun phrase that refers to a unique entity is a <b>proper</b> <b>name.</b> Blackness and chastity are common nouns, even if blackness and chastity are considered unique abstract entities.|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} results of an {{investigation}} of the spoken word retrieval abilities of a patient, BG, with <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> anomia.

Cued retrieval of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> was influenced by age-of-acquisition, although effects of other linguistic variables were not excluded. It is claimed that an explanation in terms of a `continuum of word retrieval difficulty' rather than of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> as `pure referring expressions' can best account for the findings. However, this proposal is unlikely to be able to explain all cases of <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> anomia. Nonetheless, it is suggested that similar findings may be observed in other people with <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> anomia, and that it is necessary for future studies to investigate not only <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> but also common noun retrieval.

5000|$|Because {{they are}} used to refer to an {{individual}} entity, <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are, by their nature, definite; so a definite article would be redundant, and personal names (like John) are used without an article or other determiner. However, some <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> (especially certain geographical names) are usually used with the definite article. These have been termed weak <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> in contrast with the more typical strong <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> which are normally used without an article. Entities with weak <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> include geographical features (e.g. the Mediterranean, the Thames), buildings (e.g. the Parthenon), institutions (e.g. the House of Commons), cities and districts (e.g. The Hague, the Bronx), works of literature (e.g. [...] the Bible), and newspapers and magazines (e.g. The Times, The Economist, the New Statesman).Plural <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are weak.

40|$|A <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> is a {{vocabulary}} {{element of a}} particular language which also belongs to a respective onymic subsystem, thereby acquiring a binary character. <b>Proper</b> <b>names</b> are formed (as a secondary plan of a language) with the background of appellative vocabulary. However, in their formation and use in communication, {{not only are the}} rules of the appellative language code applied but also the rules specific to <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> Two opposing but interrelated tendencies are typical of the position of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> – a continuous interaction of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> with other vocabulary and the whole language system and, simultaneously, a continuous polarisation of the category of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in relation to appellatives. The interaction of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> with other vocabulary relates to the ongoing processes of onymisation (appellative % proprium) and apellativisation (proprium % appellative) with the openness of onymy (the social, historical, cultural as well as the political dimensions of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> present a wide range of possibilities for, e. g. the adoption of exonyms) but, above all, it relates to the social needs of ordinary communication. The polarisation of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in relation to appellatives is, hence, conditioned by the special character of onymic nomination. From this binary interrelationship of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> follows the binary status of the category nomen proprium, i. e. linguistic status and onomastic status. In the analysis of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> and from the methodological standpoint in onomastics, I consider this to be fundamental. That is why, after the older characterisation of onomastics, I have extended the definition of the linguistic status of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> as defined by Kuryłowicz (La position linguistique du nom propre, 1956) to linguistic and onomastic status (Blanár 1976, 1977). These terms will be discussed later...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhile <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in {{argument}} positions {{have received}} a lot of attention, this cannot be said about <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in the naming construction, as in “Call me Al”.

If <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> can <b>enter</b> syntax as predicates, then in argument positions they should have a complex structure, consisting of a determiner and its restriction, like common nouns (cf. “definite description theories of proper names”). Further consideration of the compositional semantics of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in the naming construction also shows that they have another argument slot, that of the naming convention.

40|$|In both {{linguistics}} and philosophy, <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> {{have sometimes}} posed a perplexing problem, as <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> obviously {{belong to a}} system of linguistic signs, and yet they seem to lack 2 ̆ 2 meaning 2 ̆ 2. They do not signify, but they only point. As meaning or sense of a sign is its relations to other signs, with language being a system of the closely interrelated signs, their apparent lack of meaning has made <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> in being isolated from the other signs, look particularly anomalous in a system of linguistic signs. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show, from anthropological perspective, that this particular conception of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> is wrong due to its inappropriate assumptions on language and communication. Anthropological interests in <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> have been largely descriptive, concerning culturally diverse systems of allocation of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> to individual members of a society. However when anthropologists stop to dwell on the nature of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> more theoretically, they have been under strong influences of on-going linguistic and philosophical discussion. Many tend to argue, following Levi=Strauss, that <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> do have meanings, i. e., <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> do not just point, but signify by classifying individuals named and by relating them to the group and society they belong to. In short they try to show, in vain, that <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are actually not 2 ̆ 7 proper 2 ̆ 7 at all. In this paper I examine Levi=Strauss 2 ̆ 7 s unsuccessful attempt to locate <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> within a system of classification, thus to rid them of their anomalous linguistic positions. Another well-known attempt to incorporate <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> into the signifying system of linguistic signs is Russell 2 ̆ 7 s theory of descriptions, where definite descriptions assure <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> of their meaningfulness. By examining Kripke 2 ̆ 7 s refutation of Russell 2 ̆ 7 s theory, <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> will be shown again to resist their incorporation into a signifying system of signs, but I will also show how Kripke, and those who follow his argument, have gone so far as to overemphasize the anomaly of <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> I will argue that both those who try to reduce the anomaly of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> and those who overemphasize it are erred in seeing <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in their signifying or referring relation to the named, i. e., seeing them as a kind of describing of the latter. Instead I will show the relation between <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> and the named is essentially that of ownership, therefore names are signs of indexical nature, not ones of symbolic nature as other nouns are. I will conclude the so-called problem of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> is pseudo problem based on confusing indexical signs with symbolic signs. This will lead us finally to recognize our tendency to overlook or underestimate ontogenetically and philogenetically indexical nature of our language...|$|R

50|$|Words {{or phrases}} derived from <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are {{generally}} capitalized, {{even when they}} are not themselves <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> For example, Londoner is capitalized because it derives from the <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> London, but it is not itself a <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> (it can be limited: the Londoner, some Londoners).

Which of these items are capitalized may be merely conventional.

World-denoting pronouns and domain restriction variables account for the context-dependence of determiner phrases in general.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the most}} popular {{philosophical}} view about <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> says that the only semantically relevant function of these names is the referential function.

40|$|Vocabulary {{knowledge}} {{is a prerequisite}} to successful comprehension for native speakers and second language learners alike. <b>Proper</b> <b>names,</b> a peculiar and diverse group of lexical items, have long {{been the focus of}} discussion in general linguistics but have received practically no attention in second language vocabulary acquisition research. This study is the first attempt to assess whether <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> impact on second language learners' listening ability. First, I examine the question of how <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> can be adequately defined and discuss their semantic, structural, pragmatic and functional properties. I analyze <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in light of the prototype theory and argue that personal, deity and pet names constitute the core of the <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> category. Names of places and enterprises occupy an intermediate position while names of events and artefacts are considered the least prototypical, i. e. peripheral members of the category. After identifying essential properties of prototypical <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> I argue that in a spoken (as opposed to a written) text <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> cannot be considered automatically known items and place high demands on the listeners' cognitive resources. English as a second language (ESL) learners have to bring in a large amount of linguistic and encyclopaedic knowledge in order to cope with <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> in the flow of speech. I propose a 3 -level model of such knowledge: recognition -> categorization -> referent properties. I then subject this model to empirical testing. The first experiment shows that among intermediate to advanced ESL learners the <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> recognition rate is around 60 percent. It is harder for ESL listeners to recognize <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> when the percentage of difficult common vocabulary in the text is high. The participants' proficiency level and the structure of a specific text were also found to affect the ability to recognize unfamiliar names. Well over a third of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are missed, which suggests that in real life listening, ESL learners mistake unknown common expressions for <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> and vice versa. In the second experiment, the participants' comprehension of a news story is tested under two conditions: <b>Names</b> Known (all <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are familiar prior to listening) and <b>Names</b> Unknown (all <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> are unfamiliar). Results indicate that the presence of unfamiliar <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> hinders the intermediate to advanced proficiency learners' comprehension of a short news text as measured by immediate free recall and the ability to evaluate <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> related statements. The effect is local; it concerns comprehension of details, particularly those details that are associated with processing the <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> themselves. The Names Unknown group produced fewer details and more incorrect inferences in their recalls, scored significantly lower on the measure of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> related comprehension, and selfreported a lower amount of comprehension. In contrast, the Names Known group produced more details and fewer incorrect inferences in their recalls, scored much higher on the measure of <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> related comprehension, and self-reported a greater degree of comprehension. The experiment also shows that participants in the Names Unknown treatment were not always able to ascertain from context what the referent of an unfamiliar <b>proper</b> <b>name</b> is, and in cases when they did, they could not extract as much information about the referent as the participants in the Names Known treatment had available. It is evidently unrealistic to expect ESL learners to determine what unfamiliar <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> refer to from context. On average, after 2 - 3 attempts at listening participants in the Names Unknown group were able to extract just over 40 percent of the information about the referents of unfamiliar <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> Also participants' difficulty ratings of experimental tasks confirmed that the presence of unfamiliar <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> definitely makes the text seem harder to understand. The last experiment replicated the findings of the previous one on a larger sample. The Names Known group performed significantly better on open-ended questions and true-false-don't know statements. A substantial effect of unfamiliar <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> on the overall comprehension scores was found. Around 17 {{percent of the variance in}} the scores was accounted for by familiarity/lack of familiarity with <b>proper</b> <b>names.</b> The findings also provide some evidence in support of the claim that a name form that hints at the cognitive category its referent belongs to is less likely to adversely affect comprehension than a form that does not. Unfamiliar <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> contribute to raising the vocabulary threshold in second language listening, which should be taken into account by teachers, test-developers and other TESOL (teaching English to speakers of other languages) professionals...|$|R

The <b>proper</b> <b>names</b> selected by this process supply new contexts which can be used for finding new <b>proper</b> <b>names,</b> and so on. This procedure was applied to a small German corpus (50, 000 words) and correctly disambiguated 65 % of the capitalized words, which should improve when it is applied to a very large corpus. ...|$|R
