However, at the time McNabb was demoted to third string, he was on pace to total 4,156 passing yards for the season, which would have broken the Redskins' all-time {{franchise}} record, and been {{the first time he}} had exceeded the 4,000 yard mark in his career.|$|E

25|$|An {{accident}} {{involving a}} Pan Am plane on December 8, 1963 {{led to the}} FAA's ordering the installation of safety devices on aircraft. The 707, named Clipper Tradewind (N709PA) and operating as Pan Am Flight 214, was in a holding pattern on a flight from Baltimore to Philadelphia when it was last seen <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> flames. It was determined that lightning had ignited vapors in the plane's fuel tanks. As {{a result of the}} disaster, lightning discharge wicks were installed on all commercial airliners. There were 81 fatalities.|$|E

The show would include the highest new entry and (if not featured in the previous week) the highest climber on the charts, and omit any song <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the chart. Tracks could be featured in consecutive weeks in different formats. For example, if a song was played over the chart countdown or the closing credits, then it was acceptable for the act {{to appear in the}} studio the following week.|$|E
25|$|For eight years, Toulon was not {{particularly}} successful and were in heavy financial trouble (a 10 million franc deficit) forced the Ligue Nationale de Rugby to demote them to the Second Division in July 2000. The club missed an immediate return the next year, <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the final to Montauban, as only one club was promoted that year. It took them five more years to do so as RCT {{went on to win}} the Pro D2 title. Unfortunately, despite immense popular support (gates averaged more than 12,000), and a lot of enthusiasm, they only managed to win three games out of 26 and were relegated after only a season.|$|E

She beat Andrea Hlaváčková in the first round, Pauline Parmentier in the second round, 30th seed Roberta Vinci in the third round, and Ekaterina Makarova in the fourth round to reach her fourth career Grand Slam quarterfinal. She lost to Li Na in the quarterfinals. Azarenka {{was the fourth}} seed at the 2011 Wimbledon Championships.

25|$|In {{the first}} week of February the group {{provided}} on-call close air support to US ground forces, directed by P-40 Warhawks of the 71st Reconnaissance Group acting as forward air controllers. On 2 February, it coordinated with SBD dive bombers of Marine Aircraft Group 24 in bombing Japanese positions defending Umingan against attacks by the U.S. 25th Division, then supported the 1st Cavalry Division as it moved into Manila. The mediums then began a campaign against industries and airfields on Formosa, and attacked shipping along the southeast China coast. Tactics evolved in which formations of 36 aircraft bombed from medium altitudes, while low altitude strafing attacks featured four waves of B-25Js flying nine abreast, such as the attack on the Imperial Japanese Navy airfield at Taichū (台中), Formosa, on 2 March. The raid of 2 March illustrates the scope of medium bomber operations in the Western Pacific in 1945: attacks in bombardment wing strength using two groups, each group with its own target, employing a mission force of 72 B-25 bombers, 24 P-51 Mustang fighter escorts, and two OA-10 Catalinas on station for rescue operations. On 20 March, the group attacked a small convoy of warships escorting a large freighter near Amoy, China. Flying abreast in four attack waves totaling 22 Mitchells, each squadron lost a bomber in the brief but vicious combat, with two <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the target area and two others crash-landing at Fourteenth Air Force fields on the Chinese mainland.|$|E

Hull finished 14th in the Third Division in the 1991–92 season, meaning that they would be competing in the new Second Division the following season. In their first season in the rebranded division, Hull narrowly avoided another relegation, but the board kept faith in Dolan and over the next two seasons they achieved mid-table finishes.

500|$|These fights {{were usually}} {{close-up}} and personal, {{with a number}} of shots blasted from pistols, often resulting in innocent bystanders hit by bullets gone wild. Much of the time, {{it would be difficult to}} tell who had [...] "won” the gunfight for several minutes, as the black powder smoke from the pistols cleared the air. How famous gunfighters died is as varied as each man. Many well-known gunfighters were so feared by the public because of their reputation that when they were killed, they died as a result of ambush rather than <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a [...] "blaze of glory". Others died secluded deaths either from old age or illness.|$|E

Although {{the winner of the}} contest is not mentioned, it is implied in [...] "The Puffy Shirt" [...] that George was the winner.

The chance to record a Bond theme appealed to her because [...] "you know it's <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> movie history", and coming from Scotland, like original Bond Sean Connery, [...] "that's very close and inherent in our culture. It's not Bond if it's not Scottish!"

500|$|At home, Lansbury {{served a}} second term as Mayor of Poplar, in 1936–37. He argued against direct {{confrontation}} with Mosley's Blackshirts during the October 1936 demonstrations known as the Battle of Cable Street. In October 1937 he {{became president of the}} Peace Pledge Union, and a year later he welcomed the Munich Agreement as a step towards peace. During this period he worked on behalf of refugees from Nazi Germany, and was chairman of the Polish Refugee Fund which provided relief to displaced Jewish children. On 3 September 1939, after Neville Chamberlain's announcement of war with Germany, Lansbury addressed the House of Commons. Observing that the cause to which he had dedicated his life was <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> ruins, he added: [...] "I hope that out of this terrible calamity will arise a spirit that will compel people to give up the reliance on force." ...|$|E
500|$|Beck, Page, Hopkins, Jones, and Moon {{were pleased}} with {{the outcome of the}} {{recording}} session and there was talk of forming a working group and additional recordings. [...] This led to the famous quip, [...] "Yeah, it'll go down like a lead zeppelin", which Page later used, with a slight spelling change, for his new group. Page ascribed it to Moon, while Beck's and Led Zeppelin's later manager Peter Grant claimed Moon used the phrase [...] "go down like a lead balloon", to which Entwistle added [...] "more like a lead zeppelin". [...] Entwistle, on the other hand, insists that he came up with the name independently along with the idea of using an image of [...] "a Zeppelin <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> flames" [...] for an album cover. Led Zeppelin biographer Keith Shadwick notes that forming an actual group at the time [...] "was never a realistic option", due to existing contractual obligations.|$|E
500|$|... "Time Will Crawl" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Bowie in mid– to late–1986 at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland. He produced the recording alongside David Richards. Lyrically, the song addresses the pollution {{and destruction of}} the planet by industry. Bowie has cited hearing of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 as {{the genesis of the}} lyrics, and was in Switzerland {{at the time of the}} accident. He said, [...] "I was taking a break from recording [...] it was a beautiful day and we were outside on a small piece of lawn facing the Alps and the lake. Our engineer, who had been listening to the radio, shot out of the studio and shouted: 'There's a whole lot of shit <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Russia.' The Swiss news had picked up a Norwegian radio station that was screaming – to anyone who would listen – that huge billowing clouds were moving over from the Motherland and they weren't rain clouds." [...] In another contemporary interview, Bowie said that the song [...] "deals with the idea that someone in one's own community could be the one responsible for blowing up the world." [...] At the time, he also stated that it was his favorite song from the album.|$|E

The inability or failure of the Clinton administration to do anything about the genocide would form her later views on possible military interventions.
