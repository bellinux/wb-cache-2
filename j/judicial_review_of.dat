50|$|The {{efforts of}} the Janata {{administration}} to get government officials and Congress politicians tried for Emergency-era abuses and crimes were largely unsuccessful due to a disorganised, over-complex and politically motivated process of litigation.

5|$|The {{applicant}} then {{appealed to}} the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal construed section 8B(1) {{in accordance with the}} clear legislative intention expressed through the plain wording of the provision. It held that the provision reinstates the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> decisions made or acts done pursuant to the executive's powers under the ISA. In order to determine the law on <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA, it is necessary to ascertain the exact decision laid down in Lee Mau Seng. However, the Court declined to opine whether the Lee Mau Seng decision meant that a detention order cannot be challenged on the basis that it was made for reasons completely outside the scope of the ISA. This was because on {{the facts of the case}} it had not been established that the applicant was re-detained for reasons not contemplated by section 8(1) of the ISA and completely unrelated to national security. Notably, the Court did not decide whether section 8B(2) of the ISA precludes it from reviewing a detention order shown to have been made for purposes other than national security, or whether the 1989 amendments to the ISA are outside the scope of the legislative power conferred on Parliament by the amended Article 149 of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The broad {{heading of}} <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> {{illegality}} may {{be divided into}} two sub-headings. In the first case, the High Court inquires into whether the public authority was empowered to take a particular course of action or make a decision, and, in the other, whether it exercised its discretion wrongly even though it was empowered to act. Where the Court finds that the public authority had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised its discretion wrongly, it may strike down the decision on the basis of illegality.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers.

The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Women {{claiming}} {{refugee status}} in Canada must demonstrate to the Immigration and Refugee Board [IRB] that their claim is valid and plausible. Canada’s legislative framework acknowledges that gender-related persecution can {{qualify as a}} ground for refugee status under the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees [Refugee Convention]. Specifically, the IRB’s Chairperson’s Guideline 4 – Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution [Gender Guidelines] assist IRB decision-makers in deciding gender-related refugee claims by offering options for procedural accommodation and analytical guidance in the evaluation of gender-related claims. The Gender Guidelines aim to ensure decision-makers have “the degree of knowledge, understanding, and sensitivity” needed to make a “fair and correct judgment” of gender-related claims (Griffith v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] FCJ No 1142 (QL)). The purpose of this research is to critically examine the use of the Gender Guidelines in IRB decisions on gender-related refugee claims and Federal Court <b>judicial</b> <b>reviews</b> <b>of</b> those claims. Looking at 166 Federal Court <b>of</b> Canada <b>judicial</b> <b>reviews</b> <b>of</b> gender-related claims of persecution previously rejected at the IRB level from 2003 to 2013, I used a grounded theory methodological basis and content analysis approach informed by Michel Foucault’s insights on power relationships and Judith Butler’s insights on performativity to examine discursive deployment of gender in refugee determinations through the treatment of the Gender Guidelines. I examined four legal standards used in these <b>judicial</b> <b>reviews</b> <b>of</b> gender-related claim determination—credibility assessments, plausibility assessments, availability of state protection, and the availability of an internal flight alternative [IFA]. I analyzed the application of these standards and looked at how variables such as country of origin or type of persecution or extrajudicial factors such as Canadian political discourse and rigid understandings of gender identity result in inconsistent application of the Gender Guidelines, thereby violating women refugee claimants’ right to procedural fairness. Several recommendations are made for changes at both the IRB and Federal Court level to correct identified barriers and to ensure all claims related to gender-related persecution have a full and fair opportunity to provide evidence and have it considered on its merits...|$|R

5|$|In {{the appeal}} against Prakash J.'s {{judgment}} to the Court of Appeal, also called Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1996), {{counsel for the}} appellants argued that the restriction placed by the Minister on the importation, sale and distribution of the Jehovah's Witnesses publications was too wide and disproportionate. Applying an approach similar to that taken in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), the Court of Appeal noted that the appellants were essentially seeking to challenge the view taken by the Minister that Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to carry out National Service {{was a threat to}} national security. The Court regarded this as a non-justiciable issue and declined to allow the appellants to bring an application for <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> Order No. 405/1995.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{subsequently}} {{passed the}} Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989. They took effect on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively. Section8B(1) of the amended ISA provides {{that the law}} pertaining to the <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> decisions made by the President or the Minister was restored to the legal position applicable in Singapore on 13 July 1971, the date when Lee Mau Seng was decided. In Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1990), the Court of Appeal held that these amendments reinstated the legal position set out in Lee Mau Seng as the applicable law governing judicial review in Singapore, thus prompting {{a return to the}} subjective test in reviewing the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 also {{introduced}} section8B(2), {{which is an}} ouster clause providing that no <b>judicial</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> orders made under the ISA shall be available save in relation to questions relating to the procedural requirements of the ISA. In Teo Soh Lung, the Court of Appeal held {{that it was not}} necessary for it to decide if the subjective test in Lee Mau Seng precluded judicial review in the case. Hence, the position remains to be confirmed by the courts. In addition, the Court decided that it was unnecessary to consider the effect of section8B(2) on issues not related to national security and the constitutionality of the 1989 amendments to the ISA.|$|E
