5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of <b>increasing</b> <b>their</b> populations very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee {{is usually a}} last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies.

Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E

5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal political theory of children's education that fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an education that follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual children through <b>increasing</b> <b>their</b> capacity for liberty. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a lacuna between educational policy and liberal political theory.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how debt affects firms following failed takeovers. Using {{a sample of}} 573 unsuccessful takeovers, we find that, on average, targets significantly <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> debt levels. Targets that <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> debt levels more than the median amount reduce their levels of capital expenditures, sell off assets, reduce employment, increase focus and <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> operating cash flows. These leverage-increasing targets also realize superior stock price performance over the five years following the failed takeover. In contrast, those firms that <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> leverage the least show insignificant changes in their level of investment and their operating cash flows and realize stock price performance that {{is no different than}} their benchmarks. Those failed targets that <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> leverage the least, and fail to get taken over in the future, realize significant negative stock returns following their initial failed takeovers. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that debt helps firms remain independent not because it entrenches managers, but because it commits the manager to making the improvements that would be made by potential raiders. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{sea otter}} {{displays}} numerous adaptations to its marine environment. The nostrils and small ears can close. The hind feet, which provide {{most of its}} propulsion in swimming, are long, broadly flattened, and fully webbed. The fifth digit on each hind foot is longest, facilitating swimming while on its back, but making walking difficult. The tail is fairly short, thick, slightly flattened, and muscular. The front paws are short with retractable claws, with tough pads on the palms that enable gripping slippery prey. The bones show osteosclerosis, <b>increasing</b> <b>their</b> density to reduce buoyancy.|$|E

The Luftwaffe with its small, but valuable fleet of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors, could now operate from the same area. From June 1940 onwards, the Battle of the Atlantic began in earnest.|$|E
