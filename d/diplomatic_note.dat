5|$|On 21 December 1979, the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia {{published}} a map entitled Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia showing Pedra Branca {{to be within}} its territorial waters. Singapore rejected this claim in a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> of 14 February 1980 and asked for the map to be corrected. The dispute was not resolved by an exchange of correspondence and intergovernmental talks in 1993 and 1994. In {{the first round of}} talks in February 1993 the issue of sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge was also raised. Malaysia and Singapore therefore agreed to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), signing a Special Agreement for this purpose in February 2003 and notifying the Court of it in July 2003. The case was heard at the Peace Palace in The Hague between 6 and 23 November 2007.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, the {{day before}} the Dunkirk evacuation, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov {{presented}} a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> that accused the Lithuanian government of abducting three Soviet soldiers stationed in Lithuania in accordance with the terms of the mutual assistance treaty. The note alleged that two soldiers had been tortured to obtain Russian military secrets but managed to escape, and that the third, Butayev, was murdered. Earlier in May, Butayev had deserted his unit and was searched by the Lithuanian police. When found, he committed suicide. The Lithuanian government replied that the accusations were baseless, but promised a full investigation of the incident and convened a special commission. However, the commission's requests for detailed information, including interviews, photographs, physical descriptions, or other data that could further the investigation, went unanswered. The official Soviet stance was that Lithuania needed to carry out the investigation on its own and that its requests were an attempt to shift responsibility to the Russians.|$|E
5|$|On September 5, 1920, Polish Foreign Minister Eustachy Sapieha {{delivered}} a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> to the League of Nations asking it {{to intervene in}} the Polish–Lithuanian War. He claimed that Lithuania allowed free passage through its territory for Soviet troops and therefore violated its declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. The next day Lithuania responded with a direct note to Poland in which Lithuanian Foreign Minister Juozas Purickis proposed to negotiate a demarcation line and other issues in Marijampolė. On September 8, during a planning meeting for what later was the Battle of the Niemen River, the Poles decided to maneuver through the Lithuanian territory {{to the rear of the}} Soviet Army. In an attempt to conceal the planned attack, Polish diplomats accepted the proposal to negotiate. The negotiations started on September 16 in Kalvarija, but collapsed just two days later.|$|E

De los Santos alleged that Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi had channeled $200,000 (5 million pesos) to Ramos' 1992 election campaign.|$|E
25|$|On 15/16 March 2004, {{the ship}} entered a {{maritime}} area designated as conservation zones {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Falkland Islands and issued demands for other ships to identify themselves. This prompted a protest from the British government to the Argentine government over its policing of seas under Falkland jurisdiction. The <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> also re-asserted British sovereignty over the islands.|$|E
25|$|The {{second time}} the Soviets helped Kekkonen {{came in the}} Note Crisis in 1961. The most widely held view of the Note Crisis is that the Soviet Union's acted to ensure Kekkonen's reelection. Kekkonen had planned to prevent the parties from forming an anti-Kekkonen {{alliance}} to promote Olavi Honka in the 1962 presidential elections by dissolving parliament. However, in October 1961, the Soviet Union sent a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> demanding common military exercises against the West {{in reference to the}} Finno-Soviet Treaty.|$|E

25|$|The intercommunal {{violence}} in Cyprus prompted Turkey to transmit a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> to United Kingdom. United Kingdom then invited Turkey and Greece {{to a conference}} in London, which started on August 26. The day before the Tripartite London Conference (29 August–7 September 1955) began, Prime Minister Menderes claimed that Greek Cypriots were planning a massacre of Turkish Cypriots. Seeing the opportunity to extricate Britain, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan advised the Turkish delegates {{that they should be}} stern. Foreign minister Fatin Rüştü Zorlu paid heed to Macmillan and launched a harsh opening salvo, stating that Turkey would reconsider its commitment to the Treaty of Lausanne unless Greece reconsidered its position on Cyprus. The Greek delegates, surprised by harshness of the speech, blamed the British.|$|E
25|$|On September 5, 1920, Polish Foreign Minister Eustachy Sapieha {{delivered}} a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> to the League of Nations alleging the Lithuania violated its neutrality and asking {{to intervene in}} the Polish–Lithuanian War. The League agreed to mediate and began its session on September 16. The resolution, adopted on September 20, urged both states to cease hostilities and adhere to the Curzon Line. Poland was asked to respect Lithuanian neutrality if Soviet Russia agreed to do the same. Also a special Control Commission was to be dispatched into the conflict zone to oversee implementation of the resolution. It was clear that the League had only a narrow goal to prevent armed hostilities and not to resolve the underlying territorial dispute. The Lithuanian government accepted the resolution, while Poland reserved full freedom of action in preparation for the attack on the Soviets.|$|E
500|$|On 21 December 1979, the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia {{published}} a map entitled Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia showing Pedra Branca {{to be within}} its territorial waters. Singapore rejected this [...] "claim" [...] in a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> of 14 February 1980 and asked for the map to be corrected. In the late 1980s, Attorney-General of Singapore Tan Boon Teik was despatched by the Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew to disclose the documentary evidence which Singapore had to the Malaysian Attorney-General, to demonstrate the strength of Singapore's case. However, the dispute was not resolved by an exchange of correspondence and intergovernmental talks in 1993 and 1994. In {{the first round of}} talks in February 1993 the issue of sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge was also raised.

50|$|Unlike other {{situations}} regarding border disputes, for the Cadrilater problem no international conference was organized.

500|$|Bird's {{career in}} the Cabinet was ended by scandal in 1990 after a {{shipment}} of Israeli weapons to Antigua and Barbuda were received and then diverted to the Medellín Cartel of Colombian drug dealers. The scandal broke after the Colombian government publicly complained {{about the use of}} Antigua and Barbuda as a trans-shipment point; a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> from the Israeli government revealed that the weapons had been shipped at the apparent express instruction of Bird, who had given assurances {{that they would not be}} passed on to any third parties. The guns were actually ordered as part of a conspiracy by Maurice Sarfati and Yair Klein, who forged documents showing that Sarfati was an authorised representative of the Antiguan government and that the purchase of weapons had been approved by the Antiguan Minister for National Security, though that position did not exist. The plan was to set up a mercenary training camp on Antigua in order to train and supply Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha's Medellin forces. The Prime Minister repeatedly refused to open an investigation, despite demands by community leaders and members of his own government, saying that [...] "conclusive evidence" [...] was needed. An investigation was finally ordered on 25 April, with Bird asking to be temporarily relieved of his position until the inquiry concluded.|$|E

50|$|In the {{following}} three weeks, American President Woodrow Wilson responded to the request for a truce with three <b>diplomatic</b> <b>notes.</b> As a precondition for negotiations, he demanded the retreat of Germany from all occupied territories, the cessation of submarine activities and (implicitly) the emperor's abdication. This last demand was intended to render the process of democratisation irreversible.|$|R

2500|$|In the end, the British {{reply to}} the German move was a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note,</b> {{strongly}} disputing the German claim that Britain was attempting to [...] "encircle" [...] Germany with hostile alliances. The German denunciation and reports of increased German shipbuilding in June 1939 caused by the Z Plan played a significant part in persuading the Chamberlain government {{of the need to}} [...] "contain" [...] Germany by building a [...] "Peace front" [...] of states in both Western and Eastern Europe and raised the perception in the Chamberlain government in 1939 that German policies were a threat to Britain.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 August 2014, a Chinese J-11 fighter {{came within}} 30 {{feet of a}} P-8 around 135 miles east of Hainan Island. The J-11 flew past the P-8's nose and {{performed}} a barrel roll at close proximity. A Pentagon spokesperson said the J-11's unit had made close intercepts earlier that year. The U.S. sent a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> to China about the pattern of behavior by {{the commander of the}} Chinese fighter group. China stated that the claims were [...] "totally groundless", and that the event's root was U.S. surveillance of China; the U.S. stated it will continue to operate in international airspace and waters.|$|E
2500|$|The Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs {{has opened}} to the public two {{documents}} concerning Sugihara's file: the first aforementioned document is a 5 February 1941 <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> from Chiune Sugihara to Japan's then Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka in which Sugihara stated he issued 1,500 out of 2,139 transit visas to Jews and Poles; however, since most of the 2,139 people were not Jewish, this would imply that most of the visas were given to Polish Jews instead. Levine then notes that another document from the same foreign office file [...] "indicates an additional 3,448 visas were issued in Kaunas for a total of 5,580 visas" [...] which were likely given to Jews desperate to flee Lithuania for safety in Japan or Japanese occupied China.|$|E

50|$|As US President Woodrow Wilson did {{not agree}} {{immediately}} to ceasefire negotiations, there was a delay of several weeks. Now, Ludendorff again changed tack and argued in favour of continued fighting and for the exchange of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>notes</b> to be ended.

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, the League was making its final {{decision}} regarding the bitter territorial {{dispute over the}} Vilnius Region between Poland and Lithuania. On February 3, the League decided to divide the [...] wide neutral zone, established {{in the aftermath of}} the Żeligowski's Mutiny in November 1920. Despite Lithuanian protests, the division of the neutral zone proceeded on February 15. In these circumstances, the League decided on an unofficial exchange: Lithuania would receive the Klaipėda Region for the lost Vilnius Region. Already on February 4, the allied ultimatum was replaced by a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> requesting that the transfer of the Klaipėda Region would be orderly and not coerced. On February 11, the Allies even thanked Lithuania for the [...] peaceful resolution of the crisis. To further appease the League, the Simonaitis' Directorate was disbanded on February 15. Viktoras Gailius formed a provisional five-member Directorate, which included two Germans and three Prussian Lithuanians. On February 17, the Conference transferred the region to Lithuania under several conditions to be later formalized in the Klaipėda Convention: the region would be granted autonomy, Lithuania would compensate Allied costs of administration and assume German liabilities of war reparations, and the Neman River would be internationalized. Lithuania accepted and thus the revolt was legitimized. The French and British ships left the port on February 19.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 August 1939, Papen {{presented}} the Turks with a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>note</b> {{that was almost}} an ultimatum threatening the cancellation of all arms contacts and for the Reich to impose economic sanctions if Turkey did not cease leaning towards joining the Anglo-French [...] "peace front". Papen approved of the German-Soviet nonaggression pact, sending Hitler a telegram congratulating him on his [...] "brilliant diplomatic victory" [...] as Papen believed that Britain and France would never go to war for Poland without the Soviet Union; accordingly he drew the conclusion that Germany could now invade Poland without fear of a world war. After the signing of German-Soviet non-aggression pact in Moscow on 24 August 1939, for a moment, the Turks considered giving in. However, the Turks recovered their nerve, and on 26 August 1939 Saracoğlu told Papen that Germany had broken every promise it had ever made to the Turks, {{and he did not}} care if Germany ceased trading with Turkey. On 29 August 1939, İnönü told Papen that Turkey was a sovereign country that nobody would dictate to, and observed that if the Germans did not want Turkish chrome, {{they did not have to}} buy it, with İnönü adding just whom the Germans would buy chrome from was an interesting question that he could not answer. The İnönü-Papen meeting of 29 August 1939 left the ambassador [...] "thoroughly uneasy" [...] and he left the meeting in [...] "acute perspiration" [...] as Germany needed Turkish chrome very badly. As Turkey was the only place in the world that the Germans could buy chrome from after the British blockade came into effect on 3 September 1939, the Turks had called the German bluff, and the threat of severing German-Turkish trade was not put into practice.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} more said between them in the railway carriage, and, as they parted at the door in Berkeley Square, Hugh swore to himself that this should be the last season {{in which he would}} harbor his brother in London.

Then Archie went down to his club, and finally {{arranged}} with Doodles that the first visit to the spy should be made on the following morning.

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid handing them to the Entente Powers, Emperor Karl {{assigned}} the entire Austro-Hungarian Navy, the Austro-Hungarian merchant fleet and all Austro-Hungarian harbours, arsenals and shore fortifications to the National Council.
