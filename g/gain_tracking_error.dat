40|$|A P-type {{iterative}} learning controller (ILC) {{which includes}} a current iteration <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> (CITE) in its high-order updating law is proposed for the tracking control of repetitive uncertain discrete-time nonlinear systems. It is shown that, under relaxed conditions, the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> bounds are class-K functions of the bounds of uncertainty, disturbance and the initialization <b>error.</b> The <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> bound and the ILC convergence rate are tunable by the CITE learning <b>gain.</b> Moreover, the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> bound is {{shown to be a}} class-K function of the bounds of the differences of initialization errors, uncertainties, and disturbances between two successive ILC repetitions.

40|$|Visual {{feedback}} and non-visual information play different roles in tracking of an external target. This study explored the respective {{roles of the}} visual and non-visual information in eleven healthy volunteers who coupled the manual cursor to a rhythmically moving target of 0. 5 Hz under three sensorimotor conditions: eye-alone tracking (EA), eye-hand tracking with visual feedback of manual outputs (EH tracking), and the same tracking without such feedback (EHM <b>tracking).</b> <b>Tracking</b> <b>error,</b> kinematic variables, and movement intermittency (saccade and speed pulse) were contrasted among tracking conditions. The results showed that EHM tracking exhibited larger pursuit <b>gain,</b> less <b>tracking</b> <b>error,</b> and less movement intermittency for the ocular plant than EA tracking. With the vision of manual cursor, EH tracking achieved superior tracking congruency of the ocular and manual effectors with smaller movement intermittency than EHM tracking, except that the rate precision of manual action was similar for both types of tracking. The present study demonstrated that visibility of manual consequences altered mutual relationships between movement intermittency and <b>tracking</b> <b>error.</b> The speed pulse metrics of manual output were linked to ocular <b>tracking</b> <b>error,</b> and saccade events were time-locked to the positional <b>error</b> of manual <b>tracking</b> during EH tracking. In conclusion, peripheral non-visual information is critical to smooth pursuit characteristics and rate control of rhythmic manual tracking.

40|$|An {{experiment}} that examined how {{changes in a}} motion platform drive filter affect pilot-vehicle performance and opinion {{was conducted on the}} NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator. Pilots controlled a simplified helicopter model in the vertical or the directional axis and tracked a randomly moving target aircraft {{in the presence of a}} random disturbance. With both tasks, variations from full motion to fixed-base conditions were made in the high-pass drive filter gain and natural frequency. The results indicate that vertical motion did not affect the open-loop pilot-vehicle target-tracking crossover frequency, but target-tracking phase margins improved with increased filter gain or decreased natural frequency. Vertical disturbance-rejection crossover frequency increased with decreasing filter natural frequency, while disturbance rejection phase margins improved with increasing filter <b>gain.</b> Vertical <b>tracking</b> <b>errors</b> increased significantly when all vertical motion was removed. No significant differences were measured among the directional configurations, which indicates that pure yaw motion cues may not be as important as previously thought in flight simulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{interacting}} multiple model (IMM) method using intelligent tracking filter with fuzzy <b>gain</b> to re-duce <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> for maneuvering target. In the proposed filter, the unknown acceleration input for each sub-model {{is determined by}} mis-matches between the modelled target dynamics and the actual target dynamics. After an acceleration input is detected, the state estimate for each sub-model is modified. To modify the accurate estimation, we pro-pose the fuzzy gain based on {{the relation between the}} filter residual and its variation. To optimize each fuzzy system, we utilize the genetic algo-rithm (GA). Finally, the tracking performance of the proposed method is compared with those of the input estimation(IE) method and AIMM method through computer simulations. ...|$|R

In this article, preserving linear fluid-flow model, we propose its extension to the case when a network is composed of wired and wireless part.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess whether {{exchange-traded}} funds (ETFs) can beat the market, as it is expressed by the Standard and Poor (S&P) 500 Index, examine the outperformance persistence, calculate <b>tracking</b> <b>error,</b> assess the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> persistence, investigate the factors that induce <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> and assess whether there are predictable patterns in ETFs' performance. Design/methodology/approach – The author uses a sample of 50 iShares during the period 2002 - 2007 and calculates the simple raw return, the Sharpe ratio and the Sortino ratio, regresses the performance differences between ETFs and market index, calculates <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> as the standard deviation in return differences between ETFs and benchmarks, assesses <b>tracking</b> <b>error's</b> persistence in the same fashion used to assess the ETFs' outperformance persistence, examines the impact of expenses, risk and age on <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> and applies dummy regression analysis to study whether the performance of ETFs is predictable. Findings – The results reveal that the majority of the selected iShares beat the S&P 500 Index, both at the annual and the aggregate levels while the return superiority of ETFs strongly persists at the short-term level. The <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> of ETFs also persists at the short-term level. The regression analysis on <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> reveals that the expenses charged by ETFs along with the age and risk of ETFs are some of the factors that can explain the persistence in <b>tracking</b> <b>error.</b> Finally, the dummy regression analysis indicates that the performance of ETFs can be somehow predictable. Originality/value – The findings of this paper may be of help to investors seeking investment choices that will help them to gain above market returns. In addition, tracking error-concerned investors will be helped by the findings of the paper. Finally, the findings on return predictability can also be helpful to investors.

40|$|Iterative {{learning}} control (ILC) {{has proven to}} be a powerful method to derive a high performance feedforward signal for systems that perform repetitive tasks. The feedforward signal is derived through several iterations, based on the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> of a feedback controlled system. In practical applications, the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> consists of a repetitive part and a non-repetitive part. ILC only compensates for the repetitive part of the error. The non-repetitive part also enters the learning scheme and affects the tracking performance. The problem definition of this thesis is defined as: Determine how non-repetitive <b>errors</b> affect the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> and the learned feedforward signal of ILC and design a method to eliminate the effect of non-repetitive errors. An expression for the <b>tracking</b> <b>error</b> of an arbitrary iteration is derived as a function of the reference, load disturbances and measurement disturbances.
