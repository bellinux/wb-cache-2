2500|$|There is no {{specific}} variety of cocoa that shows resistant to Phytophthora infections {{and the establishment}} and utilization of resistant variety will be most likely depends on the region. Numerous breeding programs have been established worldwide in order to screen and test for local hybrids for disease resistant of Phytophthora spp. For example, a study in Cameroon assessed the performance of local cocoa cultivars (the southern and northern Cameroon cultivar) compared to the local and international gene bank cultivars. The local <b>genebank</b> cultivar consisted of F1 hybrid of Upper Amazon X Trinidad, and an international cultivar from Papua New Guinea, and Latin America were provided through International Cocoa <b>Genebank,</b> Trinidad. Based on the information provided by farmers and leaf disc test to assess resistant variety, the local cultivars selected from farmers field showed some resistant to P. megakarya compared to other varieties. Thus, {{it was concluded that}} there are some potential resistant varieties available in this area. In addition, some molecular work on developing resistant varieties to black pod is being done by CEPLAC (Executive Plan of Cocoa Farming) agency in Brazil [...] and hopefully more breeding program focusing on black pod resistant will be established and produced commercialized resistant varieties.|$|E
2500|$|The largest {{collection}} of rice cultivars is at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, with over 100,000 rice accessions held in the International Rice <b>Genebank.</b> Rice cultivars are often classified by their grain shapes and texture. For example, Thai Jasmine rice is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less amylopectin than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. Japanese mochi rice and Chinese sticky rice are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as [...] "glutinous rice" [...] (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to [...] "gluten") to make zongzi. The Japanese table rice is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese sake rice is another kind as well.|$|E

40|$|This brief {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} the 2008 study carried out by Bioversity International and its partners that investigated two major issues relating to conservation of coffee germplasm: 1. What are the real threats to and losses of coffee germplasm held globally in field <b>genebanks?</b> 2. How do the costs of cryopreservation compare with those of maintaining coffee field collections for long-term conservation? The study shows that the costs of cryopreservation should not be considered prohibitive to establishing duplicate, back-up collections of coffee. If cryopreservation is adopted as a complement to field <b>genebanks,</b> the costs of cryopreservation must be added to existing costs of field conservation. However, field collections could be reduced and at least partly between cryopreservation and field collection to ensure the longterm, cost-efficient conservation of coffee genetic resources. This study investigated coffee as a test case, but the results are relevant to other species that are difficult to conserve using the traditional method of seed drying and low-temperature storage.
