Upon his release, he took a year {{to recover from the}} ordeal before showing up at the Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, hoping to return to work as a test pilot. His old buddy, Colonel McKee (Charles McGraw), tries his best for him, but the base commander, Brigadier General Banner (Lloyd Nolan), turns him down because he cannot trust him to be stable. A complication is that the general's secretary and love interest, Connie Mitchell (Virginia Leith), is an old <b>flame.</b> <b>Bond</b> presses for a job and accepts the general's offer of routine flying in support.

This step {{was followed by a}} second deposition of antibody by overprinting on the PEI-GA patterned PMMA foil. The PEI polymer ink was first formulated to ensure stable drop formation in inkjet printing and the printed films were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

Capable of spanning greater lengths and carrying greater loads, glulam has advanced wood as a building material. Although glulam timber offers significant improvement over sawn timber, its ultimate bending strength often remains limited by strength reducing flaws, such as knots and finger joints, in the tension zone. Tensile reinforcement of glulam has been researched in the past, most commonly using metal reinforcement, without commercial success.

In order to ensure the appropriate corrosion protection, conventional methods cannot be used, but cladding can supply the required protection.

Stein, {{in honor of his}} distinguished 40 -year career as the leading educator in the engineering of measurement systems for test and evaluation. The authors are privileged to be students of Prof. Stein more years and more data channels ago than they care to remember! The basic assumption for this series is that thereader has at least a cursory familiarity with mea-surement systems for strain, under laboratory con-ditions, with both foil and wire bonded resistance strain gages. This basic familiarity includes adhesive, ce-ramic and <b>flame</b> spray <b>bonding</b> techniques; standard wiring methods; and standard signal conditioning approaches. Fur-ther, the authors assume some familiarity with system fre-quency responses. We focus, here, on foil and wire strain gages for the measurement of dynamic strain and the real problems associated with the generation of demonstrably valid dynamic strain data. Piezoresistive and semiconductor strain gages are not discussed here due to their properly infrequent use in structural dynamics testing. Any mention of commercial products in this series implies neither an endorsement nor recommendation by the authors. Products are mentioned to support explanation of funda-mental measurement principles that must be understood if valid dynamic strain data is to be acquired...|$|R
40|$|The coming {{generations of}} {{portable}} products require significant improvement of packaging technologies, mainlydue to increasing signal frequencies {{and the demand}} for higher density of functions. State of the art are organicsubstrates with high-density build-up layers and micro-vias, equipped on both sides with discrete passive and activecomponents. The space requirement of active chips can be already reduced to a minimum by implementing CSPs(chip size packages) or flip chips. A further miniaturization however requires a 3 -dimensional integration of components. Besides miniaturization the new applications require signal frequencies of several GHz. In order to maintainsignal integrity, much shorter and impedance-matched interconnects between chips and other components arerequired. Here the Chip in Polymer technology will be described which allows extreme dense 3 -dimensional integrationand very short interconnects. This approach is based on the integration of ultra-thin components into builduplayers of printed circuit boards. Details of the technological implementation, like thin die <b>bonding,</b> embeddingby vacuum <b>lamination,</b> laser drilling and metallization, will be discussed.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European project ?HIDING DIES? innovative chip-in-polymer technologies are employed and further developed for chip embedding and active component integration in printed circuit boards in order to achieve maximum miniaturisation and superior functionality under very high signal frequencies of several GHz?s. The basic concept is to embed ultra-thin semiconductor chips into the laminated build-up layers of microvia PCBs. The process flow steps are Cu metallisation of the wafer Al pads, wafer thinning to achieve very thin chips, die <b>bonding,</b> vacuum <b>lamination</b> of RCC materials, laser drilling of vias up to chip contact pads and final 3 -D via metallisation. This paper will show details of all the technology steps but will mainly concentrate on the lamination technology employed for realisation of the Consortium?s test vehicles. Furthermore, it intends to demonstrate the versatility of state-of-the-art lamination technology in conjunction with innovative Resin-coated-copper (RCC) films for chip and component integration in challenging technological applications. RCC materials with a resin thickness ranging from 25 µm up to 100 µm have been successfully laminated on PCB structures, embedding very thin and sensitive chips. This study will provide guidelines how the vacuum lamination parameters have to be adjusted to avoid chip breakage and achieve optimum lamination results such as void elimination, excellent epoxy adhesion at PCB and chip interfaces and good flatness of the resultant chip stacking structure. This study will bring into light the paramount role of the fundamental epoxy RCC properties to the lamination results. DSC results will be shown from different epoxy resin RCC?s. From technological standpoint, the study will show interesting techniques how the lamination temperature and pressure profile can be manipulated to achieve chip embedding even with very fragile chips of 50 µm thickness. The thickness of the epoxy resin above the embedded chip depends strongly on the epoxy thickness of the used RCC film and the lamination profile. Furthermore, comparable results will be shown with lamination temperature profiles using slow and fast heating rates and their effect of the epoxy fluidity, chip-stack flatness and epoxy adhesion will be discussed. Experimental results will be also shown for lamination of relatively thick chips of 200 µm. Additionally, reliability results on laminated test vehicles will be presented and their reliability performance will be correlated to the lamination parameters...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} research project, carried {{out during the}} years 2006 - 2008, the possibility to manufacture wet glued laminated beams using ungraded laminations of Norway spruce side boards was investigated with very promising results. In the project presented in this report, {{the performance of the}} wet glued beams has been further investigated and developed as regards grading of side board <b>laminations,</b> <b>bond</b> line properties and lamination finger jointing. The possibility to use scanning equipment for measurement of fibre angles and prediction of strength and stiffness of boards and beams has been studied and the procedures for technical approval and CE marking have been probed into. Studies concerning market and economy for the beams and layouts for a pilot plant and a full capacity plant, respectively, for production of such beams have also been carried out. The possibility to grade side boards in the wet state using axial dynamic excitation was investigated with a positive result. From such excitation, a board’s stiffness (modulus of elasticity) could be determined. Accordingly, grading criteria regarding axial stiffness, and knot size, was applied to grade side board laminations into two classes; outer and inner laminations. Strength and stiffness tests of beams manufactured from such graded laminations showed that the beams actually could challenge first rate glulam and LVL products available on the market. Regarding beam shape and shape stability, cross section cupping may need further attention. Even if this deformation was small, it was still visible to the naked eye. The problem could probably be overcome if the beams are dried to a moisture content of 12 - 14 % before planing. Results of shear tests show that green glued bond lines can fulfil strength requirements for glulam. However, delamination requirements for service class 3 (outdoors) were not fully met. From small scale tensile testing of glued bonds it was concluded that green glued bonds with high density wood have the same tensile strength and fracture energy as dry glued bonds. For bonds with low density wood and/or small amount of adhesive, the tensile strength could be lower than for dry glued bonds, whereas the fracture energy was on a similar level. Strength testing of wet and dry glued finger joints demonstrated that joints glued from high density wood was significantly stronger than low density joints {{and that there was no}} significant difference between the strength of green glued joints and joints glued after drying. From X-ray measurement it was shown that the glue penetration into the wood fibres is much deeper in a green glued joint than in a joint that is glued in the dried state. From scanning algorithms developed within the scope of this project it is possible to obtain reasonably accurate predictions of grain-angle distributions on board surfaces as well as rather accurate descriptions of knot locations and of fibre-angle disturbances around knots. From scanning of board ends, cross section characteristics with respect to radial and tangential directions and of annual ring widths could also be determined. Finally, both board and beam stiffness were predicted from this data, with an accuracy that is comparable with the one obtained from well-reputed commercial grading systems...|$|R
