The {{special interest in}} S. oneidensis MR-1 revolves around its behavior in an anaerobic environment contaminated by heavy metals such as iron, lead and uranium. Experiments suggest it may reduce ionic mercury to elemental mercury and ionic silver to elemental silver. Cellular respiration for these bacteria is not restricted to heavy metals though; the bacteria can also target sulfates, nitrates and chromates when grown anaerobically.|$|E
40|$|A rapidly-growing facultatively aerobic {{bacterium}} that transforms tetrachloroethene (PCE) via trichloroethene (TCE) to cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethene (cis- 1, 2 -DCE) at {{high rates}} in a defined medium was isolated from a contaminated site. Metabolic characterization, cellular fatty acid analysis, and partial sequence analysis of 16 S rRNA {{showed that the}} new isolate, strain MS- 1, has characteristics matching those {{of the members of}} the family Enterobacteriaceae. Strain MS- 1 can oxidize about 58 substrates including many carbohydrates, short-chain fatty acids, amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines. It can transform up to 1 mM PCE (aqueous) at a rate of about 0. 5 (mu) mol of PCE(middot) h(sup- 1) (middot) mg (dry weight) of cell(sup- 1). PCE transformation occurs following growth on or with the addition of single carbon sources such as glucose, pyruvate, formate, lactate, or acetate or with complex nutrient sources such as yeast extract or a mixture of amino acids. PCE dehalogenation requires the absence of oxygen, nitrate, and high concentrations of fermentable compounds such as glucose. Enterobacter agglomerans biogroup 5 (ATCC 27993), a known <b>facultative</b> <b>bacterium</b> that is closely related to strain MS- 1, also reductively dehalogenated PCE to cis- 1, 2 -DCE. To our knowledge, this is the first report on isolation of a <b>facultative</b> <b>bacterium</b> that can reductively transform PCE to cis- 1, 2 -DCE under defined physiological conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe complex II {{family of}} {{proteins}} includes succinate:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) and quinol:fumarate oxidoreductase (QFR). In the <b>facultative</b> <b>bacterium</b> Escherichia coli both are expressed {{as part of}} the aerobic (SQR) and anaerobic (QFR) respiratory chains. SQR from E. coli is homologous to mitochondrial complex II and has proven to be an excellent model system for structure/function studies of the enzyme. Both SQR and QFR from E. coli are tetrameric membrane-bound enzymes that couple succinate/fumarate interconversion with quinone/quinol reduction/oxidation. Both enzymes are capable of binding either ubiquinone or menaquinone, however, they have adopted different quinone binding sites where catalytic reactions with quinones occur. A comparison of the structures of the quinone binding sites in SQR and QFR reveals how the enzymes have adapted in order to accommodate both benzo- and napthoquinones. A combination of structural, computational, and kinetic studies of members of the complex II family of enzymes has revealed that the catalytic quinone adopts different positions in the quinone-binding pocket. These data suggest that movement of the quinone within the quinone-binding pocket is essential for catalysis...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Single {{and mixed}} infections with 11 {{clinical}} isolates of Propionibacterium acnes and three <b>facultative</b> <b>bacteria</b> (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice.

One critical characteristic of Francisella {{is its ability to}} dampen or subvert the host immune response. Previous work has shown that monocytes infected with highly virulent F. tularensis subsp. tularensis strain Schu S 4 responded with a general pattern of quantitatively reduced pro-inflammatory signaling pathway genes and cytokine production in comparison to those infected with the less virulent related F. novicida. However, it has been unclear whether the virulent Schu S 4 was merely evading or actively suppressing monocyte responses. By using mixed infection assays with F. tularensis and F. novicida, we show that F. tularensis actively suppresses monocyte pro-inflammatory responses. Additional experiments show that this suppression occurs in a dose-dependent manner and is dependent upon the viability of F. tularensis. Importantly, F. tularensis was able to suppress pro-inflammatory responses to earlier infections with F. novicida. These results lend support that F. tularensis actively dampens human monocyte responses and this likely contributes to its enhanced pathogenicity...|$|E

One critical characteristic of Francisella {{is its ability to}} dampen or subvert the host immune response. In order to help understand the mechanisms by which this occurs, we performed Affymetrix microarray analysis on transcripts from blood monocytes infected with the virulent Type A Schu S 4 strain. Results showed that expression of several host response genes were reduced such as those associated with interferon signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, autophagy and phagocytosis. When compared to microarrays from monocytes infected with the less virulent F. tularensis subsp. novicida, we found qualitative differences and also a general pattern of quantitatively reduced pro-inflammatory signaling pathway genes in the Schu S 4 strain. Notably, the PI 3 K / Akt 1 pathway appeared specifically down-regulated following Schu S 4 infection and a concomitantly lower cytokine response was observed.

A DNA microarray containing 4, 020 genes from this organism was constructed to explore anaerobic gene expression patterns on a genomic scale.

These genes {{are involved in}} a variety of cell functions, including carbon metabolism, electron transport, iron uptake, antibiotic production, and stress response. Among the highly induced genes are not only those responsible for nitrate respiration and fermentation but also those of unknown function.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{atmospheric}} oxygen on {{the viability of}} 13 strains of anaerobic bacteria, two strains of <b>facultative</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and one aerobic organism was examined. There were great variations in oxygen tolerance among the <b>bacteria.</b> All <b>facultative</b> <b>bacteria</b> survived more than 72 h of exposure to atmospheric oxygen. The survival time for anaerobes ranged from less than 45 min for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius to more than 72 h for two Clostridium perfringens strains. An {{effort was made to}} relate the degree of oxygen tolerance to the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases in cell-free extracts of the <b>bacteria.</b> All <b>facultative</b> <b>bacteria</b> and a number of anaerobic bacteria possessed superoxide dismutase. There was a correlation between superoxide dismutase activity and oxygen tolerance, but there were notable exceptions. Polyacrylamide gel electropherograms stained for superoxide dismutase indicated that many of the anaerobic bacteria contained at least two electrophoretically distinct enzymes with superoxide dismutase activity. All <b>facultative</b> <b>bacteria</b> contained peroxidase, whereas none of the anaerobic bacteria possessed measurable amounts of this enzyme. Catalase activity was variable among the bacteria and showed no relationship to oxygen tolerance. The ability of the bacteria to reduce oxygen was also examined and related to enzyme content and oxygen tolerance. In general, organisms that survived for relatively long periods of time in the presence of oxygen but demonstrated little superoxide dismutase activity reduced little oxygen. The effects of medium composition and conditions of growth were examined for their influence on the level of the three enzymes. Bacteria grown on the surface of an enriched blood agar medium generally had more enzyme activity than bacteria grown in a liquid medium. The data indicate that superoxide dismutase activity and oxygen reduction rates are important determinants related to the tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to oxygen...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli is the {{dominant}} <b>facultative</b> <b>bacterium</b> in the normal intestinal flora. E. coli is, however, also responsible {{for the majority of}} serious extraintestinal infections. There are distinct serotypical differences between facultative and invasive E. coli strains. Invasive strains frequently produce virulence factors such as α-hemolysin (HlyA), which causes hemolysis by forming pores in the erythrocyte membrane. The present study reveals that this pore formation triggers purinergic receptor activation to mediate the full hemolytic action. Non-selective ATP-receptor (P 2) antagonists (PPADS, suramin) and ATP scavengers (apyrase, hexokinase) concentration dependently inhibited HlyA-induced lysis of equine, murine, and human erythrocytes. The pattern of responsiveness to more selective P 2 -antagonists implies that both P 2 X 1 and P 2 X 7 receptors are involved in HlyA-induced hemolysis in all three species. In addition, our results also propose a role for the pore protein pannexin 1 in HlyA-induced hemolysis, as non-selective inhibitors of this channel significantly reduced hemolysis in the three species. In conclusion, activation of P 2 X receptors and possibly also pannexins augment hemolysis induced by the bacterial toxin, HlyA. These findings potentially have clinical perspectives as P 2 antagonists may ameliorate symptoms during sepsis with hemolytic bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Strain T 1 is a <b>facultative</b> <b>bacterium</b> that {{is capable}} of {{anaerobic}} toluene degradation under denitrifying conditions. While 80 % of the carbon from toluene is either oxidized to carbon dioxide or assimilated into cellular carbon, {{a significant portion of the}} remainder is transformed into two dead-end metabolites. These metabolites were produced simultaneous to the mineralization of toluene and were identified as benzylsuccinic acid and benzylfumaric acid. Identification was based on comparison of mass spectra of the methyl esters of the metabolites and authentic compounds that were chemically synthesized. Strain T 1 is also capable of o-xylene transformation during growth on toluene. o-Xylene does not serve as a source of carbon and is not mineralized. Rather, it is transformed to analogous dead-end metabolites, (2 -methylbenzyl) -succinic acid and (2 -methylbenzyl) -fumaric acid. o-Xylene transformation also occurred during growth on succinic acid, which suggests that attack of the methyl group by succinyl-coenzyme A is a key reaction in this transformation. We reason that the main pathway for toluene oxidation to carbon dioxide involves a mechanism similar to that for the formation of the metabolites and involves an attack of the methyl group of toluene by acetyl-coenzyme A...|$|E

During infections, Lm is enters phagosomes {{from which it}} escapes into the cytoplasm. Listeriolysin O (LLO) is essential and two phospholipases {{play a role in}} this process [1]. Actin polymerization provides the propulsive force that moves bacteria through the cytoplasm and into adjacent cells. It is initiated by the interaction of the N-terminal domain of ActA, a 639 amino acid membrane protein, with the host Arp 2 / 3 complex. The first 156 amino acids of the NH 2 -terminal domain contain three regions that contribute to actin nucleation: a stretch of acidic residues (‘A ’ region, amino acids 32 – 45), a cofilin homology sequence (‘C ’ region, amino acids 145 – 156), and an actin monomer-binding region (‘AB ’ region, amino acids 59 – 102) [2]. Many studies have dissected the function of ActA in actin polymerization. In the present study, we have explored a novel role of ActA. By using ActA mutants we provide evidence for its involvement in phagosome disruption. These studies have implicated the acidic stretch of ActA in promoting bacterial escape from the phagosome.

The anaerobic and aerobic expression levels of these genes were measured by I-galactosidase assays in different medium conditions and {{in the presence of}} three regulatory mutations (fnr, narL, and rpoN). The anaerobically expressed genes (aeg) located at minute 99 (aeg- 99) and 75 (aeg- 75) appeared to be partially regulated byfnr, and aeg- 93 is tightly regulated byfnr. aeg- 60 requires a functional rpoN gene for its anaerobic expression. aeg- 46. 5 is repressed by narL. aeg- 65 A and aeg- 65 C are partially controlled byfnr but only in media containing nitrate or fumarate. aeg 47. 5 and aeg- 48. 5 were found to be anaerobically induced only in rich media. The effects of a narL mutation on aeg- 46. 5 expression were observed in all medium conditions regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} nitrate.

A comparison of several methodologies for SRS diagnostic indicate differences in their specificity and its capacity to detect other bacteria coexisting with P. sairnonis in culture media (contamination) and fish samples (coinfection), aspects relevant for research, vaccine development and clinical diagnostic. By computer-simulation analyses, we identified a group of restriction enzymes that generate unique P. salmonis 16 S rDNA band patterns, distinguishable from all other bacteria. From this information, we designed and developed a PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) assay, which was validated using 16 S rDNA universal primers and restriction enzyme PmaCl for the amplification and digestion, respectively.

Endoglucanase activities were higher than those of β-glucosidase and xylanase at all temperatures. Xylanase had the lowest activity among the three enzymes examined. The optimum temperature for the enzymes of Bacillus licheniformis JK 7 was 70 °C for endoglucanase (0. 75 U/ml) and 50 °C for β-glucosidase and xylanase (0. 63 U/ml, 0. 44 U/ml, respectively). All three enzymes were stable at a temperature range of 20 to 50 °C. At 50 °C, endoglucanse, β-glucosidase, and xylanase had 90. 29, 94. 80, and 88. 69 % residual activity, respectively. The optimal pH for the three enzymes was 5. 0, at which their activity was 1. 46, 1. 10, and 1. 08 U/ml, respectively. The activity of all three enzymes was stable in the pH range of 3. 0 to 6. 0.

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) {{is one of the most}} powerful tools for this purpose. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the method will depend on the careful selection of genes whose expression are stable and can be used as internal controls for a particular experimental setting. Findings The expression stability of five commonly used housekeeping genes [beta-actin (ACTB), elongation factor 1 -alpha (EF 1 A), ubiquitin (UBQ), glyceraldehyd- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and tubulin alpha (TUBA) ] were monitored in salmonid cell lines CHSE- 214 and RTS 11 after infection with two of the most fastidious fish pathogens, the <b>facultative</b> <b>bacterium</b> Piscirickettsia salmonis and the aquabirnavirus IPNV (Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus). After geNorm analysis, UBQ and EF 1 A appeared as the most stable, although EF 1 A was slightly upregulated at late stages of P. salmonis infection in RTS 11. ACTB instead, showed a good performance in each case, being always considered within the three most stable genes of the panel. In contrast, infection-dependent differential regulation of GAPDH and TUBA was also demonstrated. Conclusion Based on the data presented here with the cell culture models CHSE- 214 and RTS 11, we suggest the initial choice of UBQ, ACTB and EF 1 A as reference genes in qRT-PCR assays for studying the effect of P. salmonis and IPNV on the host immune response. </p...|$|E

In the present study, we obtained the draft genome of an Aerophobetes bacterium TCS 1 from saline sediment near the Thuwal cold seep in the Red Sea using a genome binning method. Analysis of 16 S rRNA genes of TCS 1 and close relatives revealed wide distribution of Aerophobetes in deep-sea sediments. Phylogenetic relationships showed affinity between Aerophobetes TCS 1 and some thermophilic bacterial phyla. The genome of TCS 1 (at least 1. 27  Mbp) contains {{a full set of}} genes encoding core metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and pyruvate fermentation to produce acetyl-CoA and acetate. The identification of cross-membrane sugar transporter genes further indicates its potential ability to consume carbohydrates preserved in the sediment under the microbial mat. Aerophobetes bacterium TCS 1 therefore probably carried out saccharolytic and fermentative metabolism. The genes responsible for autotrophic synthesis of acetyl-CoA via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway were also found in the genome. Phylogenetic study of the essential genes for the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway implied relative independence of Aerophobetes bacterium from the known acetogens and methanogens. Compared with genomes of acetogenic bacteria, Aerophobetes bacterium TCS 1 genome lacks the genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism, signal transduction and cell motility. The metabolic activities of TCS 1 might depend on geochemical conditions such as supplies of CO 2, hydrogen and sugars, and therefore the TCS 1 might be a <b>facultative</b> <b>bacterium</b> in anaerobic saline sediments near cold seeps. © 2016, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

40|$|A <b>facultative</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{capable of}} {{removing}} the selenium (Se) oxyanions selenate (SeO(inf 4) (sup 2 -)) and selenite (SeO(inf 3) (sup 2 -)) from solution culture in flasks {{open to the}} atmosphere was isolated and studied {{with the goal of}} assessing its potential for use in bioremediation of seleniferous agricultural drainage water. Elemental Se (Se(sup 0)) was confirmed as a product of the reaction. The organism, identified as Enterobacter cloacae and designated strain SLD 1 a- 1 (ATCC 700258), removed from 61. 5 to 94. 5 % of added SeO(inf 4) (sup 2 -) (the primary species present in agricultural drainage water) at concentrations from 13 to 1, 266 (mu) M. Equimolar amounts of nitrate (NO(inf 3) (sup-)), which interferes with SeO(inf 4) (sup 2 -) reduction in some organisms, did not influence the reaction in growth experiments but had a slight inhibitory effect in a washed-cell suspension. Washed-cell suspension experiments also showed that (i) SeO(inf 3) (sup 2 -) is a transitory intermediate in reduction of SeO(inf 4) (sup 2 -), being produced and rapidly reduced concomitantly; (ii) NO(inf 3) (sup-) is also reduced concomitantly and at a much higher rate than SeO(inf 4) (sup 2 -); and (iii) although enzymatic, reduction of either oxyanion {{does not appear to be}} an inducible process. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that precipitate particles are < 0. 1 (mu) m in diameter, and these particles were observed free in the medium. Evidence indicates that SLD 1 a- 1 uses SeO(inf 4) (sup 2 -) as an alternate electron acceptor and that the reaction occurs via a membrane-associated reductase(s) followed by rapid expulsion of the Se particles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram {{negative}} non <b>facultative</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{and one of}} the members of normal flora in different sites of body in healthy humans. This bacterium can resist in fluids and hospital environments for a long time. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has two systems for glucose uptake: a low affinity oxidative pathway and a high affinity phosphorylative pathway. The orfBCD genes are located over two million base pair upstream of the genes involved in the high affinity uptake system. Although the role of these genes are unknown by now, they may have a role in regulation of glucose uptake. In the present study, the role of orfD gene in glucose uptake in P. aeruginosa has been investigated. Method: orfD fragment were cloned in pUCP 20 as vector and the recombinant plasmid transferred into WMA 200 strain of P. aeruginosa, a mutant strain of P. aeruginosa with a chromosomal deletion of orfBCD. So we compared the rate of glucose uptake by P. aeruginosaWMA 200, P. aeruginosaWMA 200 /pUCP 20 /orfD and P. aeruginosa H 103 as wild type strain of P. aeruginosa by using labeled glucose under conditions at low substrate concentration and low cell density. Results: Carbohydrate uptake patterns differed considerably among three strains. The wild type is able to uptake glucose at a faster rate than the mutant; however, the mutant complemented with orfD shows an intermediate uptake comparing to the wild type and the mutant. Conclusion: orfD gene has an important role in carbohydrate uptake in P. aeruginosa strains however further studies are required to determine the involved mechanism.

40|$|Microorganisms are {{intricately}} {{involved in}} the ecology of many insects, often contributing to host fitness and forming evolutionarily stable associations. The interactions between hosts and microbes can significantly alter their evolutionary trajectories, enabling them to adapt to novel environmental conditions. In this thesis I have examined how host ecology can shape the interactions of bacteria with insects of agricultural and epidemiological importance. I have described the bacterial communities associated with Bactrocera oleae (the olive fruit fly) and generated draft genome sequences for {{several members of the}} gut microbiota, including the symbiotic bacterium “Candidatus Erwinia dacicola”. Comparative genomic analyses indicate that Ca. E. dacicola and a novel <b>facultative</b> <b>bacterium</b> Tatumella TA 1 may perform key nutritional functions for the host, including the synthesis of essential amino acids and ammonia assimilation from host nitrogenous waste products. Tatumella TA 1 is consistently associated with all life stages of populations collected in Israel and Crete at low relative abundance, and encodes large adhesion proteins that may assist in attachment to the host epithelium or other members of the microbiota in the B. oleae gut. I have also examined the variation in frequency and relative abundance of facultative microbes that infect several Glossina spp. (the tsetse fly) : the sole vector of African trypanosomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to three vertically transmitted endosymbionts (Wigglesworthia, Sodalis, and Wolbachia), tsetse flies are infected with two additional potential reproductive manipulators: Spiroplasma and Rickettsia, and a novel strain of Klebsiella. The draft genomes generated for these taxa over the course of this thesis provide the opportunity for future studies in to their role in host biology and how community interactions can shape the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of host-associated microbes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{characteristic}} of hydrogen production by <b>facultative</b> anaerobic <b>bacteria,</b> obligate anaerobic bacteria and their mixed culture was studied by the batch culture method. The results showed that, {{due to the}} synergistic effect between <b>facultative</b> <b>bacteria</b> and anaerobic bacteria, the ability of hydrogen production in the mixed culture was much better than that in the pure culture. Especially, the culture Scheme No. 7 mixed up with three strains (Bacterium. E: Bacterium. B: Bacterium. P = 1 : 1 : 1) not only had the best hydrogen production capacity (1. 885 mol H 2 /mol glucose) and maximum average hydrogen production rate (212. 2 mL/(L·h)), but also had stable hydrogen production under continuous culture conditions, which was 1. 968 mol H 2 /mol glucose...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{evaluated}} the dentine bond strength (BS) and the antibacterial activity (AA) of six adhesives against strict anaerobic and <b>facultative</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Methods: Three adhesives containing antibacterial components (Gluma 2 Bond (glutaraldehyde) /G 2 B, Clearfil SE Protect (MDPB) /CSP and Peak Universal Bond (PUB) /chlorhexidine) {{and the same}} adhesive versions without antibacterial agents (Gluma Comfort Bond/GCB, Clearfil SE Bond/CSB and Peak LC Bond/PLB) were tested. The AA of adhesives and control groups was evaluated by direct contact method against four strict anaerobic and four <b>facultative</b> <b>bacteria.</b> After incubation, according to the appropriate periods of time for each microorganism, the time to kill microorganisms was measured. For BS, the adhesives were applied according to manufacturers' recommendations and teeth restored with composite. Teeth (n = 10) were sectioned to obtain bonded beams specimens, which were tested after artificial saliva storage for one week and one year. BS {{data were analyzed using}} two-way ANOVA and Tukey test. Results: Saliva storage for one year reduces the BS only for GCB. In general G 2 B and GCB required at least 24 h for killing microorganisms. PUB and PLB killed only strict anaerobic microorganisms after 24 h. For CSP the average time to eliminate the Streptococcus mutans and strict anaerobic oral pathogens was 30 min. CSB showed no AA against <b>facultative</b> <b>bacteria,</b> but had AA against some strict anaerobic microorganisms. Conclusions: Storage time had no effect on the BS for most of the adhesives. The time required to kill bacteria depended on the type of adhesive and never was less than 10 min. Clinical significance: Most of the adhesives showed stable bond strength after one year and the Clearfil SE Protect may be a good alternative in restorative procedures performed on dentine, considering its adequate bond strength and better antibacterial activity.
