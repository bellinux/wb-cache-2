5000|$|In 1942, Hitler {{appointed}} Speer {{as the new}} Minister of Armaments and Munitions, {{following the}} death of Fritz Todt in a plane crash. This included responsibility for construction assignments such as the Organization Todt. Under Speer, German arms production improved. Speer adopted [...] "industrial self-responsibility" [...] as advocated by Walther Rathenau. Under Speer, [...] "a given plant concentrated on producing only one item, but did so in maximum quantity." [...] He also put contractual guarantees in place to ensure production was maintained at high efficiencies. Despite continued allied bombing, German armaments production continued to increase under Speer's plan as predicted by Rathenau, [...] "doubling production without increasing equipment or labor costs." [...] The average index figure for armaments production went from a value of 98 in 1941 to a peak of 322 in July 1944. Speer goes on to state that he [...] "applied the methods of democratic economic leadership," [...] while the allies [...] "moved in the opposite direction." [...] In particular. he claims the Americans introduced [...] "an authoritarian stiffening into their industrial structure..." [...] Through <b>delegated</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and committees, Speer [...] "allowed arguments and counterarguments to be stated before they made a decision." [...] Yet, armaments production never exceed what Germany achieved during the First World War, Speer states, because of [...] "excessive bureaucratization, which I fought in vain." [...] Yet, Speer notes, [...] "...our ability to produce more and more in spite of the air raids must {{have been one of the}} reasons that Hitler did not really take the air battle over Germany seriously." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the processes used by the principal of a private school in Karachi, Pakistan to motivate teachers for the accomplishment of the delegated tasks. The research focused on three major areas i. e. process of delegation; support provided in delegation and challenges occurring {{during the process of}} delegation. In the context of Pakistan, principals are mainly found as typically isolated with their positional powers. (Bahadur, 2010). This {{is one of the reasons}} when the tasks are delegated to the teachers; they are left with less support and perhaps no guidance. There are some significant literatures which illustrate that a school principal, as a distributed leader, plays a versatile role in developing a second line of leaders in the form of teacher leaders. This is mainly achieved by institutionalizing the process of delegating responsibilities to the teachers and motivating them to fulfill <b>delegated</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> With the aim and focus, this study is carried out within the paradigm of qualitative research and designed under the case study method. To obtain in-depth information and understand the facilitating factors for supporting teacher leaders to fulfill <b>delegated</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> data were collected through semi-structured interviews, observations and document analysis. The findings of this study have informed that the principal uses a structured process for selecting and delegating responsibilities to the teachers. Moreover, through support mechanism in the system principal also motivates teachers extrinsically and intrinsically to fulfill the delegated tasks. These mechanisms are strong communication system; empowerment; collaborative learning; capacity building; flexible work structure and trustworthiness. Furthermore, data have also highlighted some challenges like coordinators 2 ̆ 7 turn over, lack of incentives and overloaded work which create hindrances in the process of delegation. Nevertheless, the efforts applied by the principal resulted in professional development of the teachers; building accountability and ownership among the teachers; sharing of responsibilities, creating future leader and improving teachers 2 ̆ 7 performances...|$|E

40|$|Preliminary, {{please do}} not {{circulate}} publicly. Boards are working harder over time, but are they working better? Using text-based algorithms to construct a dataset with over 30, 000 firm-year observations from 1996 to 2010, we document that the governance reforms of the early 2000 s may have had unin-tended consequences. While readily observable board characteristics have not changed much over time, boards have increasingly <b>delegated</b> <b>responsibilities</b> to committees sta↵ed by independent directors. We find evidence that this delegation may have erected bar-riers to communication and e↵ective board decision-making. Investors discount the in-formativeness of the personal stock purchases for independent director who are active committee members; returns to firms announcing an acquisition decrease as board del-egation increases.
