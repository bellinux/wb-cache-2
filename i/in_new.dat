5|$|Birds of the {{nominate}} subspecies {{were introduced}} to New Zealand and Australia by acclimatisation societies between 1860 and 1880, apparently for purely sentimental reasons. <b>In</b> <b>New</b> Zealand, where it was introduced on both the main islands, the song thrush quickly established itself and spread to surrounding islands such as the Kermadecs, Chatham and Auckland Islands. Although it is common and widespread <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Zealand, in Australia only a small population survives around Melbourne. <b>In</b> <b>New</b> Zealand, {{there appears to be}} a limited detrimental effect on some invertebrates due to predation by introduced bird species, and the song thrush also damages commercial fruit crops in that country. As an introduced species it has no legal protection <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Zealand, and can be killed at any time.|$|E
