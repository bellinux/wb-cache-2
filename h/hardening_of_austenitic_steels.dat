40|$|To further {{understand}} the <b>hardening</b> mechanism <b>of</b> <b>austenitic</b> manganese <b>steel</b> under actual working conditions, the work hardening ability was studied and the microstructures <b>of</b> <b>austenitic</b> manganese <b>steel</b> were observed under different impact energies. The work hardening mechanism was also analyzed. The {{results show that}} the best strain hardening effect could be received only when the impact energy reaches or exceeds the critical impact energy. The microstructural observations reveal that dislocations, stacking faults and twins increase with raising impact energy of the tested specimens. The hardening mechanism changes at different hardening degrees. It is mainly dislocation and slip hardening below the critical impact energy, but it changes to the twinning hardening mechanism when the impact energy is above the critical impact energy...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{manganese}} content and additions of aluminum, silicon, and possibly other alloying elements, TWIP steels possess a stacking fault energy that favors twinning as the predominant deformation mechanism together with ordinary dislocation gliding [1]. Among all common deformation and/or transformation processes, twinning has the most beneficial effect on the strain <b>hardening</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>austenitic</b> <b>steels.</b> TWIP steels start to yield at relatively low stress levels but exhibit moderate-to-high tensile strengths combined with extremely high total elongations, making the steels very suitable for forming applications while still leaving good strength and energy absorption potential to the manufactured parts. Because of these properties, TWIP steels have become very attractive especially for the automotive industry, where increasing safety requirements {{and the need for}} weight reduction of the car body are motivating the search for new structural materials. At the same time, good formability allows considerable cost reductions during the manufacturing process. Besides the chemical composition, also temperature affects the stacking fault energy, and therefore a change in the governing deformation process occurs with the changing deformation temperature of TWIP steels. At very low temperatures, a change from the twinning transformation process to partial martensitic phase transformation can be observed, while at high temperatures, dislocation glide becomes the dominant (and sole) deformation mechanism. At the same time, strain hardening and deformation mechanisms in TWIP steels usually depend also on strain rate, which is an important aspect for the automotive safety. In order to better understand the dependence of the mechanical behavior of TWIP steels on composition, temperature, and strain rate, three high-alloyed manganese steel grades were mechanically tested at various strain rates and temperatures. In this paper, we present the results of these measurements together with a discussion of the deformation mechanisms of TWIP steels in various conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} and structural responses of high-density TRIP steel and TRIP-steel/zirconia composite honeycomb structures were studied under uniaxial compression in the out-of-plane loading direction {{over a wide}} range of strain rates. Their mechanical response, buckling, and failure mechanisms differ considerably from those of conventional thin-walled, low-density cellular structures. Following the linear-elastic regime and the yield limit of the bulk material, the high-density square honeycombs exhibited a uniform increase in compression stress over an extended range of (stable) plastic deformation. This plastic pre-buckling stage with axial crushing of cell walls correlates with the uniaxial compressive response of the bulk specimens tested. The dominating material effects were the pronounced strain <b>hardening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>austenitic</b> <b>steel</b> matrix accompanied by a strain-induced α’-martensite nucleation (TRIP effect) and the strengthening effect due to the zirconia particle reinforcement. The onset of critical plastic bifurcation was initiated at high compressive loads governed by local or global cell wall deflections. After exceeding the compressive peak stress (maximum loading limit), the honeycombs underwent either a continuous post-buckling mode with a folding collapse (lower relative density) or a symmetric extensional collapse mode of the entire frame (high relative density). The densification strain and the post-buckling or plateau stress were determined by the energy efficiency method. Apart from relative density, the crush resistance and deformability of the honeycombs were highly influenced by the microstructure and damage evolution in the cell walls as well as the bulk material’s strain-rate sensitivity. A significant increase in strain rate against quasi-static loading resulted in a measured enhancement of deformation temperature associated with material softening. As a consequence, the compressive peak stress and the plastic failure strain at the beginning of post-buckling showed an anomaly with respect to strain rate indicated by minimum values under medium loading-rate conditions. The development of the temperature gradient in the stable pre-buckling stage could be predicted well by a known constitutive model for quasi-adiabatic heating...|$|R
