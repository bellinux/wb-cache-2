40|$|Abstract: The {{revival of}} the modern Austrian School of {{economics}} {{may be said to}} have begun 30 years ago. In 1974 the Austrian School had been on hiatus for almost a quarter of a century. For more than 60 years before the 1940 s, the Austrian economists had been considered some of the most original contributors to economic theory and policy. They were among the leading developers of the theories of marginal util-ity, opportunity cost, value and price, capital and interest, markets and competition, money and the business cycle, and comparative economic systems – capitalism ver-sus socialism versus the interventionist welfare state. But the rise and triumph of the Keynesian explanation of and prescription for the Great Depression eclipsed all com-peting approaches to the problems of economic depression and high unemployment. <b>Despite</b> all <b>that,</b> <b>however,</b> fundamental Austrian insights about man and the market exposed in this article are still corner-stones of a unique Austrian approach which is incompatible with the positivist, historicist, and neoclassical economic views of the world.

40|$|The {{preceding}} eight chapters {{deal with}} {{the current status of}} collective bargaining in eight U. S. industries. The differences between collective bargaining for police officers and auto workers or between professional athletes and college professors are obvious and illustrate the richness and variety of contemporary collective bargaining. <b>Despite</b> <b>that</b> diversity, <b>however,</b> the eight industries exhibit important similarities in collective bargaining.

50|$|The Romanian {{offensive}} in Transylvania failed mainly due to Bulgaria's attack against Dobruja, which {{opened a new}} front that strained too much the Romanian Army, already fighting on a very large front. Even though Transylvania was relatively quickly re-taken by the combined German-Austro-Hungarian forces, they failed to initially break the Romanian front in the Carpathians, especially in the Prahova Valley, where a successful breakthrough {{could lead to the}} quick capture of Bucharest, cutting off the Romanian Army and forcing the country out of the war. Initial Romanian defensive successes were however short-lived, as the sheer length of the front (1600 km) combined with Central Powers reinforcements eventually forced them to withdraw behind the Siret, in Moldavia. There, despite their precarious situation, they managed to reform, retrain and resupply their Army, which resulted in them winning the greatest victories for the Allies on the European Front in 1917. <b>Despite</b> <b>that,</b> <b>however,</b> they {{had no choice but to}} surrender, after being left alone on the Eastern front following Russia's own surrender and being nearly completely surrounded by the Central Powers.|$|E

Wickets fell with reasonable regularity, despite Daren Powell getting punished by Shahid Afridi and Salman Butt early on. Afridi was run out for a typical 24 off 21 balls - good co-operation between Corey Collymore and wicket-keeper Courtney Browne resulted in that, although it {{would never have been}} out if Afridi hadn't lost his bat in mid-run. The Pakistan team got runs off Powell, but never got the better of Ian Bradshaw, and his hard work and good swing bowling paid off as he got the wicket of Shoaib Malik for 13, who was deceived attempting a cut shot. The score was then slowly increased by the Pakistan team, who reached 108 for 3 after 25 overs - having lost Salman for 43 after a slice that was well taken by Xavier Marshall at point. But from then on, everything went down for Pakistan. Youhana ran himself out on 30 (133 for 4), and Chris Gayle got the big wickets of Inzamam-ul-Haq (23) and Younis Khan (9) to reduce Pakistan to 153 for 6. Only a ninth-wicket partnership between Abdul Razzaq (22) and Iftikhar Anjum (8*) gave Pakistan hope, as they were all out for 192 in 44.3 overs - a target that most saw as possible, even on an Arnos Vale Stadium ground where the average first-innings score is 207.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{establish}} the maximum theoretical efficiency that a viscous flow turbine (such as a Tesla turbine) can achieve. This {{is very much in}} the spirit of the Betz limit for wind turbines. The scaling down of viscous flow turbines is thought not to alter this result, whereas the scaling down of conventional turbines, whether axial or radial flow, results in an ever lowering of their efficiencies. A semiempirical scaling law is developed for conventional gas turbines using published machine performance data, which is fitted to a simple boundary layer model of turbine efficiency. An analytical model is developed for a viscous flow turbine. This is compared to experimental measurements of the efficiency of a Tesla turbine using compressed air. The semiempirical scaling law predicts that below a rotor diameter of between about 11 mm and 4 mm, a practical Brayton cycle is not possible. <b>Despite</b> <b>that,</b> <b>however,</b> and for rotor diameters less than between about 7 mm and 2 mm, a viscous flow turbine, compressor, or pump will be more efficient than a conventional design.

40|$|Russia, {{with total}} {{production}} of 581 bcm (billion of cubic meters), is the world’s leading producer of gas. <b>Despite</b> <b>that,</b> <b>however,</b> the problems currently faced by its gas industry are many and significant.

The Russian gas company is already heavily indebted, while the profitability of a significant portion of its domestic market sales has still to be demonstrated because of very low gas prices and a significant level of non-monetary relations. On the other hand, the progressive deregulation of the European gas market, its principal export market, carries stakes of a different kind for Gazprom. Its most likely effect will be to bring about significant changes to the future long-term gas contracts that form the basis for the long-term financing of investments and therefore the development of industrial capacity. These issues have placed once again on the agenda the oft-repeated and oft-avoided question of reforms in this industry. The latest project, discussed in 2002, was centred on deregulation that consisted in essence of ending the gas company’s monopoly on sales and production. Th...|$|E
40|$|Song {{translation}} {{is one of}} the most difficult forms of translation (Susam-Sarajeva, 2008). In addition to the semantic code, translators have to take account of prosodic, poetic, rhythmic, and audial codes, to name but a few. Di Giovanni (2008) and Chaume (2012) add to this list the visual code, which is not only prevalent in film or musical, but also in popular music (Kaindl, 2005) and other live performance music genres (Low, 2005). The combination of all these factors contribute to establish some exceedingly severe limitations for song translators. 	<b>Despite</b> <b>that,</b> <b>however,</b> it is a surprisingly well-established fact that audiovisual translation in general, and song translation in particular, are relatively new and usually ignored areas of research (Franzon, 2008; Mateo, 2008; Susam-Sarajeva, 2008; Siitonen, 2014). Susam-Sarajeva, in the introduction to her 2008 special issue of The Translator, explains that one of the reasons of this is the relative difficulty and craftsmanship that song translation requires, as song translators should not only be near-fluent in both languages, but also have an extensive knowledge of music or drama theory. Another reason is that the field is somewhat outside the borders of traditional translation studies. A third objection may be that in song translation, the borders between translation, adaptation, and rewriting are not as clear-cut as in most other forms of translation. 	Whatever the exact reasons, however, to date only three major collections seem to have been published on the subject: Songs and Significance, a book of collected articles edited by Gorlée (2005); the aforementioned special issue of The Translator dedicated to music (Susam-Sarajeva, 2008); and Music, Text and Translation, a text book edited by Minors (2013) with chapters by different translation scholars active in the field. This is not to say that there are no other sources, or that the field was only established in 2005 (indeed, articles on the subject have been appearing since the early 20 th century [Gorlée, 2005; Kaindl, 2005]), but research has traditionally been quite sparse...|$|E

Indeed, to go one step further, given the hold on the concept of religion by those committed to the humanistic study of religion, we might need to talk here not of the appropriation but of expropriation of religion by science—that is, of wresting ownership of the concept from the humanists by using it solely as a taxonomic device to differentiate and explain a peculiar range of human behaviour demonstrated in religious practices...|$|R
