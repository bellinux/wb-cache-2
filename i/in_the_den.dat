5|$|The age {{of first}} {{breeding}} in gray wolves {{depends largely on}} environmental factors: when food is plentiful, or when wolf populations are heavily managed, wolves can rear pups at younger ages {{in order to better}} exploit abundant resources. This is further demonstrated by the fact that captive wolves have been known to breed as soon as they reach 9–10 months, while the youngest recorded breeding wolves in the wild were 2 years old. Females are capable of producing pups every year, with one litter annually being the average. Unlike the coyote, the gray wolf never reaches reproductive senescence. Estrus typically occurs in late winter, with older, multiparous females entering estrus 2–3 weeks earlier than younger females. During pregnancy, female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are more likely. Old females usually whelp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>den</b> of their previous litter, while younger females typically den near their birthplace. The gestation period lasts 62–75 days, with pups usually being born in the summer period.|$|E

Mike is present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>den,</b> watching the game, but the two friends do not notice each other at first. When Mike does see Nick, {{he is unable to}} get his attention. When Nick is introduced into the game, he grabs the gun, fires it at the current contestant, and then again at his own temple, causing the audience to riot in protest. Grinda hustles Nick outside to his car to escape the angry mob. Mike cannot catch up with them as they speed away.|$|E

Veronica learns that the main surveillance camera of the sorority was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>den</b> mother's room. The prisoners in the experiment successfully escape from prison. Veronica breaks into the room that is under surveillance and finds that they are growing marijuana. Veronica types up her exposé and hands it to the newspaper editor, but before it is published, one of the sorority members informs Veronica that they are growing the cannabis in order to aid the den mother's cancer. Veronica cannot stop the publication of the article, but she warns the sorority about potential repercussions nonetheless. Mac (Tina Majorino) convinces Parker to stay at Hearst.|$|E

2500|$|Kodiak bears reach sexual {{maturity}} at age five, but most sows are over {{nine years old}} when they successfully wean their first litter. The average time between litters is four years. Sows continue to produce cubs throughout their lives, but their productivity diminishes after they are 20 years old. Mating season for Kodiak bears is during May and June. They are serially monogamous (having one partner at a time), staying together from two days to two weeks. As soon as the egg is fertilized and divides a few times, it enters a state of suspended animation until autumn when it finally implants on the uterine wall and begins to grow again. Cubs are born <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>den</b> during January or February. Weighing less than [...] at birth with little hair and closed eyes, they suckle for several months, emerging from the den in May or June, weighing [...] Typical litter sizes on Kodiak are two or three cubs, with a long-term average of 2.4 cubs per litter. However, Kodiak bears have six functional nipples and litters up to six cubs have been reported. Sows are sometimes seen with five or six cubs in tow, probably due to adopting cubs from other litters. Most cubs stay with their mothers for three years. Almost half of the cubs die before they leave, with cannibalism by adult males {{being one of the}} major causes of death.|$|E

Insulin (0 - 4 u. /ml) replaced the growth-stimulatory properties of protamine-zinc-insulin, whilst protamine sulphate (5 /tg/ml) was found to be toxic to the cells.
