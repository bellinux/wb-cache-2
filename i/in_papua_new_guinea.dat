5|$|By 1943, Japanese expansionary {{moves in}} the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) had ceased. Their advance <b>in</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> had been halted the {{previous}} year by the blocking action that Australian forces had fought along the Kokoda Track. Subsequent defeats at Milne Bay, Buna–Gona, Wau and on Guadalcanal had forced the Japanese on to the back foot. As {{a result of these}} victories, the Allies were able to seize the initiative in the region in mid-1943 and began making plans to continue to push the Japanese back in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Following Japan's {{entry into}} the war, the {{decision}} was made to transfer a large number of Australian troops from the Middle East to the Pacific region. In early 1942, as the Japanese advanced through the Netherlands East Indies, the majority of the battalion was captured during the Battle of Java. A small number of the battalion's personnel returned to Australia and it was subsequently re-raised in mid-1942. It was later attached to the 6th Division as a corps unit and served <b>in</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> during the Aitape–Wewak campaign in 1944–1945. The battalion was disbanded in January 1946.|$|E

5|$|Air Vice Marshal Allan Leslie Walters, CB, CBE, AFC (2November 1905– 19October 1968) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Born in Victoria and raised in Western Australia, {{he graduated from the}} Royal Military College, Duntroon, before transferring to the RAAF in 1928. He was considered one of the service's leading flying instructors and aerobatic pilots between the wars, and was appointed to his first squadron command in 1937. Over the course of World WarII, Walters led No.1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron in Singapore, No.1 (Fighter) Wing in Darwin, Northern Territory, No.72 Wing in Dutch New Guinea, and Northern Command <b>in</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> He was decorated with the Air Force Cross in 1941 for his work with No.1 Squadron, and mentioned in despatches in 1944 for his service with No.72 Wing.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{transfer}} to the Army, the Chinooks were used in similar roles to those they had undertaken in RAAF service. The first operational deployment of the Army Chinooks began in October 1997, when two of the helicopters and three Black Hawks which were <b>in</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> {{as part of a}} training exercise were tasked with delivering food supplies to the highlands of the country following a severe drought. The Chinooks were also used to transport fuel supplies for the other ADF aircraft and helicopters involved in this effort. At this time, the deployment of two Chinooks was the largest the Army could undertake as the other helicopters were undergoing maintenance or were needed for training purposes. The Chinooks returned to Australia in March 1998.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF {{has been}} {{pleased with the}} King Air's {{performance}} in the light transport role, though the aircraft cannot be deployed into combat areas. No. 38 Squadron often operates with the Army's Townsville-based 3rd Brigade, {{as well as the}} 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment, which conducts operational patrols across Far North Queensland during peacetime. The unit is also frequently tasked with transporting senior politicians and other VIPs. The King Airs often operate <b>in</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea,</b> as well as other parts of the Asia-Pacific region. The Australian Government ordered 10 Alenia C-27J Spartan battlefield transports in May 2012, and these aircraft will be operated by No. 35 Squadron from 2015. No. 38 Squadron marked its 70th anniversary in 2013, and has the longest period of continual operation of any of the RAAF's flying squadrons.|$|E
