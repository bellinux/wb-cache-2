50|$|In 2014 Socialist Action gave {{active support}} to the {{campaign}} of the Refugee Union, a group formed {{to fight for the}} rights of asylum seekers in Hong Kong. Together with Socialist Action the Refugee Union activists staged a well-organised and peaceful six-month-long occupation in Central (close to IFC) to demand the government cancels its contract with welfare operator <b>International</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Services</b> (ISS). ISS has attracted massive criticism over its perceived high-handedness and failure to fully meet its contractual obligations in respect of rent and food allowances to refugees who are banned from working in Hong Kong. Following a long campaign, the government (Social Welfare Department) made significant concessions to the Refugee Union’s demands in early 2015. These included replacing the widely criticised food parcels with a coupon system. On 29 January 2015, a deadly fire broke out in the New Territories at a former pig farm converted into slum housing for refugees under an ISS-supported programme. Sri Lankan asylum seeker Sivarajah Sivatharan was killed in the fire, a tragedy that reignited debate over the Hong Kong government's cruel policies towards refugees. Socialist Action joined with Refugee Union members in a protest outside the Social Welfare Department offices in Wan Chai to demand policy changes after the fire.|$|R

This implies that individuals are not simply following patterns driven by clergy and other religious leaders, nor are they volunteering to help their own children based on these immigration patterns. The results gathered for these various different types of volunteering organizations indicate that the patterns for relationships documented are more generally applicable irrespective of the types of volunteering involved.|$|R
