40|$|Challenging the {{conventional}} wisdom that structural problems are to blame for the <b>euro</b> <b>area’s</b> protracted domestic demand stagnation, this paper sets out to shed some fresh light {{on the role of the}} ECB in the ongoing EMU crisis. Contrary to the widely held interpretation of the ECB as an inflation targeter—and a rather soft one, too—it is argued that the key characteristic of the ECB is the pronounced asymmetry in its policy approach and mindset. Curiously, this asymmetry has not only given rise to an antigrowth bias, but to upward price pressures and distortions as well. There is a link between stagnation and inflation persistence that owes to the ECB’s failure to internalize the <b>euro</b> <b>area’s</b> fiscal regime. This raises the question as to whether inflation targeting would have led to better results, or could do so in future.

40|$|Very low policy {{rates as}} well as the {{substantial}} redesign of rules and supervisory institutions have changed background conditions for the <b>Euro</b> <b>Area's</b> financial intermediary sector substantially. Both policy initiatives have been targeted at improving societal welfare. And their potential side effects (or costs) have been discussed intensively, in academic {{as well as}} policy circles. Very low policy rates (and correspondingly low market rates) are likely to whet investors' risk taking incentives. Concurrently, the tightened regulatory framework, in particular for banks, increases the comparative attractiveness of the less regulated, so-called shadow banking sector. Employing flow-of-funds data for the <b>Euro</b> <b>Area's</b> non-bank banking sector we take stock of recent developments {{in this part of the}} financial sector. In addition, we examine to which extent low interest rates have had an impact on investment behavior. Our results reveal a declining role of banks (and, simultaneously, an increase in non-bank banking). Overall intermediation activity, hence, has remained roughly at the same level. Moreover, our findings also suggest that non-bank banks have tended to take positions in riskier assets (particularly in equities). In line with this observation, balance-sheet based risk measures indicate a rise in sector-specific risks in the non-bank banking sector (when narrowly defined) ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} <b>euro</b> <b>area’s</b> {{merchandise trade}} flows {{over the last}} two decades, taking jointly into account their long-run determinants and short-run dynamics. The empirical investigation is based on a reinterpretation of the long-run structural VAR approach, following a two-step procedure. Initially, long-run cointegrating relationships are specified according to economic theory suggestions, allowing to test the empirical relevance of different determination mechanisms of the trade balance. Subsequently, dynamic properties are analyzed using a Subset VECM in which short-run parametric restrictions are imposed through the SER/TP method. Generalized IRFs are used to simulate the effects of a real exchange rate shock on the long-run relationships and on the involved variables, using both an unrestricted and a parsimonious VECM. An assessment of the consequences arising from estimations using different frequencies of data is also presented. The main findings are: i) <b>euro</b> <b>area’s</b> trade flows are determined in the long-run by non-price competitiveness factors, according to the absorption approach; ii) policy actions through a real devaluation produce detrimental effects on the trade balance both in the short- and long-run; iii) a proper recognition of the identified methodological issues (model specification, simulation design and data frequency) may help to improve the reliability of results...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} economists have {{dismissed}} the popular {{belief that the}} debt crisis was caused by excessive social welfare spending. According to their analysis, increased debt levels were mostly due to the large bailout packages provided to the financial sector during the late-2000s financial crisis, and the global economic slowdown thereafter. The average fiscal deficit in the <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> in 2007 was only 0.6% before it grew to 7% during the financial crisis. In the same period, the average government debt rose from 66% to 84% of GDP. The authors also stressed that fiscal deficits in the <b>euro</b> <b>area</b> were stable or even shrinking since the early 1990s. US economist Paul Krugman named Greece as the only country where fiscal irresponsibility {{is at the heart}} of the crisis. British economic historian Robert Skidelsky added that it was indeed excessive lending by banks, not deficit spending that created this crisis. Government's mounting debts are a response to the economic downturn as spending rises and tax revenues fall, not its cause.|$|E
