Recently, patient-specific instrumentation {{was introduced to}} facilitate correct positioning of implants. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the early clinical results of TKA performed with patient-specific CT-based instrumentation and conventional technique. A prospective, randomized controlled trial on 112 patients was performed between January 2011 and December 2011. A group of 112 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental group comprised 52 patients who received the Signature CT-based implant positioning system, and the control group consisted of 60 patients with conventional instrumentation. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with the KSS scale, WOMAC scale, and VAS scales to assess knee pain severity and patient satisfaction with the surgery.

We determined the frequency of occurrence of hip fracture and the baseline factors predicting death and institutionalization at 6 months after hip fracture. METHODS. A representative cohort of 2812 individuals aged 65 years and older was followed prospectively for 6 years. Hip fractures were identified, and the occurrence of death and institutionalization within 6 months of the fracture was determined. Prefracture information on physical and mental function, social support, and demographic features and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data</b> on comorbid diagnoses, fracture site, and complications were analyzed to determine predictors of death and institutionalization after hip fracture. RESULTS. Of 120 individuals suffering a hip fracture, 22 (18 %) died within 6 months and 35 (29 %) were institutionalized at 6 months. The predictors of death in multiple logistic regression included fracture site, a high number of comorbid conditions, a high number of complications, and poor baseline mental status. The primary predictor of institutionalization was poor baseline mental status. CONCLUSIONS.

40|$|The {{increase}} in popularity for wearable technologies (see: Apple Watch and Microsoft Band) {{has opened the}} door for an Internet of Things solution to healthcare. One of the most prevalent healthcare problems today is the poor survival rate of out-of hospital sudden cardiac arrests (9. 5 % on 360, 000 cases in the USA in 2013). It has been proven that heart rate derived features can give an early indicator of sudden cardiac arrest, and that providing an early warning has the potential to save many lives. Many of these new wearable devices are capable of providing this warning through their heart rate sensors. This thesis paper introduces a prospective dataset of physical activity heart rates collected via Microsoft Band. This dataset is indicative of the heart rates that would be observed in the proposed Internet of Things solution. This dataset is combined with public heart rate datasets to provide a dataset larger than many of the ones used in related works and more indicative of out-of-hospital heart rates.

40|$|Background: The triage {{of trauma}} {{patients}} is currently {{based on the}} trauma mechanism. However, {{it is known that}} elderly patients can sustain severe injuries due to insignificant trauma mechanisms. As such, triage methods might be questionable. Objective: To evaluate whether current trauma triage criteria are appropriate in severely injured elderly patients. Methods: To analyze the effect of the trauma mechanism on triage and treatment, consecutive patients >= 55 years of age, with an injury severity score > 15, treated from 2002 to 2005 were divided into those who sustained a high-energy trauma (HET) versus a low energy trauma (LET). Pre-hospital and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data,</b> injury characteristics, and data on mortality and disablement one year postinjury (sickness impact profile) were analyzed for HET and LET groups. Results: Age, sex and co-morbidity rate were similar in 84 HET patients and 107 LET patients. HET patients (mean ISS 28) received more sophisticated trauma care than LET patients (mean ISS 22), although mortality was similar (38 vs. 34 %). Long-term disablement was also similar (median SIP scores 4 vs. 6). Severe head injuries and the Revised Trauma Score were related to mortality. Physical disablement was related to preexisting co-morbidities. No variables were related to psychosocial disablement. Conclusions: In elderly people a low energy trauma may lead to severe consequences. Not only the trauma mechanism, but also age, co-morbidity, and the likelihood of a brain injury should be leading in the triage and subsequent management of severely injured elderly...|$|R

Aware of this burden, the program ‘Via Verde do AVC’ was implemented in Portugal, {{with the objective of}} reducing mortality by stroke, specially on ischemic stroke patients aged between 18 and 80 years old. Objectives: This thesis focus on the performance of ‘Via Verde do AVC’, and aims to assess whether the program has achieved significant health gains, at reasonable costs. Methodology: Individual level <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data</b> on stroke admissions, and regional level stroke mortality rates are studied, in order to assess the program’s impact on mortality. For in-hospital analysis, the impact is measured as a whole, as well as breakdown by expertise level and/or year. In the regional analysis, simple and weighted regressions are performed. Results: The regressions performed do not show statistically significant impact of ‘Via Verde do AVC’ on ischemic stroke mortality. The health status of the patient at arrival (measured by the number of diagnosis), as well as the hospital are the most relevant explanatory variables. For regional analysis, there are significant regional asymmetries in stroke mortality, and time has also been a critical factor for mortality reduction. Conclusions: There is little {{reason to believe that the}} program decreases mortality before or during a hospital stroke episode. Moreover, there are some aspects of the program that should be improved, namely Promotion, Training, and Post-hospital Care...|$|R

Aim of this cohort {{study was to}} analyse two different treatment strategies for DSWI: titanium sternal plating system (TSFS) and muscle flap coverage (MFC). Between January 2007 and December 2011, from 3122 patients undergoing cardiac surgery 42 were identified with DSWI and treated {{with one of the}} above mentioned strategies. <b>In-hospital</b> <b>data</b> were collected, follow-up performed by telephone and assessment of Quality of Life (QoL) using the SF- 12 Health Survey Questionnaire. 20 patients with deep sternal wound infection were stabilized with TSFS and 22 patients treated with MFC. Preoperative demographics and risk factors did not reveal any significant differences. Patients treated with TSFS had a significantly shorter operation time (p< 0. 05) and shorter hospitalization (p< 0. 05). A tendency towards lower mortality rate (p = n. s.) and less re-interventions were also noted (plating 0. 6 vs. flap 1. 17 per patient, n. s.). Quality of Life in the TSFS group for the physical-summary-score was significantly elevated compared to the MFC group (p< 0. 05). Relating to chest stability and cosmetic result the treatment with TSFS showed superior results, but the usage of MFC gave the patients more freedom in breathing and less chest pain. Our results demonstrate that the use of TSFS is a feasible and safe alternative in DSWI. However, MFC remains an absolutely essential option for complicated DSWI since the amount of perfused tissue can be the key for infection control...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{technical}} {{advances in}} thoracic aortic surgery, {{such as the}} use of antegrade cerebral perfusion, avoidance of cross-clamping and the application of glue, have beneficially influenced postoperative outcome. The aim of the present study was to analyse the impact of these developments on outcome of patients undergoing surgery of the thoracic aorta. Methods and results: Between January 1996 and December 2005, 835 patients (37. 6 %) out of 2215 aortic patients underwent surgery on the thoracic ascending aorta or the aortic arch at our institution. All <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data</b> were assessed. Two hundred and forty-one patients (28. 8 %) suffered from acute type A dissection (AADA). Overall aortic caseload increased from 41 patients in 1996 to 141 in 2005 (+ 339 %). The increase was more pronounced for thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) (+ 367. 9 %), than for acute type A aortic dissections (+ 276. 9 %). Especially in TAA, combined procedures increased and the amount of patients with impaired left ventricular function (EF < 50 %) raised up from 14 % in 1996 to 24 % in 2005. Average age remained stable. Logistic regression curve revealed a significant decrease in mortality (AADA) and in the overall incidence of neurological deficits.

Controversy exists regarding the influence of aprotinin on renal function and its effect on the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) and cerebrovascular incidents (CVI). In the present study, we analyzed the incidence of these adverse events in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery under full-dose aprotinin and compared the data with those recently reported by Mangano et al [2006]. For 751 consecutive patients undergoing CABG surgery under full-dose aprotinin (> 4 million kalikrein-inhibitor units) we analyzed <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data</b> on renal dysfunction or failure, MI (defined as creatine kinase-myocardial band > 60 iU/L), and CVI (defined as persistent or transient neurological symptoms and/or positive computed tomographic scan). Average age was 67. 0 +/- 9. 9 years, and patient pre- and perioperative characteristics were similar to those in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database. The mortality (2. 8 %) and incidence of renal failure (5. 2 %) ranged within the reported results. The incidence rates of MI (8 % versus 16 %; P <. 01) and CVI (2 % versus 6 %; P <. 01) however, were significantly lower than those reported by Mangano et al. Thus the data of our single center experience do not confirm the recently reported negative effect of full-dose aprotinin on the incidence of MI and CVI. Therefore, aprotinin may still remain a valid option to reduce postoperative bleeding, especially because of the increased use of aggressive fibrinolytic therapy following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty...|$|R

METHODS: Patients with ISR following bare-metal stenting (BMS) and treated with SES were prospectively studied. Baseline, procedural, and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data</b> were appraised. The primary endpoint was the rate of major cardiovascular events (MACE) at long-term follow up (> 9 months). Secondary endpoints were the individual contributors to MACE. RESULTS: A total of 180 SES were implanted to treat 138 consecutive patients. Procedural success was achieved in all patients without in-hospital death, acute stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent coronary artery bypass. During follow up, MACE occurred in 5. 8 % of patients at 6 months, 14. 3 % at 12 months, and 25 % at 24 months. Specifically, all-cause mortality was 1. 7 % at 6 months, 3. 5 % at 12 months, and 4. 8 % at 24 months, for a total of 5 deaths. Target vessel revascularization occurred at 6, 12, and 24 months in 4. 2 %, 11. 2 %, and 15. 9 % of patients, respectively, while target lesion revascularization (TLR) alone accounted for 3. 4 % at 6 months, 9. 6 % at 12 months, and 11 % at 24 months. Three case of myocardial infarction occurred during follow up (2. 2 %), without any surgical revascularization or stent thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ISR with SES appears safe and effective, even if a 10 % annual rate of MACE can be expected, with a sizable portion of these due to apparently nontarget lesion events. © 2007 HMP Communications | All Rights Reserved...|$|R

We retrospectively analysed <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data</b> for 244 consecutive adult patients who underwent surgical treatment of congenital cardiac disease in our centre between January, 1998 and December, 2007. The mean patient age was 27. 2 plus or minus 11. 9 years, 29 % were in functional class III or IV, and 25 % were cyanosed. Of the patients, half were operated on for the first time. A total of 61 % of patients underwent curative operations, 36 % a reoperation after curative treatment, and 3 % a palliative operation. Overall mortality was 4. 9 %. Predictive factors for hospital death were functional class, cyanosis, non-sinus rhythm, a history of only palliative previous operation(s), and an indication for palliative treatment. Functional class, cyanosis, type of initial congenital cardiac disease (single ventricle and double-outlet right ventricle), and only palliative previous operation were risk factors for prolonged intensive care stay (more than 48 hours). The surgical management of adult patients with congenital cardiac disease has improved during recent decades.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Different {{studies have}} {{analyzed}} {{the potential impact}} of the underlying pathologic process and the use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest on outcome and quality of life after surgery on the thoracic aorta. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the impact of different surgical procedures on outcome and quality of life. METHODS: Between June 2001 and December 2003, 244 patients underwent surgery for various diseases of the ascending aorta with or without involvement of the aortic valve or root. They were divided according to the operative procedure: 76 patients (31. 2 %) underwent isolated replacement of the ascending aorta, 42 patients (17. 2 %) received separate aortic valve replacement and supracoronary replacement of the ascending aorta, 86 patients (35. 2 %) received a mechanical composite graft, and 40 patients (16. 4 %) received a biologic composite graft. All <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data</b> were assessed, and a follow-up was performed in all survivors after 26. 6 +/- 8. 8 months, focusing on outcome and quality of life (SF- 36). RESULTS: Overall in-hospital mortality was 6. 1 %, and late mortality was 5. 7 %, with no significant difference between groups. Independent of the surgical technique and the extent of surgery, there was no difference in quality of life between the surgical collective and an age-matched and sex-matched standard population. CONCLUSIONS: Operations of the ascending aorta and aortic valve are very safe, with low in-hospital mortality and favorable midterm outcome regarding late mortality and morbidity. Quality of life after operations of the ascending aorta and aortic valve is equal to a standard population and is not affected by the surgical procedure. Liberal use of aortic root replacement is therefore justified to radically treat the diseased aortic segment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{have shown}} that {{selective}} antegrade cerebral perfusion improves mid-term {{quality of life in}} patients undergoing surgical repair for acute type A aortic dissection and aortic aneurysms. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the impact of continuous cerebral perfusion through the right subclavian artery on immediate outcome and quality of life. METHODS: Perioperative data of 567 consecutive patients who underwent surgery of the aortic arch using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest have been analyzed. Patients were divided into three groups, according to the management of cerebral protection. Three hundred eighty-seven patients (68. 3 %) had deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with pharmacologic protection with pentothal only, 91 (16. 0 %) had selective antegrade cerebral perfusion and pentothal, and 89 (15. 7 %) had continuous cerebral perfusion through the right subclavian artery and pentothal. All <b>in-hospital</b> <b>data</b> were assessed, and quality of life was analyzed prospectively 2. 4 +/- 1. 2 years after surgery with the Short Form- 36 Health Survey Questionnaire. RESULTS: Major perioperative cerebrovascular injuries were observed in 1. 1 % of the patients with continuous cerebral perfusion through the right subclavian artery, compared with 9. 8 % with selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (p < 0. 001) and 6. 5 % in the group with no antegrade cerebral perfusion (p = 0. 007). Average quality of life after an arrest time between 30 and 50 minutes with continuous cerebral perfusion through the right subclavian artery was significantly better than selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (90. 2 +/- 12. 1 versus 74. 4 +/- 40. 7; p = 0. 015). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous cerebral perfusion through the right subclavian artery improves considerably perioperative brain protection during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Irreversible perioperative neurologic complications can be significantly reduced and duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest can be extended up to 50 minutes without impairment in quality of life...|$|R
