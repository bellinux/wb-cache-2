5|$|An {{injunction}} is {{an equitable}} private law remedy that restrains a public body from <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> act that is wrongful or ultra vires. Following law {{reforms in the}} United Kingdom in 1977, it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders {{as well as a}} declaration or injunction in the same set of legal proceedings. As these reforms have not been followed in Singapore, the Singapore High Court is not empowered to grant injunctions under Order 53 of the Rules of Court.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{animation}} required for Deadpool's mask and Colossus, Reese and Wernick had more freedom than usual to keep adjusting the script during post-production. Reynolds recorded new lines of dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded {{the lines in}} an additional dialogue recording session once the film was finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> impression of Wolverine star Hugh Jackman's natural Australian accent, and another where Deadpool asks whether the character Professor X is being portrayed by James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart {{at that point in}} the X-Men timeline, which became a favorite line in the film for many audience members.|$|E

5|$|Co-writer Glen Morgan felt <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> episode on vampires was a mistake, {{and said}} that they were also criticized for having Mulder fall for Kristen. Co-writer James Wong was also disappointed, saying that the script was a lot better than the show and that the episode was {{weakened}} when Fox censors had problems with the episode. Actor David Duchovny thought the episode had style, but suffered some lapses in logic, including the scene where Kristen shaves Mulder before the two kiss.|$|E
5|$|Dave Guard and Bob Shane {{had been}} friends since junior high school at the Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii where both had learned to play ukulele in {{required}} music classes. They had developed an interest in and admiration for native Hawaiian slack key guitarists like Gabby Pahinui. While in Punahou's secondary school, Shane taught first himself and then Guard the rudiments of the six-string guitar, and the two began performing at parties and in school shows <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> eclectic mix of Tahitian, Hawaiian, and calypso songs.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2012, NYSDOT {{announced}} {{a project to}} reconstruct NY149 and its junction with US4 in Fort Ann. The project would upgrade the intersection by <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> overall expansion, requiring the condemnation of one property. This new widening would help make turns from US4 south to NY149 west. The intersection would be repaved and drainage basins on US4 and NY149, which would tie into the system on Clay Hill Road. NYSDOT's website notes that announced that bids of the new project were announced in Fall2013 with construction beginning soon after. The slated date of completion for the $1.3million project would be in Fall2014.|$|E

5|$|The Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from {{granting}} injunctions {{against the}} Government {{or one of}} its officers. An injunction is an equitable private law remedy that restrains a public authority from <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> act that is wrongful or ultra vires. In place of an injunction, the Court may make a declaration concerning the parties' rights. At common law, there is no general right to claim damages – that is, monetary compensation – if rules of public law have been breached by an authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person {{must be able to}} establish a private law claim in contract or tort law.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam {{appointed}} Senator Murphy to the High Court, {{even though}} Murphy's Senate seat {{would not be}} up for election if a half-Senate election were held. Labor then held {{three of the five}} short-term New South Wales Senate seats. Under proportional representation, Labor could hold its three short-term seats in the next half-Senate election but, if Murphy's seat were also contested, Labor was unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, a Murphy appointment meant the almost certain loss of a seat in the closely divided Senate at the next election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent. By March 1975, many Liberal parliamentarians felt that Snedden was <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> inadequate job as leader of the Opposition, and that Whitlam was dominating him in the House of Representatives. Malcolm Fraser challenged Snedden for the leadership, and defeated him on 21 March.|$|E

There was also a parody involving Schapelle Corby's case and a future {{version of the}} show, still hosted by Jason Gunn where Invercargill mayor Tim Shadbolt had finally been voted off and was to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> final dance with his new partner, a walking frame.|$|R

25|$|After AutoRun completes, AutoPlay initiates by <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> {{examination}} of the volume for content. This is called content sniffing. AutoPlay decides whether the volume is an Audio CD, movie DVD, a blank recordable medium (a CD-R, CD-RW, DVD+R etc.) or a generic volume which contains files.|$|E

25|$|If ρ = 0, {{then the}} fixed points are neither {{attractive}} nor repulsive but indifferent, and the transformation {{is said to}} be elliptic. These transformations tend to move all points in circles around the two fixed points.

25|$|The {{notion of}} how dances {{were to be}} {{executed}} changed dramatically over the years.

25|$|Corporals Pares and Gill, were <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> {{excellent}} job.

They took out four or five this way and all the time they were giving the rest of us a running commentary.|$|E
