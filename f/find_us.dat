25|$|We can't {{tell you}} who we are. Or where we live. It's too risky, and we've got to be careful. Really careful. So we don't trust anyone. Because if they <b>find</b> <b>us...</b> well, we just won't let them <b>find</b> <b>us..</b>|$|E
25|$|The second LP, <b>Find</b> <b>Us</b> A Way {{showed the}} band {{moving away from}} their R roots and taking in new {{influences}} from acts like The Spencer Davis Group, who were themselves starting {{to move away from}} their earlier style. This album contained some original compositions as well as stage favourites. Although they were apparently unhappy about not being not consulted over the final track selection or the cover art, it also sold very well.|$|E
25|$|My Lord, - We beg {{leave to}} thank your lordship for {{presiding}} at this, our first examination, and we trust that the progress {{which we have}} made in out studies will meet with your approval, and also of our parents. We feel assured that your lordship's approbation will prove a stimulus to our future exertions, and that next Christmas (with God's blessing) will <b>find</b> <b>us</b> much further advanced, not only in our secular studies, but in the great study you so strongly recommended to our attention on your late visit, namely - 'the study of God's laws {{and those of the}} Church.' We conclude, begging your lordship's apostolic benediction, and wishing you a merry Christmas and many happy New Years. Signed on behalf of the pupils of St Peter's School. Laurence Lorigan.|$|E

6000|$|... "Believe me, {{my young}} friend," [...] she replied musingly, [...] "it's {{never in my}} {{experience}} what's unprepared for that <b>finds</b> <b>us</b> least expecting it. Not that it was actually his leg was in my mind." ...|$|R
500|$|In this meeting, Said Bey had {{attempted}} to dissuade Lynch of his plans {{to travel to the}} Dead Sea, with Aqil remarking that the Bedouin of the Ghor (Jordan Valley) would [...] "eat them up". Lynch's reply was that [...] "they would <b>find</b> <b>us</b> difficult of digestion," [...] but he suggested that as Aqil seemed to hold influence with these tribes, he would be prepared to pay him to make the trip a more peaceable one.|$|E
500|$|Just {{after midnight}} on August 21, Ichiki's {{main body of}} troops arrived at the east bank of Alligator Creek and were {{surprised}} to encounter the Marine positions, not having expected to <b>find</b> <b>U.S.</b> forces located that distance from the airfield. [...] Nearby U.S. Marine listening posts heard [...] "clanking" [...] sounds, human voices, and other noises before withdrawing {{to the west bank}} of the creek. At 01:30 Ichiki's force opened fire with machine guns and mortars on the Marine positions on {{the west bank of the}} creek, and a first wave of about 100 Imperial soldiers charged across the sandbar towards the Marines.|$|E
500|$|I {{then would}} [...] {{convince}} reasonable {{men of the}} importance of some of my remarks; and prevail on them to weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations.– I appeal to their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature, claim, in the name of my sex, some interest in their hearts. I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion, to make her a help meet for them! Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would <b>find</b> <b>us</b> more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers– in a word, better citizens.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, monsieur--" [...] {{he began}} {{in a tone of}} protest, which I set down to the way a {{landlord}} has of making difficulties that he shall be the better paid for such lodging as he <b>finds</b> <b>us.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope," [...] Dick said, as they {{returned}} from their ride, [...] "that Tippoo {{will not be}} long before he <b>finds</b> <b>us</b> some other duties. There is nothing very interesting in counting carcases, or seeing rice measured." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have played}} a trick on your friend," [...] said Conolly. [...] "He {{suggested}} this visit; and I did not tell him {{of the relation between}} <b>us.</b> <b>Finding</b> <b>us</b> on terms of familiarity, if not of affection, he is naturally surprised." ...|$|R
500|$|A free-flow {{electronic}} {{charging system}} called Dart Charge began in November 2014 based on automatic number plate recognition. The charge can be paid online or phone in advance or by midnight {{the day after}} crossing, but {{can no longer be}} paid in cash at the site since the old toll booths have been removed. However, cash payments are accepted at some Payzone shops. Reminder signs on approaches to the crossing say [...] "Dart charge; <b>find</b> <b>us</b> online. Pay by midnight tomorrow." [...] Charges run between 6am and 10pm and this is indicated on overhead-gantry signs. The charges for the crossing as of November 2014 are as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|At {{roughly the}} same time as Quatermass II was being {{transmitted}} by the BBC, Hammer Film Productions released their film adaptation of the first serial in British cinemas. Directed by Val Guest, it was retitled The Quatermass Xperiment, and starred American actor Brian Donlevy as part of a deal to help the film <b>find</b> <b>US</b> distribution. Kneale, who had little involvement with the film, was unimpressed with this casting. [...] "I may have picked Quatermass's surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind." [...] Val Guest has praised Donlevy's performance, saying that [...] "he gave it absolute reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heinrich Gimpel, {{a hidden}} Jew {{serving as an}} officer at the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht in Berlin. Heinrich is careful and meticulous about {{maintaining}} his masquerade: originally even from the reader, who goes through nearly a whole chapter before finding that Gimpel is a hidden Jew and a leader of a secret Jewish community. Heinrich's specific job is to monitor the American payment of tribute to Germany and detect the frequent attempts to avoid payment. Gimpel is arrested because a friend's wife denounces him as a Jew, without knowing he really is one, because he resisted her sexual advances. Gimpel is eventually released from custody, an SS major who escorts {{him out the door}} casually remarking to him: [...] "You <b>find</b> <b>us</b> in the oddest places." ...|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} :We are, if anything, creatures of habits. Drawn {{to the safety}} and comfort of the familiar. But {{what happens when the}} familiar becomes unsafe, when the fear that we have been desperately trying to avoid <b>finds</b> <b>us</b> where we live? ...|$|R
6000|$|We know not, and we {{need not}} To know how mortals fare, Of Bills that pass, or speed not, Time <b>finds</b> <b>us</b> unaware, Yea, creeds and codes may crumble, And Dilke and Gladstone stumble, And eat the pie that's humble, We neither know nor care! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{some of you}} hit him?" [...] {{the leader}} asked, angrily. [...] "We mustn't keep the fun up very long, for the boss is bound to come mighty soon, an' there'll be a row that amounts to {{something}} if he <b>finds</b> <b>us</b> foolin' like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|Scopus nodded. [...] "Very well, Beric. I shall {{go first}} {{to the house of}} Gallus the praetor, he is one of my best friends. After we are done there we will go to the aid of Lysimachus the senator; so, if you don't <b>find</b> <b>us</b> at the house of Gallus, you will <b>find</b> <b>us</b> there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw you swinging," [...] he muttered, [...] "swinging by {{that piece}} of cord! There was a great black pin through your heart. Elizabeth, if he should get away sometime! If some one should come over from America and {{discover}} where he was! If he should <b>find</b> <b>us</b> out! Oh, my God, if he should <b>find</b> <b>us</b> out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing until we've been to {{the house}} in Soho. If Beresford has still got the upper hand, there's nothing to fear. If otherwise, our enemy will come to <b>find</b> <b>us,</b> and he will not <b>find</b> <b>us</b> unprepared!" [...] From a drawer in the desk, he took a service revolver, and placed it in his coat pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a man," [...] she remarked, [...] "in the stalls, who <b>finds</b> <b>us</b> {{apparently}} {{more interesting}} than the performance. I do not see very well even with my glasses, but I fancy, no! I am quite sure, that his face is familiar to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Glidden <b>finds</b> <b>U.S.</b> Marine Steve Gallagher (Gary Cooper) and {{his good}} buddies Mulligan (Jack Oakie) and O'Brien (Roscoe Karns) in the stockade for {{striking}} their sergeant.

6000|$|... "Hardly that, Watson. You will, I am sure, {{agree with}} me that if the page be given, {{the number of the}} chapter is immaterial. Also that if page 534 <b>finds</b> <b>us</b> only in the second chapter, the length of the first one must have been really intolerable." ...|$|R

60|$|So the {{beginning}} of this eventful 1865, which <b>finds</b> <b>us</b> still treading the wine-press of our great conflict, should bring with it a serene and solemn hope, a joy such as those had with whom {{in the midst of the}} fiery furnace there walked one like unto the Son of God.|$|R
