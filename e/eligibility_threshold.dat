40|$|In {{an effort}} to balance their budgets many states are {{considering}} reducing eligibility for Medicaid. Using variation in state policies, this paper models the effect of more stringent eligibility criteria for Medicaid on the insurance status {{and the use of}} antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for people living with HIV, a group heavily dependent on Medicaid. Using nationally representative data from the mid- 1990 's, we find that stricter <b>eligibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> for Medicaid raise uninsurance rates and reduce the use of antiretroviral therapy among HIV+ patients, especially for those who are disabled. These stricter <b>eligibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> in turn adversely affect the survival prospects of HIV+ patients by lowering the rate of HAART use. Our estimates suggest approximately 13, 000 lives could have been saved if all states had adopted the <b>eligibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> of California. We do not find any evidence of a "crowding out" effect of public insurance on private coverage among these patients. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether there would be racial and ethnic disparities in meeting eligibility criteria for medication therapy management (MTM) services implemented in 2006 for Medicare beneficiaries. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Secondary data analyses of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2004 - 2005). STUDY DESIGN: Logistic regression and recycled predictions were {{used to test the}} disparities in meeting eligibility criteria across racial and ethnic groups. The <b>eligibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> used by health plans in 2006 and new thresholds recommended for 2010 were examined. Racial and ethnic disparities were examined by comparing non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) with non-Hispanic whites (whites) and comparing Hispanics with whites, respectively. Disparities were also examined among individuals with severe health problems. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: According to 2006 thresholds, the adjusted odds ratios for meeting eligibility criteria for blacks and Hispanics to whites were 0. 36 - 0. 60 (p<. 05) and 0. 13 - 0. 46 (p<. 05), respectively. Blacks and Hispanics would be 21 - 34 and 32 - 38 percent, respectively, less likely to be eligible than whites according to recycled predictions. Similar patterns were found using the 2010 <b>eligibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> and among individuals with severe health problems.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} the use of prenatal care by pregnant women and the utilization of medical care by children, eligibility for Medicaid was expanded dramatically for pregnant women and children during the 1980 s and early 1990 s. By lowering the costs of prenatal care, delivery, and child health care for some individuals, Medicaid expansions may prompt some women to give birth who otherwise would not have children or lead some women to have more children than they otherwise would have. This study uses natality data from 1983 to 1996 {{to examine the relationship}} between a state's <b>eligibility</b> <b>threshold</b> for Medicaid and birth rates among various groups. The results suggest that expansions have significant and sizable effects on births.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which public health insurance crowds out purchases of private insurance. Specifically, the effect of Medicaid's medically needy program on the probability that an individual will buy private insurance is investigated. Evidence presented here suggests that the presence of the medically needy program and more specifically, its relative generosity significantly reduces the likelihood that an individual will purchase private insurance. For individuals living in more generous medically needy states, the crowd out is particularly evident for individuals whose family incomes lie closest to the <b>eligibility</b> <b>thresholds.</b> This does suggest that expansions of public coverage not only provide a "net" for the targeted uninsured, but also may attract individuals into the "net" who would otherwise seek private insurance. Such crowding out has serious implications for the net benefits of such public expansions. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{families}} with children, employment {{comes at a}} price. They must subtract from their wages the cost of someone else caring for their child. Their wage minus the costs of obtaining child care, transportation, and other expenses that may be generated by employment is generally {{referred to as the}} effective wage. The Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) child care subsidy voucher, the Earned In-come Tax Credit (EITC), and the Child and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC) are all intended to increase the effective wage of parents to support them enter-ing and staying in the workforce. This paper explores the trade-offs between employment and effective wage that parents must make through the lens of three hypothetical North Carolina families facing promotion, bonus, and employer relocation opportunities. Through their eyes we understand why it would be rational to turn down these opportunities due to the potential loss {{of thousands of dollars in}} benefits. These situations demonstrate the weaknesses of the cur-rent system, where the needs of employers and employees become increasingly opposed as families approach the income <b>eligibility</b> <b>threshold</b> and the portability threshold. This paper proposes a policy to better align the needs of employers and employees by restructuring the incentive system to phase out benefits gradu-ally, guarantee help to anyone who is eligible, make support sensitive to regional changes in child care prices, and administer it through the tax system rather than local social services offices throughout the country.

Whether this is attributable to a new complication for the same body system (such as an original impairment of chronic bronchitis and a new impairment of emphysema both recorded as a respiratory impairment) or a relapse of the original condition (such as a recurrence of cancer) is not readily identifiable in our data. Additionally, any change in diagnosis upon return may not represent a new impairment since some secondary or unrecorded impairments may have become more expressed. That is, the condition was always present but was not reflected as the “primary” impairment in SSA records.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of large changes in the {{duration}} of unemployment insurance (UI) in different economic environments on labor supply, job matches, and search behavior. We show that differences in <b>eligibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> by exact age {{give rise to a}} valid regression discontinuity design, which we implement using administrative data on the universe of new unemployment spells and career histories over twenty years from Germany. We find that increases in UI have small to modest effects on non-employment rates, a result robust over the business cycle and across demographic groups. Thus, large expansions in UI during recessions do not lead to lasting increases in unemployment duration, nor can they explain differences in unemployment durations across countries. We do not find any effect of increased UI duration on average job quality, but show that the mean potentially confounds differential effects on job search across the distribution of UI duration. However, it appears that for a majority of UI beneficiaries increases in UI duration may lead to small declines in wages...|$|R
40|$|The United States federal {{mandatory}} minimums {{have been}} controversial {{not only because}} of the length of the mandatory sentences for even first-time offenders, but also because the eligibility quantities for crack are very small when compared to those for other drugs.

Moreover, despite lower quantity <b>eligibility</b> <b>thresholds</b> for crack, a smaller fraction of crack offenders are eligible for mandatory minimums relative to other drugs. Furthermore, while being just eligible for a mandatory minimum increases sentence length on average, the impact is not uniform across drugs. Notably, sentences for crack offenders are generally sufficiently long such that, on average, sentences for crack offenders are not impacted by eligibility for a mandatory minimum. In summary, the discrepancy in federal sentencing between crack offenders and those convicted for other drugs does not appear to be driven by mandatory minimums, but rather other aspects of federal sentencing policy and norms...|$|R
