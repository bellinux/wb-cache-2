40|$|Fifty radiolarian {{events of}} early Pleistocene and Neogene age were {{identified}} in an E-W transect of equatorial DSDP sites, extending from the Gulf of Panama to the western Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans. Our objective was to document the degree of synchroneity or time-transgressiveness of stratigraphically-useful <b>datum</b> <b>levels</b> from this geologic time interval. We restricted our study to low latitudes within which morphological variations of individual taxa are minimal, the total assemblage diversity remains high, and stratigraphic continuity is well-documented by an independent set of criteria. Each of the five sites chosen (503, 573, 289 / 586, 214) was calibrated to an "absolute" time scale, using a multiple of planktonic foraminiferal, nannofossil, and diatom <b>datum</b> <b>levels</b> which have been independently correlated to the paleomagnetic polarity time scale in piston core material. With these correlations we have assigned "absolute" ages to each radiolarian event, with a precision of 0. 1 - 0. 2 m. y. and an accuracy of 0. 2 - 0. 4 m. y. On this basis we have classified each of the events as either: (a) synchronous (range of ages 1. 0 m. y.); and (c) not resolvable (range of ages 0. 4 - 1. 0 m. y.). Our results show that, among the synchronous <b>datum</b> <b>levels,</b> a large majority (15 out of 19) are last occurrences. Among those events which are clearly time-transgressive, most are first appearances (10 out of 13). In many instances taxa appear to evolve first in the Indian Ocean, and subsequently in the western and eastern Pacific Ocean. This pattern is particularly unexpected {{in view of the}} strong east-to-west zonal flow in equatorial latitudes. Three of the time-transgressive events have been used to define zonal boundaries: the first appearances of Spongaster pentas, Diartus hughesi, and D. petterssoni. Our results suggest that biostratigraphic non-synchroneity may be substantial (i. e., greater than 1 m. y.) within a given latitudinal zone; one would expect this effect to be even more pronounced across oceanographic and climatic gradients. We anticipate that the extent of diachroneity may be comparable for diatom, foraminiferal, and nannofossil <b>datum</b> <b>levels</b> as well. If this proves true, global "time scales" may need to be re-formulated {{on the basis of a}} smaller number of demonstrably synchronous events...|$|R

These include 17 first appearance <b>datum</b> <b>levels</b> (FAD), 10 last appearance <b>datum</b> <b>levels</b> (LAD), and 5 coiling-change events in trochospiral species. The studied succession has been subdivided into nine planktonic foraminiferal zones (viz. downsequence N. 22, N. 21, N. 20, N. 19, N. 18, N. 17 B, N. 17 A-N. 16, N. 15, N. 8). The zonal index species occur in the expected stratigraphic order for zonal correlation, {{but some of the}} zonal boundaries may be diachronous compared to other localities in the western Pacific region. The FAD of Globorotalia (Truncorotalia) truncatulinoides (d' Orbigny) at 714. 10 mbsf defines the boundary between the Zone N. 22 and N. 21; the boundary between Zones N. 21 and N. 20 at 741. 73 mbsf is marked by the FAD of Globorotalia (Truncorotalia) tosaensis Takayanagi and Saito. The lower boundary of Zone N. 20 is placed at 747. 65 mbsf, based on the FAD of Globorotalia (Truncorotalia) crassaformis s. s. (Galloway and Wissler); the FAD of Sphaeroidinella dehiscens (Parker and Jones) at 756. 61 mbsf defines the boundary between Zones N. 18 and N. 19. The FAD of Globorotalia (Globorotalia) tumida tumida (Brady) at 811. 15 mbsf marks the boundary between Zones N. 18 and N. 17 B. The boundary between Zones N. 17 B and N. 17 Ais placed at 843. 52 mbsf, based on the FAD of Pulleniatina primalis Banner and Blow. A change in depositional conditions occurs at 846. 4 mbsf just below the Zone N. 17 B lower boundary and is marked by the first appearance of abundant planktonic foraminifers in the region. The interval between 849. 13 and 856. 1 mbsf is placed in undifferentiated Zones N. 17 A and N. 16, based on the rare occurrence of Neogloboquadrina acostaensis (Blow). The sparsely fossiliferous volcanic sandstone unit between 934. 19 and 955. 67 mbsf is positioned within Zone N. 15 based on the presence of Globigerina (Zeaglobigerina) nepenthes Todd and Globigerinoides (Zeaglobigerina) druryi Arkers, and absence of N. acostaensis and Globorotalia (Jenkinsella) siakensis LeRoy. An unconformity between 955. 67 and 971. 80 mbsf may explain the absence of Zones N. 14 through N. 9. Basal Zone N. 8 is recognized at 971. 80 to 1008. 60 mbsf by the presence of Globigerinoides sicanus De Stefani and the absence of Praeorbulina and Orbulina spp. The age of the succession between 702. 49 and 1008. 6 mbsf extends from the latest Pliocene or earliest Pleistocene (Zone N. 22) to the earliest middle Miocene (Zone N. 8).

Nordic Seas Sites 907 and 985 - 987 feature generally rare to common and moderately well-preserved planktonic foraminifers only within the past 1 m. y., although Pliocene taxa are sparsely recorded at Site 986 on the Svalbard margin. Planktonic foraminifer <b>datum</b> <b>levels</b> are located to the section level where possible for the subpolar North Atlantic sites. Comparison to an integrated magnetostratigraphy and calcareous nannofossil stratigraphy shows that several <b>datum</b> <b>levels</b> are synchronous to within 5 % of their published ages. In particular, {{the start of the}} Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) Acme Zone (1. 8 Ma), the first occurrence (FO) of Globorotalia inflata (2. 09 Ma), the last occurrence (LO) of Globorotalia cf. crassula (3. 3 Ma), and the FO of Globorotalia puncticulata (4. 5 Ma) are judged synchronous in eastern sections of the subpolar North Atlantic. The LO of Neogloboquadrina atlantica (sinistral) occurs ~ 100 - 200 k. y. later relative to its mid-latitude North Atlantic age (2. 41 Ma) ...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the several}} sites drilled during Leg 22, Site 214 is of special {{interest}} to biostratigraphers because this continu-ously cored section contains well-preserved siliceous and calcareous microfossils cooccurring over part of the cored interval. Planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nanno-fossils occur from the Recent {{at the top of}} the hole down to Paleocene sediments. Progressively shallower facies towards the bottom of the hole, and possible hiatuses just above this shallow facies, make this portion of the section less useful than the middle Eocene to Recent interval. Nannofossils as well as planktonic foraminifera occur in normal succession above the middle Eocene, though some-what attenuated in the Eocene and Oligocene. Usable Radiolaria occur only from the middle Miocene up. Selected <b>datum</b> <b>levels</b> of the three microfossil groups a...|$|R
5000|$|A Bill was {{introduced}} into Parliament {{for the new}} line from Cinderford Bridge, passing through two tunnels, and touching the village of Blakeney {{on the way to}} Brimspill. However the Bill was thrown out for failing to comply with standing orders; some buildings had been omitted from the plans and there was a discrepancy in the <b>datum</b> <b>levels.</b> The chairman, Protheroe, immediately wrote to Stephenson, but he was abroad and George Parker Bidder replied. Bidder could only plead the difficulty of complying with the new and complicated standing orders, and dismissed a 12 feet inaccuracy in a level as [...] "purely clerical ... not significant". The company decided to re-apply for an Act, but the idea was overtaken by the idea of main line railways in the area.|$|R
