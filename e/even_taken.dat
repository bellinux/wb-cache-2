5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has emerged}} as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. However, there are strong indications the theory is incomplete. The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open. Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics. <b>Even</b> <b>taken</b> as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration. Mathematical relativists seek {{to understand the nature of}} singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations, while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes). In February 2016, it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the Advanced LIGO team on September 14, 2015. A century after its introduction, general relativity remains a highly active area of research.|$|E

500|$|Shakur {{was convicted}} on all eight counts: two murder charges, and six assault charges. The {{prosecution}} {{did not need}} to prove that Shakur fired the shots that killed either Trooper Foerster or Zayd Shakur: being an accomplice to murder carries an equivalent life sentence under New Jersey law. Upon hearing the verdict, Shakur said—in a [...] "barely audible voice"—that she was [...] "ashamed that I have <b>even</b> <b>taken</b> part in this trial" [...] and that the jury was [...] "racist" [...] and had [...] "convicted a woman with her hands up". Judge Appleby told the court attendants to [...] "remove the prisoner" [...] and Shakur replied: [...] "the prisoner will walk away on her own feet". After Joseph W. Lewis, the jury foreman, read the verdict, Kunstler asked that the jury be removed before alleging that one juror had violated the sequestration order (see above).|$|E
500|$|The Atlantic puffin is sturdily {{built with}} a thick-set neck and short wings and tail. It is [...] in length {{from the tip}} of its stout bill to its blunt-ended tail. Its {{wingspan}} is [...] and on land it stands about [...] high. The male is generally slightly larger than the female, but they are coloured alike. The forehead, crown and nape are glossy black, as are the back, wings and tail. A broad black collar extends around the neck and throat. On each side of the head is a large, lozenge-shaped area of very pale grey. These face patches taper to a point and nearly meet {{at the back of the}} neck. The shape of the head creates a crease extending from the eye to the hindmost point of each patch giving the appearance of a grey streak. The eye looks almost triangular in shape because of a small, peaked area of horny blue-grey skin above it and a rectangular patch below. The irises are brown or very dark blue and each has red orbital ring. The underparts of the bird, the breast, belly and undertail coverts, are white. By the end of the breeding season, the black plumage may have lost its shine or <b>even</b> <b>taken</b> on a slightly brownish tinge. The legs are short and set well back on the body giving the bird its upright stance on land. Both legs and large webbed feet are bright orange, contrasting with the sharp black claws.|$|E

Surviving examples of Germanic effigies, such as the phallic idol recovered in a bog in Broddenbjerg, Denmark, show that among some of the continental Germanic peoples at least, religious idols were naturally human-like wooden shapes that had been roughly carved to make their appearance more human-like.|$|E

2500|$|Political {{changes were}} another {{cause of the}} flapper culture. World War I reduced {{the grip of the}} class system {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, {{encouraging}} different classes to mingle and share their sense of freedom. Women finally won the right to vote in the United States on August 26, 1920. Women wanted to be men's social equals and were faced with the difficult realization of the larger goals of feminism: individuality, full political participation, economic independence, and 'sex rights'. They wanted to be treated like men and go smoking and drinking. In addition, many women had more opportunities in the workplace and had <b>even</b> <b>taken</b> traditionally male jobs such as doctors, lawyers, engineers and pilots. The rise of consumerism also promoted the ideals of [...] "fulfilment and freedom", which encouraged women to think independently about their garments, careers, social activities.|$|E
2500|$|Around a {{thousand}} poems attributed to him are extant. His poems {{have been collected}} into the most important Tang dynasty poetry anthology Heyue yingling ji, compiled in 753 by Yin Fan, and thirty-four of his poems {{are included in the}} anthology Three Hundred Tang Poems, which was first published in the 18th century. In the same century, translations of his poems began to appear in Europe. The poems were models for celebrating the pleasures of friendship, the depth of nature, solitude, and the joys of drinking wine. Among the most famous are [...] "Waking from Drunkenness on a Spring Day", [...] "The Hard Road to Shu", and [...] "Quiet Night Thought", which still appear in school texts in China. In the West, multi-lingual translations of Li's poems continue to be made.

2500|$|In the Eastern Orthodox Christian {{tradition}} {{there are}} reports of particular, Wonderworking icons that exude myrrh (fragrant, healing oil), or perform miracles upon petition by believers. When such reports are verified by the Orthodox hierarchy, they are understood as miracles performed by God through the prayers of the saint, rather than being magical properties of the painted wood itself. Theologically, all icons are considered to be sacred, and are miraculous by nature, being a means of spiritual communion between the heavenly and earthly realms. However, {{it is not uncommon for}} specific icons to be characterised as [...] "miracle-working", meaning that God has chosen to glorify them by working miracles through them. [...] Such icons are often given particular names (especially those of the Virgin Mary), and <b>even</b> <b>taken</b> from city to city where believers gather to venerate them and pray before them. Islands like that of Tinos are renowned for possessing such [...] "miraculous" [...] icons, and are visited every year by thousands of pilgrims.|$|E

2500|$|On March 14, finalist Jermaine Jones was disqualified for concealing {{arrests and}} {{outstanding}} warrants. Jones, however, {{denied that he}} had concealed his previous arrests, as he admitted his arrests when he signed up for Idol. A police official in a New Jersey town {{where he was the}} target of two arrest warrants said that [...] "the case wasn't big enough to merit going after him in California", and a New Jersey legislator commented that for the show [...] "to expose, embarrass and interrogate a young man without an attorney in front of 40 million viewers was an outrage". Critics suggested that the show may have staged the disqualification to boost ratings. When asked about speculations that producers had prior knowledge of his criminal past and that the producers were simply out to exploit him on-air, Jones replied that [...] "I haven’t <b>even</b> <b>taken</b> my mind into that and why they did what they did, because then I’ll drive myself crazy".|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} the phrase [...] "wow factor architecture" [...] is uncertain, but has been used {{extensively}} in business management in both the UK and United States to promote avant-gardist buildings within urban regeneration since the late 1990s. It has <b>even</b> <b>taken</b> on a more scientific aspect, with money made available in the UK to study {{the significance of the}} factor. In research carried out in Sussex University, UK, in 2000, interested parties were asked to consider the [...] "effect on the mind and the senses" [...] of new developments. In an attempt to produce a [...] "delight rating" [...] for a given building, architects, clients and the intended users of the building were encouraged to ask: [...] "What do passers‑by think of the building?", [...] "Does it provide a focal point for the community?" [...] The Design Quality Indicator has been produced by the UK Construction Industry Council, so that bodies commissioning new buildings will be encouraged to consider whether the planned building has [...] "the wow factor" [...] in addition to more traditional concerns of function and cost.|$|E
2500|$|The {{passenger}} terminal, at {{the western}} end, was closed down and a new temporary terminal was converted from the old RAF buildings, {{in preparation for the}} start of the rebuild. Check-in was in a converted hangar and adopted the now familiar layout. The main difference from today was that not just the luggage was weighed. All passengers too, were required to stand on the big Avery scales, and were charged accordingly. The departure lounge, known as the Traffic Hall, was converted from one of the big brick [...] "H" [...] blocks. Along with comfortable seating, the lounge contained a long bar, backed by a full length, brightly coloured, three-dimensional collage. On a table, in the centre of the hall, was a large display case containing an architect's model of how the new airport would look. The modernity was <b>even</b> <b>taken</b> into the toilets, which had the first warm-air hand driers. Outside, the remainder of the ex RAF buildings became the Freight Village. A new but smaller viewing enclosure was allocated adjacent to the west end of the new terminal. No cafe, no toilets, just a bare rectangle of concrete. The chain link fence was usually lined with bicycles, which were regularly blown over when the BEA and Dan-Air DC3 Dakotas opened up both engines before turning right and taxiing out. No push-back then. No steerable nose wheels either. Just full power and hard right rudder.|$|E

2500|$|The Carmina Burana {{contains}} numerous poetic {{descriptions of}} a raucous medieval paradise (CB 195–207, 211, 217, 219), {{for which the}} ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, known for his advocation of the blissful life, is <b>even</b> <b>taken</b> as an authority on the subject (CB 211). CB 219 describes, for example, an ordo vagorum (vagrant order) to which people from every land and clerics of all rankings were invited—even presbyter cum sua matrona, or [...] "a priest with his lady wife" [...] (humorous because Catholic priests must swear an oath of celibacy). CB 215 even {{provides an example of}} the religious rites of this order, the Officium lusorum, the [...] "Service", or [...] "Mass", [...] "of the Gamblers". In this parody world, the rules of priesthood include sleeping in, eating heavy food and drinking rich wine, and regularly playing dice games. These rules were described in such detail that older research on the Carmina Burana took these descriptions literally and assumed there actually existed such a lazy order of priests. In fact, though, this outspoken reverie of living delights and freedom from moral obligations shows [...] "an attitude towards life and the world that stands {{in stark contrast to the}} firmly established expectations of life in the Middle Ages." [...] The literary researcher Christine Kasper considers this description of a bawdy paradise as part of the early history of the European story of the land of Cockaigne: in CB 222 the abbas Cucaniensis, or Abbot of Cockaigne, is said to have presided over a group of dice players.|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not <b>even</b> <b>taken</b> a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott McMahon is a United States {{citizen who}} was wrongfully imprisoned without {{charge in the}} Philippines from April, 2011 to August, 2016. McMahon {{was living in a}} {{subdivision}} with his longtime girlfriend and their two children when he struck up a friendship with a neighbor named Jan Marcel, who had a highly tumultuous relationship with his wife, Dolores San Pablo Vermeulen. One day, Vermeulen brought the police in to raid McMahon's home in search of Marcel. This event had an extremely traumatic effect on McMahon's son, and because of the damage to his son's mental health, McMahon brought a lawsuit against Vermeulen for child abuse. When all her attempts to get the lawsuit dropped failed, Vermeulen accused McMahon of having raped her six months previously. A medical examination showed no sign of rape, and McMahon could prove that he was on vacation hundreds of miles away with his family {{at the time of the}} alleged assault. Despite the fact that McMahon could not physically have perpetrated the alleged rape, and the lack of any evidence that a crime had <b>even</b> <b>taken</b> place, McMahon (who had no idea at the time that he had been subpoenaed) was arrested in a restaurant on April 7, 2011, in front of television news cameras. McMahon was held in prison conditions described by The David House Agency, which is handling his case, as [...] "subhuman." [...] Vermeulen sent a friend to both McMahon and his girlfriend, offering to drop the rape charge if he would drop the lawsuit against her and also pay her off: a clear attempt at blackmail. All such efforts were rebuffed by the couple. McMahon petitioned to be released on bail, but this request was not even considered until three-and-a-half years after his arrest, when it was denied, the court basing its decision on Vermeulen's accusations, despite the total lack of evidence. Finally, on August 2, 2016, a Filipino judge acquitted McMahon of all charges, writing that Vermeulen had accused McMahon as a way to get [...] "leverage" [...] in the 2009 child abuse case. However, McMahon could not leave the country, because the Filipino Bureau of Immigration demanded that he pay them $1000 for every year since his visa expired, despite the fact that it only expired because he had been imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit. Due to heavy U.S. government pressure, McMahon was allowed to return home to Seattle on September 4. The California Innocence Project represented Scott McMahon alongside a team of legal and political experts, coordinated by the David House Agency.|$|E
