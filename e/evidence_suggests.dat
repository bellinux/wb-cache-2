5|$|Gaelic {{continued}} to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse settlement period, but place-name <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> it had a lowly status. The obliteration of pre-Norse names is almost total. There is little continuity of style between Pictish pottery {{in the north and}} that of the early Viking period. The similarities that do exist suggests the later pots may have been made by Norse who had settled in Ireland, or by Irish slaves. In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials have been found on Arran, although not on Bute, and place-name <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. There are numerous Manx Runestones and place names of Norse origin on the Isle of Man.|$|E
5|$|Geological <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that Deinonychus {{inhabited}} a floodplain or swamplike habitat.

5|$|Recent <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that nonpathogenic {{strains of}} H. pylori may be beneficial, e.g., by {{normalizing}} stomach acid secretion, and {{may play a}} role in regulating appetite, since its presence in the stomach results in a persistent but reversible reduction in the level of ghrelin.|$|E

5|$|According to {{linguists}} like Bhadriraju Krishnamurti, Tamil, as a Dravidian language, descends from Proto-Dravidian, a Proto-language. Linguistic reconstruction {{suggests that}} Proto-Dravidian was spoken around {{the third millennium}} BC, possibly in the region around the lower Godavari river basin in peninsular India. The material <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that the speakers of Proto-Dravidian were of the culture associated with the Neolithic complexes of South India. The next phase in the reconstructed proto-history of Tamil is Proto-South Dravidian. The linguistic <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that Proto-South Dravidian was spoken around {{the middle of the}} second millennium BC, and that proto-Tamil emerged around the 3rd century BC. The earliest epigraphic attestations of Tamil are generally taken to have been written shortly thereafter. Among Indian languages, Tamil has the most ancient non-Sanskritised Indian literature. Scholars categorise the attested history of the language into three periods, Old Tamil (300 BC – AD 700), Middle Tamil (700–1600) and Modern Tamil (1600–present). In November 2007, an excavation at Quseir-al-Qadim revealed Egyptian pottery dating back to first century BC with ancient Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. John Guy states that Tamil was the lingua franca for early maritime traders from India.|$|E
5|$|Accounts vary as to {{the number}} of casualties, but the most {{reliable}} <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that Jordan lost four killed, ten to twelve wounded, and 355 captured—about 100 escaped. After the battle, Morgan counted eleven dead and forty wounded among the raiders, plus one killed while advancing on the town. Additionally, three civilians were killed.|$|E
5|$|Although adult lions have {{no natural}} predators, <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that the {{majority}} die violently from humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries on each other, either members of different prides encountering each other in territorial disputes, or {{members of the same}} pride fighting at a kill. Crippled lions and lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or elephants, and careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.|$|E
