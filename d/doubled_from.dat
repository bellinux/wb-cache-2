Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, Chelsea Bridge was in poor condition.

In addition, parts of its structure were beginning to work loose, and in 1922 the gilded finials on the towers {{had to be removed}} because of concerns that they would fall off. Architectural opinion had turned heavily against Victorian styles and Chelsea Bridge was now deeply unpopular with architects; former President of the Royal Institute of British Architects Reginald Blomfield spoke vehemently against its design in 1921, and there were few people supporting the preservation of the old bridge. In 1926 the Royal Commission on Cross-river Traffic recommended that Chelsea Bridge be rebuilt or replaced.|$|E

On 19 July, the advance of a large German, Austrian and Ottoman force across the northern Sinai was reported.
