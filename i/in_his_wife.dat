5|$|As {{the years}} went by with further childlessness, Ernest became more distant to his wife, and was {{continually}} unfaithful. Though Alexandrine continued to be devoted, choosing to ignore those relationships she was aware of, her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside her immediate family. By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further interest <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once Adrienne was {{released}} from prison in France, she, with the help of U.S. Minister to France James Monroe, obtained passports for her and her daughters from Connecticut, which had granted the entire Lafayette family citizenship. Her son Georges Washington had been smuggled out of France and taken to the United States. Adrienne and her two daughters journeyed to Vienna for an audience with Emperor Francis, who granted permission for the three women to live with Lafayette in captivity. Lafayette, who had endured harsh solitary confinement since his escape attempt a year before, was astounded when soldiers opened his prison door to usher <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> and daughters on 15 October 1795. The family spent the next two years in confinement together.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} 1770, at least five investigators in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendell, Plett 1791) successfully tested a cowpox vaccine in humans against smallpox. For example, Dorset farmer Benjamin Jesty successfully vaccinated and presumably induced immunity with cowpox <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> and two children during a smallpox epidemic in 1774, {{but it was not}} until Jenner's work that the procedure became widely understood.

25|$|As {{recounted in}} his autobiography, Alan was ordained as an Episcopal priest in 1945 (aged 30) and {{resigned}} the ministry by 1950, {{partly as a}} result of an extramarital affair which resulted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> having their marriage annulled, but also because he could no longer reconcile his Buddhist beliefs with the formal doctrine of the church.

25|$|Though {{known to}} keep her faith a private matter, her {{religion}} and proximity to the king made her the target of anti-Catholic sentiment. Catherine occupied herself with her faith. Her piety was widely known and was a characteristic <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> that the King greatly admired; in his letters to his sister, Catherine's devoutness is described almost with awe. Her household contained between four and six priests, and in 1665, Catherine decided to build a religious house east of St James's to be occupied by thirteen Portuguese Franciscans {{of the order of}} St Peter of Alcantara. It was completed by 1667 and would become known as The Friary.|$|E
500|$|Béla's {{blindness}} {{prevented him}} from administering his kingdom without assistance. He put his trust <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> and her brother Beloš. Both royal and private charters from Béla's reign emphasize Queen Helena's pre-eminent role in the decision-making process, proving that the king regarded his wife as his co-ruler. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, at [...] "an assembly of the realm near Arad" [...] in early to mid-1131, Queen Helena ordered the slaughter of all noblemen who were accused of having suggested the blinding of her husband to King Coloman. Béla distributed the goods of the executed magnates between the newly established Arad Chapter and the early 11th-century Óbuda Chapter.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Hubbard {{proposed}} marriage to Northrup. According to Northrup's later recollections she repeatedly refused him but relented after {{he threatened to}} kill himself. She told him: [...] "All right, I'll marry you, if that's going to save you." [...] They were married {{in the middle of}} the night of August 10, 1946 at Chestertown, Maryland after awakening a minister and roping <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> and housekeeper to serve as witnesses. It was not until much later that Northrup discovered that Hubbard had never been divorced from his first wife, Margaret [...] "Polly" [...] Grubb; the marriage was bigamous. Ironically, the wedding took place only 30 miles from the town where Hubbard had married his first wife thirteen years previously. The wedding attracted criticism from L. Sprague de Camp, another science fiction colleague of Hubbard's, who suggested to the Heinleins that he supposed [...] "Polly was tiresome about not giving him his divorce so he could marry six other gals who were all hot & moist over him. How many girls is a man entitled to in one lifetime, anyway? Maybe he should be reincarnated as a rabbit." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1767, Taylor {{purchased}} a [...] estate in Biery's Port (now part of Catasauqua) for £700. On this expansive property overlooking the Lehigh River, he built {{what was then}} one of the finest homes in the region, the house now named for him. Shortly after the Taylors moved <b>in,</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> Ann died. Taylor continued to live here for the next six years, but in 1774, he returned to Durham to operate the ironworks under a new lease. Until that time, production at Durham Furnace had focused on domestic products, primarily plates for stoves and fireplaces but also cast iron pots and pans. With the start of the Revolutionary War in 1775, the mill became a major supplier of cannon shot to the Continental Army and Navy.|$|E
2500|$|By 1992, Norm Green was {{arranging}} {{a deal to}} {{turn the}} team into the L.A. Stars, playing at a new arena (which is now the Honda Center) under construction in Anaheim, California. However, as The Walt Disney Company was already in negotiations with the NHL to create an expansion team in the area, the league instead asked Green to let Disney create the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim while the North Stars would get a relocation approval to wherever Green wanted. In January 1993, Green chose Dallas as the new home of the franchise, and the decision was formally announced on March 10. Several reasons were cited for the relocation, including poor attendance during a string of losing seasons, the failure to reach deals for a new arena in either Minneapolis or Saint Paul, and a sexual harassment lawsuit against Green that resulted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> threatening to leave him unless he moved the team. The subsequent [...] decision to relocate the franchise to Texas made Green much reviled in Minnesota, where he derisively {{came to be known}} as [...] "Norm Greed".|$|E
2500|$|Wiles {{worked on}} that task {{for six years}} in near-total secrecy, {{covering}} up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife.</b> His initial study suggested proof by induction, and he based his initial work and first significant breakthrough on Galois theory before switching to an attempt to extend horizontal Iwasawa theory for the inductive argument around 1990–91 when it seemed {{that there was no}} existing approach adequate to the problem. However, by the summer of 1991, Iwasawa theory also seemed to not be reaching the central issues in the problem. In response, he approached colleagues to seek out any hints of cutting edge research and new techniques, and discovered an Euler system recently developed by Victor Kolyvagin and Matthias Flach that seemed [...] "tailor made" [...] for the inductive part of his proof. Wiles studied and extended this approach, which worked. Since his work relied extensively on this approach, which was new to mathematics and to Wiles, in January 1993 he asked his Princeton colleague, Nick Katz, to help him check his reasoning for subtle errors. Their conclusion at the time was that the techniques Wiles used seemed to work correctly.|$|E
