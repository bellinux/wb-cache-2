5|$|Elk <b>handling</b> <b>facilities</b> {{are areas}} of pens with loading and {{unloading}} ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E
5|$|International {{airports}} have {{commercial relationships}} with and {{provide services to}} airlines and passengers from around the world. Many also serve as hubs, or places where non-direct flights may land and passengers may switch planes, while others serve primarily direct point-to-point flights. This affects airport design factors, including the number and placement of terminals {{as well as the}} flow of passengers and baggage between different areas of the airport. An airport specializing in point-to-point transit can have international and domestic terminals, each in their separate building equipped with separate baggage <b>handling</b> <b>facilities.</b> In a hub airport, however, spaces and services are shared.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, the Ministry of Transport {{announced}} that SKA-Somalia had been contracted to manage {{operations at the}} re-opened Aden Adde International Airport {{over a period of}} ten years. Among its first initiatives, worth an estimated $6 million, SKA invested in new airport equipment and expanded support services by hiring, training and equipping 200 local workers to meet international airport standards. The company also assisted in comprehensive infrastructure renovations, restored a dependable supply of electricity, revamped the baggage <b>handling</b> <b>facilities</b> as well as the arrival and departure lounges, put into place electronic check-in systems, and firmed up on security and work-flow. Additionally, SKA connected the grounds' Somali Civil Aviation and Meteorological Agency (SCAMA) and immigration, customs, commercial airlines and Somali Police Force officials to the internet. By January 2013, the firm had introduced shuttle buses to ferry travelers to and from the passenger terminal.|$|E

25|$|Today the {{principal}} cargo <b>handling</b> <b>facilities</b> {{are located in}} the Boston neighborhoods of Charlestown, East Boston, and South Boston, and in the neighbouring city of Everett. In 2011, the port handled over 11.5 million metric tons of cargo, including 192,000 container TEUs. Other major forms of cargo processed at the port include petroleum, liquefied natural gas (LNG), automobiles, cement, gypsum, and salt.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, European Ferries {{took over}} the {{operations}} of Port of Larne following the purchase of Larne Harbour Ltd. Under European Ferries management the Port prospered, making it the leading ro/ro port in Northern Ireland. European Ferries have improved the <b>handling</b> <b>facilities</b> for ro/ro operations with new double deck facilities in 1978 (the first in Ireland) and a new passenger terminal in 1985.|$|E
50|$|Freight trains have {{continued}} to run on the railway, carrying mainly cement, maize, fuel and freight containers. As of 2011, there were two freight trains every day, making up about one third of Lesotho’s international trade in bulk goods. Rail freight infrastructure in Lesotho included a container <b>handling</b> <b>facility</b> and a bulk grain <b>handling</b> <b>facility</b> in the Maseru industrial sites. These facilities were owned {{by the government and}} leased to the South African rail company, Spoornet, which was the railway's operator.|$|R

25|$|Magnox fuel {{incorporated}} {{cooling fins}} to provide maximum heat transfer despite low operating temperatures, making it expensive to produce. While {{the use of}} uranium metal rather than oxide made reprocessing more straightforward and therefore cheaper, the need to reprocess fuel a short time after removal from the reactor meant that the fission product hazard was severe. Expensive remote <b>handling</b> <b>facilities</b> were required to address this danger.|$|E
25|$|A {{masterplan}} for {{the growth}} of the airport was published in May 2005 indicating that the main terminal building will need to be increased in size, new aircraft hangars, maintenance facilities, and cargo <b>handling</b> <b>facilities</b> will need to be constructed. The possibility of a second runway built on land {{to the north of the}} current airfield, has been mooted, to cope with the forecast growth in air traffic. A new air traffic control tower was opened in October 2005.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} times with {{improved}} transportation, centralized and much larger elevators serve many farms. Some {{of them are}} quite large. Two elevators in Kansas (one in Hutchinson and one in Wichita) are half a mile long. The loss of the grain elevators from small towns is often considered a great change in their identity, and there are efforts to preserve them as heritage structures. At the same time, many larger grain farms have their own grain <b>handling</b> <b>facilities</b> for storage and loading onto trucks.|$|E
50|$|The berths will be {{developed}} {{at a cost of}} $85 million over the course of 18 months. Under the agreement, India Ports Global will refurbish a 640 meter long container <b>handling</b> <b>facility,</b> and reconstruct a 600 meter long container <b>handling</b> <b>facility</b> at the port. India Ports Global will modernize ancillary infrastructure by installing four rail-mounted gantry cranes, sixteen rubber-tire gantry cranes, two reach stackers, two empty handlers, and six mobile harbor cranes. Upon completion of upgrade works agreed to in the May 2016 agreements, Chabahar's capacity will be increased to 8 million tons from the current 2.5 million ton capacity.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, CentrePort is {{breaking}} ground {{on a new}} 700-acre Rail Park, which was triggered by a $25 million private investment from BroadGrain Commodities to build a grain <b>handling</b> <b>facility</b> and bean processing plant.|$|R
50|$|Finally, the {{environmental}} impact is small. The waste <b>handling</b> <b>facility</b> at the wellhead, plus a temporary security buffer zone, would require about one square kilometer. When the borehole is filled and sealed, the land can be returned to a pristine condition.|$|R
25|$|The harsh {{operating}} {{conditions of the}} arctic seas place high requirements on the strength, reliability and redundancy of the hull and propulsion machinery, especially for single-screw ships operating independently without icebreaker escort. For this reason the hull form of the SA-15 class freighters resembles that of icebreakers and their robust propulsion system has several innovative features and prototype arrangements to improve the ships' operational capability. Special attention has also been paid on the ships' general purpose characteristics by designing the cargo storage and <b>handling</b> <b>facilities</b> to allow various different types of cargo.|$|E
25|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} occurs naturally within some environments {{as part of}} {{the rock}} weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from coal stocks, coal <b>handling</b> <b>facilities,</b> coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid rock drainage.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{depth of}} Kollam Port is 8 meters. This {{will soon be}} {{increased}} to 10 meters. The project to increase depth is now underway {{at a cost of}} Rs.5.7 crores. Kollam Port has a cement terminal, cargo <b>handling</b> <b>facilities,</b> and a customs clearance centre (under construction). The port is undergoing infrastructural development. The port is very near the city of Kollam. Chief Minister Oommen Chandy launched the Coastal Shipping Project (CSP) at Kollam Port on 9 November 2013. Passenger ships will start operating from Kollam Port by 2014.|$|E

25|$|Work on {{the power}} station began in 1890. The narrow, winding Lucy Tongue Level was made ready for {{locomotive}} working during 1892, and {{the sinking of the}} new shaft began in the same year. The locomotive began work in 1893 and was able to haul all the mine’s output, replacing six horses. Before this, much of the output had been taken up to the Low Level because of limited haulage capacity in the Lucy Level, but this now ceased and ore <b>handling</b> <b>facilities</b> {{at the entrance to the}} Low Level were no longer needed. The Low Level engine shaft was no longer needed, and the winding engine was removed.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, 22.6million {{passengers}} used Scotland's airports, with {{there being}} 514,000 aircraft movements with Scottish airports being amongst {{the fastest growing}} in the United Kingdom in terms of passenger numbers. Plans have been published by the major airport operator BAA plc to facilitate the expansion of capacity at the major international airports of Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow, including new terminals and runways {{to cope with a}} large forecast rise in passenger use. Prestwick Airport also has large air freight operations and cargo <b>handling</b> <b>facilities.</b> Scotland is well-served by many airlines and has an expanding international route network, with long-haul services to Dubai, New York, Atlanta and Canada.|$|E
25|$|The Tilt Train service connects Townsville {{railway station}} to Brisbane {{in the south}} and Cairns in the north. Townsville is a major {{destination}} and generator of rail freight services. The North Coast railway line, operated by Queensland Rail, meets the Western line in the city's south. Container operations are also common and the products of the local nickel and copper refineries, as well as minerals from the western line (Mount Isa), are transported to the port via trains.
