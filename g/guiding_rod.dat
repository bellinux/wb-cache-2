5000|$|In {{conventional}} mortars, {{the bomb}} is {{inserted into the}} tube and the entire projectile travels through the tube to gain initial guidance at launch time. The Davidka's tail tube is {{the only part of}} the shell which fit inside the launch tube. This contributed to the weapon's notorious inaccuracy, as the shell lacked adequate guidance during the launch phase to acquire aerodynamic stability in the intended direction.It is not a spigot mortar, either; in a spigot mortar the [...] "barrel" [...] is a <b>guiding</b> <b>rod</b> inserted inside the shell's propellant chamber. The Davidka's propellant chamber fires inside the mortar tube (barrel) as does a conventional mortar, but the 3 inch (76.2 mm) caliber of the barrel is much smaller than the caliber of the warhead of the bomb. It is therefore an oversized conventional mortar, where most of the bomb, and especially its center of gravity, remain outside the barrel - an aerodynamically unstable design, which only worked at all because the center of pressure was still within the barrel. The head of the bomb was essentially a large can filled with nails, rocks, or any other material which could be used for shrapnel. This meant that the blast effects of the weapon were completely random and of dubious efficacy as an anti-personnel weapon. It was of no practical value for siege combat or other light artillery purposes, but it made a loud bang.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the morphology and physiology of the genitalia of the male cricket to establish a basis for neuroethological study of its reproductive behaviour. First, {{the structure of the}} phallic complex, including the dorsal pouch, <b>guiding</b> <b>rod,</b> epiphallus, ventral lobes and median pouch, are described, as are the muscles, cuticle, membranes and biomechanics of copulation. The innervation and sensory receptors have also been examined. Second, the functional role of the muscle in each genital organ has been determined by direct observation of muscle contraction during spontaneous or evoked movements and by analysis of the changes in movements after the ablation of the muscle. Third, for the flexible membranous organs, the ventral lobes and median pouch, the passages for haemolymph and their dynamic properties have been examined using petroleum jelly. Fourth, the sequence of coordinated motor actions performed by the internal and external genital organs, which were induced in both restrained and dissected males using newly developed techniques, has been analyzed during tethered copulation and spermatophore formation. As a result, the mechanisms of copulation and spermatophore formation are now more fully understood...|$|E

A spherical bearing sits {{on top of the}} sliding plate and transfers an applied load to the sliding plate, which moves downward and crushes the elongated specimen...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the neural mechanisms of reproductive behaviour {{in the male}} cricket, we identified motor neurones innervating the muscles in each genital organ by backfilling with cobalt/nickel and recording their extracellular spike activity from nerve bundles of the terminal abdominal ganglion during tethered copulation and spermatophore formation. During tethered copulation, at least two motor neurones innervating two ipsilateral muscles were activated during projection of the <b>guiding</b> <b>rod</b> of the phallic dorsal pouch. Only one motor neurone, innervating four ipsilateral muscles of the dorsal pouch, was responsible for spermatophore extrusion by deforming the dorsal pouch. For spermatophore transfer, three motor neurones, singly innervating three epiphallus muscles, {{played a major role}} in opening passages for haemolymph to enter the ventral lobes and median pouch by bending the epiphallus. Two ventral lobe and 3 – 5 median pouch motor neurones seemed to play a role in expanding or folding the two membranous structures by relaxing or contracting their muscle fibres. After spermatophore transfer, most of the genital motor neurones exhibited a rhythmic burst of action potentials causing movement of the phallic complex coupled with strong abdominal contractions. For spermatophore formation, the genital motor neurones began to accelerate their rhythmic bursts approximately 30 s prior to subgenital plate opening and then changed their activity to tonic bursting or silence. The results have allowed us to describe the timing of the onset and termination of genital muscle contraction more precisely than before, to examine the neural mechanisms of copulatory motor control and to speculate on the neural organization of the reproductive centre for spermatophore extrusion and protrusion...|$|E
40|$|Components used {{in space}} {{are subject to}} high {{frequency}} and high amplitude mechanical shocks that occur during the launch and separation phases of the space vehicles. Shock testing is done to ensure that components can withstand the shock events. A shock can be described by an acceleration and time history, but in shock testing {{it is difficult to}} manage and quantify shocks by only looking at the acceleration and time history of a shock. Instead, a shock response spectrum is used, which plots the peak accelerations of multiple single degree of freedom systems with their own unique frequencies over a range of frequencies, usually from 100 Hz to 10 000 Hz. The shocks that occur in space can reach up to acceleration levels of 10 000 g’s. The main objective of this work was to develop a software application for the mechanical shock testing system at Tartu Observatory. The shock testing system at Tartu Observatory consists of a resonant plate, pendulum hammer, <b>guiding</b> <b>rod,</b> weights and a data acquisition module with acceleration sensors. The software was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio. NET 2003 using the C++ programming language and external libraries. The software is required to acquire the data from the sensors connected to the data acquisition module and process and plot it. The shock response spectrum and acceleration-time histories can be plotted. An important aspect of shock testing {{is to be able to}} recreate shocks of various levels. If the shock testing system manages to do this, the system is considered reliable. To test the reliability of the system, the developed software was tested by performing shock testing on test objects and plotting the results...|$|E
