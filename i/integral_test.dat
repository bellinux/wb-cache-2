5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called helium <b>integral</b> <b>test.</b> A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E

These systems are composed of subsystems, or components, that interact through unidirectional interfaces. We show that, for systems that have the structure of an acyclic graph, {{it is possible to}} obtain rigorous upper bounds on the probability of failure of the entire system from an uncertainty analysis of the individual components and their interfaces and without the need for <b>integral</b> <b>testing.</b> Certification is then achieved if the probability of failure upper bound is below an acceptable failure tolerance.

2500|$|Significantly, Oresme {{developed}} the first {{proof of the}} divergence of the harmonic series, something that was only replicated in later centuries by the Bernoulli brothers. His proof, requiring less advanced mathematics than current [...] "standard" [...] tests for divergence (for example, the <b>integral</b> <b>test),</b> begins by noting that for any n that is a power of 2, there are n/2 - 1 terms in the series between 1/(n/2) and 1/n. [...] Each of these terms is at least 1/n, [...] and since there are n/2 of them they sum to at least 1/2. [...] For instance, there is one term 1/2, then two terms 1/3+1/4 that together sum to at least 1/2, then four terms 1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8 that also sum to at least 1/2, and so on. [...] Thus the series must be greater than the series 1+1/2+1/2+ 1/2+..., which {{does not have a}} finite limit. This proves that the harmonic series must be divergent. [...] This argument shows that the sum of the first n terms grows as , which is correct within a multiplicative constant.|$|E
