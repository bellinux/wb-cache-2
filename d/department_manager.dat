40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} use of management accounting systems by general <b>managers</b> and <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> in luxury hotels. We also investigate general managers' emphasis on financial and non-financial performance indicators while they evaluate their department managers' performance. In addition, managers' satisfaction with details and availability of their hotel's management accounting system (MAS) is assessed. The results indicate that general <b>managers</b> and <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> make equal use of MAS for both short and long-term decisions. However, a detail {{analysis of the data}} by manager groups indicates that general <b>managers</b> differ from <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> with respect to their use of MAS for making decisions. Furthermore, general <b>managers,</b> compared to <b>department</b> <b>managers,</b> are found to be more satisfied with the frequency in which MAS is available to them. On the issue of department managers' performance evaluations by general managers, the results reveal that general managers put more emphasis on financial than on non-financial performance indicators. The <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> in the study were in charge of food and beverage and room departments.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{composition}} of clinical <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> in Swedish hospitals is changing; more non-doctors {{and women are}} entering managerial positions. In parallel, most hospitals face increased pressure to contain costs. This article presents a study of managers' perceptions of tightness of budgetary control and how their views vary systematically with personal characteristics and organizational conditions. METHOD: Data were collected through a postal survey in 2005 to 173 clinical <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> (response rate of 70 %). Statistical analysis was performed by factor analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: The data suggest that clinical department managers' perceptions of tight budgetary control were related to how long {{they had been in}} their current position, their profession (whether they were doctors or non-doctors) and their sex. Further, their perceptions could be explained by how close the managers' departments were to their budget targets. CONCLUSIONS: Perception of tight budgetary control by managers depends on both their personal characteristics and the financial situation of their departments. Differences between men and women, and doctors and non-doctors call for additional research about the possible impact of changes in the {{composition of}} clinical <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> on how budgetary responsibility is exercised...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{addressed}} {{the lack of}} interaction between leadership and motivation in previous studies, particularly through mixed methods research. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore {{to determine the extent of}} the relationship between leadership and motivation within a home-improvement department store, which had yet to be explored through research. Methodology: Within a single case study – B&Q – 59 questionnaires and 6 semi-structured interviews were undertaken on employees and <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> respectively. The purpose of this was to uncover the motivational outcomes of employees, which were complemented and explained by the factors contributing towards the leadership styles of <b>department</b> <b>managers.</b> Findings: The research discovered that the underlying motivational issues of employees were related to formal managerial relations, limited goals, taskorientated job designs, and a lack of integration with B&Q. These emerging results guided interviews, which provided motivational explanations such as autocratic decision-making, resource constraints such as time, an emphasis on task-efficiency, and a reluctance to integrate social activities or participate with employees. A test of correlation supported the discussion section, which found that the leadership styles of <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> had a significant relationship with the motivational outcomes of employees. Implications: The results of the study provide the impetus for B&Q’s <b>department</b> <b>managers</b> to realign their leadership approaches with the motives of employees. Findings also support the notion that, despite previous research, ‘successful’ leadership styles may not necessarily be the answer to motivational issues in specific contexts. A future study within the same store may use these findings to construct and exercise a leadership style, after which improvements in motivation can be assessed...|$|R

500|$|A {{challenge}} for the filmmakers was creating computer-generated images of food that would appear delicious. Gourmet chefs in both the U.S. and France were consulted and animators attended cooking classes at San Francisco-area culinary schools to understand the workings of a commercial kitchen. Sets/Layout <b>department</b> <b>manager</b> Michael Warch, a culinary-academy trained professional chef before working at Pixar, helped teach and consult animators as they worked. He also prepared dishes used by the Art, Shade/Paint, Effects and Sets Modeling departments. Renowned chef Thomas Keller allowed producer Brad Lewis to intern in his French Laundry kitchen. For the film's climax, Keller designed a fancy, layered version of the title dish for the rat characters to cook, which he called [...] "confit byaldi" [...] {{in honor of the}} original Turkish name. The same sub-surface light scattering technique that was used on skin in The Incredibles was used on fruits and vegetables, while new programs gave an organic texture and movement to the food. Completing the illusion were music, dialogue, and abstract imagery representing the characters' mental sensations while appreciating food. The visual flavor metaphors were created by animator Michel Gagné inspired by the work of Oscar Fischinger and Norman McLaren.|$|E

500|$|Lasseter also {{explained}} that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: [...] "Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins." [...] Character <b>department</b> <b>manager</b> Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: [...] "John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, {{they need to have}} that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy {{to the point where the}} audience might see them as rubber toys." [...] According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, [...] "Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Lasseter {{was embarrassed}} {{with what was}} on the screen, later recalling, [...] "It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean {{characters}} that I've ever seen." [...] He asked Disney for the chance to retreat back to Pixar and rework the script in two weeks, and Katzenberg was supportive. Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project. In the meantime, the crew would shift to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter kept morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was [...] "a very scary time," [...] recalled story <b>department</b> <b>manager</b> BZ Petroff. Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators. Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and would later go over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it. Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists would then draw the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with revising, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised. When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on Toy Story, Steve Jobs kept the work going with his own personal funding. Jobs did not insert himself much into the creative process, respecting the artists at Pixar and instead managing the relationship with Disney.|$|E
