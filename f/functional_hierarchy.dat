This is deeply linked with the problem of the emergence of symbols, sometimes referred as the [...] "symbol grounding problem" [...] when it comes to language acquisition. Actually, the very existence and need for symbols in the brain is actively questioned, and alternative concepts, still allowing for compositionality and <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchies</b> are being investigated.|$|R

40|$|Functional {{annotation}} {{consists in}} assigning a biological function {{to a given}} protein. It is a crucial task in biology and has various impacts on many fields, including understanding cellular processes and drug designing. In {{order to be able}} to share and reuse annotations, biologists and bioinformaticians have developed structured controlled vocabularies that were first simple classifications and then more elaborated ontologies such as the Gene Ontology [1]. In our project, biologists and bioinformaticians collaborators are interested in proteins annotated with two distinct ontologies, such that no protein is annotated with both of them. These ontologies are merely <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchies</b> (Subtilist [2] and FunCat [3]) that share common features: (i) a simple structure with no explicit relationships (subsumption relationships can be deduced from concepts identifiers), (ii) high broadness and small depth, and (iii) variable size.

This view carries the implicit assumption that the relation between LF and PF is isomorphic, at last for what concerns clausal operators. However, this assumption seems to be untenable once extended to clausal negation, where cross-linguistic variation in the IP field (Zanuttini 1997, Ouhalla 1990, Miestamo 2003) and in the Left Periphery (Moscati 2010 a) does not translate in an analogous LF variation. 7 page(s...|$|R

He expects that the multiplex network of Chemo-Mechanical Feedback (CMF) loops exist over various hierarchical levels.

50|$|A {{multiple}} timescales recurrent {{neural network}} (MTRNN) is a neural-based computational model that can simulate the <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy</b> {{of the brain}} through self-organization that depends on spatial connection between neurons and on distinct types of neuron activities, each with distinct time properties. With such varied neuronal activities, continuous sequences of any set of behaviors are segmented into reusable primitives, which in turn are flexibly integrated into diverse sequential behaviors. The biological approval of such a type of hierarchy was discussed in the memory-prediction theory of brain function by Hawkins in his book On Intelligence.|$|E
50|$|Inter-utility {{real time}} data {{exchange}} has become critical to the operation of interconnected systems {{in most parts of}} the world. For example, the development of electricity markets has seen the management of electricity networks by a <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy</b> that is split across boundaries of commercial entities. At the top level there is typically a system operator with coordination responsibilities for dispatch and overall system security. Below this are regional transmission companies that tie together distribution companies and generating companies. In continental power systems there is now considerable interconnection across international borders. ICCP allows the exchange of real time and historical power system information including status and control data, measured values, scheduling data, energy accounting data and operator messages.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an analytical}} approach, Probability and Confidence Trade-space (PACT), {{which can be}} used to assess uncertainty in International Space Station (ISS) hardware sparing necessary to extend the life of the vehicle. There are several key areas under consideration in this research. We investigate what sparing confidence targets may be reasonable to ensure vehicle survivability and for completion of science on the ISS. The results of the analysis will provide a methodological basis for reassessing vehicle subsystem confidence targets. An ongoing annual analysis currently compares the probability of existing spares exceeding the total expected unit demand of the Orbital Replacement Unit (ORU) in <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchies</b> approximating the vehicle subsystems. In cases where the <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchies</b> availability does not meet subsystem confidence targets, the current sparing analysis further identifies which ORUs may require additional spares to extend the life of the ISS. The resulting probability is dependent upon hardware reliability estimates. However, the ISS hardware fleet carries considerable epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty in the knowledge of the true hardware failure rate), which does not currently factor into the annual sparing analysis. The existing confidence targets may be conservative. This paper will also discuss how confidence targets may be relaxed based on the inclusion of epistemic uncertainty for each ORU. The paper will conclude with strengths and limitations for implementing the analytical approach in sustaining the ISS through end of life, 2020 and beyond...|$|R

This critique is based on the <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy</b> tree (FH tree), which is the heart of the expert system component of MACH-III [Kurland et aI 1989]. First we describe <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy</b> as a paradigm for organizing expert system knowledge. Then the algorithm for generating text structures based on this <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy</b> organization is presented in two parts. The first describes how the higher level RST structure defining the overall organization of the paragraphs and their contents is built. This is an elaboration of the algorithm first presented in [Granville 1993]. The second part describes how the individual paragraph RST structures are filled out, resulting in a complete representation of the desired text. This algorithm was developed as part of the George system, ongoing work extending MACH-III to improve explanation capabilities. The first part of the algorithm, that which builds the high-level RST structures, has been implemented. The second part is the current subject of the George effor...|$|E

A, A schematic summary of the laminar patterns of feed-forward (or ascending) and feedback (or descending) connections for visual area V 1. The laminar patterns vary somewhat from one visual area to the next. But in general, the connections are complementary, so that the ascending connections terminate in the granular layer (layer 4) and the descending connections avoid it. The connections are generally reciprocal, in that an area that sends feedforward connections to another area also receives feedback connections from it. The visual anatomical hierarchy is defined based on, among other things, the laminar patterns of these interconnections among the various areas. See text for details.

40|$|It is {{generally}} thought that skilled behavior {{in human beings}} results from a <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of the motor control system, within which reusable motor primitives are flexibly integrated into various sensori-motor sequence patterns. The underlying neural mechanisms governing {{the way in which}} continuous sensori-motor flows are segmented into primitives {{and the way in which}} series of primitives are integrated into various behavior sequences have, however, not yet been clarified. In earlier studies, this <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy</b> has been realized through the use of explicit hierarchical structure, with local modules representing motor primitives in the lower level and a higher module representing sequences of primitives switched via additional mechanisms such as gate-selecting. When sequences contain similarities and overlap, however, a conflict arises in such earlier models between generalization and segmentation, induced by this separated modular structure. To address this issue, we propose a different type of neural network model. The current model neither makes use of separate local modules to represent primitives nor introduces explicit hierarchical structure. Rather than forcing architectural hierarchy onto the system, <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy</b> emerges through a form of self-organization that is based on two distinct types of neurons, each with different time properties ("multiple timescales"). Through the introduction of multiple timescales, continuous sequences of behavior are segmented into reusable primitives, and the primitives, in turn, are flexibly integrated into novel sequences. In experiments, the proposed network model, coordinating the physical body of a humanoid robot through high-dimensional sensori-motor control, also successfully situated itself within a physical environment. Our results suggest that it is not only the spatial connections between neurons but also the timescales of neural activity that act as important mechanisms leading to <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy</b> in neural systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines verb cluster transparency {{phenomena in}} Afrikaans. Special {{attention is paid}} to aspectual and posture verbs, the so-called Direct and Indirect Linking Verbs. Transparency phenomena are analysed using a Cinque-esque (1999) hierarchy of functional verbs. Chapter One introduces Cinque's (1999) analysis of Italian transparency phenomena as being the product of a hierarchy of functional verbs. It is demonstrated that a <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy</b> can also explain West-Germanic (including Afrikaans) transparency phenomena such as NP scrambling, super passives, long extraposition and quantifier scope. The hierarchy {{can also be used to}} explain the passivisation properties of certain classes of Afrikaans restructuring verbs. Chapter Two explores the relative orders of projections within the Afrikaans <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> A number of tests are utilised to determine the relative orders of different restructuring verbs within the <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> Chapter Three discusses the syntactic structures associated with restructuring verbs in Afrikaans vis a vis the <b>functional</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> Special {{attention is paid to}} the derivation of so-called Complex Initials in Afrikaans where a verb string undergoes V 2. An analysis in terms of Chomsky's phase theory is explored. Data is presented that suggests that a stronger version of the Phase Impenetrability Condition should be implemented. Chapter Four examines the implications a functional-head analysis has for verbal inflection, with special emphasis on the IPP effect in West-Germanic. It is argued on the basis of participle-marking of inseparable verb prefixes in some Afrikaans dialects that Afrikaans has a different structure associated with participle marking than do German and Dutch. This difference allows the participle marker to occur on the embedded verb in dialects such as Kharkhams and Griekwa Afrikaans. Since the marker is subject to relativised minimality, it is also able to undergo head movement, a phenomenon which results in optional IPP in Afrikaans...|$|E

This article {{discusses}} automatic identifications {{of functional}} structures of artifacts from given behavioral models of components and their connection information (called functional understanding). We propose an ontology of functional concepts {{which provides a}} rich vocabulary representing functions together with clear definitions grounded on behavior.

Furthermore, the ontology includes a new category of functional concepts named meta-function representing conceptual categories of relationship between functions.
