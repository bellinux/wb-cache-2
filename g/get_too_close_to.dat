25|$|A 2005 {{report found}} serious {{shortcomings}} to China’s national innovation system. There were problems with services to help turn S work into {{results and the}} allocation of national funding to support S was far from optimal. Sometimes researchers became short-sighted if they <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the market. Another serious problem was that companies facing severe competition looked first to purchase foreign technology rather than investing in developing technology and technology development capacity at home in China. Many of the patent applications came from medium-sized enterprises (70%) since small enterprises invest little in research. China's hierarchical, top-down society where authority is greatly respected and feared has been argued to stifle creative debate.|$|E
25|$|Soon the Balkan rebellions were {{beginning}} to falter. In Europe, papers were filled with reports of Ottoman soldiers killing thousands of Slavs. Even in Great Britain William Ewart Gladstone published his account of Ottoman atrocities in his Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East. Soon, a new Russo-Turkish war had begun. Despite fighting better than they ever had before, the advanced Ottoman armies still were not equal to the Russian forces. This time there was no help from abroad, in truth many European nations supported the Russian war, {{as long as it}} did not <b>get</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Istanbul. Ten and a half months later when the war had ended the age of Ottoman domination over the Balkans was over. The Ottomans had fought well, the new navy of Ironclads had won the battle for the Black Sea, and Russian advances in the Caucasus had been kept minimal. In the Balkans, however, the Russian army, supported by rebels, had pushed the Ottoman army out of Bulgaria, Romania, and much of East Rumelia {{and by the end of}} the war the artillery firing in Thrace could be heard in Constantinople.|$|E

After Flower's death in the third series, Zaphod continued to perform the duties as the group's dominant male and would chase off any roving males trying to reach new dominant female Rocket Dog. As meerkats will not mate with first generation relatives, he eventually left the group and became a roving male. [...] He returned after two episodes and still acted as the group's dominant male as of the end of series three. At the start of the fourth series, Zaphod was shown with his own radio collar. He left the Whiskers again to become a rover, then took over as dominant male of the Aztecs in the second episode of the series. As Maybelline was also one of his daughters, Zaphod was still without a mate. On 4 March 2011, Zaphod died of old age. He was 12 years old.|$|E

He practices the , a fictional ancient sword art based on Battōjutsu, that enables him to exercise superhuman speed and reflexes, study and predict his opponent's movements in battle, as well as perform many powerful sword techniques. Most of his techniques were originally intended to be lethal, but Kenshin has since modified {{the use of these}} techniques in accordance with his vow never to kill.

There are Navajo religious rights (the Fundamental Laws of the Dine' (Dine' Natural Law) from the Navajo Nation Title 1 Laws), Navajo grazing rights, boundaries, and private properties around and in the formation.

The restrictions were put in place in July 2016 by the delegated tribal authority (i.e., Navajo families and grazing holders that live around the formation, Shiprock Pinnacle Tribal Advocates, and members of the Navajo Chapters & Tribal Council). Visitors without any proper tribal authorization will be considered to be trespassing on Federal Indian Reservation land and are subject to legal sanctions. The tribal police are in effect present at the formation to monitor its use and visitations.|$|E

Anything coming along, then, will take us for a craft that has come out from Malaga." ...|$|E
