5|$|In the {{rebuttal}} phases, {{a witness}} or a rival character provides {{their idea of}} what has happened. The player is able to press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying. By doing this, the player gets closer to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases. Upon solving a case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E
5|$|Women {{were not}} {{explicitly}} banned from voting in Great Britain until the 1832 Reform Act and the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act. In England the suffrage movement existed {{before and after}} the 1832 act, but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872. Although there were notable exceptions such as the working-class areas of Lancashire, the women's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle-class movement. In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas. Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low-waged, densely-populated, industrialised valleys of the south. At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction, but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground. The coal mining industry, with its absence of pithead baths, led to unpaid women's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family's menfolk clean became a never ending task. This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam, a matriarch of the home, but little could be <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> in a society controlled by men.|$|E

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} stability {{properties of}} a chaotic system are exploited {{to formulate a}} reduced-subspace 4 -dimensional assimilation algorithm (4 DVar-AUS). The key result is {{the existence of an}} optimal subspace dimension for the assimilation that {{is directly related to the}} unstable subspace dimension. Theoretical arguments suggest that the optimal subspace dimension is equal to N+ + 1, where N+ is the number of positive Lyapunov exponents. In support of the theory, numerical experiments are performed in simple models with a variable number of positive exponents: the results show that, in the presence of observational error, the confinement of the assimilation increment in the unstable subspace of the system reduces the RMS analysis error with respect to standard 4 DVar. The standard 4 DVar solution, while being closer to the observations, is <b>further</b> away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>The</b> explanation of this result is that, assimilating in the unstable subspace, errors in the stable directions are naturally damped: because of observational error, assimilating in the whole space otherwise prevents this decay. In fact, if observations are perfect, standard 4 DVar gives the best results. ...|$|R
40|$|Where {{does your}} food come from? This {{is a simple}} {{question}} that many people ask but don 2 ̆ 7 t truly {{want to have to}} answer to. We have some idea of the concept of farming that is cobbled together from images taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> media and advertisements. The vision of a small pastoral farm where animals roam around in outdoor pens or live in stately wooden barns is the idea that comes to mind when we think of farming. This concept could not be <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>truth.</b> This difference between your perception and the reality is due to a widespread effort to block images of modern farming practices from public view. Those orchestrating this deception are so powerful that they have pushed censorship laws onto nineteen different states in the United States. These laws are collectively called the Ag Gag. This series of photographs was created to shed light on modern farming practices and to bring awareness to the overreach of agricultural corporations in dictating laws limiting individual free speech. In this work you see images of what modern large scale animal farming actually looks like. You will also see what impacts this has on the environment and learn about the benefits and problems with this type of farming. In the end the most important question I want you to ask yourself is: Is this where I want my food coming from...|$|R
40|$|How do banks {{operate and}} where does the money supply come <b>from?</b> <b>The</b> {{financial}} crisis has heightened awareness that these questions have been unduly neglected by many researchers. During the past century, three different theories of banking were dominant at different times: (1) The currently prevalent financial intermediation theory of banking says that banks collect deposits and then lend these out, just like other non-bank financial intermediaries. (2) The older fractional reserve theory of banking says that each individual bank is a financial intermediary without the power to create money, but the banking system collectively is able to create money {{through the process of}} ‘multiple deposit expansion’ (the ‘money multiplier’). (3) The credit creation theory of banking, predominant a century ago, does not consider banks as financial intermediaries that gather deposits to lend out, but instead argues that each individual bank creates credit and money newly when granting a bank loan. The theories differ in their accounting treatment of bank lending as well as in their policy implications. Since according to the dominant financial intermediation theory banks are virtually identical with other non-bank financial intermediaries, they are not usually included in the economic models used in economics or by central bankers. Moreover, the theory of banks as intermediaries provides the rationale for capital adequacy-based bank regulation. Should this theory not be correct, currently prevailing economics modelling and policy-making would be without empirical foundation. Despite the importance of this question, so far only one empirical test of the three theories has been reported in learned journals. This paper presents a second empirical test, using an alternative methodology, which allows control for all other factors. The financial intermediation and the fractional reserve theories of banking are rejected by the evidence. This finding throws doubt on the rationale for regulating bank capital adequacy to avoid banking crises, as the case study of Credit Suisse during the crisis illustrates. The finding indicates that advice to encourage developing countries to borrow from abroad is misguided. The question is considered why the economics profession has failed over most of the past century to make any progress concerning knowledge of the monetary system, and why it instead moved ever <b>further</b> away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> as already recognised by the credit creation theory well over a century ago. The role of conflicts of interest and interested parties in shaping the current bank-free academic consensus is discussed. A number of avenues for needed further research are indicate...|$|R

25|$|There is {{a popular}} {{misconception}} among the general public that most Jews went to their deaths passively. Nothing could be <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Jewish resistance to the Nazis comprised not only their armed struggle but also spiritual and cultural opposition which gave the Jews dignity despite the inhumane conditions {{of life in the}} ghettos. Many forms of resistance were present, even though the elders were terrified by the prospect of mass retaliation against the women and children in the case of anti-Nazi revolt. As the German authorities undertook to liquidate the ghettos, armed resistance was offered in over 100 locations on either side of Polish-Soviet border of 1939, overwhelmingly in eastern Poland. The uprisings erupted in 5 major cities, 45 provincial towns, 5 major concentration and extermination camps, as well as in at least 18 forced labor camps. Notably, the only rebellions in Nazi camps were Jewish.|$|E

[...] The current Psi Epsilon Chapter of Zeta Psi at Dartmouth was established in 1920.

[...] From 2001 to 2006, Zeta Psi continued to operate as an independent fraternity, not officially recognized by Dartmouth College. In January 2007, Dartmouth College announced an agreement that would allow Zeta Psi to reorganize on campus as early as 2009. Part of the agreement dictated that the organization [...] "go dark", with no activities or recruiting, for a period of two years.

And their love she had, and kept to a far higher degree than {{seems to be the case}} with those who court affection by caresses and indulgence. We knew that her approval was of a generous kind, we prized enthusiastically her rare betrayals of her motherly tenderness, and we depended on her in a manner we only realised in the desolation, dreariness, and helplessness that fell upon us, when we knew that she was gone. She had not, nor had any of us, understood that she was dying, and she had uttered only a few words that could imply any such thought.

60|$|Brandeis {{had held}} all day by Mulinuu, expecting the {{reported}} real attack. He woke on the 13th {{to find himself}} cut off on that unwatered promontory, and the Mataafa villagers parading Apia. The same day Fritze {{received a letter from}} Mataafa summoning him to withdraw his party from the isthmus; and Fritze, as if in answer, drew in his ship into the small harbour close to Mulinuu, and trained his port battery to assist in the defence. From a step so decisive, it might be thought the German plans were unaffected by the disastrous issue of the battle. I conceive nothing would be <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Here was Tamasese penned on Mulinuu with his troops; Apia, from which alone these could be subsisted, {{in the hands of the}} enemy; a battle imminent, in which the German vessel must apparently take part with men and battery, and the buildings of the German firm were apparently destined to be the first target of fire. Unless Becker re-established that which he had so lately and so artfully thrown down--the neutral territory--the firm would have to suffer. If he re-established it, Tamasese must retire from Mulinuu. If Becker saved his goose, he lost his cabbage. Nothing so well depicts the man's effrontery as that he should have conceived the design of saving both,--of re-establishing only so much of the neutral territory as should hamper Mataafa, and leaving in abeyance all that could incommode Tamasese. By drawing the boundary where he now proposed, across the isthmus, he protected the firm, drove back the Mataafas out of almost all that they had conquered, and, so far from disturbing Tamasese, actually fortified him in his old position.|$|E
