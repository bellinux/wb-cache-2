40|$|At {{first glance}} {{the story of}} the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) appears to have {{followed}} a puzzling course. When researchers first proposed their ideas for an accelerator-driven neutron source for exploring the structure of materials through neutron scattering, the project seemed so promising that both Argonne managers and officials at the laboratory's funding agency, the Department of Energy (DOE), suggested that it be made larger and more expensive. But then, even though prototype building, testing, and initial construction went well a group of prominent DOE reviewers recommended in fall 1980 that it be killed, just months before it had been slated to begin operation, and DOE promptly accepted the recommendation. In response, Argonne's leadership declared the project was the laboratory's top priority and rallied to save it. In late 1982, thanks to another review panel led by the same scientist who had chaired the panel that had delivered the death sentence, the project was granted a reprieve. However, by the late 1980 s, the IPNS was no longer top priority within the international materials science community, at Argonne, or within the DOE budget because prospects for another, larger materials science accelerator emerged. At just this point, the facility started to produce exciting scientific results. For the next two decades, the IPNS, its research, and its experts became valued resources at Argonne, within the U. S. national laboratory system, and within the international materials science community. Why did this Argonne project prosper and then almost suffer premature death, even though it promised (and later delivered) good science? How was it saved and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> on to have a long, prosperous life for {{more than a quarter of}} a century? In particular, what did an expert assessment of the quality of IPNS science have to do with its fate? Getting answers to such questions is important. The U. S. government spends a lot of money to produce science and technology at multipurpose laboratories like Argonne. For example, in the mid- 1990 s, about the time the IPNS's fortunes were secured, DOE spent more than $ 6 billion a year to fund nine such facilities, with Argonne's share totaling $ 500 million. And an important justification for funding these expensive laboratories is that they operate expensive but powerful scientific tools like the IPNS, generally considered too large to be built and managed by universities. Clearly, 'life and death' decision making has a lot to tell us about how the considerable U. S. federal investment in science and technology at national laboratories is actually transacted and, indeed, how a path is cleared or blocked for good science to be produced. Because forces within Argonne, DOE, and the materials science community obviously dictated the changing fortunes of the IPNS, it makes sense to probe the interactions binding these three environments for an understanding of how the IPNS was threatened and how it survived. In other words, sorting out what happened requires analyzing the system that includes all three environments. In an attempt to find a better way to understand its twists and turns, I will view the life-and-death IPNS story through the lens of an ecological metaphor. Employing the ideas and terms that ecologists use to describe what happens in a system of shared resources, that is, an ecosystem, I will describe the IPNS as an organism that vied with competitors for resources to find a niche in the interrelated environments of Argonne, DOE, and the materials science community. I will start with an explanation of the Argonne 'ecosystem' before the advent of the IPNS and then describe how the project struggled to emerge in the 1970 s, how it scratched its way to a fragile niche in the early 1980 s, and how it adapted and matured through the turn of the 21 st century. The paper will conclude with a summary of what the ecosystem perspective shows about the life and death struggle of the IPNS and reflect on what that perspective reveals about how research is produced in the laboratory...|$|E

Is there an experience of turning points? We did qualitative interviews with six former gamblers. Our main conclusions were that the initiation to gambling can be very different and still lead to similar effects. There seems to be a strong enticement surrounding the attributes of gambling, which are connected to developing a gambling addiction. The experiences of turning points were very palpable. Essential to the break up was to be honest towards your self, wanting to quit and making that decision. The support from significant others was also of great importance...|$|R

What is philosophy trying to accomplish, and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> about accomplishing <b>it?</b> A survey {{of the history of}} philosophy and current discussions regarding its aims and methods shows that philosophers radically disagree about the nature of philosophical inquiry. Part of the reason for this observation is that the aims and methods of philosophy are themselves philosophical topics. My task in meta-philosophy is {{to understand the nature of}} philosophy given that there is no distinct subject matter, and its aims and methods are subject to philosophical dispute; philosophy is an essentially divided discipline. Philosophers today and throughout history have supposed that philosophy is a scientific discipline; however, if my thesis is correct, philosophy cannot be a science. The first step is to appreciate the diversity of philosophical aims and methods; some aims and methods in philosophy directly contradict each other. Unlike science, which proceeds on the basis of a general universal methodology, philosophy is incapable of making scientific progress due to a radical methodological controversy at the very heart of the discipline. I recommend that, instead of attempting to merge with the aims and methods of science, philosophy should distinguish itself from science, and be understood as a different kind of discipline altogether. Once we reject the scientific meta-philosophical conception of philosophy, we can begin speculating and reconstructing the identity of philosophy from within philosophy itself...|$|R

40|$|The Surface Melt estimations and Northern Hemisphere {{plays an}} {{important}} role in climate changing studies. Melting of Greenland ice sheet can results in significant sea level rise n the future. That is why it is necessary to investigate <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> in the past. Our goal was to estimate surface melt trends in Arctic during the last millenium. In order to reach it we handled to a 1200 -year long record of simulated temperature data provided by community Simulations of Last Millenium. In the frame if Last Millenium run project these data were simulated with the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model. A dataset of surface temperatures at 2 meter for years 800 - 2005 AD with the spatial resulution of (grid cells of 3, 75 °lon, 3, 71 °lat) and temporal resolution of 6 hours was produced in Linux using CDO, NCO, GMT and Ferret. The study was focused on Greenland area as the largest ice sheet in NH. To estimate surface melt, Positive Degree-Days (PDD (°C days)) indices were calculated. PDD trends wer estimated, mapped and plotted for several locations in Greenland for millenial, centennial and decimal time scales. In order to validate the simulated data, a 10 -year record was compared with the one from AWS Humboldt provided be Greenland Climate Network GC-Net. The correlation was estimated as well as temperature sets were plotted as graphs and analyzed. Finally, to check how adequately the model temperature simulation is, temperatures for several years through the millenium were plotted as graphs for the different location in Greenland. That figured out the pecularities of a certain model behavior, which make difficulties for provide surface melt estimations. According to these pecularities we discussed our results and made an assumption, for which locations in Greenland our trends estimations are realistic...|$|R

40|$|Motivation is a {{fundamental}} factor to fructify any functional and effective classroom setting with interest, hope and expressive fruitful teaching experience.

It is noticeable that language learners, in this case Saudi university students, do not invest as much time in learning English as they do in learning their specialist subjects.  This paper tends to look at the meaning of motivation and <b>how</b> far <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> to affect language learning. It also attempts to investigate factors that frustrate learners by conducting different research tools such as interviews and questionnaires for both English students and instructors.   Research results present that many students dislike English classes and wish not to participate or attend them.   Additionally, teachers comment that despite the efforts to promote language learning, the outcome of their students is considered to be unsatisfactory. Teachers believe that this can be contributed to the fact that they are pressed to complete fixed curriculum in a limited period of time and abide by strict instruction to evaluate their students with no room left for them to personalize their own learning experience. Therefore, teachers need to be given opportunities to broaden their pedagogical repertoires and make English learning more engaging and more meaningful. The study implications shed the light on some useful hints to be applied in EFL classes...|$|R

40|$|Today {{the study}} of the {{fragmentation}} represents an important occasion to meditate on the city and on the evolution of the relational strategies of settlements. If we analyse in a critical way our contemporary cities, we can see several interventions of the last decades, that brought, more or less consciously, to discontinuity and isolation (gated communities to the new ghettos). In this situation the individual becomes part of a small community; but <b>how</b> long <b>does</b> <b>it</b> can <b>go</b> on? Are the public and sharing spaces, in which we can open ourselves to the city and in the same time we can develop a sense of identity and belonging, well designed? Are they at human scale? A tendency, that can be observed in the modern western cities, is the intervention as collective living and cohousing that are producing urban continuities and community relations trying to institute relationships with the outside, always keeping their own differences and identities. Anyway the architectonic results don’t seem already innovative and the general quality of the interventions remains of low level. The innovative examples for collective living can certainly be considered positive for what deals with functions, topics and sense of community: spaces where liveability increases and where a rediscovered relation between Man and Environment is at the centre of the project, have been designed. So the lacking passage to completely solve, thanks to the cohousing projects, the fragmentation of the city, deals with the architectural aspect. Architects must underline the importance of the architectonical results in terms of language and spatiality to increase the integration capability of the intervention. In this case the design of architecture has a fundamental role for the next development of the city and for solving all the fragmented and inclusive situation...|$|R

40|$|Barack Obama spent {{fewer than}} three days in China, but his first trip {{there has been a}} week-long story in the news world, as countless journalists, academics, and pundits have shared their {{thoughts}} about what this visit could do for U.

Now that the president has left the PRC, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> all <b>go?</b> Obama Administration officials are speaking highly of it, claiming that Obama was forceful in private meetings with Hu Jintao {{and the rest of the}} Chinese leadership. And perhaps the devil is in the details, as political scientist David Shambaugh says, speaking favorably of the joint statement of cooperation that Obama and Hu issued on Tuesday, which he thinks sets a positive tone for future Sino-U. S. relations. However, most of us weren’t privy to the Obama-Hu conversations, and my reading of the joint statement is somewhat more pessimistic than Shambaugh’s. On the whole, I’d say that Obama’s trip was anti-climactic, and even a bit disappointing. While most commentators didn’t really expect that Obama would accomplish all that much during his time in China, a survey of what happened on the trip, and what’s been written about it, reinforces the general sense among China watchers that very little got done. Below, a review of Obama-in-China, both the trip itself and the discussion surrounding it: The Good: 1. The town hall meeting in Shanghai took place on Monday as planned. At one point last week, we were hearing stories that both American and Chinese officials had reservations about the event, and there were rumors that it might be canceled due to conflicts over who could attend and whether or not the meeting would be broadcast in China. Thanks to what I assume was a weekend full of closed-door negotiations, the town hall went ahead as scheduled. If it hadn’t, Obama’s trip would have been even less interesting — and both sides would have appeared unwilling to cooperate with the other. As for Obama’s performance in the town hall meeting itself... well, see below for more, under “The Bad. ” 2. My Google Reader has been full of great writing this week. A trip like Obama’s generates a lot of press, and those of us in the China field have been feasting on it.

Grant when he visited China in the late 1870 s; and all of the short takes that Evan Osnos has posted at his New Yorker blog. Yale Global Online has two thoughtful pieces about Obama in Asia, and there are some interesting essays at The Daily Beast — one by Peter Beinart on the shifting U.

To what extent, if at all, was the authorâs original text modified by the intervention of the censor, or by editorial intervention {{on the part of the}} publisher? Who replaced PrÃ©vost as author of Le Pour et le contre, and for which numbers? What sources were used, and how were they exploited? Should the sentiments expressed at any given time be attributed to the author of Le Pour et le contre, or to his source, or to the censor? The present edition attempts to answer these and other questions as far as possible. Le Pour et le contre no. 61 marks PrÃ©vostâs official return to the French scene. The first sixty numbers may be seen, therefore, to constitute the first period in the career of Le Pour et le contre. The highlights are undoubtedly the review of Voltaireâs Letters concerning the English nation and PrÃ©vostâs elaborate self-justification in response to Lenglet-Dufresnoyâs accusations. But the anecdotes about English life and letters, which form the substance of most of these early numbers, and the fictional tales which PrÃ©vost occasionally includes, are likewise rich in interest. This edition gives the full text of each number, based on a comparison of up to twenty copies of Le Pour et le contre. For each number, the extensive critical apparatus gives details of the editions and variant states found, comments of each point of bibliographical interest, and records significant variants, while explanatory notes are given on the substance of the text. In addition, the manuscript annotations to be found in the copy of Le Pour et le contre held at the municipal library in Lyons are published here integrally for the first time. Ranging from a single word or less to several pages, they undoubtedly reinstate PrÃ©vostâs text in the vast majority of cases, and are of great interest for the light they shed on matters of censorship and authority.

What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> feel like from the inside? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> feel to the newly initiated, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> feel to those with along history? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> feel to teacher and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> feel to student?

40|$|The task of {{this essay}} is to stage an {{encounter}} with disappointment. Though the ‘affective turn’ is manifest across many disciplines, {{there has been little}} reckoning with disappointment as a particular affect. In the over-lapping contexts of environmental catastrophe and environmentally or ecologically-oriented performance – where the global challenges are immense, solutions impossible, but action vital – disappointment is inevitable. It seems imperative that we begin to think through disappointment’s affective registers in order to understand where disappointment comes from and what <b>it</b> <b>does.</b> What sort of affect, or force, is disappointment? <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> work and what work <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>do?</b> Where <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>go</b> and what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> take with it? I argue that disappointment remains vital to hope. If disappointment is figured as the space created between expectation and disconfirmation, then that space in-between is the necessary place of hope’s reappearance...|$|R
