5|$|Voting {{during the}} three shows {{consisted}} of 50 percent public televoting and 50 percent from a jury deliberation. The jury consisted of five music industry professionals who were citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on vocal capacity, the stage performance, the song's composition and originality, and the overall impression of the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> any of the competing acts {{in such a way}} that they could not vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member were released shortly after the grand final.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the doubts {{highlighted}} {{in relation to the}} construction of a synagogue, the Perushim, confidently in possession of the ambiguous firman, began clearing away the rubble from the Ruin courtyard in September 1836. As the foundations of he-Hasid's original synagogue were revealed, they discovered a few old documents dating from 1579, signed by Israel ben Moses Najara. After much debate, they decided not to rebuild the Ruin, but initially erect a small structure {{on the edge of the}} Ashkenasic compound. The Arab creditors, however, still refused to relinquish the claims they had on the Jews and continued to interfere with the works. Zoref, claiming that the Ashkenazim currently in Jerusalem were not related <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> those who had borrowed the money at the turn of the 18th century, was forced to appear in court requesting a further ruling cancelling the debts. He mentioned that an injunction had already been passed that absolved the Ashkenazim from repaying the debt and maintained that the Turkish Statute of Limitations cancelled out the debts of Judah heHasid's followers. Although the court ruled in the Ashkenazim's favour, Zoref nevertheless had to appease the Arab instigators with annual bribes in order to allow building to continue. At some point this arrangement ceased and in 1851, he was struck on the head with a sword and died of his wounds three months later. By January 1837 however, the Perushim had dedicated the modest Menachem Zion Synagogue in the northwestern corner of the courtyard. In 1854, a second smaller synagogue was built within the compound. The actual plot upon which he-Hasid's synagogue had stood 130 years earlier, however, remained in ruins.|$|E

25|$|Constantine {{had become}} a worshiper of the Christian God, but he {{found that there were}} many {{opinions}} on that worship and indeed on who and what that God was. In 316, Constantine was asked to adjudicate in a North African dispute between the Donatist sect (who began by refusing obedience to any bishops who had yielded <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> persecution, later regarding all bishops but their own sect as utterly contaminated). More significantly, in 325 he summoned the First Council of Nicaea, effectively the first Ecumenical Council (unless the Council of Jerusalem is so classified). The Council of Nicaea is the first major attempt by Christians to define orthodoxy for the whole Church. Until Nicaea, all previous Church Councils had been local or regional synods affecting only portions of the Church.|$|E

500|$|The American Historical Revue and Motion Picture Industry Exposition {{was open}} from July2 to August4, 1923. [...] The fair was located off of Figueroa Street in Exposition Park, {{just to the}} east of the brand-new Los Angeles Coliseum, where every evening a {{complimentary}} show for exposition visitors, [...] "Montezuma and the Fall of the Aztecs", was given. [...] Admission to the fair was fifty cents, though fairgoers could purchase a coin for a dollar at the box office and enter without further charge. [...] After the first week, organizers realized the public was not interested in the historical theme, but was there to see favorite movie stars. Exhibitors accordingly greatly expanded the space devoted to movie attractions, but the exposition was a financial failure. Those in charge of the fair had hoped to attract a million visitors; the actual attendance was about 300,000, many of whom were teenagers given complimentary admission in the final two weeks of the fair. With the fair flirting with insolvency throughout its run, officials hoped the planned visit of President Warren Harding on August 6 would increase gate receipts, but Harding fell ill in San Francisco and died on August 2.

500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> its racist view: [...] "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now if this guy hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E
