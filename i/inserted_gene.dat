5|$|Ensuring a plasmid accepts {{an insert}} {{is a common}} problem of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin systems {{can be used to}} {{positively}} select for only those cells that have taken up a plasmid containing the <b>inserted</b> <b>gene</b> of interest, screening out those that lack the <b>inserted</b> <b>gene.</b> An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors. The gene of interest is then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus, inactivating the transcription of the toxic protein. Thus, cells containing the plasmid but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and only those that incorporate the insert survive.|$|E
25|$|Transgene use {{in humans}} is {{currently}} fraught with issues. Transformation of genes into human cells {{has not been}} perfected yet. The most famous example of this involved certain patients developing T-cell leukemia after being treated for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID). This was attributed to the close proximity of the <b>inserted</b> <b>gene</b> to the LMO2 promoter, which controls the transcription of the LMO2 proto-oncogene.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, replication-competent viral vectors contain all {{necessary}} genes for virion synthesis, {{and continue to}} propagate themselves once infection occurs. Because the viral genome for these vectors is much lengthier, {{the length of the}} actual <b>inserted</b> <b>gene</b> of interest is limited compared to the possible length of the insert for replication-defective vectors. Depending on the viral vector, the typical maximum length of an allowable DNA insert in a replication-defective viral vector is usually about 8–10 kB. While this limits the introduction of many genomic sequences, most cDNA sequences can still be accommodated.|$|E

25|$|Viral {{transformation}} (transduction): Package {{the desired}} genetic material into a suitable plant virus and allow this modified virus to infect the plant. If the genetic material is DNA, it can recombine with the chromosomes to produce transformant cells. However, genomes of most plant viruses consist of single stranded RNA which replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cell. For such genomes {{this method is}} a form of transfection and not a real transformation, since the inserted genes never reach the nucleus of the cell and do not integrate into the host genome. The progeny of the infected plants is virus-free and also free of the <b>inserted</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E
25|$|The goal of {{gene therapy}} studies is to virally {{supplement}} retinal cells expressing mutant genes {{associated with the}} Retinitis Pigmentosa phenotype with healthy forms of the gene; thus, allowing the repair and proper functioning of retinal photoreceptor cells {{in response to the}} instructions associated with the inserted healthy gene. Clinical trials investigating the insertion of the healthy RPE65 gene in retinas expressing the LCA2 Retinitis Pigmentosa phenotype measured modest improvements in vision; however, the degradation of retinal photoreceptors continued at the disease-related rate. Likely, gene therapy may preserve remaining healthy retinal cells while failing to repair the earlier accumulation of damage in already diseased photoreceptor cells. Response to gene therapy would theoretically benefit young patients exhibiting the shortest progression of photoreceptor decline; thus, correlating to a higher possibility of cell rescue via the healthy <b>inserted</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In a cloning experiment, a gene may be {{inserted}} into a plasmid used for transformation. [...] However, in such experiment, {{not all the}} plasmids may contain a successfully <b>inserted</b> <b>gene.</b> [...] Additional techniques may therefore be employed further to screen for transformed cells that contain plasmid with the insert. [...] Reporter genes {{can be used as}} markers, such as the lacZ gene which codes for β-galactosidase used in blue-white screening. [...] This method of screening relies on the principle of α-complementation, where a fragment of the lacZ gene (lacZα) in the plasmid can complement another mutant lacZ gene (lacZΔM15) in the cell. [...] Both genes by themselves produce non-functional peptides, however, when expressed together, as when a plasmid containing lacZ-α is transformed into a lacZΔM15 cells, they form a functional β-galactosidase. [...] The presence of an active β-galactosidase may be detected when cells are grown in plates containing X-gal, forming characteristic blue colonies. [...] However, the multiple cloning site, where a gene of interest may be ligated into the plasmid vector, is located within the lacZα gene. [...] Successful ligation therefore disrupts the lacZα gene, and no functional β-galactosidase can form, resulting in white colonies. [...] Cells containing successfully ligated insert can then be easily identified by its white coloration from the unsuccessful blue ones.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, {{the idea}} that <b>inserted</b> <b>genes</b> exert no {{unintended}} damaging effects is an implicit hypothesis which has become an assumption and is now entrenched as a consensus.

50|$|The {{finding that}} a {{recombinant}} organism contains the <b>inserted</b> <b>genes</b> {{is not usually}} sufficient {{to ensure that they}} will be appropriately expressed in the intended tissues.

50|$|Further testing using PCR, Southern hybridization, and DNA {{sequencing}} {{is conducted}} {{to confirm that}} an organism contains the new gene. These tests can also confirm the chromosomal location and copy number of the <b>inserted</b> <b>gene.</b> The presence of the gene does not guarantee it will be expressed at appropriate levels in the target tissue so methods that look for and measure the gene products (RNA and protein) are also used. These include northern hybridization, quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, ELISA and phenotypic analysis. All offspring from the first generation will be heterozygous for the <b>inserted</b> <b>gene</b> and must be mated together to produce a homozygous animal. For stable transformation the gene should be passed to the offspring in a Mendelian inheritance pattern, so the organism's offspring are also studied.|$|E
50|$|In animals it is {{necessary}} to ensure that the inserted DNA is present in embryonic stem cells. Offspring can be screened for the gene.

50|$|There are two {{advantages}} {{by using}} transposon tagging. First, if a transposon is inserted into a gene sequence, this insertion is single and intact. The intactness can make tagged sequence easily to molecular analysis. The other advantage is that, many transposons {{can be found}} eliminated from tagged gene sequence when transposase is analyzed. This provides confirmation that the <b>inserted</b> <b>gene</b> sequence was really tagged by transposon.|$|E

50|$|Though {{the above}} designs are {{generally}} followed, there are exceptions. For example, the construct might include a Cre-Lox system to selectively remove inserted genes; or a prokaryotic construct may insert itself downstream of a promoter, allowing the <b>inserted</b> <b>genes</b> {{to be governed}} by a promoter already in place and {{eliminating the need for}} one {{to be included in the}} construct.|$|R
50|$|Another major use of {{plasmids}} {{is to make}} {{large amounts}} of proteins. In this case, researchers grow bacteria containing a plasmid harboring the gene of interest.

50|$|Not all the organism's cells will be {{transformed}} {{with the new}} genetic material; typically a selectable marker is used to differentiate transformed from untransformed cells.

Another screening method involves a DNA probe that sticks only to the <b>inserted</b> <b>gene.</b> Multiple strategies can remove the marker from the mature plant.|$|E
