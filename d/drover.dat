5|$|Megadeth {{began the}} Blackmail the Universe world tour in October, enlisting touring bassist James MacDonough of Iced Earth and guitarist Glen <b>Drover</b> of Eidolon and King Diamond. Five {{days before the}} first show, Menza was {{replaced}} by Shawn <b>Drover,</b> who remained with the band as a regular member. The band toured the US with Exodus and Europe with Diamond Head and Dungeon. In June 2005, Capitol released a greatest-hits compilation, , featuring remixed and remastered versions of songs chosen by fans from Megadeth's Capitol albums.|$|E
5|$|In late November 2014, Shawn <b>Drover</b> {{quit the}} band after ten years, wanting {{to pursue his}} own musical interests. This was quickly {{followed}} by the departure of Chris Broderick, due to artistic and musical differences. Ellefson denied rumors that the band would disband, and said he and Mustaine would continue working on new music.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{probably}} began {{fighting in}} June 1783, {{at the age}} of thirty-three, although Brailsford suggests it was 1781 or slightly earlier. Johnson had unintentionally slighted a carman (horse-drawn wagon driver) and fighter called Jack Jarvis, who then called for Johnson to fight him as a matter of honour. Johnson comprehensively battered the experienced Jarvis at Lock's Fields, and his name {{came to the attention of}} professional fighters. At that time Johnson had no intention of earning a living from the sport, but he became so goaded by a professional known as The Croydon <b>Drover</b> that a fight was arranged for March 1784, at Kennington Common. Johnson beat the <b>Drover</b> to a pulp in 27minutes and decided to become a professional.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1920s Vaughan Williams {{continued}} to compose, conduct and teach. Kennedy lists forty works premiered during the decade, including the Mass in G minor (1922), the ballet Old King Cole (1923), the operas Hugh the <b>Drover</b> and Sir John in Love (1924 and 1928), the suite Flos Campi (1925) and the oratorio Sancta Civitas (1925).|$|E
5|$|Additionally, several hardships {{struck the}} band in 2014. In May, bassist David Ellefson lost a brother to cancer, {{following}} which, the band cancelled {{a number of}} scheduled shows. On October 4, Mustaine's Alzheimer's-afflicted mother-in-law went missing from a campground. Her remains were discovered on November 26. Furthermore, drummer Shawn <b>Drover</b> and guitarist Chris Broderick announced their resignations from the band that November. The pair would later emerge in a new band, Act of Defiance.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Dystopias recording, {{longtime}} drummer Shawn <b>Drover</b> and guitarist Chris Broderick {{announced their}} {{departure from the}} band. It is the first album by the band since 2004's The System Has Failed not to feature the former, and the first not to feature the latter since 2007's United Abominations. These roles have been filled by Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler and Angra guitarist Kiko Loureiro, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Drover's</b> cabooses {{looked more}} like combine cars than {{standard}} cabooses. [...] The purpose of a <b>drover's</b> caboose was much more like a combine, as well. On longer livestock trains in the American West, the <b>drover's</b> caboose is where the livestock's handlers would ride between the ranch and processing plant. [...] The train crew rode in the caboose section while the livestock handlers rode in the coach section. <b>Drover's</b> cabooses used either cupolas or bay windows in the caboose section for the train crew to monitor the train. The use of <b>drover's</b> cars on the Northern Pacific Railway, for example, lasted until the Burlington Northern Railroad merger of 1970. They were often found on stock trains originating in Montana.|$|R

5|$|Rush {{then spent}} some months as a <b>drover</b> in {{southern}} New South Wales, while his brother John, {{taking advantage of}} the new Crown Lands Act took up a selection on the Lower Clarence River in 1863. Rush soon joined his brother, at first working for other settlers as a stockman and slaughterman. In 1866, he selected land at Ashby and began business in his own right as a butcher.|$|E
5|$|Sargent's own composition, Impression on a Windy Day, {{has been}} {{recorded}} for CD by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Gavin Sutherland on the ASV label. Sargent's first recordings as a conductor, made for HMV in 1923 using the acoustic process, were of excerpts from Vaughan Williams's opera Hugh the <b>Drover.</b> In {{the early days of}} electrical recording, he took part in a pioneering live recording of extracts of Mendelssohn's Elijah at the Albert Hall with the Royal Choral Society.|$|E
5|$|United Abominations is the {{eleventh}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth. Released on May 8, 2007, United Abominations {{is the first}} Megadeth release distributed through Roadrunner Records, and {{with the exception of}} the band's frontman Dave Mustaine, was recorded with an all-new line-up. While touring to promote the album, guitarist Glen <b>Drover</b> left the band for personal reasons and was replaced by Chris Broderick, leaving this as the only Megadeth studio album to which he contributed.|$|E

5|$|All the composer's {{major works}} {{and many of}} the minor ones have been recorded. There have been {{numerous}} complete LP and CD sets of the nine symphonies, beginning with Boult's Decca cycle of the 1950s, most of which was recorded in the composer's presence. Although rarely staged, the operas have fared well on disc. The earliest recording of a Vaughan Williams opera was Hugh the <b>Drover,</b> in an abridged version conducted by Sargent in 1924. Since the 1960s there have been stereophonic recordings of Hugh the <b>Drover,</b> Sir John in Love, Riders to the Sea, The Poisoned Kiss, and The Pilgrim's Progress. Most of the orchestral recordings have been by British orchestras and conductors, but notable non-British conductors who have made recordings of Vaughan Williams's works include Herbert von Karajan, Leonard Bernstein, Leopold Stokowski, and, most frequently, André Previn, who conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the first complete stereo cycle of the symphonies, recorded between 1967 and 1972. Among the British conductors most closely associated with Vaughan Williams's music on disc and in concert in the generations after Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli are Vernon Handley, Richard Hickox, Sir Mark Elder and Sir Andrew Davis. Record companies with extensive lists of Vaughan Williams recordings include EMI, Decca, Chandos, Hyperion and Naxos.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{began to}} sell the subcompact Suzuki Swift-based Barina in 1985. The Barina was {{launched}} concurrently with the Suzuki-sourced Holden <b>Drover,</b> followed by the Scurry later on in 1985. In the previous year, Nissan Pulsar hatchbacks were rebadged as the Holden Astra, {{as a result of}} a deal with Nissan. This arrangement ceased in 1989 when Holden entered a new alliance with Toyota, forming a new company: United Australian Automobile Industries (UAAI). UAAI resulted in Holden selling rebadged versions of Toyota's Corolla and Camry, as the Holden Nova and Apollo respectively, with Toyota re-branding the Commodore as the Lexcen.|$|E
5|$|In {{these years}} Sargent tackled a wide repertoire, {{recording}} much of it, {{but he was}} particularly noted for performances of choral pieces. He promoted British music, as he would throughout his career, conducting Handel's Messiah performed with large choruses and orchestras; and the premières of At the Boar's Head (1925) by Holst; Hugh the <b>Drover</b> (1924) and Sir John in Love (1929) by Vaughan Williams; and Walton's cantata Belshazzar's Feast (at the Leeds Triennial Festival of 1931). To popularise classical music, Sargent conducted many concerts for young people including the Robert Mayer Concerts for Children from 1924 to 1939.|$|E
5000|$|Little London {{may have}} been {{established}} by Welsh cattle <b>drovers.</b> Cattle <b>drovers</b> established at least 70 communities established in England and Wales, many of which still exist. They were temporary homes for long distance <b>drovers,</b> driving their cattle to the great fairs and markets of London and other centres in England. They were on common land, separated from local communities. The <b>drovers</b> had a licence to travel, granted by Elizabeth I, and were regarded as [...] "foreigners" [...] by the local parishioners who could not travel without a [...] "settlement certificate". One of the Old English words for [...] "foreigners" [...] was utlenden ("outlanders"), which could be corrupted to [...] "Little London".|$|R

5|$|It {{marked the}} first time the band had {{released}} more than one album with the same lineup since 1997's Cryptic Writings, however it is the band's final album to feature drummer Shawn <b>Drover</b> and guitarist Chris Broderick, due to their departures from Megadeth in November 2014. The album debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 86,000 copies in the United States as of December 2015. The album received mixed reviews from critics and, as of August 2014, has a Metacritic rating of 41/100.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine is the band's primary songwriter. He {{develops}} songs {{starting with}} a particular riff that, with modifications, becomes {{the central part of}} the song. He has said that song fragments are composed separately, and then the band makes a compact structure from them. Drummer Shawn <b>Drover</b> stated that Mustaine had saved many riffs over the years and that some recent material is based on those demo recordings. Ellefson stated that the band constantly creates new material, and that making a recording begins with exchanging ideas after which the band enters the studio and discusses the concept, direction, artwork, and song titles. The lyrics are usually written after the music is arranged. Discussing the band's lyrics, Mustaine said that many of the themes are derived from literature, such as the novels of George Orwell.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of 2014, the band {{announced}} its intentions to start pre–production on the album. The band {{had been working on}} new material since December 2013, and in January 2014, Mustaine revealed that many riffs had already been written for the record. In May 2014, prior to his departure, <b>Drover</b> revealed that he and Mustaine had entered the studio and began tracking some demo ideas. The band originally planned to record in August 2014 and release the album in 2015. Instead, plans were only made to demo new material that October and start recording in January 2015. Mustaine elaborated that, due to a reduced tour schedule for summer 2014, the band had more time to focus on songwriting.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the origin}} of the name Xaxim has several hypotheses.

Others say that the word Xaxim comes from the Tupi-Guarani language. Near the landing site of the <b>drovers</b> had a small waterfall. Shah = small, Xim = waterfall. Gathering, was Xaxim.|$|R
5|$|Sing {{was born}} on 2 March 1886 in Clermont, Queensland, Australia, {{the son of a}} Chinese father and an English mother. His parents were John Sing (c. 1842–1921), a <b>drover</b> from Shanghai, China, and Mary Ann Sing (née Pugh; c. 1857–unknown), a nurse from Kingswinford, Staffordshire, England. Sing's mother had given birth to a {{daughter}} named Mary Ann Elizabeth Pugh on 28 May 1883, less than two months before marrying Sing's father on 4 July 1883. It is unclear whether this child was John Sing's daughter as well. A daughter, Beatrice Sing, was later born into the family on 12 July 1893. The three children grew up together on the farm run by the Sings, and all three performed well academically.|$|E
5|$|Butchers, slaughterers, surgeons, and {{physicians}} were suspected {{because of the}} manner of the mutilations. A surviving note from Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the City Police, indicates that the alibis were investigated of local butchers and slaughterers, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry. A report from Inspector Swanson to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months. Some contemporary figures, including Queen Victoria, thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle <b>drover</b> on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the London Docks, and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday. The cattle boats were examined but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Pieces of {{the rope}} which was used to hang Corder sold for a guinea each. Part of Corder's scalp with an ear still {{attached}} was displayed in a shop in Oxford Street. A lock of Maria's hair sold for two guineas. Polstead became a tourist venue with visitors travelling from as far afield as Ireland; Curtis estimated that 200,000 people visited Polstead in 1828 alone. The Red Barn and the Martens' cottage excited particular interest. The barn was stripped for souvenirs, down to the planks being removed from the sides, broken up, and sold as toothpicks. It was slated to be demolished after the trial, but it was left standing and eventually burned down in 1842. Even Maria's gravestone in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead was eventually chipped away to nothing by souvenir hunters; only {{a sign on the}} shed now marks the approximate place where it stood, although her name is given to Marten's Lane in the village. Pottery models and sketches were sold and songs were composed, including one quoted in the Vaughan Williams opera Hugh the <b>Drover</b> and Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus.|$|E
