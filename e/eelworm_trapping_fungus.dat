40|$|ABSTRACT: Nematode <b>trapping</b> <b>fungi</b> {{captured}} nematode {{by forming}} {{different types of}} structure {{in a way to}} get supplement of nitrogen from the nematode, just like carnivorous plants. Fungal parasites of nematodes are broadly classified as either predaceous or endoparasitic. The genus Nematoctonus is unique in that some species are endoparasitic and some species are predaceous by established criteria. The generic diagnosis for Nematoctonus was given by Dreschsler that one assimilative hyphae which is hyaline, more or less branched, developing within minute living animals. Growth and sporulation of N. robustus was significantly varied with different temperature on corn meal agar medium. It is evident from results showing the effect of temperature on the biology of N. robustus that 200 C was most optimum temperature for both growth and sporulation. With increase in the temperature there is increase in radial growth of this fungus but correspondingly there s decrease in sporulation...|$|R

In 17 -cm³ vials, soil moisture influenced survival of P. penetrans in the presence of H. rhossiliensis; nematode survival decreased with diminishing soil moisture. Hirsutella rhossiliensis and M. ellipsosporum were equally effective in reducing numbers of P. penetrans by 24 - 25 % after 4 days in sand.

Results indicated that application of castor alone or in concomitant with A. oligospora or /and oxamyl gave better enhancement in various growth parameters such as fresh shoot length and weight whether in tomato or sunflower. Root galling was significantly suppressed in all treatments as compared with untreated plants. In sunflower, pre-planting application with castor + oxamyl gave the best results, recording a gall index of 3. 50 with the highest percentage of increase in total plant fresh weight (81. 9). However, castor alone or integrated application of castor + A. oligospora + oxamyl or A. oligospora + oxamyl to the soil gave the best results in terms of suppression of galls and increased tomato plant growth.

It is a pathogen of eelworms and nematodes, notable for its distinct sickle-shaped conidia that grow in pierce out through the host body. This genus Harposporium was treated initially in the Clavicipitaceae and {{is thought to be}} closely related to members of the genus, Tolypocladium.

50|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} {{are typically}} found in patchy distributions, which vary {{in space and}} time, although the degree of patchiness varies between species (reviewed in Lewis 2002). Factors responsible for this aggregated distribution may include behavior, {{as well as the}} spatial and temporal variability of the nematodes natural enemies, like nematode <b>trapping</b> <b>fungus.</b> Nematodes also have limited dispersal ability. Many infective juveniles are produced from a single host which could also produce aggregates. Patchy EPN distributions may also reflect the uneven distribution of host and nutrients in the soil (Lewis et al. 1998; Stuart and Gaugler 1994; Campbell et al. 1997, 1998). EPNs may persist as metapopulations, in which local population fragments are highly vulnerable to extinction, and fluctuate asynchronously (Lewis et al. 1998). The metapopulation as a whole can persist as long as the rate of colonization is greater or equal to the rate of population extinction (Lewis et al. 1998). The founding of new populations and movement between patches may depend on the movement of infective juveniles or the movement of infected hosts (Lewis et al. 1998). Recent studies suggest that EPNs may also use non-host animals, such as isopods and earthworms for transport (Eng et al.2005, Shapiro et al. 1993) or can be scavengers (San-Blas and Gowen, 2008).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} of a fungal formulation {{based on the}} nematophagous fungus Duddingtonia flagrans was assessed in the control of cattle trichostrongyles. Twenty male Nellore calves, six-month-old, divided in two groups (fungus-treated and control without fungus) were fed on a pasture of Brachiaria decumbens naturally infected with larvae of bovine trichostrongyles. Animals of the treated group received doses of sodium alginate mycelial pellets orally (1 g/ 10 kg live weight, twice a week), for 12 months. Feces samples were collected for egg count (eggs per gram of feces–EPG) and coprocultures during 12 months. There was {{a significant reduction in}} EPG (56. 7 %) and infective larvae (L 3) in coprocultures (60. 5 %) for animals of the treated group in relation to the control group {{at the end of the}} study. There was a significant reduction of L 3 (64. 5 %) in herbage samples collected up to 0 – 20 cm from fecal pats and 73. 2 % in distant samples (20 – 40 cm) between the fungus-treated group and the control group.

Also control groups of ewes, receiving only feed supplement, were established on all 3 farms. Groups were monitored by intensive parasitological investigation. The ewes and their lambs were moved in late June to saved pastures for summer grazing, the lambs receiving an anthelmintic treatment at this time. After approximately 6 weeks on summer pasture the lambs were weaned, treated a second time with anthelmintic, and returned to their original lambing pastures for finishing. Decisions as to when lambs were to be marketed were entirely {{at the discretion of}} the farmer co-operators. No difference in lamb performance was found between the two treatments on all three farms. This was attributed to the high levels of nutrition initially of the ewes limiting their post-partum rise in nematode faecal egg counts in spring, which in turn resulted in low levels of nematode infection on pastures throughout the autumn period. Additionally, pastures were of good quality for the lambs during the finishing period, so they grew at optimal rates as far as the farmers were concerned. </p...|$|R

The mode and severity of infection of nematodes by a soil saprophyte Paecilomyces lilacinus (Thom) Samson and a knob-producing nematode <b>trapping</b> <b>fungus</b> Monacrosporium lysipagum (Drechsler) Subram were studied under laboratory conditions using microscopy. Infection of stationary stages of nematodes by P. lilacinus was studied with three plant-parasitic nematodes Meloidogyne javanica (Treub) Chitwood, Heterodera avenae Wollenweber and Radopholus similis (Cobb) Thorne. Paecilomyces lilacinus infected eggs, juveniles and females of M. javanica by direct hyphal penetration. The early developed eggs were more susceptible than the eggs containing fully developed juveniles. As observed by transmission electron microscopy, fungal hypha penetrated the M. javanica female cuticle directly. Paecilomyces lilacinus also infected immature cysts of H. avenae including eggs in the cysts and the eggs of R. similis. Trapping and subsequent killing of mobile stages of nematodes by M. lysipagum were studied with the above three nematodes. In addition, plant-parasitic nematodes Pratylenchus neglectus (Rensch) Chitwood and Oteifa and Ditylenchus dipsaci (Kuhn) Filipjev were tested with M. lysipagum.

The fungi were tested individually and in combination against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica (Treub) Chitwood, cereal cyst nematode Heterodera avenae Wollenweber, or burrowing nematode Radopholus similis (Cobb) Thorne on tomato, barley and tissue cultured banana plants, respectively. In all cases, nematode populations were controlled substantially by both individual and combined applications of the fungi. Combined application of P. lilacinus and M. lysipagum reduced 62 % of galls and 94 % of M. javanica juveniles on tomato when compared to the experiment with no fungi added. Sixty five percent of H. avenae cysts were reduced on barley by combined application of fungi. Control of R. similis on banana, both in the roots and in the soil, was greatest when M. lysipagum was applied alone (86 %) or in combination with P. lilacinus (96 %), using a strategy where the fungi were inoculated twice in 18 weeks growth period. Overall, combined application of P. lilacinus and M. lysipagum was the most effective treatment in controlling nematode populations, although in some cases M. lysipagum alone was as effective as the combined application of fungi, particularly against M. javanica. 16 page(s...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} therefore to investigate whether nematode-trapping fungi occurred in mangrove habitats. To achieve this we assessed the diversity of nematode-trapping fungi on decaying litter from mangroves, freshwater and terrestrial habitats (22 sites) in Hong Kong. Composite samples (n = 1, 320) of decaying litter (wood and leaves) were examined and a total of 31 species of nematode-trapping fungi belonging to four genera, Arthrobotrys, Monacrosporium, and Dactylella were recorded. Twenty-nine species reported in this study are new records for Hong Kong and 16 species are new records from mangrove habitats worldwide. Nematode <b>trapping</b> <b>fungi</b> are therefore present in marine environments. Commonly encountered taxa were Arthrobotrys oligospora and Monacrosporium thaumasium which are abundant in all habitats. A. oligospora, M. thaumasium and Arthrobotrys musiformis were frequent (F > 10 %). Twenty-six species were rare (0. 16 - 9. 32 %). Species richness and diversity was higher in terrestrial than in freshwater and mangrove habitats (ANOVA, P < 0. 001). A higher mean diversity was observed on decaying leaves as compared to decaying wood in all habitats (P < 0. 001). Based on Shannon diversity index, it was also observed that taxa characterized by adhesive nets were more frequent in all habitats. This can be explained by the fact that these taxa may have a better competitive saprotrophic ability which would allow them to compete favourably in nutrient limited environments. Abiotic factors that could be linked to differences in species diversity between decaying wood and leaves are also discussed. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.

Trotz verstärktem Befall wurde das Pflanzenwachstum verbessert (induzierte Toleranz). Weiterhin wurden durch "antibiotikafreie" Kulturfiltrate (KF) aus der bakterielen Übergangs- und stationären Phase ähnliche Wirkungen erzielt. Außerdem wurde eine systemische Wirkung von B. subtilis auf den Meloidogyne-Befall an Tomate nachgewiesen. B. subtilis bzw. die KF-behandelte Testpflanzen zeigten stärkere Anlockwirkung auf Meloidogyne-Larven (M. incognita, M. arenaria) als unbehandelte. KF (50, 10, 1 %) von B. subtilis zeigten keine nematizide Wirkung auf die Meloidogyne-Larven. KNO 3 als Trägersubstanz für das Bakterienpräparat besaß ähnliche Wirkungen auf den Meloidogyne-Befall und die Nematodenvermehrung. Ebenfalls wurde das Pflanzenwachstum durch KNO 3 -Zufuhr gefördert.

Investigations {{were made}} {{to know about the}} effects of Bacillus subtilis and its {{metabolites}} on the infestation of tomato plants with root-knot and lesion nematodes. Further more, experiments were carried out to clear up the mode of actions ofB. subtilis and its culture filtrates on infestation of tomato seedlings and reproduction of root-knot nematodes. Substrate applications ofB. subtilis FZB 24 ® leaded to an increasement of infestations intensity and reproduction of root-knot nematodes (M. arenaria). Eventhough, bacterized and inoculated plants with root-knot nematodes showed better growth than with bacteria untreated plants (induced tolerance). In addition "antibiotica free" culture filtrates (CF) from transitional and stationary bacterial growth phase also promoted reproduction of root-knot nematodes. These CF elicitized tolerance of tomato plants towardsMeloidogyne too. It was proved that B. subtilis could induce a systemic reaction of tomato plants towards root-knot infestation. Besides that test plants treated with B. subtilis (cells) or CF were more attractive to Meloidogyne-Larvae (M. arenaria & M. incognita) than untreated once. CF in 50, 10 and 1 % concentrations did not have a nematicidal effect on the root-knot larvae. KNO 3 -the carrier of the bacterial preparate (B. subtilis FZB 24 ®) - had also the same effects on infestation and reproduction of root-knot nematodes. Plant growth was promoted due to application of KNO 3. The use of nematode <b>trapping</b> <b>fungus,</b> Arthrobotrys superba gave some range of nematode (root-knot) control (30 % gall reduction). Whereas, with the combination ofA. superba and B. subtilis FZB 24 ® the effect of the fungus was reduced. The application of exogenic phytohormones and precursores showed no effect on plant growth. Reproduction of Meloidogyne was promoted by IAA and combination of IAA and kinetin (not significant). In the tested concentrations of these phytohormones there was no direct mortality effect on root-knot larvae. Content of some enzymes (chitinase, glucanase and peroxidase) from shoot of treated tomato plants was determind. B. subtilis-Isolates (FZB 24 ® and S 18) reduced the population of lesion nematodes,Pratylenchus penetrans in attacked plants (not significant) [9 % per root system and 15 - 20 % per g root].

A survey of the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance (AR) on Peninsular Malaysia revealed 50 % of the sheep (n= 39) and 75 % of the goat farms (n= 9) were infected with nematode parasites that were resistant to the benzimidazoles.

Daily fungal feeding by both means resulted in an 80 - 95 % reduction in infective larvae in faecal cultures. Similar results were found in small scale grazing experiments, where sheep were fed daily with fungal spores for 3 consecutive months. Pen trials comparing goats and sheep, showed no difference between the two livestock species. Larger scale field trials where D. flagrans was combined with rapid rotational grazing, showed excellent parasite control.

40|$|Nematode {{community}} analysis {{may provide}} a useful tool to quantify soil health. Nematode communities were monitored for 5 years during a 12 -year period in the sustainable agriculture fanning systems (SAFS) project at UC Davis, where conventional (CONV), low-input (LOW) and organic (ORG) management treatments were compared. After the completion of three 4 -year crop rotation cycles, a uniform crop of oats was grown in 2001. The composition of the nematode genera was different from year to year, but there were significant management effects on genus composition in each year, with the CONV treatment being {{significantly different from the}} LOW and ORG treatments. Important contributors to the differences in genus composition among treatments were plant parasitic nematodes. Nematode community indices (enrichment (EI), basal (131) and channel (CI) indices) of the CONV treatment differed from those of the ORG and LOW treatments in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 2000, but not in 2001. The difference in structure index (SI) among management treatments was significant in 1995 and 2000. El and SI were generally lower, and 131 and Cl higher in CONV than in LOW and ORG treatments. There were significant crop effects on the community indices throughout the years. Even in 200 1, there was a residual effect of the crop grown in 2000 on most nematode community indices. Differences in El, BI and C-I among crops were consistent, while those in SI were not. Meloidogyne javanica (Treub) Chitwood, juveniles added to various soil samples were reduced by 68 % in soil where nematode <b>trapping</b> <b>fungi</b> had been added and which had low BI (12) and low CI (20) values. Soil from SAFS plots with a high BI (47) and high CI (70) after I year of oats and ploughing, suppressed root knot juveniles much less. There were significant negative correlations between BI and root knot nematode (RKN) suppression (- 0. 72) and between CI and RKN suppression (- 0. 74). Thus, BI and Cl appeared to be most valuable as indicators for long-term effects of management on nematode suppression. However, BI and SI may be more suitable as general indicators for the health status of a soil, since Cl can be high in highly disturbed agro-ecosystems as well as in undisturbed natural ecosystems. A high BI would indicate poor ecosystem health, while a high SI would indicate a well-regulated, healthy ecosystem. For agricultural soils the presence of large populations of plant parasitic nematodes forms an additional indication of poor ecosystem health, as natural regulation is limited in this case.

40|$|Abstract The {{infection}} structures, trophism, {{and ecological}} character of nematophagous fungi are reviewed {{in this article}} {{on the basis of}} data extracted from the literature and the most recent experiments conducted in this area. Traditionally, nematophagous fungi are classified into four groups according to their modes of attacking nematodes: nematode-trapping fungi using adhesive or mechanical hyphal <b>traps,</b> endoparasitic <b>fungi</b> using their spores, eggparasitic fungi invading nematode eggs or females with their hyphal tips, and toxin-producing fungi immobilizing nematodes before invasion. In the present review, we focus on the first two groups. The living strategies of these nematophagous fungi depend on the diversity of their infection structures, such as different traps and spore types, which determine the modes of infecting nematodes. The diversity of trophic modes of nematophagous fungi is an important prerequisite for fungal survival and activity in soil. The abundance and activity of Hirsutella rhossiliensis and H. minnesotensis, representatives of endoparasites and potential biocontrol agents against nematodes, are highly dependent on environmental factors. Comprehensive understanding of the survival and activity of nematophagous fungi in soil is fundamental for the exploitation of these fungi as successful biocontrol agents.

30|$|Keratinophilic fungi are {{considered}} as an ecologically important group of highly specialized fungi, which are {{adapted to the}} utilization of keratin as the main or sole source of nutrition (Kunert 2000). This unique fungal group is attracting lot of attention throughout the world because {{of their ability to}} degrade hard keratin, which is otherwise resistant to degradation by most of the other microorganisms (Filipello 2000). In nature, they exist as self sufficient saprophytes as long as environmental conditions are favourable but they may become parasitic by accident and then pathogenic. Soils rich in keratinous material are found to be most conducive for the growth and occurrence of keratinophilic fungi (Otcenasek 1978; Mercantini et al. 1980). But occurrence of keratinophilic fungi also depends upon various genomic and climatic factors such as organic matter, soil humidity, pH, temperature, soil texture, depth of soil profile and other microorganisms (Srivastava et al. 1990). For isolation of keratinophilic fungi from soil, keratin or hair baiting technique given by Vanbreuseghem (1952) is widely used. As per this procedure, different keratinous substrates are used as a bait to lure keratinophilic species. However, different species vary in their preference for colonization and utilization of these baits. Keeping this in view, an experiment was carried out to find out the best keratin baits for <b>trapping</b> these <b>fungi</b> and to know the successional pattern of the isolated species.|$|R
30|$|All {{materials}} and experimental conditions including mass loss determination {{were the same}} as those described in the previous paper [16]. Air sampling was carried out at a height of about 100  cm using a BIOSAMP MBS- 1000 air sampler (Midori Anzen, Tokyo, Japan) at the same site {{on the grounds of the}} Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute in Tsukuba, from June to November 2008. Two hundred one damp Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) disks, about 3 -mm thick and 7.8  cm in diameter, were used as a fungal medium to <b>trap</b> airborne wood-decay <b>fungi.</b> Japanese cedar disks exposed to 1, 000 l of air by the air sampler were incubated for 16  weeks. Fungal strains grown on the disks whose initial mass and mass loss during the incubation were 5, 530 and 255  mg, respectively, were isolated [16].|$|R
60|$|That it had {{a fascination}} for Oolanga goes without saying. He was never tired of visiting the museum in the tower, and spent endless hours in {{inspecting}} the exhibits, till he was thoroughly familiar with every detail of all of them. He asked permission to clean and polish and sharpen them--a favour which was readily granted. In addition to the above objects, there were many things of a kind to awaken human fear. Stuffed serpents of the most objectionable and horrid kind; giant insects from the tropics, fearsome in every detail; fishes and crustaceans covered with weird spikes; dried octopuses of great size. Other things, too, there were, not less deadly though seemingly innocuous--dried <b>fungi,</b> <b>traps</b> intended for birds, beasts, fishes, reptiles, and insects; machines which could produce pain of any kind and degree, and the only mercy {{of which was the}} power of producing speedy death.|$|R

However, no report {{is available on}} the use of yeast Saccharomyces cerviciacae for such purpose. The aim {{of this study was to}} ivestigate the use of both fungi to reduce the number of Heamoncus contortusinfective larvae. Agar and fecal media containing the spore of the fungi was inoculated with infected H. contortus larvae (3 rd stage). Fecal media containing the fungi was prepared by oral inoculation of sheepwith liquid containing 106, 107 spores of D. flagrans, and 106, 107 spores of D. flagrans, and 106, 1012 sporesof S. cerviciae. The number of larvae <b>trapped</b> in the <b>fungi</b> was counted. The result showed both fungi wereable to reduce the number of infective lave. However, for D. flagrans, beside it able to kill the larvae, it alsoable to trap the larva which did not occur in S. cerviceae.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study non-target effects of augmenting entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) communities in soil. When raw soil from a citrus orchard was augmented with either 2, 000 Steinernema riobrave or S. diaprepesi, fewer EPN (P ≤ 0. 05) survived if the soil had also been treated with 2, 000 S. riobrave 7 d earlier (i. e., two augmentation events rather than one). EPN survival was unaffected by treatment (P ≤ 0. 05) in soil that was air-dried to disrupt antagonist activity prior to the experiment. When S. diaprepesi, S. riobrave, Heterorhabditis zealandica or no EPN were added to raw soil and S. diaprepesi was added 5 d later, the survival of both S. diaprepesi and of total EPN was greater (P ≤ 0. 05) in soil that received no pretreatment than in soilpre treated with S. riobrave. Pretreatment of soil with H. zealandica or S. diaprepesi had less or no affect on survival of S. diaprepesi or total EPN. When nematodes were recovered from soil and placed on water agar, the number of S. diaprepesi that were killed by endoparasitic and <b>trapping</b> nematophagous <b>fungi</b> was greater (P ≤ 0. 05) if soil was pretreated with steinernematid species than if the soil was not pretreated or was pretreated with H. zealandica. The adverse effects of pretreating soil on EPN survival were density dependent within a range of pretreatment dosages (20 – 100 IJ/cm 2 soil surface), and the treatment effects required more time to become evident at lower than at higher dosages. These experiments suggest that non-target effects of augmenting the EPN community in soil vary among EPN species and {{have the potential to}} temporarily reduce EPN numbers below the natural equilibrium density...|$|R
30|$|The decay risk of {{airborne}} wood-decay fungi {{in the same}} volume of air was investigated by using an air sampler {{over the course of}} a year at three different sampling sites. Japanese cedar disks measuring 7.8  cm in diameter and about 3  mm in thickness, and with a moisture content of about 100  % were placed in a “BIOSAMP” air sampler and then exposed to 1000  l of air in the northern, central, and southwest parts of Japan. The exposed disks were incubated for 20  weeks in a damp container maintained at 26  ±  2  °C and degraded by <b>fungi</b> <b>trapped</b> on the disks. The decay risk was calculated from the mass loss during incubation, and the factors affecting the said risk were explored. The results showed that sampling sites apparently do not affect decay risk, even though the Scheffer’s climate indexes of the sites were quite different. The relation between the sampling month and decay risk reveals that decay risk remains virtually the same year-round. Relative humidity on a sampling day is one of the key factors affecting decay risk in sampling conducted at the central or southwest site. In contrast, no weather factors influenced decay risk at the northern sampling site.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{have studied}} the fate of {{electron}} dense microbodies in nematode-trapping organs (<b>traps)</b> of the <b>fungus</b> A. oligospora during the initial hours following nematode capture. The interaction studies were performed with isolated traps which had captured a nematode under conditions where the fungal cells had no access to external energy sources. Video enhanced contrast microscopy showed that under these conditions the number of dense bodies present in the trap cell that formed the penetration tube, rapidly decreased. During subsequent penetration {{and development of the}} infection bulb this decrease continued while at this time common cell organelles such as mitochondria and vacuoles were formed. This was confirmed by electron microscopy which also revealed that the dense bodies were degraded by means of an autophagic process. The organelles were degraded individually and finally turned into compartments which, based on ultrastructural criteria, were considered vacuoles. Fusion of such vacuoles into larger organelles frequently occurred. The degradation process was initiated early in the interaction since initial stages were already evident within 15 min after capture. Generally it took 1 - 2 h before the infection bulb had fully developed and trophic hyphae formation started. During this time the original trap cell, characterized by numerous dense bodies, was transformed into an activ...|$|R

During this time the original trap cell, characterized by numerous dense bodies, was transformed into an active vegetative hyphal cell containing typical cell organelles such as nuclei, mitochondria, a strongly proliferated endoplasmic reticulum, vacuoles and "normal" microbodies but lacked dense bodies. This disappearance of dense bodies was confined to the cell that penetrated the nematode and - less frequently - its two neighbouring cells in the hyphal loop. In the other cells, constituting the trap, the dense bodies remained unaffected. As will be discussed, the present results support our current view that traps of A. oligospora contribute to the survival of the organism in its natural environment. ...|$|R
