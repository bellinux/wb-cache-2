Since proas already have an outrigger to the windward side, a simple angled foil mounted on the ama becomes a Bruce foil, making the already stable proa even more stable. Bruce foils are often combined with inclined rigs, which results in a total cancellation of heeling forces. Inclined rigs are also well suited to the proa, as the direction of incline remains constant during shunting.|$|E

40|$|It {{has become}} obvious that modern ships suffer from {{problems}} related to their seakeeping-behavior, which is mainly related to large amplitude roll motion in head and following seas. As these effects {{are not covered by}} the existing intact stability criteria, an additional concept was developed. This new concept allows us to quantify the risk of the occurrence of large roll angles by calculating a capsiz-ing index. The question left open so far was, how much stability would be required for a certain ship to meet a distinct safety level against capsizing. This paper presents an approach addressing this ques-tion based on the analysis of some real capsizing acci-dents analyzed by applying various criteria proposed in the past, in comparison to the new intact stability index. For this purpose our simulation code, ROLLS, was applied, taking into account relevant effects such as cargo shift, additional <b>heeling</b> <b>moments</b> and water in-gress.

40|$|This {{presentation}} details [some of {{the work}} on] the Atlantis project, whose aim is the design, development, and experimental testing of an autonomous wind-propelled marine craft. Functionally, such a vehicle is the marine equivalent of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and would serve similar purposes. The Atlantis project {{has been able to}} demonstrate an advance in control precision of a wind-propelled marine vehicle from typical commercial autopilot accuracy of 100 meters to an accuracy of better than one meter with a prototype based on a modified Prindle- 19 light catamaran.

The wind-propulsion system is a rigid wing-sail mounted vertically on bearings, mass balanced to allow free rotation in azimuth about a stub-mast. Aerodynamic torque about the stub-mast is trimmed using a flying tail mounted on booms aft of the wing. This arrangement allows the wing-sail to automatically attain the optimum angle to the wind, and weathervane into gusts without inducing large <b>heeling</b> <b>moments.</b> The concept of using a wing upon a sailboat has been around almost as long as aircraft themselves.

50|$|For a {{controllable}} {{and fast}} gust response, the mast was carefully tuned to deflect {{from the top}} downwards {{with an increase in}} wind speed, causing the upper main to twist, reducing the <b>heeling</b> <b>moment.</b> The use of solid wings, rather than tubes as on similar boats (RS800 etc.), aids sailors new to the world of skiff racing while facilitating rapid movement across the 49er during maneuvers.|$|E
5000|$|Ballast {{takes many}} forms. The {{simplest}} form of ballast used in small day sailers is so-called [...] "live ballast", or {{the weight of}} the crew. By sitting on the windward side of the hull, the <b>heeling</b> <b>moment</b> must lift {{the weight of the}} crew. On more advanced racing boats, a wire harness called a trapeze is used to allow the crew to hang completely {{over the side of the}} hull without falling out; this provides much larger amounts of righting moment due to the larger leverage of the crew's weight, but can be dangerous if the wind suddenly dies, as the sudden loss of <b>heeling</b> <b>moment</b> can dump the crew in the water. On larger modern vessels, the keel is made of or filled with a high density material, such as concrete, iron, or lead. By placing the weight as low as possible (often in a large bulb at the bottom of the keel) the maximum righting moment can be extracted from the given mass. Traditional forms of ballast carried inside the hull were stones or sand.|$|E
50|$|In this maneuver, the {{mainsail}} will {{cross the}} center of the boat while the jib is pulled {{to the other side of}} the boat. If a spinnaker is up, its pole will have to be manually moved to the other side, to remain opposite the mainsail. In a dinghy, raising the centerboard can increase the risk of capsizing during what can be a somewhat violent maneuver, although the opposite is true of a dinghy with a flat, planing hull profile: raising the centerboard reduces <b>heeling</b> <b>moment</b> during the manouevre and so reduces the risk of capsize.|$|E
50|$|When {{a vessel}} has {{negative}} metacentric height (GM) i.e., is in unstable equilibrium, any external force {{applied to the}} vessel will cause it to start heeling. As it <b>heels,</b> the <b>moment</b> of inertia of the vessel's waterplane (a plane intersecting the hull at the water's surface) increases, which increases the vessel's BM (distance {{from the center of}} Buoyancy to the Metacenter). Since there is relatively little change in KB (distance from the Keel to the center of Buoyancy) of the vessel, the KM (distance from Keel to the Metacenter) of the vessel increases.|$|R

50|$|In sailing, hiking ({{stacking}} or stacking out in New Zealand) is {{the action}} of moving the crew's body weight as far to windward (upwind) as possible, in order to decrease the extent the boat heels (leans away from the wind).
