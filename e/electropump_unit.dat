40|$|The {{immersing}} <b>electropump</b> <b>unit</b> {{has been}} investigated. The mathametical {{model of the}} system the thyristor commutator of the immersing <b>electropump</b> <b>unit</b> - the well in the transient conditions has been developed. The device of the smooth start and break gives the increase of the middle working time till the failure by 1, 28 times. The program of modeling of the asynchronous thyristor regulation is {{being used in the}} study process of the Higher School; the developed diagram solution of the device of a smooth start and break has easily been built into the control stations SAUNA and CASCADE instead of the magnetic starter.
