5|$|Their {{happiness}} {{together is}} brought to an end when Calchas persuades Agamemnon to arrange Cressida's return to him {{as part of a}} hostage exchange in which the captive Trojan Antenor is freed. The two lovers are distraught and <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> eloping together but they finally cooperate with the exchange. Despite Cressida's initial intention to remain faithful to Troilus, the Greek warrior Diomedes wins her heart. When Troilus learns of this, he seeks revenge on Diomedes and the Greeks and dies in battle. Just as Cressida betrayed Troilus, Antenor was later to betray Troy.|$|E
25|$|To {{explain the}} {{categories}} in more detail, {{they are the}} preconditions {{of the construction of}} objects in the mind. Indeed, to <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the sun and stone presupposes the category of subsistence, that is, substance. For the categories synthesize the random data of the sensory manifold into intelligible objects. This means that the categories are also the most abstract things one can say of any object whatsoever, and hence one can have an a priori cognition of the totality of all objects of experience if one can list all of them. To do so, Kant formulates another transcendental deduction.|$|E
25|$|Since Charles Darwin, the {{willingness}} of some humans to sacrifice themselves for genetically unrelated {{members of the same}} large, diffuse group (such as a religion or a nation) has raised a theoretical challenge. Social psychological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are motivated by commitment to the larger collective whereas anthropological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are triggered by commitment to other members of the group. The distinction between local and extended fusion provides an explanation for these apparently competing explanations. Local fusion is proposed to occur in relatively small, homogeneous groups whose members attach to each other through direct personal contact (e.g., families or work teams). In contrast, extended fusion occurs in relatively large groups whose members do not all have personal relationships (e.g., political parties or nation states). In extended fusion, even though fused individuals may not actually know all of their fellow group members, they still feel like they know them and <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> them as like family.|$|E

I should like to live in a sparry grot, and sleep upon a couch of sweet leaves!' ...|$|R

They both soon become friends and Cricket becomes Pinocchio's most {{faithful}} advisor, never leaving his side.

[...] which sounds like a military command, and proceeds to put you {{through a series of}} moves without pause for breath, Beyoncé and her minions cracking the whip every time you <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> flagging.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a common}} belief that number of module ranks equals number of sides. As above data shows, this is not true. [...] One can also find 2-side/1-rank modules.

2500|$|During a 2008 interview, {{when asked}} if he had ever benefited from his parents' {{connection}} to the entertainment industry, Thicke answered, [...] "It never helped. It's always been a hindrance … People can't see me without seeing them, and it affects the way people see me … When you listen to Jay-Z's music, you don't see his mother and father standing there. You don't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> his mother and father. But if you knew all of Jay-Z's family, you might think of him differently. With me, people still visualize my dad and that affects the origin of the music." ...|$|E

50|$|Both Durr-e-Shehwar and Mansoor love Shandana and Sophia a lot. But Shandana envies {{her mother}} {{thinking}} that she led a comfortable and happy {{life with a}} loving husband and nothing to worry about. And thus, she often compares Haider and her father. Shandana also undergoes a stage <b>of</b> semi-depression and <b>evens</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> divorcing Haider. When Mansoor gets to know this, he gets angry on Haider. He reports this matter to his sister i.e. Haider's mother, thus, further complicating the matter.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the writing}} and {{recording}} of One Hot Minute (1995), Flea integrated some use of slap-bass progressions, {{but continued to}} center his technique around the philosophy of [...] "less is more" [...] rather than complexity: [...] "I can't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anything I played that was complex even the slapping stuff is simple. It's original-sounding, and I'm proud of that– but what I played was {{more a matter of}} aesthetic choice." [...] This led Flea to alter the way he wrote music by playing alone, instead of the jam sessions that would dictate how the band conceived songs: [...] " [...] is the least jam-oriented record we've made. I mean, we definitely jammed on the ideas, but there's only one groove on the whole album that came from a jam, 'Deep Kick'. The rest of it came from my sitting down with a guitar or bass." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{elevation}} to {{the status}} of a beloved classic came decades after its initial release, when it became a television staple during Christmas season in the late 1970s. This came as a welcome surprise to Frank Capra and others involved with its production. [...] "It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen," [...] Capra told The Wall Street Journal in 1984. [...] "The film has {{a life of its own}} now, and I can look at it like I had nothing to do with it. I'm like a parent whose kid grows up to be president. I'm proud... but it's the kid who did the work. I didn't <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as a Christmas story when I first ran across it. I just liked the idea." [...] In a 1946 interview, Capra described the film's theme as [...] "the individual's belief in himself" [...] and that he made it [...] "to combat a modern trend toward atheism".|$|E

2500|$|After being [...] "utterly inspired" [...] by Jonathon Porritt's book Seeing Green, Lucas {{joined the}} Green Party in 1986. She {{recalled}} in 2007: [...] "I thought, right! I'm going there now" [...] to the Green's main office on Clapham High Street, near where she lived. [...] "I'm {{just going to}} dedicate {{the rest of my}} life to this party". Soon afterwards she became the party's National Press Officer (1987–89) and Co-Chair (1989–90). Lucas has a reputation as a party moderniser, in terms of internal slang, a [...] "spiky" [...] rather than a [...] "fluffy". In a 2009 Guardian interview, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "when I was putting people up to go on TV programmes I'd be saying to them, 'What are you planning to wear?', and they'd be slightly offended that I'd <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> asking the question. But I do genuinely think that has changed, a lot. It's a recognition, not that there's some kind of terrible compromise about putting on a tie, but that actually you don't want people to be focusing on what you look like but on what you're saying".|$|E
2500|$|Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post {{gave the}} first anime episode a B+ and said [...] "I’ll {{admit that the}} concept is {{familiar}} {{and at the same}} time goofy, but there’s a certain quality about it that’s charming, sexy and has the potential to be a hell of a lot of fun." [...] He give later episodes B's, writing that [...] "the show does feel like it’s trying to be a bit educational though it tends to fall more on the whole titillation side more than anything else." [...] In his review of episode 9, he wrote that [...] "the show takes things further than reality would in a lot of ways, there’s a lot of fun in just having characters that actually acknowledge some form of sexuality that exists." [...] and summarized the series as [...] "Silly and serious but with a great dose of a fanservice, this show is just a delight to watch." [...] In reviewing the final episode, he wrote [...] "It does things that most shows are afraid to <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> never mind even trying a fraction of doing when it comes to character relationships, intimacy and sexuality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rigoletto premiered on 11 March 1851 in a sold-out La Fenice as {{the first}} part of a double bill with Giacomo Panizza's ballet Faust. Gaetano Mares conducted, and the sets were {{designed}} and executed by Giuseppe Bertoja and Francesco Bagnara. The opening night was a complete triumph, especially the scena drammatica and the Duke's cynical aria, [...] "La donna è mobile", which was sung in the streets the next morning (Verdi had maximised the aria's impact by only revealing it to the cast and orchestra a few hours before the premiere, and forbidding them to sing, whistle or <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the melody outside of the theatre). Many years later, Giulia Cora Varesi, the daughter of Felice Varesi (the original Rigoletto), described her father's performance at the premiere. Varesi was very uncomfortable with the false hump he had to wear; he was so uncertain that, even though he was quite an experienced singer, he had a panic attack when {{it was his turn to}} enter the stage. Verdi immediately realised he was paralysed and roughly pushed him on the stage, so he appeared with a clumsy tumble. The audience, thinking it was an intentional gag, was very amused.|$|E

2500|$|Dean, having {{obtained}} divorce {{papers in}} Mexico, had first returned to New York to marry Inez, only {{to leave her}} {{and go back to}} Camille. After his recovery from dysentery in Mexico, Sal returns to New York in the fall. He finds a girl, Laura, and plans to move with her to San Francisco. Sal writes to Dean about his plan to move to San Francisco. Dean writes back saying that he's willing to come and accompany Laura and Sal. Dean arrives over five weeks early, but Sal is out taking a late-night walk alone. Sal returns home, sees a copy of Proust, and knows it is Dean's. Sal realizes his friend has arrived, but at a time when Sal doesn't have the money to relocate to San Francisco. On hearing this Dean makes the decision to head back to Camille. Sal's friend Remi Boncoeur denies Sal's request to give Dean a short lift to 40th Street {{on their way to a}} Duke Ellington concert at the Metropolitan Opera House. Sal's girlfriend Laura realizes this is a painful moment for Sal and prompts him for a response as the party drives off without Dean. Sal replies: [...] "He'll be alright". Sal later reflects as he sits on a river pier under a New Jersey night sky about the roads and lands of America that he has travelled and states: [...] "[...] [...] I think of Dean Moriarty, I <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Old Dean Moriarty the father we never found, I think of Dean Moriarty." ...|$|E
