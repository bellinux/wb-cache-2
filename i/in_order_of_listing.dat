40|$|This paper {{examines}} identification {{power of}} the instrument exogeneity assumption in the treatment effect model. We derive the identification region: The set of potential outcome distributions that are compatible with data and the model restriction. The model restrictions whose identifying power is investigated are (i) instrument independence {{of each of the}} potential outcome (marginal independence), (ii) instrument joint independence of the potential outcomes and the selection heterogeneity, and (iii) instrument monotonicity in addition to (ii) (the LATE restriction of Imbens and Angrist (1994)), where these restrictions become stronger <b>in</b> the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>listing.</b> By comparing the size of the identification region under each restriction, we show that the joint independence restriction can provide further identifying information for the potential outcome distributions than marginal independence, but the LATE restriction never does since it solely constrains the distribution of data. We also derive the tightest possible bounds for the average treatment effects under each restriction. Our analysis covers both the discrete and continuous outcome case, and extends the treatment effect bounds of Balke and Pearl (1997) that are available only for the binary outcome case to a wider range of settings including the continuous outcome case...|$|R

40|$|We propose and analyse a quasirandom {{analogue}} of {{the classical}} push model for disseminating information in networks (“randomized rumor spreading”). In the classical model, in each round each informed vertex chooses a neighbor at random and informs it, {{if it was not}} before. It is known that this simple pro-tocol succeeds in spreading a rumor from one vertex to all others within O(logn) rounds on complete graphs, hypercubes, random regular graphs, Erdős-Rényi ran-dom graph and Ramanujan graphs with high probability. In the quasirandom model, we assume that each vertex has a (cyclic) <b>list</b> <b>of</b> its neighbors. Once informed, it starts at a random position <b>of</b> the <b>list,</b> but from then on informs its neighbors <b>in</b> the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> the <b>list.</b> Surprisingly, irrespective <b>of</b> the <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lists,</b> the above mentioned bounds still hold.

Our argument is also applied to the notions of computational complexity theory: quantum truth-table reducibility and quantum truth-table autoreducibility...|$|R

40|$|We give a time-randomness {{tradeoff}} for the quasi-random rumor spreading protocol {{proposed by}} Doerr, Friedrich and Sauerwald [SODA 2008] on complete graphs. In this protocol, {{the goal is}} to spread a piece of information originating from one vertex throughout the network. Each vertex is assumed to have a (cyclic) <b>list</b> <b>of</b> its neighbors. Once a vertex is informed by one of its neighbors, it chooses a position in its list uniformly at random and then informs its neighbors starting from that position and proceeding <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> the <b>list.</b> Angelopoulos, Doerr, Huber and Panagiotou [Electron. J. Combin. 2009] showed that after (1 +o(1)) (_ 2 n + n) rounds, the rumor will have been broadcasted to all nodes with probability 1 - o(1). We study the broadcast time when the amount of randomness available at each node is reduced in natural way. In particular, we prove that if each node can only make its initial random selection from every ℓ-th node on its list, then there exists lists such that (1 -ε) (_ 2 n + n - _ 2 ℓ - ℓ) +ℓ- 1 steps are needed to inform every vertex with probability at least 1 -O((-n^ε/ 2 n)). This shows that a further reduction of the amount of randomness used in a simple quasi-random protocol comes at a loss of efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of identifying names which occur frequently <b>in</b> an <b>ordered</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> names. Such names are called hot spots. Hot spots can be identified easily by counting the occurrences of each name and then selecting those with large counts.

These techniques guess the frequently occurring names, while using less space than the simple solution. We have implemented and tested both techniques using several types of input traces. Our experiments show that very accurate guesses can be made using much less space than the simple solution would require. (Also cross-referenced as UMIACS-TR- 93 - 74...|$|R
