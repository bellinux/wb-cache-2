5|$|Flick {{began his}} career in semi-professional {{baseball}} and played in minor league baseball for two years. He was noticed by George Stallings, {{the manager of the}} Phillies, who signed Flick as a reserve outfielder. Flick was pressed into a starting role in 1898 when an injury forced another player to retire. He excelled as a starter. Flick <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> the Athletics in 1902, but an court injunction prevented him from playing in Pennsylvania. He joined the Naps, where he continued to play for the remainder of his major league career, which was curtailed by a stomach ailment.|$|E

30|$|The method we {{used here}} is to find some regions so that the orbits of (1.5) {{starting}} from them approach the axes as n tends to infinity.

40|$|Abstract. Consider {{a variant}} of the simple random walk on the inte-gers, with the {{following}} transition mechanism. At each site x, the proba-bility of <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> the right is ω(x) ∈ [1 2, 1), until the first time the pro-cess <b>jumps</b> <b>to</b> the left from site x, from which time onward the probabil-ity of <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> the right is 1 2. We investigate the transience/recurrence properties of this process in both deterministic and stationary, ergodic environments {ω(x) }x∈Z. In deterministic environments, we also study the speed of the process. 1...|$|R
