Demolition <b>of</b> the previous <b>building</b> on the site - the 1950s office block Bowater House - took place between July and December 2006. Construction work began in January 2007. The superstructure <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> was completed in March 2009. <b>Fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> began in April 2009. In August 2010 a penthouse in the development was rumoured to be sold for £140 million, making it the most expensive residential property in Britain. Also in that month {{it was announced that}} McLaren Automotive would be opening a car showroom in the building in early 2011. However, a newspaper report {{at the time of the}} development's launch party in January 2011 indicated that according to Land Registry records the sale of only five properties had been completed - the 'recordbreaking' £140 million penthouse being sold to the development's own financial backer Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani for £40.5 million in August 2010. One to an Indian family in mining and oil and an adjoining penthouse to One Hyde Park developer Christian Candy, who reportedly paid £31 million, [...] "about £100 million less than the asking price".|$|R

Neve, the Warbleton millwright was responsible for the <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the roundhouse as a power mill. The mill stood derelict for many years with major structural faults, including both side girts being broken.|$|R

As part of the UERL group, the CCE obtained its electricity from the company's Lots Road Power Station, originally built for the electrification of the MDR; the proposed Chalk Farm generating station was not built. The final section of the approved route between Charing Cross and the Embankment was not constructed, and the southern terminus on opening was Charing Cross. After a period of test running, the railway was ready to open in 1907.|$|R

The <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> this fleet was slow and difficult, {{and it did not}} set sail from Île-d'Aix, France until 22 June 1746. A subsequent storm in the Bay of Biscay and adverse winds slowed the transatlantic crossing. Disease broke out on the ships - typhus and scurvy.|$|R

It was but a very few weeks, nay days ago, {{that she had been}} quite convinced that the King himself would be foremost in the general desire to fit out an expedition for the rescue of the unfortunate Jacobites, and naturally the <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> such an expedition would have been entrusted primarily to herself and incidentally to her husband.|$|R
50|$|Production of {{complete}} motor buses (and of any two-axle motor buses) had ended in 1978, and {{aside from the}} <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the last articulated MAN shells, the only production in 1979 was that of two batches of trolleybuses (and the only such vehicles ever built by the company). These were all 40 ft vehicles, model 10240T: 110 trackless trolleys for the Philadelphia trolleybus system, operated by SEPTA, and 109 for the Seattle trolleybus system, operated by Metro Transit (now King County Metro). One of the latter has been preserved (following its retirement in 2003) by King County Metro (see King County Metro fleet).|$|R
50|$|When the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company {{was formed}} in 1865, Canning was {{appointed}} its chief engineer. He had charge of the manufacture and laying of the transatlantic telegraph cables of 1865 and 1866, for which the company were the contractors. This work involved the <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the SS Great Eastern. On 2 August 1865 the cable broke in 2000 fathoms of water. After a second cable had been successfully laid by the Great Eastern (13-27 July 1866) Canning set to work to recover the broken cable, using special grappling machinery, which he devised for the purpose. After several failures the cable was eventually recovered on 2 September 1866.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1943, work was under way on the {{conversion}} of HMCS Prince David and HMCS Prince Henry to landing ship infantry (medium) LSI (M). They were reconfigured to carry 550 infantrymen transported in six landing craft assault (LCA) and two landing craft mechanised (LCM), and have large sick-bay facilities for the anticipated casualties. Their old 6-inch guns were replaced with two twin [...] mountings, two single Bofors 40 mm guns, and ten Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. The rebuilding, which took place at Esquimalt and Vancouver, was completed in December 1943 and shortly after re-commissioning, she left for the United Kingdom via Cristobal and New York, under Captain T.D. Kelly RCNR, (her final commanding officer) who had supervised the <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> both ships.|$|R

50|$|The {{peace is}} announced; Napoleon is exiled to Elba. The {{crew of the}} Bellona are paid off and the ship goes into {{ordinary}} storage. Aubrey and Maturin read newspapers to learn world events while they were blockading Brest, adjusting to peace. They agree to a plan with the three men from the Chilean independence movement. Aubrey requests suspension from the Navy List, and is put on loan to the hydrographic office. Maturin finances the <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the Surprise, which takes until February 1815. They sail to Madeira with their families aboard. After a brief time on the island, their families will take the packet home. Instead, Lord Keith, commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, sends orders to Aubrey reinstating him because Napoleon has escaped from Elba. Aubrey takes command of the Royal Navy ships in the harbour of Madeira to blockade the Straits of Gibraltar.|$|R

500|$|The {{station was}} {{selected}} for use as an underground bunker in early 1939 {{as part of a}} programme of developing deep shelters to protect government operations from bombing in the event of war. The platform faces were bricked up and the enclosed platform areas and space in the circulation passages were divided up into offices, meeting rooms and dormitories. The engineering and structural work was carried out by the London Passenger Transport Board and the <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the rooms and installation of the power and communications equipment was done by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. A two-person lift was installed in the original emergency stairwell and a telephone exchange, toilets and bathrooms were added. The main occupant of the shelter was the Railway Executive Committee, but it was also used as a shelter by prime minister Winston Churchill and his war cabinet until the Cabinet War Rooms were ready for use. Churchill called the establishment at Down Street [...] "The Barn".|$|R
60|$|Martin {{did as he}} was requested--so far, that is to say, as {{the first}} half of the {{commission}} was concerned. As regarded the second, he took it upon himself to make certain changes. Having seen Mr Keith to his room, he put the <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the relief ship into the good hands of a group of his fellow guests whom he discovered in the porch. Elsa's feelings towards her rescuer might be one of unmixed gratitude; but it might, on the other hand, be one of resentment. He did not wish her to connect him in her mind with the episode in any way whatsoever. Martin had once released a dog from a trap, and the dog had bitten him. He had been on an errand of mercy, but the dog had connected him with his sufferings and acted accordingly. It occurred to Martin that Elsa's frame of mind would be uncommonly like that dog's.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the house}} was {{acquired}} by English Heritage in 1995, {{it was in a}} dangerously dilapidated condition, having been uninhabited since 1923, and was described by English Heritage as [...] "the most significant building at risk in London". It was painstakingly restored in a ten-year £4.5m project by Purcell Miller Tritton architects. Bexley Heritage Trust, a local heritage charity, was involved in partnership with English Heritage from 2000 and completed the interior furnishing and <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the house prior to its reopening by HM The Queen in Spring 2005. The Danson Park grounds were also restored, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, in 2006. In 2016, the borough cancelled its grant to the Bexley Heritage Trust for the upkeep of the property, and the charity therefore withdrew to focus on Hall Place, and the house fell under direct management from the borough. The council has subsequently made Danson House the register office for Bexley Borough.|$|R
