50|$|A {{rat-tail}} splice, {{also known}} as a twist splice or a pig-tail splice, is a very basic <b>electrical</b> <b>splice</b> that can be done with both solid and stranded wire. It is made by taking two or more bare wires of the same diameter and wrapping them together symmetrically around the common axis of both wires. The bare splice can be insulated with electrical tape or other means.|$|E
50|$|A {{trick of}} the eye is used to produce {{visually}} distinct neon display segments by blocking out parts of the tube with an opaque coating. One complete assembly may be composed of contiguous tube elements joined by glass welding to one another so that the same current passes through, for example, several letters joined end to end from cathode to cathode. To the untrained eye, this looks like separate tubes, but the <b>electrical</b> <b>splice</b> is the plasma inside the crossover glass itself. The entire tube lights up, but the segments that the viewer {{is not supposed to}} see are covered with highly opaque special black or gray glass paint. This heat-resistant coating is either painted on or dipped. Without blockout paint, the unintended visual connections would make the display appear confusing.|$|E
40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>splices</b> between NbTi Rutherford type cables {{need to be}} {{made for}} the LHC IR inner triplet quadrupoles. Splices between magnets as well as {{internal}} to the magnets are necessary. Various splice configurations, solders, and fluxes have been considered. Testing of these splices at cryogenic temperatures and at various currents has been completed. The results were satisfactory; Fermilab is capable of making excellent low resistance (< 1 n Omega) solder joints for the LHC project. (4 refs) ...|$|R

50|$|Friction tape {{is a type}} of {{adhesive}} tape made from cloth impregnated with a rubber-based adhesive, mainly used to insulate splices in electric wires and cables. Because the adhesive is impregnated in the cloth, friction tape is sticky on both sides. The rubber-based adhesive makes it an electrical insulator and provides a degree of protection from liquids and corrosion. In the past, friction tape was widely used by electricians, but PVC electrical tape has replaced it in most applications today. The frictional properties of the tape come from the cloth material, which is usually made from cotton, while the fabric base protects <b>electrical</b> <b>splices</b> against punctures and abrasion.|$|R
40|$|Low {{resistance}} <b>electrical</b> <b>splices</b> between rare-earth barium {{copper oxide}} (REBCO) coated conductors are key technology for high temperature superconductor magnets. A splice must satisfy two main requirements: 1) reproducible low electrical resistance; and 2) high mechanical strength. Systematic {{measurements of the}} splices are required because the internal interface resistances of the REBCO-coated conductor (e. g., REBCO/Ag interface) are difficult to be predicted. In this paper, the electrical resistance of lap joints made from REBCO tapes produced by different manufacturers has been experimentally investigated at 4. 2 K and in fields of up to 12. 4 T. The same sample splices were also measured at 77 K and in self-field in order to define a lift factor correlating joints resistances at 77 and 4. 2 K. As expected, a strong effect on the conductor orientation in the splice was found...|$|R
40|$|The {{interconnections}} {{between the}} Large Hadron Collider (LHC) magnets have required some 40 000 TIG welded joints and 65 000 <b>electrical</b> <b>splices.</b> At {{the level of}} single joints and splices, non-destructive techniques find limited application: quality control {{is based on the}} qualification of the process and of operators, on the recording of production parameters and on production samples. Visual inspection and process audits were the main techniques used. At the level of an extended chain of joints and splices - from a 53. 5 m half-cell to a complete 2. 7 km arc sector - quality control is based on vacuum leak tests, electrical tests and RF microwave reflectometry that progressively validated the work performed. Subsequent pressure tests, cryogenic circuits flushing with high pressure helium and cool-downs revealed a few unseen or new defects. This paper presents an overview of the quality control techniques used, seeking lessons applicable to similar large, complex projects...|$|R
5000|$|... "Pig-tailing" [...] which {{involves}} splicing a short length of copper wire (pigtail) {{to the original}} aluminum wire, and then attaching the copper wire to the existing <b>electrical</b> device. The <b>splice</b> of the copper pigtail to the existing aluminum wire can be accomplished with special crimp connectors, special miniature lug-type connectors, or approved twist-on connectors (with special installation procedures).|$|R
50|$|Buildings {{designed}} with sustainable architecture principles use airtight technologies to conserve energy. Under low energy building, passive house, low-energy house, self-sufficient homes, zero energy building, and superinsulation standards, structures {{must be more}} air-tight than previously. Air barriers, careful sealing of construction joints and service penetrations (holes for pipes, etc.) achieve this. Airtightness minimizes the amount of warm (or cool) air that can pass through the structure, so the mechanical ventilation system can recover the heat before discharging air externally. Green buildings may include windows that combine triple-pane insulated glazing with argon or krypton gas to reduce thermal conductivity and increase efficiency. In landscape and exterior construction projects, airtight seals protect general service and landscape lighting <b>electrical</b> connections and <b>splices.</b> Many other specific applications must meet airtight standards to be waterproof or vapor-proof for human safety and proper function.|$|R
