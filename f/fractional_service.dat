40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{performance}} analysis of Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms in IP (Internet Protocol) networks is presented. IP QoS mechanisms are surveyed and classified as either non-fractional service rate reserved or <b>fractional</b> <b>service</b> rate reserved. We {{show that most}} mechanisms supporting Differentiated Services (DiffServ) are non-fractional service rate reserved, while most supporting Integrated Service (IntServ) are <b>fractional</b> <b>service</b> rate reserved...|$|E
40|$|Packet {{scheduling}} is key {{to quality}} of service (QoS) capabilities of broadband wired and wireless networks. In a heterogeneous traffic environment, a comprehensive QoS packet scheduler must {{strike a balance between}} flow fairness and access delay. Many advanced packet scheduling solutions have targeted fair bandwidth allocation while protecting delay-constrained traffic by adding priority queue(s) on top of a fair bandwidth scheduler. Priority queues are known to cause performance uncertainties and, thus, various modifications have been proposed. In this paper, we present a packet queueing engine dubbed <b>Fractional</b> <b>Service</b> Buffer (FSB), which, when coupled with a configurable flow scheduler, can achieve desired QoS objectives, such as fair throughputs and differentiated delay guarantees. Key performance metrics, such as delay limit and probability of delay limit violation, are derived as a function of key FSB parameters for each delay class in the packet queueing engine using diffusion approximations. OPNET simulations verify these analytical results...|$|E
50|$|The AAL1gator {{has been}} used in several {{applications}} that were completely different than the application it was designed for. The designers knew they had a hit product when reports of these uses came in. One use was to provide <b>fractional</b> T1 <b>service</b> over microwave radio. Another use was to move DS1's around within a box.|$|R

[...] Flight Options currently provides a suite of <b>fractional</b> jet <b>services,</b> membership and 25-hour jet card programs for personal travel by individuals using a full line of previously owned aircraft from a diverse range of manufacturers.|$|R
5000|$|Ricci founded Cleveland, Ohio-based Flight Options in 1998 in {{an effort}} to develop a {{nationwide}} <b>fractional</b> jet <b>services</b> ownership program. Flight Options enjoyed significant early success, with its annual revenues growing from $35 million to $300 million in 17 months of operations. [...] In December 2001, the company combined operations with Raytheon Travel Air, a subsidiary of Raytheon Company, doubling the company's size.|$|R
40|$|We report {{simulation}} results and prototype control protocols for a {{digital subscriber loop}} transmission system, which will find anti operate at the highest common bidirectional transmission rate that is viable on a given loop while preserving a specified noise margin. A prototype implements the rate-adaptation and transmission protocols over a captive muir|gauge earle facility. Simulation results predict the accompanying symbol rate versus reach characteristics for a transceiver with the same structure as today's basic access (BRA) systems under RA-DSL control. Results predict that 1. 5 Mb/s could be deliv- ered to loops up to 2 kin while subscribers out to 10 km could receive 80 kb/s (lB + D service). For a number of specialized or short-notice situations such as <b>Fractional</b> TI <b>service</b> re- quests, n x DS- 0 video conferencing, and cable exhaust, RADSL could {{be the basis for}} a fast and flexible response vehicle. If RA-DSL cannot serve an individual combination of distance and capacity, existing methods remain. However, a statistical assessment with metro population data shm*s the potential for RA-DSL to satisfy 4 - 6 times more n x DS- 0 access requests than BRA, on existing copper, without carrier serving area constraints...|$|R
40|$|This paper models the {{temporal}} adoption dynamics of an abstracted Internet technology or service, where the instantaneous net {{value of the}} service perceived by each (current or potential) user / customer incorporates three key features: i) user service affinity heterogeneity, ii) a network externality, and iii) a subscription cost. Internet technologies and services with network externalities face a "chicken and egg" adoption problem in that the service requires an established customer base {{in order to attract}} new customers. In this paper we study cost subsidization as a means to "reach the knee", at which point the externality drives rapid service adoption, and thereby change the equilibrium <b>service</b> <b>fractional</b> adoption level from an initial near-zero level to a final near-one level (full adoption). We present three simple subsidy models and evaluate them under two natural performance metrics: i) the duration required for the subsidized service to reach a given target adoption level, and ii) the aggregate cost of the subsidy born by the service provide. First, we present a "two target adoption subsidy" (TTAS) that subsidizes the cost so as to keep the fraction of users with positive net utility at a (constant) target level until the actual adoption target is reached. Second, we study a special case of the above where the target ensures all users have positive net utility, corresponding to a "quickest adoption" subsidy (QAS). Third, we introduce an approximation of QAS, called AQAS, that only requires the service provider adjust the subsidy level a prescribed number of times. Fourth, we study equilibria and their stability under uniformly and normally distributed user service affinities, highlighting the unstable equilibrium in each case as the natural target adoption level for the provider. Finally, we provide a fictional case study to illustrate the results. Comment: 29 pages, 15 figures. Accepted for publication by ACM Transactions on Internet Technologies on April 30, 2017.
