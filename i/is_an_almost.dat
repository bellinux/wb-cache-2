Due to various changes in the ecosystem, some of them human-induced, efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened whitebark pine.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus was {{described}} in a 2009 paper authored by Xu et al. in the journal Nature. The description incorporated data from two subadult specimens found in close association: the holotype, IVPP V 15923, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> complete articulated (i.e. with the bones laid out {{as they were in}} life) skeleton; and the other, IVPP V 15304, is a likewise almost complete articulated specimen, only missing the skull. The second specimen is 15% larger than the holotype. These specimens have also respectively been referred to by the erroneous specimen numbers IVPP V 15924 and IVPP V 16134.|$|E
5|$|The female fisher {{begins to}} breed at about {{one year of}} age and her {{reproductive}} cycle <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> year-long event. Mating takes place in late March to early April. Blastocyst implantation is then delayed for 10 months until mid-February of the following year when active pregnancy begins. After gestating for about 50 days, the female gives birth to one to four kits. The female then enters estrus 7–10 days later and the breeding cycle begins again.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, NASA {{launched}} the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements {{showed that the}} CMB frequency spectrum <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> perfect blackbody with no deviations {{at a level of}} 1 part in 104, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 105. John C. Mather and George Smoot were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.|$|E
5|$|Mole crickets {{have three}} life stages, eggs, nymphs, and adults. Most {{of their life}} in these stages is spent underground, but adults have wings and {{disperse}} in the breeding season. They vary in their diet; some species are vegetarian, mainly feeding on roots, others are omnivores, including worms and grubs in their diet, while a few are largely predatory. Male mole crickets have an exceptionally loud song; they sing from a subsurface burrow that opens out into {{the air in the}} shape of an exponential horn. The song <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> pure tone, modulated into chirps. It is used to attract females, either for mating, or for indicating favourable habitats for them to lay their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The main {{settlement}} {{on the island}} today is Biggings, which overlooks Housa Voe and is surrounded by in-bye land {{to the east of}} the hill dyke (which runs south from West Voe). To the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial moraine about one and a half kilometres in length. Much {{of the rest of the}} area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till. There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile. The lack of peat led to 'turf scalping' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} special {{relativity}} {{can be summarized}} by treating space and time as a unified structure known as spacetime (withc relating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameterc. Lorentz invariance <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameterc is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts thatc is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves. In non-inertial frames of reference (gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames), the local speed of light is constant and equal toc, but {{the speed of light}} along a trajectory of finite length can differ fromc, depending on how distances and times are defined.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene of}} Limbaugh rescuing Brian <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> shot-for-shot {{homage to the}} scene of Mr. Miyagi rescuing Daniel in The Karate Kid. Returning home after being saved by Limbaugh, Brian begins {{watching}} the NBC comedy series The Office, featuring actor and comedian Rainn Wilson. Deciding to thank Limbaugh for his newfound conservatism, Brian is taken by Limbaugh to the National Republican Party headquarters in Washington, D.C., in order to meet former President of the United States George W. Bush and United States Senator John McCain from Arizona. McCain then recalls when he and Limbaugh solved mysteries together. A parody of the animated television series Scooby-Doo is then shown, including McCain and Limbaugh capturing United States Congressman Barney Frank from Massachusetts, disguised as a mummy.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in side view, and nearly three times {{as long as it}} is high. There <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E

5|$|Nunavut Tourism did not, as of 2002, produce {{detailed}} {{statistics about}} tourism numbers, trends and characteristics. However, by 2010, this {{appeared to have}} changed, with Nunavut Tourism providing media outlets with general figures on trends in tourism in Nunavut. Tourism brings approximately CAD $30 million to Nunavut's economy each year according to Nunavut Tourism, with one in five of its tourists arriving on cruise ships. Between June and October 2008, 33,378 people visited Nunavut by air and sea, according to the territory's Department of Economic Development and Transportation. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> 16 percent increase {{on the number of}} people who visited Nunavut by air and sea during the same period in 2006, which was 28,802 people. The average age of people arriving in Nunavut was 46 during the period in 2008 that the Department of Economic Development and Transportation conducted its survey, and the majority of visitors were in the territory for business purposes. 96 percent of all business travellers entering the territory were domestic travellers (Canadian residents). However, among the leisure traveller sub-group, the proportion of domestic travellers declines - Canadians make up only 72 percent of the leisure traveller arrival numbers, with travellers from the United States (20 percent) and other countries (8 percent) making up the difference. September and July account for 46 percent of arrivals, making them the busiest arrival months.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> {{complete}} {{example of}} a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E
5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> direct quotation from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E
