40|$|Orosius argentatus shows extreme colour {{variation}} and is reputedly highly polyphagous, circumstances that both warrant confirmation that the taxon comprises only one species. Because the species transmits phytoplasma pathogens between plants, information on species status {{is relevant to}} epidemiological studies. Replicated field samples, taken in Mareeba, North Queensland, over 2 years indicated that O. argentatus is the most abundant leaf-hopper in stylo (Stylosanthes scabra) and is relatively host-specific on cultivated stylo, at least locally. A priori groupings of colour types were established for morphometric analyses of head, prothorax, tibia, wing and genitalia characters. No consistent morphological differences were detected across the colour types, and results from colour heritability trials, although limited, revealed that females could produce progeny that belong to multiple colour types. The {{results from this study}} suggest individuals that <b>key</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the species O. argentatus, despite being polymorphic in colour, cannot be clearly separated on any morphological basis and therefore are likely to belong to a single, interbreeding population.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of three {{morphological}} characters (e. g., filament, width, chloroplast number, and type of cell end wall), six filament types of Spirogyra were collected along Bear Creek in the Santa Catalina Mountains near Tucson, Arizona. The occurrence and distribution of filament types showed seasonal and geographical patterns. Filaments were more frequently collected in early summer from pools at lower elevation. Growth of Spirogyra {{may be influenced by}} water temperature, pH, and water amount. Most filaments occurred more abundantly while water temperture and pH were relatively high. The number of filament types was greatest at sites with a semi-permanent water supply rather than in temporary and permanent pools. Of the six types of Spirogyra, Type V showed morphological and genetic changes through vegetative growth and sexual reproduction in a clonal culture in the laboratory. After 33 months culturing, a narrower filament-width group (Group II, 22. 0 ± 1. 1 μm) was produced in the original clone (Group I, 30. 9 (+OR-) 0. 7 μm). Groups I and II were homothallic and sexually compatible. Zygospores from the cross of I x II yielded germlilngs of Groups I, II, III (27. 2 ± 1. 0 μm) and a binucleate IV (44. 9 ± 0. 8 μm). Chromosome counts were: Group I (24), Group II (12), Group III (18), and Group IV (24, one nucleus). Relative nuclear-DNA fluorescence values increased as filament width and chromosome number increased. Cytologically, Group I is a tetraploid, Group II a diploid, and Group III a triploid. Systematically, Groups I, II and III <b>key</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> pirogyra singularis, S. communis, and S. fragilis, respectively, using Transeau's monograph on Zygnemataceae. These species are interpreted to be a species complex of S. communis (whose name has priority) with the ancestral haploid (x = 6) missing. Five years after isolation of the original strain in this species complex filaments corresponding to Groups I and II were found at the original collection site. The two field-collected groups were indistinguishable from the laboratory species complex in morphology and chromosome number. Homothallic conjunction within two field width groups yielded progeny similar to those from homothallic conjunction of groups in the laboratory species complex. Filament widths of progeny were generally within the width limits of respective parental groups. The four intergroup crosses between laboratory and field width groups were successful and yielded progeny representing Groups I, II, and III. The similarities in morphology, chromosome numbers, and reproductive behavior of laboratory and field width groups imply that the laboratory species complex of S. communis has a natural counterpart in the field...|$|E

Consistent microstructure character differences in the Weddell Sea specimens combined with high genetic distances (COI divergence> 20 %) allowed the description of Epimeria angelikae, a species new to science.

40|$|Inclusive fitness theory, {{put forward}} by English {{biologist}} William Hamilton in 1964, {{is considered by many}} as the most important addition to the theory of natural selection since Darwin. One prediction of the theory is that animals should often show a tendency to nepotistically favour close relatives. Goodisman et al.

This begs the question why nepotism is predicted by theory, yet in a growing list of species is shown to be absent. Is inclusive fitness theory in trouble? As we show, it is not: costs and constraints explain the general absence of queen rearing nepotism, and nepotism in insect societies in fact is well supported in the context of male rearing and manipulation of colony sex ratios.

In the second step, n-ary IND inference is achieved. This step fits in the framework of levelwise algorithms used in many data-mining algorithms. Since real-world databases can suffer from some data inconsistencies, approximate INDs, i. e. INDs which almost hold, are considered. We show how they can be safely integrated into our unary and n-ary discovery algorithms. An implementation of these algorithms has been achieved and tested against both synthetic and real-life databases.
