In a typical modeling workflow the <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are accounted for {{through the construction of}} a sufficiently large set of 3 -D static models. Out of this set, a few representative models are selected and dynamically simulated so as to correlate the geological characteristics of the reservoir with its dynamic performance and to propagate the uncertainty onto the final recovery factors yet maintaining the computational run time acceptable. In channelized depositional environments, which are strongly heterogeneous, the selection approach must also account for channel connectivity, which {{plays a key role in}} the possibility of efficiently draining the reservoir for a reasonable number of wells. This study can be seen as a step forward in the assessment of the risks associated to the development of channelized reservoirs under the assumption that a way to express the concept of channel connectivity is channel amalgamation. Channel amalgamation is here defined through amalgamation curves which are numerically described using a set of indexes whose combination provide spatial information of channel intersections. These indexes were calculated for a full set of 3 -D geological models and used to steer the selection of a representative model sub-set for subsequent fluid flow simulations. The validity of the index-based selection was verified on different sets of synthetic reservoir models through the evaluation of the representativeness of the model sub-set in reproducing the uncertainty of the original dataset. Eventually, the existence of a strong correlation between channel amalgamation and production performance was proved.

This complexity may, in several cases, cause difficulties to establish reliable techniques to assess risk correctly or it demands great computational effort. Therefore, methodologies to quantify the impact of uncertainties are still not well established because simplifications are necessary {{and the impact of}} such simplifications is not well known.

40|$|Using legacy {{information}} {{to search for}} geological CO 2 storage within saline aquifers {{is likely to be}} a cost-effective technique for commercial CCS projects. Here, a potential storage site was discovered, away from hydrocarbon reservoirs, using public information. CO 2 would be injected 15 – 40 km downdip from the margin of almost un-drilled regionally extensive Permian (Rotliegend) Sandstone saline aquifer. The CO 2 would migrate buoyantly towards the aquifer margin under an evaporite top-seal, becoming partly trapped by residual saturation effects. Any remaining CO 2 would be retained in the stratigraphic pinch-out trap at the edge of the aquifer. The lateral seal at the margin is most likely to be metamorphic basement – of presumed low permeability, inferred to be overlain by dolomite-anhydrite sediments. Using conservative assumptions, 170 – 690 Mt of CO 2 could be stored along a 50 km long section of the 300 km margin of the reservoir. Preliminary modelling shows that 100 % of the CO 2 will be retained within the reservoir for at least 10, 000 years.

40|$|One {{promising}} {{proposal to}} mitigate the effect of climate change as a result of high atmo- spheric CO 2 concentrations is carbon capture and storage. Deep saline aquifers provide the most storage capacity for CO 2 storage. However, their geological characteristics are often poorly defined, which makes it difficult to design CO 2 sequestration operations. This thesis considers how CO 2 sequestration can be performed effectively and efficiently under <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainty</b> by allocating injection rates among injectors to maximise economic performance criteria and simultaneously minimise the risk of CO 2 leakage. To this end, we consider the following four challenges in this thesis. 1.) Optimisation of CO 2 injection strategies is a time-consuming operation since it re- quires multiple evaluations of expensive black-box functions. This computational cost increases rapidly when accounting for the impact of <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> In this thesis, we propose the use of adaptive sparse grid interpolation (ASGI) to speed up the CO 2 optimisation process. Based on numerical results, the ASGI is an efficient surrogate technique and will be used throughout the thesis. 2.) Injection designs for CO 2 sequestration is difficult when the geology of the storage formation is not well-defined. In the thesis, we propose a utility function to find the injection strategy that is insensitive to the impact of <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> Numeri- cal results show potential benefits of using the utility function for the optimisation of CO 2 under <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> 3.) Optimisation of CO 2 sequestration for several conflicting criteria is a challenging task. In the thesis, we use a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) coupled with the ASGI surrogate to maximise both economic performance and sweep efficiency of CO 2 flooding while simultaneously minimising the risks of CO 2 leakage. Solutions obtained from the NSGA method help decision makers to manage multiple conflicting criteria for CO 2 sequestration. 4.) The ASGI surrogate is an efficient surrogate-assisted optimisation technique for a small to moderate number of input variables, but for problems with 10 s of control parameters, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality — the computational time increases exponentially with the number of input variables. In the thesis, we develop a high-dimensional model representation (HDMR) technique to efficiently map the input-output relationship of a function. Several numerical examples show that the HDMR approach is suitable for CO 2 storage optimisation with many input variables. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Geological CO 2 storage has the {{potential}} to be a key technology for prevention of industrial CO 2 emission into the atmosphere. A successful storage operation requires safe geological structures with large storage capacity. The practicality of the technology is challenged by various operational concerns, ranging from site selection to long-term monitoring of the injected CO 2. The research in this report addresses the value of using sophisticated geological modeling to help in predicting storage performance. In the first part, we investigate the significance of assessing the <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and its consequences in site selection and the early stages of storage operations. This includes the injection period and the early migration time of the injected CO 2 plume. The extensive set of realistic geological realizations used in the analysis makes the key part of this research. Heterogeneity is modelled using the most influential geological parameters in a shallow-marine system, including aggradation angle, levels of barriers in the system, faults, lobosity, and progradation direction. A typical injection scenario is simulated over 160 realizations and major flow responses are defined to measure the success of the early stages of CO 2 storage operations. These responses include the volume of trapped CO 2 by capillarity, dynamics of the plume in the medium, pressure responses, and the risk of leakage through a failure in the sealing cap-rock. The impact of <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainty</b> on these responses is investigated by comparing all cases for their performance. The results show large variations in the responses due to changing geological parameters. Among the main influential parameters are aggradation angle, progradation direction, and faults in the medium. A sophisticated <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainty</b> study requires a large number of detailed simulations that are time-consuming and computationally costly. The second part of the research introduces a workflow that employs an approximating response surface method called arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC). The aPC is fast and sophisticated enough to be used practically in the process of sensitivity analysis and uncertainty and risk assessment. We demonstrate the workflow by combining the aPC with a global sensitivity analysis technique, the Sobol indices, which is a variance-based method proven to be practical for complicated physical problems. Probabilistic uncertainty analysis is performed by applying the Monte Carlo process using the aPC. The results show that the aPC can be used successfully in an extensive <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainty</b> study. </p...|$|E

The two worst {{technological}} hurdles {{for industrial}} deployment of CO 2 storage in deep saline aquifers are {{the high cost}} of capture and <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> The latter refer to the need for a deep, high porosity, reasonably permeable and extensive salt water layer, capped by an equally extensive very low permeability layer in a tectonically stable region. Here, we propose an alternative storage approach to alleviate these concerns that consists of extracting brine from the storage formation and then re-injecting it together with CO 2 so that they mix at depth in the well and this CO 2 -saturated brine flows into the storage formation. Geomechanical stability and caprock integrity are favoured because pressure build-up is reduced due to pumping. In fact, a caprock is not required because CO 2 rich brine is denser than native brine and will tend to sink in the aquifer, which eliminates the risk of buoyant escape of CO 2 because. Moreover, the concept does not require CO 2 to be pure. In fact, theoretically, it can be used directly for flue gas without capture. While this would imply a huge increase in compression costs, the design incorporates a system to recover the pressure of the low solubility components that return to the wellhead. This, together with the thermal energy obtained from the extracted brine, ensures a high energy efficiency. The only drawback of the system is its modest use of pore space (some 2 - 3...|$|R
40|$|A simple smart logic for {{controlling}} inflow control valves (ICV) in waterflooding reservoir management is implemented and analyzed, {{with the final}} objective of improving the long term financial return of a petroleum reservoir. Such a control is based in a reactive simple logic that responds to the watercut measured in the ICV. Basically, when the watercut increases, the ICV is set to close proportionally. For comparison purposes, four strategies are presented: base case scenario with conventional control, the best completion configuration found by trial-and-error, the reactive control, and a deterministic optimal control based on Nonlinear Gradient Method with adjoint-gradient formulation is shown for comparison purposes. Finally, all four strategies are tested again in different reservoir realizations in order to mimic the <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> Two different synthetic reservoir models were studied. First, a simple cube with a five-spot well configuration, in which the permeability field has a horizontal pattern defined by lognormal distributions. The second model is a benchmark proposed by the Dutch university, TU delft, with 101 channelized permeability fields representing river patterns. For the first model, no significant relative gain is found neither in the variable control nor in the optimal control. Manly {{because of the high}} homogeneity of the reservoir models. Therefore, no intelligent completion is recommended. On the other hand, for the second and more complex case, the results indicate an expressive relative gain in the use of simple reactive logic. Besides, this type of control achieves results nearly as good as the optimal control. The test in different realizations, however, shows that reservoir characterization is still a key part of any attempt to improve production. Although the variable reactive control is semi-independent, with action being taken based on measurements, some parameters need a priori model to be tuned...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDemonstrating {{conformity}} between {{observed and}} simulated plume behaviour {{is one of}} the main high-level requirements, which have to be fulfilled by an operator of a CO 2 storage site in order to assure safe storage operations and to be able to transfer liability to the public after site closure. The observed plume behaviour is derived from geophysical and/or geochemical monitoring. Repeated 3 D seismic observations have proven to provide the most comprehensive image of a CO 2 plume in various projects such as Sleipner, Weyburn, or Ketzin. The simulated plume behaviour is derived from reservoir simulation using a model calibrated with monitoring results. Plume observations using any monitoring method are always affected by limited resolution and detection ability, and reservoir simulations will only be able to provide an approximated representation of the occurring reservoir processes. Therefore, full conformity between observed and simulated plume behaviour is difficult to achieve, if it is at all. It is therefore of crucial importance for each storage site to understand to what degree conformity can be achieved under realistic conditions, comprising noise affected monitoring data and reservoir models based on <b>geological</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> We applied performance criteria (plume footprint area, lateral migration distance, plume volume, and similarity index) for a comparison between monitoring results (4 D seismic measurements) and reservoir simulations, considering a range of seismic amplitude values as noise threshold and a range of minimum thickness of the simulated CO 2 plume. Relating the performance criteria to the noise and thickness threshold values allows assessing the quality of conformance between simulated and observed behaviour of a CO 2 plume. The Ketzin site is provided with a comprehensive monitoring data set and a history-matched reservoir model. Considering the relatively high noise level, which is inherent for land geophysical monitoring data, a reasonable conformance between the observed and simulated plume behaviour is demonstrated...|$|R
