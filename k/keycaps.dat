25|$|In 1966, Richard Isbell of American Type Founders {{issued the}} Americana {{typeface}} and included the interrobang {{as one of}} the characters. In 1968, an interrobang key was available on some Remington typewriters. In the 1970s, replacement interrobang <b>keycaps</b> and typefaces were available for some Smith-Corona typewriters.|$|E
25|$|A Visual layout {{refers to}} the symbols printed on the {{physical}} <b>keycaps.</b> Visual layouts vary by language, country, and user preference, and any one mechanical and functional layout can be employed {{with a number of}} different visual layouts. For example, the “ISO” keyboard layout is used throughout Europe, but typical French, German, and UK variants of mechanically identical keyboards appear different because they bear different legends on their keys. Even blank keyboards – with no legends – are sometimes used to learn typing skills or by user preference.|$|E

25|$|A key {{development}} {{in the ability to}} use APL effectively, before the widespread use of CRT terminals, was the development of a special IBM Selectric typewriter interchangeable typeball with all the special APL characters on it. This was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the Selectric typewriter and typeball mechanism, such as the IBM 1050 and IBM 2741 terminal. <b>Keycaps</b> could be placed over the normal keys to show which APL characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck. For the first time, a programmer could actually type in and see real APL characters as used in Iverson's notation and not be forced to use awkward English keyword representations of them. Falkoff and Iverson had the special APL Selectric typeballs, 987 and 988, designed in late 1964, although no APL computer system was available to use them. Iverson cited Falkoff as the inspiration for the idea of using an IBM Selectric typeball for the APL character set.|$|E
2500|$|The variant most {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "Model M" [...] is Part No. 1391401, on which many other variants were based. This Enhanced Keyboard model included IBM's patented buckling spring design and swappable <b>keycaps.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Model M is a {{designation}} for a {{group of}} computer keyboards manufactured by IBM starting in 1984, and later by Lexmark, Unicomp and MaxiSwitch. [...] The keyboard's many variations have their own distinct characteristics, with the vast majority having a buckling-spring key design and swappable <b>keycaps.</b> Model M keyboards have been praised by computer enthusiasts and frequent typists due to their durability and consistency, and the tactile and auditory feedback they provide.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Zenith Data Systems shipped {{a number of}} laptop {{computers}} equipped with a device called [...] "J-Mouse", which essentially used a special keyswitch under the J key to allow the J <b>keycap</b> {{to be used as}} a pointing stick.|$|R

2500|$|Initially, {{sublimation}} printing, where {{a special}} ink is printed onto the keycap {{surface and the}} application of heat causes the ink molecules to penetrate and commingle with the plastic modules, had a problem because finger oils caused the molecules to disperse, but then a necessarily very hard clear coating was applied to prevent this. Coincident with sublimation printing, which was first used in high volume by IBM on their keyboards, was the introduction by IBM of single-curved-dish <b>keycaps</b> to facilitate quality printing of key legends by having a consistently curved surface instead of a dish. But one problem with sublimation or laser printing was that the processes took too long and only dark legends could be printed on light-colored keys. On another note, IBM was unique in using separate shells, or [...] "keycaps", on keytop bases. This might have made their manufacturing of different keyboard layouts more flexible, but the reason for doing this was that the plastic material that needed to be used for sublimation printing was different from standard ABS keytop plastic material.|$|E
50|$|Typical <b>keycaps</b> of the 1970s and 1980s were {{produced}} using two-shot molding, with the markings molded into each keycap {{in a different}} color of plastic, but this eventually fell out of favor, as it was more expensive (particularly in tooling costs), and tended to produce <b>keycaps</b> more durable than the equipment on which they were mounted. Modern <b>keycaps</b> are usually labelled by stamping or laser engraving. However, two-shot molding ("Doubleshot") <b>keycaps</b> are purchasable today, known for their feel and general durability.|$|E
50|$|<b>Keycaps</b> are can {{be bought}} in {{replacement}} sets for a keyboard. Notably, replacement sets are frequently sold for keyboards that use the Cherry MX-style stems. Custom sets are bought and sold within the enthusiast communities, and artisan <b>keycaps</b> can be purchased individually.|$|E
40|$|A single <b>keycap</b> on a {{standard}} alphanumeric computer keyboard was instrumented with a piezoelectric load cell and the fingertip motion was recorded with a high-speed video motion analysis system. Contact force histories between the fingertip and the <b>keycap</b> were recorded while four subjects typed {{a standard}} text for five minutes. Each keystroke force history is characterized by three distinct phases: (I) keyswitch compression, (II) finger impact and (III) fingertip pulp compression and release. Each keystroke force history contained two relative maxima, one in phase II and one in phase III. The subject mean peak forces ranged from 1. 6 to 5. 3 N and the subject mean peak fingertip velocities ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 7 m/s. Motion analyses and force measurements suggest a ballistic model of finger motion during typing...|$|R
50|$|The Model F first {{appeared}} with the IBM System/23 Datamaster all-in-one computer. It {{is best known}} as part of the IBM Personal Computer in 1981 with some <b>keycap</b> label differences, and its subsequent release with the IBM 5170, where it was reconfigured with the AT protocol and some layout revisions.|$|R

50|$|Many modern icons have {{a maximum}} size of 1024 by 1024 pixels or greater. The {{challenge}} of icon design {{is to create}} an image that is communicative, beautiful, and understandable, at every size from this maximum resolution down to the minimum resolution of 16 by 16 pixels. Many icon formats allow one icon to include hinting to ensure visual clarity at smaller resolutions, or even completely different subsidiary images for smaller sizes (for instance, a keyboard at larger sizes, and a single <b>keycap</b> at smaller ones).|$|R
50|$|The name {{refers to}} the fact that the coil spring tensed between the <b>keycap</b> and a {{pivoting}} hammer buckles, i.e. kinks or collapses, at a certain point in its downward traverse, providing auditory and tactile feedback to the keyboard operator. Upon buckling, the hammer is pivoted forward by the spring and strikes an electrical contact which registers the key press. In a Model M, the electrical contact is a membrane sheet similar to that of a modern dome switch keyboard. On the older Model F design, a capacitive contact was used instead.|$|R
5000|$|A keycap is a {{small plastic}} cover placed over the {{keyswitch}} of a computer keyboard. <b>Keycaps</b> are illustrated to indicate the [...] or alphanumeric character they correspond to. Early keyboards were manufactured with the keyswitch and keycap integrated in one unit; separate <b>keycaps</b> were introduced to facilitate the production of different keyboard layouts.|$|E

5000|$|A {{special case}} of the {{computer}} keyboard dome-switch is the scissor-switch. The keys {{are attached to the}} keyboard via two plastic pieces that interlock in a [...] "scissor"-like fashion, and snap to the keyboard and the key. It still uses rubber domes, but a special plastic [...] 'scissors' mechanism links the <b>keycap</b> to a plunger that depresses the rubber dome with a much shorter travel than the typical rubber dome keyboard. Typically scissor-switch keyboards also employ 3-layer membranes as the electrical component of the switch. They also usually have a shorter total key travel distance (2 mm instead of 3.5 - 4 mm for standard dome-switch keyswitches). This type of keyswitch is often found on the built-in keyboards on laptops and keyboards marketed as 'low-profile'. These keyboards are generally quiet and the keys require little force to press.|$|R
5000|$|When a Teletype 33 ASR {{equipped}} with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, [...] "transmit on") caused the tape reader to resume. This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a [...] "handshaking" [...] signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q {{is replaced by a}} second Control-S to resume output. The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units {{equipped with}} this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the <b>keycap</b> above the letter was TAPE and TAPE respectively.|$|R
