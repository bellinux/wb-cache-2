The young lady has plucked her hairline to increase the expanse, and thus elegance, of her forehead, and a lock of hair falls at the back <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> A tight-fitting cap covers her ears, a fashion possibly due to the prevalent belief {{of the time that}} the Virgin Mary conceived through the ear.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is {{inspired}} {{to return to}} doing low-key events, where he structures a new image for himself as a stand-up comedian who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to sell out to corporate America. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in Moe's Tavern, he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits to himself that comedy is not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave Moe's tavern in Krusty's new SUV.|$|E

500|$|Michael Daniel Liberty is a terran news {{reporter}} whose affiliations have varied over time. He hates {{it when people}} such as his former editor-in-chief Handy Anderson calls him [...] "Mickey". Liberty is described as being [...] "of normal height and proportions, if a little lanky." [...] He has dirty blond hair that is spattered with lighter striations of gray which is swept back <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail</b> to cover a bald spot. He has a liking for cigarettes, but keeps trying to quit. A few years after going freelance, Liberty remained the same in physical appearance, apart from an abundance of facial hair ...|$|E

His Limit Break is Shot, which deals damage and inflicts status effects {{depending on the type of}} ammunition. Irvine is depicted as a cowboy, tall and fair-skinned with long brown hair that he wears pulled back <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> He also enjoys flirting with the female characters, being known as well for his marksmanship as his charm. He acts like a carefree, but misunderstood loner; however, this is merely a façade to charm women and hide his lack of confidence.|$|E
500|$|Lara's costume was {{redesigned}} and she {{no longer}} wears her trademark turquoise sleeveless top and khaki shorts, but instead, a dark brown halter top and black shorts. Additionally, her hair is no longer braided, but worn <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> According to Play, Lara [...] "moves as good as she looks [...] no longer moves like a video game character" [...] due to her being fully motion captured. Olympic gymnast and NCAA Women's Gymnastics champion Heidi Moneymaker was the model used for motion capturing. Keeley Hawes provided the voice of Lara in this instalment, as she did in Anniversary and Legend. [...] Gymnast Alison Carroll {{was selected as the}} new official Lara Croft model to promote the game, replacing Karima Adebibe.|$|E

500|$|Karen Gillan {{had to wear}} a latex {{prosthetic}} stomach bump for {{the scenes}} which depicted Amy as pregnant. She claimed {{it made her feel}} more mature and act ridiculously, and cited it as her favourite part of filming the series. Arthur Darvill wore a wig for the aged Rory, which was trimmed to look [...] "more masculine" [...] and pulled back <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> The Eknodine were CGI and the scenes were simply filmed with the actors opening their mouths. The scene in which Rory hits Eknodine-inhabited Mrs Hamil with a plank was filmed first of all with Darvill missing actress Joan Linder, and then again with Linder's stunt double, whom he was allowed to hit. There was only one prop of the plank, and fortunately all the necessary shots were completed before Darvill accidentally broke it.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "We R Who We R" [...] is {{presented}} as an underground party. The video starts off with futuristic flashing lights. Kesha, seen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail</b> wearing gray and black makeup, chains, ripped stockings, and a sparkly one-piece leotard made of shards of broken glass, walks through the 2nd Street Tunnel with fellow partygoers. The scene features drag races and explosions in the background. Close-up shots of Kesha show her wearing studs in her eyebrows and her glittery eye makeup. As cars zoom by, the video transitions into a new location at a different party. Midway through the party Kesha changes outfits to an American-flag top and pink hot pants. As the song's hook kicks in, Kesha is seen standing {{on the edge of}} a building; the music stops and Kesha stage jumps backwards off of the building's rooftop. She is caught by the partygoers beneath her and the music resumes. The final scenes show Kesha dancing among fellow partygoers on a rooftop and smiling while singing [...] "We R Who We R". Jocelyn Vena from MTV News noted that the video makes a departure from Kesha's previous music videos, in which humor is usually present; she wrote the video shows a [...] "darker and sexier" [...] side of the songstress. Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly was positive in his review of the video. Stransky commented on the song's lyrical inspiration, noting the video does not follow the same message, saying [...] "it doesn't so much inspire self esteem as much as it inspires just a plain ol', trashy, -ed out good time. Code word: party!". The video was uploaded to her VEVO account on December 1, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Mileena is {{physically}} identical to Kitana, the most glaring exception being her half-Tarkata face with large and exposed fang-like teeth (which got noticeably downsized for Deception and Armageddon). Boon described Mileena as [...] "Anti-Kitana" [...] {{and said that}} her large [...] "sharp, nasty teeth" [...] have been not originally planned and were only drawn for her infamous Fatality [...] "Man-Eater" [...] (featured in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, too), in which she sucks up the entire body of her victims and then regurgitates their clean bones. After Mortal Kombat II, her teeth were almost never used again during gameplay until Mortal Kombat 2011 (in a leap attack to bite an opponent in the neck and in one Fatality to gnaw on the killed enemy's severed head), with a sole exception of one Fatality in Deception in which she uses them to tear off the opponent's head. Mileena's skin color appears to be at times mildly darker than Kitana's, but is always lighter than Jade's. After the two were given more varying appearances in Mortal Kombat Gold (hairstyle for Kitana-derived characters is loose in Mortal Kombat II and pinned back in Ultimate MK3), Mileena's hair is usually much shorter than Kitana's and is most often worn gathered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> One element of Mileena's anatomy that has often changed is her eyes. As her supposed twin sister, Mileena shared Kitana's eyes in Mortal Kombat II; her eyes then became [...] "undead" [...] style all-white (similar to the eyes of Scorpion and Noob Saibot) in Ultimate MK3. In Deception, Armageddon and Shaolin Monks, Mileena's eyes return to normal, but with yellow pupils (Kitana's eyes are brown). In Mortal Kombat 2011, however, she has Baraka-like yellow eyes with slit pupils (her eyes are also sometimes seen as glowing whole), except of her alternate Ultimate MK3 style costume (available through pre-order bonuses and later in a DLC package) in which she has human eyes once again. In Mortal Kombat X, her facial appearance has undergone drastic changes on her facial appearance based on those from Mortal Kombat Legacy live-action series, such as having a human-like mouth, yet still retain most of her Tarkatan mouth, as seen on both of her cheeks.|$|E
50|$|Married women {{cover their}} hair without wearing wigs, and the {{standards}} of tznius expected from them are the strictest among all Hasidic/Orthodox Jewish groups. <b>As</b> is customary <b>in</b> the traditional Jerusalemite community, unmarried girls have their hair in two braided pigtails, unlike most other Haredi communities, where the girls wear their hair <b>in</b> <b>a</b> simple <b>ponytail.</b>|$|R
25|$|Melanie Chisholm: Chisholm (also called Mel C) {{was called}} Sporty Spice because she usually wore a {{tracksuit}} paired with athletic shoes, wore her long dark hair <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high <b>ponytail,</b> and sported <b>a</b> tough girl attitude {{as well as}} tattoos on both of her arms. She also possessed true athletic abilities, her signature being her ability to perform back handsprings.|$|R
5000|$|Brancheau's {{death is}} a focus of the {{documentary}} Blackfish, which criticizes keeping orcas in captivity, and her death awakened a national conversation about the issue. The director, Gabriela Cowperthwaite, argued that {{the claim that the}} orca had targeted Brancheau because she had worn her hair <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long <b>ponytail</b> was conjecture and that [...] "there had to be more to this story".|$|R

2500|$|Once she {{was signed}} to Epic, Sherrill {{suggested}} she change {{her name to}} make more of an impression. [...] According to her 1979 memoir, Stand by Your Man, during their meeting, Wynette was wearing her long, blonde hair <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail,</b> and Sherrill noted that she reminded him of Debbie Reynolds in the film Tammy and the Bachelor. He suggested [...] "Tammy" [...] as a possible name, so she became Tammy Wynette.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the title}} of the song, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu does not wear a furisode in the music video, instead wears a Western-style dress. While the initial plan was to feature Kyary Pamyu Pamyu in a kimono, she decided against this, as she wanted the music video [...] "danceable musical-style" [...] to reflect the {{happiness}} at turning 20 featured in the song. Kyary Pamyu Pamyu wears her hair <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail</b> in the video, which was a symbolic [...] "first step" [...] into becoming an adult and away from her regular twin tail-style hairstyle.|$|E

Cammy has a {{completely}} different look in the series, wearing black leather pants a black body fit shirt, red gloves, red boots, and a black necklace with a silver cross. This incarnation of the character {{does not have a}} scar on her cheek and wears her hair <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single <b>ponytail.</b> <b>As</b> <b>in</b> the animated movie, the series' English dub depicts Cammy as American instead of British.|$|R
2500|$|The younger of the Demon sisters. Kneesocks is a red-skinned demon dressed {{similarly}} {{to her sister}} but wears glasses and has blue hair worn <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail.</b> Unlike her sister, Kneesocks only has a single horn, on her forehead. She shares her sister's formality and obsession with rules, but is calmer and more composed than Scanty whenever the Anarchy sisters derail their plans. She is prone to blushing whenever she does get excited, which causes her face to turn a lighter shade of red. She wears two kneesocks that transform {{into a pair of}} scythes called [...] Her design is a partial reference to the character Yoko, from Gainax's previous series Gurren Lagann.|$|E
2500|$|Tiernan's Ellesse {{coat and}} black boots were not found. Plastic cable ties {{had been used}} as a {{ligature}} to strangle her and more ties had been used to bind her hands. A dark coloured scarf was also wrapped around her neck. Her hair was still tied <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>ponytail</b> with the same band and hairclips that she had been wearing when she disappeared. There was no evidence of a sexual assault, but the absence of her jacket and boots and the position of her underwear were among forensic evidence indicating a sexual motive. Police called in former SAS tracker [...] "Jungle Eddie" [...] McGee, who had helped track down murderer Barry Prudom in 1982, to identify the killer's most probable route through the woodland.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} ending for {{the film}} was meant to continue from when Randal throws Dante's [...] "I Assure You We're Open" [...] sign to him. After Randal leaves, Dante proceeds to count out the register and does not notice another person entering the store.

She was naked and had been bound with both rope and a Venetian blind cord. She was placed in a fetal position with her hands pressed together.
