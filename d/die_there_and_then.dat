60|$|He {{absolutely}} {{managed to}} sit up, {{but only for}} a moment, and when he fell back I really thought that he would <b>die</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> I called to the Bengali dispenser, and hastened away from the room.|$|E
60|$|We need {{scarcely}} {{say that}} poor Olaf was neither a timid nor an effeminate boy. It {{was not for}} himself that he thus gave way. It was the sudden opening of {{his eyes to the}} terrible consequences of his disobedience that unmanned him. His quick mind perceived at once that little Snorro would soon die of cold and hunger if he failed to find his way out of that wilderness; and when he thought of this, and of the awful misery that would thus descend on the heads of Karlsefin and Gudrid, he felt a strange desire that he himself might <b>die</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b>|$|E

50|$|My dear white lady, in your {{pleasant}} {{home made}} joyous by the tender love of {{husband and children}} all your own, you can never understand the slave mother's emotions as she clasps her new-born child, and knows that a master's word can at any moment take it from her embrace; and when, as was mine, that child is a girl, and from her own experience she sees its almost certain doom is to minister to the unbridled lust of the slave-owner, and feels that the law holds over her no protecting arm, it is not strange that, rude and uncultured as I was, I felt all this, {{and would have been}} glad if we could have <b>died</b> together <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was within}} twenty hours {{of her last}} visit that I left this accursed ship. For a day none had come to feed or tend the slaves, and indeed many needed no tending, for they were dead. Some still lived however, though so far as I could see the {{most of them were}} smitten with the plague. I myself had escaped the sickness, perhaps because of the {{strength}} and natural healthiness of my body, which has always saved me from fevers and diseases, fortified as it was by the good food that I had obtained. But now I knew that I could not live long, indeed chained in this dreadful charnel-house I prayed for death to release me from the horrors of such existence. The day passed as before in sweltering heat, unbroken by any air or motion, and night came at last, made hideous by the barbarous ravings of the <b>dying.</b> But even <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> I slept <b>and</b> dreamed that I was walking with my love in the vale of Waveney.|$|R
