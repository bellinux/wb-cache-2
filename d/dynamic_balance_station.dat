40|$|Abstract — Unlike statically stable wheeled mobile robots, {{dynamically}} stable mobile robots {{can have}} higher centers of gravity, smaller bases {{of support and}} can be tall and thin resembling {{the shape of an}} adult human. This paper concerns the ballbot mobile robot, which balances dynamically on a single spherical wheel. The ballbot is omni-directional and can also rotate about its vertical axis (yaw motion). It uses a triad of legs to remain statically stable when powered off. This paper presents the evolved design with a four-motor inverse mouseball drive, yaw drive, leg drive, control system, and results including <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing,</b> <b>station</b> keeping, yaw motion while balancing, and automatic transition between statically stable and dynamically stable states.

40|$|We {{postulate}} that multi-wheel statically-stable mobile robots {{for operation}} in human environments are an evolutionarydead end. Robots of this class {{tall enough to}} interact meaningfully with people must have low centers of gravity, overly wide bases of support, and very low accelerations to avoid tipping over. Accordingly, we are developing an inverse {{of this type of}} mobile robot that is the height, width, and weight of a person, having a high center of gravity, that balances dynamically on a single spherical wheel. Unlike balancing 2 -wheel platforms which must turn before driving in some direction, the single-wheel robot can move directly in any direction. We present the overall design, actuator mechanism based on an inverse mouse-ball drive, control system, and initial results including <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing,</b> <b>station</b> keeping, and point-to-point motion. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a relay-assisted load {{balancing}} scheme in cellular networks. The relay stations can be dynamically associated with different base stations. The load transferring from over-loaded cells to neighboring under-loaded cells is realized by dynamically changing the base station-relay station associations. A distributed algorithm, {{in which each}} relay station only needs to exchange information with its neighboring base stations and makes a re-association decision by itself, is proposed. Simulation {{results show that the}} overall call blocking probability can be reduced significantly when our distributed algorithm is applied.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new type}} of {{vibration}} structure (i. e. swing frame) of vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine is designed, which is based on the analysis of traditional double-plane vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine’s swing frame. The static unbalance and couple unbalance can be separated effectively by using the new <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine with the new swing frame. The modal and harmonic responses are analyzed by using the ANSYS 7. 0. By comparing the finite element modal analysis with the experimental modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes are found out, which can provide the dynamics direction for designing vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine. The new <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine can measure static unbalance and couple unbalance directly, and the influence between them is faint. The practical result indicates that the new vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machine is suitable for inertial measurement of flying objects, and can overcome the shortcomings of traditional double-plane vertical <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> machines, in which the effect of plane-separation is inferior.

40|$|To {{increase}} the accuracy {{as well the}} production speed of industrial machines, <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> is becoming a key issue. Instead of applying complicated control strategies to reduce machine vibrations, and damping systems to suppress vibrations, in <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> the mechanism parts are considered and designed such that the machine does not vibrate at all. Surprisingly however, <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> techniques are not yet widely applied. This is {{probably due to the}} lack of knowledge of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> and the fact that in general relatively a lot of mass and inertia is added to obtain a dynamically balanced mechanism.

[Purpose] This study {{examined}} the relationship between the center of pressure (COP) displacement time during the stance subphases and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability when elderly cross obstacles 0, 10, and 40 cm in height. [Subjects] Fifteen older adults were enrolled in this study (≥ 65 years of age). [Methods] An F-Scan System was used to measure the COP displacement time when subjects crossed obstacles 0, 10, and 40 cm in height, and the Dynamic Gait Index, Berg Balance Scale, and Four Square Step Test were used to measure <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability. [Results] The Dynamic Gait Index, Berg Balance Scale, and Four Square Step Test were correlated with each other. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> tests were correlated with the COP displacement time during the stance phase. At obstacle heights of 10 and 40 cm during loading response and at all heights during pre-swing, there were correlations with <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability. However, <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability did not affect the COP displacement time during mid-stance and terminal stance. [Conclusion] People with a lower <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability show a larger COP displacement time during loading response and pre-swing. Therefore, <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability can be predicted by measuring the COP displacement time...|$|R

40|$|Background: Poor <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance,</b> {{which is}} common after stroke, may affect gait function. In particular, spatiotemporal {{asymmetrical}} gait patterns may occur in hemiplegic patients after stroke. Objective: This study aimed {{to assess the}} relationship between <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> and spatiotemporal gait symmetry in patients with chronic hemiplegic stroke. Methods: To calculate symmetry ratios for step length (spatial parameter) and swing time (temporal parameter), 41 patients with chronic stroke walked at a comfortable speed. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> measures included limit of stability (LOS) during standing and heel-to-heel base of support (H-H BOS) during gait. Analysis of correlations between various measures was performed. Results: The overall LOS score correlated with temporal gait symmetry (r= 0. 66). The forward, backward, paretic, and non-paretic direction LOS scores were related to temporal gait symmetry (r= 0. 38 â 0. 62). The H-H BOS was correlated with temporal (r=â 0. 63) and spatial (r=â 0. 36) gait symmetries. Other <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> variables were not significantly correlated with spatial gait symmetry. Conclusion: Thus, control of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> abilities {{is related to the}} magnitude of temporal gait symmetry.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> {{and quiet}} {{standing}} balance are decreased in knee osteoarthritis (OA), with <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> being more affected. This study aimed {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of a group exercise programme of lower extremity muscles integrated with education on <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> using the Star Excursion Balance test (SEBT) in knee OA. METHODS: Experimental before-and-after pilot study design. Nineteen participants with knee OA attended the exercise sessions once a week for six weeks, in addition to home exercises. Before and after the exercise programme, <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> was assessed using the SEBT in the anterior and medial directions in addition to hip and knee muscle strength, pain, and function. RESULTS: Fourteen participants completed the study. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> on the affected side demonstrated significant improvements in the anterior and medial directions (p= 0. 02 and p= 0. 01, respectively). The contralateral side demonstrated significant improvements in <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> in the anterior direction (p< 0. 001). However, balance in the medial direction did not change significantly (p= 0. 07). Hip and knee muscle strength, pain, and function significantly improved (p< 0. 05) after the exercise programme. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore the effect of an exercise programme on <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> using the SEBT in knee OA. The exercise programme was effective in improving <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> which is required in different activities of daily living where the patients might experience the risk of falling.

40|$|Maintaining <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> is an {{important}} component of walking function that is likely impaired in chronic stroke survivors, evidenced by an increased prevalence of falls. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control requires maintaining the center of mass (COM) within the base of support during movement. During walking, <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control is achieved largely by modifying foot placement to adjust the base of support. However, chronic stroke survivors have difficulty with both precision control of foot placement, as well as reduced control of COM movement. The objective of this dissertation was to characterize <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control strategies during walking in chronic stroke survivors. Additionally, we evaluated whether altered sensory feedback could be used to improve balance control in stroke survivors. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control was characterized during challenging walking conditions in stroke survivors and age-matched neurologically intact individuals. Adaptations to perturbations in frontal plane COM, induced using a custom cable-driven device, were used to further probe mechanisms of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control. Despite larger amounts of COM movement and step widths, chronic stroke survivors produced a similar ratio of step width to COM sway, indicating that simply increasing step width does not produce a safer walking pattern for the stroke group. Placement of the paretic limb was unchanged in response to the external perturbations of trunk movement, which might underlie deficits in <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control. Augmented sensory feedback improved paretic foot placement and COM control, when applied during a stepping or treadmill walking task. These results provide insight into differences in <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> control in stroke while also demonstrating that augmented sensory feedback signals might be used to improve balance control, and thus walking function for chronic stroke survivors...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Assessing the {{recovery}} of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> after intravenous sedation in the elderly is important for ensuring their safe discharge, especially when they are walking. A reliable, simple <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> test would be useful in daily clinical practice. We observed {{the recovery}} of balance after intravenous sedation with midazolam, using computerized dynamic posturography (CDP), and we evaluated {{the correlation between the}} CDP result and the results of simple <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> tests. Methods Midazolam was administered in divided doses, until the Wilson sedation score reached 3, in 18 elderly male volunteers. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> test using CDP with perturbation stimuli was performed before and after sedation. As simple <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> tests, the usual-speed walking (USW) and maximum-speed walking (MSW) tests and a modified timed “up and go” (TUG) test (subjects stand up from a chair, walk 5 [*]m forward and return to the chair with MSW, and sit down again) were performed.

Core stability may be a contributing factor to static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between core stability muscle endurance and static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> in basketball players. Methods: 100 basketball players (50 female and 50 male players) were selected randomly based on the including criteria. To evaluate core stability muscle strength, a set of tests from core stability exercises was used. Static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> were evaluated by Bass Stick and Y balance test respectively. Normality of the data was evaluated using the Kolmogorov Smirnoff test. Data analysis was performed by Spearman product moment coefficient test and independent samples t test. Significant level of p&le 0 / 05 was used in all statistical analyses. Results: Results of t-test showed no significant difference between static balance in boys and girls, while significant differences were observed between <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> and core stability in males and females. In other words, core stability and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> in boys were more than girls. Also, the results of correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between core stability and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> (p= 0. 00) However, no significant relationship was observed between core stability and static balance (p= 0. 451).

40|$|A {{mechanism}} or robotic manipulator that is dynamically balanced {{does not}} cause base vibrations when moving at high speeds. A balanced mechanism does not perturb equipment mounted on the same base, the floor, and machines placed nearby, therefore <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> improves the accuracy of a machine, reduces cycle times, and reduces the required size, mass, and stiffness of base frames and floors. For robotic end-effectors <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> is advantageous because of <b>dynamic</b> decoupling. A <b>balanced</b> mechanism also remains stationary in any position which is advantageous for realizing safe and energy efficient large motion of objects. Since commonly <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> of multi-degree-of-freedom mechanisms is considered after the kinematic synthesis of a mechanism, profitable solutions without excessive mass, inertia, and complexity addition are hardly found. In this work a methodology was developed that considers <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> as a design principle in the synthesis of dynamically balanced mechanisms. New mechanisms were found where all elements contribute to the motion {{as well as to}} the <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance.</b> Such mechanisms were named inherently dynamically balanced mechanisms. Two methods for the synthesis of inherently dynamically balanced mechanisms were proposed which consider <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> prior to the kinematic synthesis, the ‘method of linearly independent linear momentum’ and the ‘method of principal vector linkages’. Also a method was found by which the loop closure relations of general planar closed kinematic chains can be considered implicitly. For that purpose the mass of an element with general center-of-mass is modeled with one virtual equivalent mass and two real equivalent masses. For the first time a high-speed inherently dynamically balanced parallel manipulator was designed, built, and tested, showing that with <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> the performance of the manipulator can be improved significantly.

The subjects first performed three trial tests of static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> {{to get used to}} the platform followed by seven repetitions of static as well as dynamic test which were recorded. During the repeated tests we could not determine any significant improvements of static balance test resulting from number of test repetitions neither in static nor in <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> (Friedman ANOVA: Static balance p= 0. 497, <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> p= 0. 393).

One-way ANOVA was used to compare among the three groups for the <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance.</b> Two-way ANOVA then was performed to test the significant change in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> among the three groups over the two age levels. Finally, t-test was used to test the significant difference between the two tested age levels. The results showed that the mean scores for the deaf children as well as for the hard-hearing children were lower than the hearing children. The older children (level II age) had significantly higher scores than the youngest children (level I age) suggesting that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> deficit was age-related...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Balance {{is highly}} {{integrative}} dynamic process involving coordination of multiple neurological pathways {{that allows for}} the maintenance of the COG over BOS. Football players often perform lower extremity passing, shooting, twisting, cutting and dribbling skills while wearing shoes, these actions require body to be in the equilibrium position to perform the task. This leads to t he conclusion of the great importance of the ability of balance in football. AIMS: 1. To study the effect of 4 week multidirectional balance board training on <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> in football players. 2. To study the effect of 4 week Both Sides Up ball training on <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> in football players. 3. To compare the effect of multidirectional balance board training program and BOSU ball training program on <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> in football players. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized Clinical trial. METHODS: Total of 60 competitive badminton players with age group between 18 - 25 were recruited in this study. The participants were allocated into 2 groups viz., Group A (multidirectional balance board training) and Group B (BOSU ball Training) for a period of 4 we eks. Participants were test for SEBT and vertical jump test on first day and after 4 weeks of balance training. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Student t test, Chi - Square Test. RESULTS: The data analysis and statistical inference showed that, after 4 weeks of balanc e training there was improvement in <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> in both the groups but {{there was no significant difference}} in <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> between two groups. As seen by difference in the SEBT and VJT scores pre and post training with p< 0. 001. CONCLUSION: 4 weeks balance training using BOSU and multidirectional balance board is effective in improving <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> and vertical jump performance in football players and also can be used as a component of multifaceted training to improve <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> and game skills...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> of {{machines}} is important when, for example, high precision {{in combination with}} low cycle times is necessary. One of the major problems with <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> is that considerable mass and considerable inertia need {{to be added to}} the mechanism. So far, only a few studies have been carried out into the comparison of various <b>dynamic</b> <b>balancing</b> principles in order to reduce these additions. Based on the findings of these studies, this paper aims to formulate guidelines for the design of dynamically balanced mechanisms with low mass and low inertia additions.

50|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>Balance</b> - In {{order for}} a mass to start moving from rest or change direction, {{it needs to be}} accelerated. A force is {{required}} to accelerate a mass. According to Newton's 3rd law of motion, there will be a counter force in the opposite direction of equal size. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> refers to the balancing of these forces and forces due to friction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] This study {{investigated}} the effect of open and closed kinetic chain exercise on the <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability of healthy young adults. [Subjects] Thirty-three healthy adults participated in this study. [Methods] Subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} either an open kinetic chain exercise group (n= 17) or a closed kinetic chain exercise group (n= 16). Both the open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain exercise groups performed 3 sets of exercises 3 times per week for 6 weeks. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> was measured {{at the beginning and end}} of the 6 -week training period, including anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and total displacement of the center of pressure. [Re-sults] Both exercise groups showed improvement in balance parameters but the improvement was only statistically significant in the closed kinetic chain group. [Conclusion] Closed kinetic chain exercise appears to be more effective at improving of <b>dynamic</b> <b>balance</b> ability than open kinetic chain exercise within a 6 -week training period.
