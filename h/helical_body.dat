5|$|Many {{bacteria}} (such as E. coli) {{have two}} distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling {{allows them to}} reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional random walk. (See external links below for link to videos.) The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> that twists about as it moves.|$|E

Overall the system consists on periplasmic chaperones, periplasmic and extracellular pilus subunits, dimeric usher outer membrane pore and associated Sec machinery. The Pilus subunits polymerise via a non-covalent interaction to form the mature pilus which consists of an adhesive tip, <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> and an usher bound base. The P-pilus (pap) system {{is one of the}} best characterised and is shown below.|$|E
40|$|The {{hydromechanics}} of spirilla locomotion is {{analyzed by}} considering the balance of both rectilinear and angular momenta of the surrounding viscous fluid which is otherwise at rest. The physical model of Spirillum adopted for the present analysis consists of a rigid <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> with flagella attached to both ends of the helix. The motion is supposed to be activated first by the polar flagella, both rotating in the same sense, thus causing the <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> to rotate in the opposite sense in angular recoil, which in turn pushes the body forward in response to the balance of linear momentum of the surrounding fluid. The sweeping back of the polar flagella during forward motion is ascribed to a certain bending flexibility of the flagella and of their conjunction with the body. Based on this model some quantitative results for Spirillum movement are predicted, and are found to be consistent with existing experimental data...|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have <b>helical</b> <b>bodies</b> with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|R
40|$|Various {{kinds of}} helical {{swimmers}} inspired by E. coli bacteria {{have been developed}} continually in many types of researches, {{but most of them}} are proposed by the rigid bodies. For the targeted drug delivery, the rigid body may hurt soft tissues of the working region with organs. Due to this problem, the biomedical applications of helical swimmers may be restricted. However, the helical microswimmers with the soft and deformable body are appropriate and highly adaptive in a confined environment. Thus, this paper presents a lotus-root-based helical microswimmer, which is fabricated by the fibers of lotus-root coated with magnetic nanoparticles to active under the magnetic fields. The helical microstructures are derived from the intrinsic biological structures of the fibers of the lotus-root. This paper aims to study the swimming characteristic of lotus-root-based microswimmers with deformable <b>helical</b> <b>bodies.</b> In the initial step under the uniform magnetic actuation, the helical microswimmers are bent lightly due to the heterogeneous distribution of the internal stress, and then they undergo a swimming motion which is a spindle-like rotation locomotion. Our experiments report that the microswimmers with soft bodies can locomote faster than those with rigid bodies. Moreover, we also find that the curvature of the shape decreases as a function of actuating field frequency which is related to the deformability of lotus-root fibers...|$|R

The AD-technique provided a good result {{for the preservation of}} the spiral spore chain of genus Streptomyces, but was not good for the <b>helical</b> cell <b>bodies</b> of genus Spirillum and of genus Borrelia. The results of the CPD-technique was opposite to that of the AD-technique. The FD-technique was good for all materials in average. From the viewpoints of simplicity efficiency and content of the results, the combination of material and method must be checked preliminarily and decided. In conclusion, the authors recommend the FD-technique as a routine method for the reasons mentioned above...|$|R
40|$|The {{motion of}} a {{rotating}} <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> in a viscoelastic fluid is considered. In {{the case of}} force-free swimming, the introduction of viscoelasticity can either enhance or retard the swimming speed and locomotive efficiency, depending on the body geometry, fluid properties, and the body rotation rate. Numerical solutions of the Oldroyd-B equations show how previous theoretical predictions break down with increasing helical radius or with decreasing filament thickness. Helices of large pitch angle show an increase in swimming speed to a local maximum at a Deborah number of order unity. The numerical results show how the small-amplitude theoretical calculations connect smoothly to the large-amplitude experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|Using {{infrared}} high-speed video microscopy, {{we observed}} light-triggered transitory flagellar motions in flagellate reproductive cells (swarmers) of a brown alga, Scytosiphon lomentaria, under primary helical swimming conditions {{before and during}} negative phototactic orientation to unilateral actinic light. The posterior flagellum, which is autofluorescent and thought to be light-sensing, was passively dragged {{in the dark and}} exhibited one to several rapid lateral beats during orientation changes for phototactic steering. Notably, a brief cessation of anterior flagellar beating was occasionally observed concomitantly with rapid beats of the posterior flagellum. This behavior caused a pause in <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> rotation, which may contribute to the accuracy of phototactic steering. Thus, coordinated regulation of the movement of the two flagella plays a crucial role in phototactic steering...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel multi-modular helical {{magnetic}} millirobot (MHMM) able to navigate in curved tubular environments. The proposed MHMM is basically composed of head, middle, and tail modules serially {{connected by a}} universal joint, and can employ more modules if necessary. The head module is a <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> with a magnetic rotary tip attached to the front end. Thus, once located in a curved tube filled with a fluid, the MHMM can effectively generate navigating or unclogging motions simply actuated by an external rotating magnetic field. This paper also examines the dynamic characteristics of the MHMM under various working conditions to manipulate the MHMM in a stable and safe manner. Then, it demonstrates various controlled motions of the MHMM in an in-vitro pulsatile flow environment to show {{the validity of the}} proposed structure and method...|$|E

Specifically, we consider a bacterium shaped {{in the form of}} a helix that propagates traveling-wave distortions which flip the handedness of the <b>helical</b> cell <b>body.</b> We treat cell length, pitch angle, kink velocity, and distance between kinks as parameters and calculate the swimming velocity that arises due to the distortions. We find that, for a fixed pitch angle, scaling collapses the swimming velocity (and the swimming efficiency) to a universal curve that depends only on the ratio of the distance between kinks to the cell length. Simultaneously optimizing the swimming efficiency with respect to inter-kink length and pitch angle, we find that the optimal pitch angle is 35. 5 ^∘ and the optimal inter-kink length ratio is 0. 338, values in good agreement with experimental observations.

This problem corresponds to the well-known Ponomarenko dynamo. It has the interesting property to have an exact dispersion relation giving the magnetic growth rate {{as a function of}} the flow properties. Therefore, it is a good benchmark to test our kinematic dynamo code. We calculated the dynamo threshold and plotted the geometry of the generated magnetic field. We also evaluated the residual error due to our stabilized formulation...|$|R
40|$|Relativistic jets are {{considered}} to be generated by magnetic fields in a rotating black hole with accretion disk. Consequently, resulting outflows contain magnetic fields in them and control the propagation of jets. We have performed 3 D relativistic MHD simulations to investigate the stability and structure of precessed MHD jets with large Lorentz factor by using a newly developed 3 D GRMHD code. We have performed simulations of supermagnetosonic jets surrounded by a fast wind. The simulation results reveal complex pressure structure inside the RMHD jet. The structure is produced by a combination of the <b>helical</b> surface and <b>body</b> modes excited by the precession as predicted theoretically. The wavelength of the body mode which occurs in an internal helical twist is much shorter than that of the helical twist surface mode.

In this application, motion of the magnetotactic bacteria is influenced by the near-surface effects such as the background flows and surface interactions. Here, we provide a hydrodynamic model of bipolarly-flagellated magnetotactic bacteria (Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense strain MSR- 1) based on the resistive-force theory to resemble the <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> and the two flagella bundles, and investigate their swimming characteristics in two environments, i. e., free-space and near flat walls. The free-space is studied using capillary tubes with depth of 200 ßm, whereas the effect of the flat walls is investigated using microfluidic chips with depth of 5 μm. We find that the linear speeds of bacteria near- and far-surface are 36 ± 16. 4 μm/s (mean±s. d.) and 46 ± 6. 8 μm/s, respectively, whereas their respective angular velocities are 12. 5 ± 5. 7 rad/s and 13. 5 ± 5. 0 rad/s...|$|E
40|$|The infective stages, or 'zoites, of coccidian parasites {{possess an}} {{organized}} network of spirally arranged microtubules that closely follow the <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> shape of these vermiform cells. These subpellicular microtubules are anchored anteriorly by insertion into a highly structured circular microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC) {{known as the}} polar ring. This MTOC has been examined both in situ and in isolated, critical-point-dried whole cyto-skeletons. The 24 microtubules attach laterally to the MTOC through shallow depressions on the inner face of the ring: the ends {{do not appear to}} be physically capped. The polar ring has no obvious or regular substructure, although it has a faintly fibrous appearance. The polarity of the microtubules, determined by 'hook decoration', is such that the plus or fast-growing end is distal to the MTOC.

40|$|Artificial microswimmers present both a {{solution}} and a challenge as alternative tools {{to be used}} in medical applications, namely, drug delivery and minimally invasive surgeries. Achieving desired amount of controlled displacement of microswimmers at desired velocities {{plays an important role in}} determining the success of such applications. In this study, a non-dimensionalised CFD model is utilised to investigate the effects of various geometrical parameters on swimming velocities of microswimmers with helical tails in cylindrical confinements, such as helix wavelength, <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> thickness, and diameter. To this end, a ``one wavelength long'' helical tail is placed inside a cylindrical channel of the same length with periodic boundary conditions applied to both ends, constituting an infinite helix model. As the channel diameter is kept constant, a parametric study of abovementioned geometric identities is conducted to observe the change in the swimming velocities. Furthermore, effects of helix-channel eccentricity and helix rotation about the longitudinal axis on swimming velocity of a dimensionally optimized helix are investigated to reveal near wall effects. The results are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical models existing in the literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{motility}} {{of bacteria}} {{plays an important}} role in their reproduction, energy balance, and predator avoidance, and the study of cell motility can also provide insights on the modes (and prevention) of infection by bacteria. Various aspects of cell motility are investigated in this dissertation, including low-Reynolds number elastohydrodynamics, swimming kinetics, swimming efficiency, and cell morphology. Three swimmers are studied in the dissertation: a Purcellian model swimmer, and the bacteria Spiroplasma and Borrelia burgdoferi. ^ The low-Reynolds number motions of Purcell 2 ̆ 7 s three-link swimmer, and of a closely-related two-paddle swimmer, are investigated and compared using slender-body theory and resistive-force theory. The results are compared (in the case of the three-link swimmer) with the resistive-have calculations of Becker, Koehler and Stone (BKS). In particular, we examine the effect of hydrodynamic interaction and slenderness on the displacement and efficiency of the swimmers. ^ Spiroplasma swimming is studied with a simple model based on resistive-force theory. Specifically, we consider a bacterium shaped in the form of a helix that propagates traveling-wave distortions which flip the handedness of the <b>helical</b> cell <b>body.</b> We treat cell length, pitch angle, kink velocity, and distance between kinks as parameters and calculate the swimming velocity that arises due to the distortions. In addition, the left-handed and right-handed helices are concatenated by kinks during the swimming process of Spiroplasma, and the block angle between these helices with reversed chiralities is solved for by using a combination of differential geometry and perturbation theory. ^ As a unique group of motile bacteria, spirochetes are distinguished by their helical and flat-wave shapes and the location of their flagella, which reside within the tiny space between the bacterial cell wall and the outer membrane (i. e., the periplasm). In Borrelia burgdoferi rotation of the flagella produces cellular undulations that drive swimming. Flagellar shape changes due to the forces and torques that act between the flagella and the cell body are investigated. ...|$|R

Radiotherapy (RT) technology can safely provide focused high-dose irradiation to these patients. A wide spectrum of RT technologiesis currently available, including internal RT consisting of Yttrium- 90 (90 Y), Iodine- 131 (131 I) anti-ferritin antibody and Homium- 199 (199 Ho) and external RT, such as three-dimensional conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT, <b>helical</b> tomotherapy, stereotactic <b>body</b> RT, and image-guided RT.

The Japanese-led space VLBI project VSOP has presented an opportunity for such studies, by reaching baseline lengths of up to 36, 000 km and resolving structures down to an angular size of ≈ 0. 3 mas at 5 GHz. VSOP observations of the jet in 0836 + 710 at 1. 6 and 5 GHz have enabled tracing of the radial structure of the flow on scales from 2 mas to 200 mas along the jet and determination of the wavelengths of individual oscillatory modes responsible {{for the formation of}} the structure observed. We apply linear stability analysis to identify the oscillatory modes with modes of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that match the wavelengths of the structures observed. We find that the jet structure in 0836 + 710 can be reproduced by the helical surface mode and a combination of the <b>helical</b> and elliptic <b>body</b> modes of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Our results indicate that the jet is substantially stratified and different modes of the instability grow inside the jet at different distances to the jet axis.

Training consisted of sorting these sequences into 1 of 2 groups: transmembrane helical peptides or nontransmembrane peptides. Learning was measured using a test set 10 % {{the size of the}} training set. As training set size increased from 214 sequences to 1, 751 sequences, learning increased in a nonlinear manner from 75 % to a high of 98 %, then declined to a low of 87 %. The final training database consisted of roughly equal numbers of transmembrane (928) and nontransmembrane (1, 018) sequences. All transmembrane sequences were entered into the database with respect to their lipid membrane orientation: from inside the membrane to outside. Generalized transmembrane helix and nontransmembrane peptides were constructed from the maximally weighted connecting strengths of fully trained networks. Four generalized transmembrane helices were found to contain 9 consensus residues: a K-R-F triplet was found at the inside lipid interface, 2 isoleucine and 2 other phenylalanine residues were present in the <b>helical</b> <b>body,</b> and 2 tryptophan residues were found near the outside lipid interface.

40|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{to what extent}} midgut {{rotation}} determines human intestinal topography and pathology. We reinvestigated the midgut during its looping and herniation phases of development, using novel 3 D visualization techniques. We distinguished 3 generations of midgut loops. The topography of primary and secondary loops was constant, but that of tertiary loops not. The orientation of the primary loop changed from sagittal to transverse due to the descent of ventral structures in a body with a still <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> axis. The 1 st secondary loop (duodenum, proximal jejunum) developed intraabdominally towards a left-sided position. The 2 nd secondary loop (distal jejunum) assumed a left-sided position inside the hernia before returning, while the 3 rd and 4 th secondary loops retained near-midline positions. Intestinal return into the abdomen resembled a backward sliding movement. Only after return, the 4 th secondary loop (distal ileum, cecum) rapidly "slid" into the right lower abdomen. The seemingly random position of the tertiary small-intestinal loops may have a biomechanical origin. The interpretation of "intestinal rotation" as a mechanistic rather than a descriptive concept underlies much of the confusion accompanying the physiological herniation. We argue, instead, {{that the concept of}} "en-bloc rotation" of the developing midgut is a fallacy of schematic drawings. Primary, secondary and tertiary loops arise in a hierarchical fashion. The predictable position and growth of secondary loops is pre-patterned and determines adult intestinal topography. We hypothesize based on published accounts that malrotations result from stunted development of secondary loop...|$|E

In the typical spermatid the nucleus undergoes profound changes as development proceeds, affecting both its form and internal fine structure. A large number of roughly parallel, dense filaments, arranged along the long axis of the nucleus, fuse {{with each other to}} form in the end the homogeneous <b>helical</b> <b>body</b> characteristic of the head of the adult spermatozoa. The nebenkern is apparently mitochondrial in nature and, in its early development, {{is similar to that of}} insects except that it appears as a double structure from the beginning. As differentiation proceeds, the mitochondria lose their membranes, and the residual, now denuded cristae, reorganize to give a parallel radial arrangement. In the last stages of development, the nebenkern derivations become applied to the sheath of the middle piece in a compact helical fashion. In the development of the atypical spermatozoa, the nucleus fails to differentiate and simply shrinks in volume until only a remnant, devoid of DNA, is left. The cytoplasm shows numerous vesicles containing small Feulgen-positive bodies, 80 to 130 m ~ in diameter. These vesicles plus contents increase in number as spermatogenesis proceeds. The "head " structure of the atypical spermatozoa consists of a bundle (7 to 17) of tail flagella, each with a centriole at its anterior end.

40|$|Endpoint: To assess early urinary (GU) and rectal (GI) toxicities after <b>helical</b> tomotherapy Stereotactic <b>Body</b> Radiation Therapy (SBRT), and to {{determine}} their predictive factors. Methods: Since May 2012 forty-five prostate cancer patients were treated with 8 fractions of 5. 48 (low risk, 29 %) or 5. 65 Gy (intermediate-high risk, 71 %) on alternative days over 2. 5 weeks. The exclusion criteria were: Gleason score 9 - 10, PSA > 40 ng/mL, cT 3 b- 4, IPSS ≥ 20 and history of acute urinary retention. During the follow-up a set of potential prognostic factors was correlated with urinary or rectal toxicity. Results: The median follow-up was 13. 8 months (2 - 25 months). There were no grade ≥ 3 toxicities. Acute grade 2 GU complications were found in a 22. 7 % of men, but in 2. 3 % of patients at 1 month, 0 % at 6 months and 0 % at 12 months. The correspondent figures for grade 2 GI toxicities were: 20. 4 % (acute), 2. 3 % (1 month), 3. 6 % (6 months) and 5 % (12 months). Acute GI toxicity was significantly correlated with the rectal volume (> 15 cm 3) receiving 28 Gy, only when expressed as absolute volume. The age (> 72 years old) was a predictor of GI toxicity after 1 month of treatment. No correlation was found, however, between urinary toxicity and the other analyzed variables. IPSS increased significantly {{at the time of}} the last fraction and within the 1 st month, returning to the baseline at 6 th month. Urinary-related quality of life (IPSS question 8 score), it was not significantly worsen during radiotherapy returning to the baseline levels 1 month after the treatment. At 12 months follow-up patient’s perception of their urinary function improved significantly in comparison with the baseline. Conclusion: Our scheme of 8 fractions on alternative days delivered using helical tomotherapy is well tolerated. We recommend using actual volume instead of percentual volume in the treatment planning, and not to exceed 15 cm 3 of rectal volume receiving ≥ 25 Gy in order to diminish acute GI toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 Half of {{all humans}} harbor the {{extracellular}} pathogen Helicobacter pylori in their stomachs. Successful colonization by H. pylori requires flagellar-based motility for the bacterium to traverse the thick gastric mucus layer and reach its preferred niche, {{close to the}} gastric epithelium. Helical cell shape is thought to facilitate H. pylori’s ability to bore into the mucus layer in a corkscrew-like motion, thus enhancing colonization of the stomach. In a mouse model of infection, H. pylori cell shape mutants show impaired stomach colonization highlighting the importance of cell shape in infection and motility. To investigate how cell shape impacts H. pylori’s motility in vitro, I modeled the viscous environment of the human gastric mucosa with physiologic concentrations of purified porcine gastric mucin (PGM). Using single-cell microscopic tracking and quantitative morphology analysis, I document marked variation in both cell <b>body</b> <b>helical</b> parameters and flagellum number among H. pylori strains leading to distinct and broad swimming speed distributions that reflect both temporal variation in swimming speed and morphologic variation within the population. Isogenic mutants with straight rod morphology showed reduced swimming speeds (7 - 21 %) and a higher fraction of immobilized bacteria. Mutational perturbation of flagellum number revealed a 19 % increase in swimming speed for H. pylori with 4 vs. 3 median flagellum number. Resistive force theory (RFT) -modeling incorporating both cell morphology and flagellum number variation predicts quantitative speed differences of 10 - 30 % among strains. However, quantitative comparisons suggest RFT underestimates the effect of helical shape on speed. To gain {{a deeper understanding of}} how helical cell morphology promotes host colonization by H. pylori, I then performed a time course of single-strain infections with wild-type bacteria, a curved rod mutant (Δcsd 1), and a straight rod mutant (Δcsd 6). Cell shape mutants show significant attenuation during initial colonization (1 day and 1 week). After persistent infection (1 - 4 months), a subset of mice infected with Δcsd 1 or Δcsd 6 mutant bacteria show enhanced infection, while others maintain low or no infection. I used confocal microscopy and 3 -D reconstructions of thick tissue sections, and performed volumetric analysis to quantify the number of bacteria within different regions of the stomach. Localization of H. pylori reveals multiple gastric niches and specific deficits for cell shape mutants in colonization of the antral glands early after infection, and altered progression of inflammation and gland hyperplasia after chronic infection. Our studies are elucidating the mechanisms by which helical cell morphology promotes motility and sustains host colonization by H. pylori, which may impact human health and disease...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{entitled}} “Design and Access to Disallowed and Unusual Conformers of Peptides in Crystals and in Solution: Structural Consequences of the Imidate and Thioimidate Isosteres for the Peptide bond” {{is divided}} into eight chapters. Imidate Modification The range of disallowed dihedral angles for residues in peptides is governed by their local steric and electrostatic clashes. Rare tolerances of violations in these angles are attributed to distortions in both local and global bond characteristics of the peptides. Discerning the origins of such disallowed angles and the consequent distortions in body of the peptides is essential, for a complete understanding of the protein fold, to improve the crystal database for validation of rare but acceptable residue conformations and for validation and improvement of theoretical models that evaluate the interactions that define the Ramachandran space. Unlike for the ordered secondary structures such as β-sheets α-helices and β-turns currently there are no models for residues constrained in disallowed folds. We reasoned that residues may be stabilized in disallowed folds in peptides if a neighbouring group and The range of disallowed dihedral angles (, ψ) for residues in peptides is governed by their hence its local unfavorable clashes can be selectively modified to a motif that favors such space Steric clashes of the type H•••Xi±n involving the backbone amide hydrogen (H) contribute to ~ 60 % of disallowed ,ψspace. Conversion of an amide to an imidate (A→I) will remove the corresponding H and hence the steric clashes related to it in peptides. Importantly, this will introduce an H-bond acceptor N (of imidate) in place of an H-bond donor NH (of amide), which will allow formation of unusual H-bonding interactions between the imidate N and the neighbouring Hs and hence constrain residues in otherwise inaccessible dihedral angles. The conversion of A→I is challenging owing to difficulties in selective synthesis, stability and purification of the imidate motif. We address all these concerns by the selective conversion of a backbone amide in peptides to the relatively stable cyclic 5, 6 -dihydro- 4 H- 1, 3 -oxazine imidate isostere, by an intra¬molecular nucleophilic cyclo-O-alkylation reaction. Chapter 1 :SectionB: Autocyclo-O-Alkylation of N-(3 -Bromopropyl) amides into 2 -Alkyl- 5, 6 -Dihydro- 4 H- 1, 3 -Oxazinehydrobromides We are describing the reactivity of N-(3 -bromopropyl) amides that are precursors for 2 -peptide- 5, 6 -dihydro- 4 H- 1, 3 -oxazine. The starting materials, 3 -bromopropylamides, were synthesized in good yields by coupling the corresponding carboxylic acids and anhydrides with 3 -bromopropylaminehydrobromide using standard mixed anhydride peptide coupling protocol. N-(3 -bromopropyl) -acylamides are unstable during the isolation. Time-dependent 1 H NMR of all the acetamides revealed that they underwent clean auto-cyclization to form the corresponding 2 -alkyl- 5, 6 -dihydro- 4 H- 1, 3 -oxazine hydrobromides following first order rate. The salts were easily isolated in high purity by trituration of the mixtures with ether. The t 1 / 2 of autocycliation of decreased upon increase in electron density on the R-carbon. Notably, the tert-butyl substituent cyclized significantly faster than acetamide which have enolizable hydrogens at the R-carbon. Thus, the cyclization rate is affected predominantly by the inductive effect of the R-carbon substituents. The formamide remained stable and unchanged due to the poor electron-donating ability of hydrogen. Chapter 1 : Section C: Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond Assistance Improves Autocyclization in N-(3 -Bromopropyl) amides The autocyclisation {{do not go to}} 100 % completion. This is because the released hydrobromic acid quenches the nucleophilicity of amide carbonyl oxygen. In order to scavenge hydro bromic acid, we used 1 equivalent of DIEA base is acting only acid scavenger which conformed by unaffecting the reaction rate upon increasing equivalents of DIEA. We found that autocyclisation of N-(3 -bromopropyl) amides rates in peptides involved in intramolecular backbone H-bonding interactions improve the autocyclization rates significantly than unstructured (random coil) peptides. Even with in the ordered structures the rate depends on the proximity of H-bonding distances as well as the H-bond acceptor strength. Half-life of autocyclisation in various peptide secondary structures are determined from time variant 1 H NMR studies performed at 60 mM peptide concentration in CDCl 3 at 32 oC. Chapter 2 : Section A: Synthesis and Isolation of 5, 6 Dihydro- 4 H- 1, 3 -Oxazine Containing Peptidomimetics We have introduced 5, 6 -Dihydro- 4 H- 1, 3 -oxazine as the imidate isostere at C-terminus of a number of peptides through NaH (base) mediated intramolecular cyclo-O-alkylation of N-(3 -bromopropyl) amides. The amide to imidate (A→I) modification reaction is faster (1 - 5. 5 h), Exhibiting no electronic and structural effects under these conditions. The side product NaBr can be easily separated by filtration through celite. No side products were observed and there is no need of further purification to get pure 1, 3 -oxazines in quantitative yields in all the peptidomimetics. Using this synthetic protocol we have synthesised a variety of 1, 3 -oxazine containing peptide analogues including aliphatic, branched aliphatic, polar side chains and larger peptides. We show that the retention of configuration at Cαof peptides during the base mediated cyclo-O-alkylation reaction. that the C 5 i. structures are more populated at Aib due to operation of The Thorpe-Ingold effect. The strength of hydrogen bonding interaction in C 5 i structure is {{similar to those of the}} highly buried backbone hydrogen bonding interaction found in the middle of a model 310 -helical peptide as indicated by DMSO titration experiments. Chapter 3 : Section A: Consequences of "Disallowed" Conformations on Constrained β-Turn Peptides Here we are describe the consequence of disallowed conformations the on a C-terminus of a type-II β-turn. We choose stereochemically constrained Type-II β-turn Pro-Aib dipeptide analogue which is the ideal model to mirror the structural effects of introducing the A→I modification at the C-terminus. The imidate containing peptidomimetic crystallised in dichloromethane and hexane mixture. Analysis of crystal structure revealed that Aib NH is involved in 3 -centered H-bonding interactions with the N of oxazine and N of proline. This constrains Aib in a conformation that is natively disallowed to it. The (, ) angles of Aib residue fall in the (180, 0) region which is strictly disallowed for natural peptides due to steric clashes involving the back bone amide N-H. More importantly there are two C•••O interactions which are accomidated in the crystal structures. Both oxygen‟s were place in staggered orientation of the Pro oxygen (OPro) between the two β-CH 3 groups of Aib, which is again strictly disallowed in natural peptides due to strong C•••Oi- 1 hard sphere clashes. However no vdW space violations are observed between these atoms. Chapter 3 : Section B: Conformational Effects of “Disallowed Aib on a 310 -Helical peptide In order to investigate the origins and consequences of “disallowed” conformations on a folded <b>helical</b> peptide <b>body,</b> the conformationally stable peptide sequence Boc-Leu 1 -Aib 2 -Ala 3 -Leu 4 -Aib 5 -Ala 6 -Phe 7 -Aib 8 -OMe (310 -helix-OMe) was chosen which is known to adopt 310 -helix in crystal structure. Analyses of the ROESY spectra, DMSO titration experiments, and CD spectra of 310 -helix-OMe and its Oxa analogue reveal that their solution conformations are identical to those of the crystal structure of 310 -helix-OMeSix sequential i+ 3 →i intramolecular backbone H-bonds stabilize the 310 -helical peptide fold in both peptides in solvents of varying polarity. The N-terminal and central segments of the helical molecules are quite structurally rigid and are not deformed. The presence of the disallowed Aib* 8 residue in Oxa analogue has a clear conformational effect mainly on the residue Phe 7. It looks like the Phe 7 amide H is involved in shielding, the Aib* 8 amide H through a bifurcated hydrogen bonding interactions with the nitrogen of oxazine and carbonyl oxygen of Ala 6 residue. Maximum structural distortion effect on the registers closest to the putative imidate bond. Our results show that “disallowed folds need not denature order in the peptide fold”. Chapter 4 : Synthetic Methods for Introducing the A → I Modification anywhere along the Peptide Chain Here we describe the incorporation of imidate isostere in the middle of any peptide sequence. In Oxa selectivity is towards 5 -exo-cyclo-O-alkylation in 1 : 4. In Thi it is towards 6 -exo-cyclo-S-alkylation in 3 : 1 ratio. This is because of better nucleophile of sulphur (S). We saw that Thi is stable to peptide coupling, N-and C-terminus protection, deprotection conditions and can be easily incorporated in middle of peptide. Chapter 5 : Section A: Cis-trans Isomerism in the X-Pro Peptide Bond In tertiary amides like X-Pro peptides having high propensity to access cis conformations due to similar environment in both cis and trans around the Cof X. X-Pro peptide bonds, constrained in s-cis conformations are prevalently found in the turn regions of peptides with the residue „X‟ in the i+ 1 position and Pro at the i+ 2 position of the β¬turn. These types of turns are termed as the type VI β-turns. For better understanding of the molecular recognition at specific cis X-Pro peptide bonds in biological events, the structure and dynamics of various constrained cis X-Pro peptide bond analogues with varying steric and electronic perturbations have been studied. Many models have been developed for stabilizing cis conformer by perturbation of molecular recognition surface of proline by employing steric and electronic interaction. In biological functions proline molecular recognition surface and cis X-Pro peptide bond more important. There is need of novel method for stabilizing X-Pro peptide bond in cis conformer without modifying the pyrolidine ring in proline. Chapter 5 : Section B: Biasing the cis/trans Equilibrium in X Pro Peptides using Reverse ni → ni- 1 * Interactions Here we present our findings that peptidomimetics containing the 5, 6 -dihydro- 4 H- 1, 3 ¬oxazine (Oxa) and 5, 6 -dihydro- 4 H- 1, 3 -thiazine (Thi) functional groups at the C-terminus of Pro selectively and remotely stabilize the s-cis rotamers of the preceding pyrrolyl (Xaa-Pro) 3 ° amide bonds, while conserving these recognition elements. The cis/trans equilibrium of Xaa-Pro peptide bonds is shifted significantly in favor of the satirically disfavored cis isomers in these peptidomimetics (upto ~ 90 %). We also provide evidence for the influence of an unusual n→ πi- 1 * interaction in the cis, and the n) (n repulsion in the trans, conformers of these molecules to beat the origin of such the origin of such cis stabilization. Chapter 6 : Steric Interactions in the cis Piv-Pro Peptide Bond The inaccessibility of cis Piv-Pro rotamer in any peptide is believed to be because the steric clashes between substituents on CX and CPro are unavoidable in this conformer. Here we access the cisPiv-Pro conformer in crystal structure of Piv-Pro-Aib-OMe and that it is sufficiently flexible to undergo bond distortions and avoid all steric clashes between substituents on CPiv and CPro. It is however the unavoidable distortions in the dihedral angle of the Prothe cisPiv-Proconformer. The cisPiv -Pro conformer is indeed accessible, if such distortions are accommodated in the peptide. Chapter 7 : Steric and Electronic Interactions in the cis Isomer of Piv-Pro Peptide Bond in Solution We have studied the electronic and steric interactions and the conformational equilibrium in two sets of homologous peptides, X-Pro-Aib-OMe (which contain Aib) and X-Pro-NH-Me, where X is acetyl, propionyl, isobutyryl and pivaloyl, in solvents of varying polarities consisting of carbontetrachloride, chloroform or dimethylsulfoxide, by means of their 1 H and 13 C-NMR, and FT-IR spectra. Formation of n * interactions between the carbonyls that flank the Aib residue, influences the alleviation of steric interactions that are believed to preclude access to the cis conformer of the Piv-Pro peptide bond. The cis Piv-Pro conformer is observable in the Aib containing peptides, at ambient conditions by FT-IR and at temperatures as low as 273 K by NMR. We estimate that the steric interactions contribute < 0. 5 kcal/mol to the conformational free energy of X-Pro peptide bond isomerism, irrespective of the steric bulk on the acyl (X) group. The relative strengths of intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions involving the X-Pro peptide motif in different conformers of these peptides influence their relative conformational stabilities. Chapter 8 : Remote Effect of Oxa and Thi Functional Groups on cis-trans Isomerism at X-Pro Peptide Bonds The C 5 a interaction at Pro residue occurs in the transition states for the intramolecular acid catalysis of cis → trans isomerization in peptidyl prolyl isomerases (PPIs) and enables the decrease in transition energy barrier for the isomerization process. We show that the NPro…. HAib interactions in C 5 a structures can be remotely effected in order to control in equilibrium constant values of the cis/trans isomerism (Kc/t) in X-Pro¬Aib-Oxa and Thi containing peptides. By this method we observed improvement in Kc/t values from 0. 18 in esters to 0. 56 in Thi and 0. 66 in Oxa containing peptides. Analyses of the ROESY spectra, DMSO titration experiments, variable temperature experiments and FT-IR spectra of R-CO-Pro-Aib-Oxa (R = Me, Et, iPr) and its Thi analogues reveals that both interactions (C 5 a and C 5 i) are persistent in cis and trans conformers of this peptidomimetics.

40|$|The {{irradiation}} {{effects of}} ultraviolets rays (UV) on leptospira cells were investigated. Four serovar strains of Genus Leptospira; L. copenhageni, L. canicola, L, biflexa and L. illini were used. A sterilization lamp (Toshiba-GL- 15) were lighted at intervals of 90 mm on the sample fluid for several minutes. Loss of motility, survival growth and morphological damages were recognized under several conditions. The medium conditions were important, that is, the Korthof's medium was less effective than {{phosphate buffered saline}} (PBS). The irradiation time was also important, that is, L. canicola cells in PBS lost their motility and survive ability within 300 sec. of irradiation, however, much more time, such as 1, 200 sec. was necessary in Korthof's medium. This phenomenon may be depended upon defensibility of albumin in the latter. Among the strains, L. biflexa cells showed the highest resistance in loss of motility and survive ability, and other three strains were inferior. The remarkable effects of cellular structures were also seen in the materials with 30 min. of irradiation, in both immediate time or after 24 h incubation. The damages observed after 24 h of irradiation were much more drastic than those of immediate time. No effect could {{be seen on the}} cells suspended in the Korthof's medium irradiated for 24 h. Regarding morphological effect, there appeared relaxation of <b>helical</b> <b>body,</b> spherical body and semighost as the immediate changes. Structural damages were recognized as the collapse of cell body, such as scattering of capsule, release of axial flagella, loss or change of cytoplasmic density and break down of wall membrane complex. These phenomena were regarded as the indirect effects of UV-irradiation and autolysis in a post-mortem change...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{proteins}} roughly constitute 30 % of open reading frames in a genome {{and form}} 70 % of current drug targets. They {{are classified as}} integral, peripheral membrane proteins and polypeptide toxins. α-helices and β -strands are the principal secondary structures observed in integral membrane proteins. This thesis {{presents the results of}} studies on analysis and correlation of sequence and structure of helices constituting integral helical membrane proteins. The aim of this work is to understand the helix stabilization, distortion as well as packing in terms of amino acid sequences and the correlated structures they adopt. To this end, analyses of datasets of X-ray crystal structures of integral helical membrane proteins and their comparison with a dataset of representative folds of globular proteins was carried out. Initial analysis was carried out using a non-redundant dataset of 75 membrane proteins to understand sequence and structural preferences for stabilization of helix termini. The subsequent analysis of helix distortions in membrane proteins was carried out using an updated dataset of 90 membrane proteins. Chapter 1 of the thesis reviews experimental as well as theoretical studies that have provided insights into understanding the structure of helical membrane proteins. Chapter 2 details the methods used {{during the course of the}} present investigations. These include the protocol used for creation of the non-redundant database of membrane and globular proteins. Various statistical methods used to test significance of the position-wise representation of amino acids in helical regions and the differences in globular and membrane protein datasets have been listed. Based on the tests of significance, a methodology to identify differences in propensity values that are statistically significant among two datasets has been devised. Programs used for secondary structure identification of membrane proteins namely Structure Identification (STRIDE) and Assignment of Secondary Structure in Proteins (ASSP) as well as those used for characterization of helical geometry (Helanal-Plus) have also been enlisted. In Chapter 3, datasets of 865 α-helices in 75 membrane proteins and 2680 α- helices from 626 representative folds in globular proteins defined by the STRIDE program have been analyzed to study the sequence determinants at fifteen positions within and around the α-helix. The amino acid propensities have been studied for positions that are important for the process of helix initiation, propagation, stabilization and termination. Each of the 15 positions has unique sequence characteristics reflecting their role and contribution towards the stability of the α-helix. A comparison of the sequence preferences in membrane and globular proteins revealed common residue preferences in both these datasets confirming the importance of these positions and the strict residue preferences therein. However, short/medium length α-helices that initiated/terminated within the membrane showed distinct amino acid preferences at the N-terminus (Ncap, N 1, N 2) as well as the C-terminus (Ccap, Ct) when compared to α-helices belonging to membrane and globular proteins. The sequence preferences in membrane proteins were governed by the helix initiating and terminating property of the amino acids as well as the external environment of the helix. Results from our analysis also conformed well with experimentally tested amino acid preferences in a position-specific amino acid preference library of the rat neurotensin receptor (Schlinkmann et al (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109 (25) : 1890 - 5) as well as crystal structures of GPCR proteins. In the light of the environment dependent amino acid preferences found at α- helix termini, a survey was carried out to find various helix capping motifs adopted at both termini of α-helices in globular and membrane proteins to stabilize these helix termini. The results from these findings have been reported in Chapter 4. A sequence dependent structural preference is found for capping motifs at helix termini embedded inside and protruding outside the membrane. The N-terminus of α-helices was capped by hydrogen bonds involving free main chain amide groups of the first helical turn as donors and amino acid side chains as acceptors, as against the C-terminus which showed position-dependent characteristic backbone conformations to cap the helix. Overall helix termini inside the membrane did not show a very high number of capping motifs; instead these termini were stabilized by helix- helix interactions contributed by the neighboring helices of the helical bundle. In Chapter 5, we examine transmembrane helical (TMH) regions to identify as well as characterize the various types of helix perturbations in membrane proteins using ASSP and Helanal-Plus. A survey of literature shows that the term ‘helix kink’ has been used rather loosely when in fact helical regions show significant amounts of variation and transitions in helical parameters. Hence a systematic analysis of TMH regions was undertaken to quantify different types of helix perturbations, based on geometric parameters such as helical twist, rise per residue and local bending angle. Results from this analysis indicated that helices are not only kinked but undergo transitions to form interspersed stretches of 310 helices and π-bulges within the bilayer. These interspersed 310 and π-helices showed unique sequence preferences within and around their <b>helical</b> <b>body,</b> and also assisted in main- taining the helical structure within the bilayer. We found that Proline not only kinked the helical regions in a characteristic manner but also caused a tightening or unwinding in a helical region to form 310 and π-helix fragments respectively. The helix distortions also resulted in backbone hydrogen bonds to be missed which were stabilized by hydrogen bonds from neighboring residues mediated by their side chain atoms. Furthermore, a packing analysis showed that helical regions with distortions were able to establish inter-helical interactions with more number of transmembrane segments in the helical bundle. The study on helix perturbations presented in the previous chapter, brought to light a previously unreported 19 amino acid π-helix fragment interspersed between α-helices in the functionally important transmembrane helix 2 (TM 2) belonging to Mitochondrial cytochrome-c-oxidase (1 v 55). Chapter 6 describes a case study of the structurally similar but functionally different members within the Heme-Copper- Superoxidases (HCO) superfamily that were considered for a comparative analysis of TM 2. An analysis of 7 family members revealed that the π-helix shortens, fragments in two shorter π-helices or was even absent in some family members. The long π-helix significantly decreased the total twist and rise of the entire helical fragment thus accommodating more hydrophobic amino acids within the bilayer to avoid hydrophobic mismatch with the bilayer. The increased radius of the TM 2 helical fragment also assisted in helix packing interactions by increasing the number of residues involved in helix-helix interactions and hydrogen bonds. Chapter 7 documents the conclusions from the different analyses presented in each of the above chapters. Overall, it is found that membrane proteins optimize the biophysical and chemical constraints of the external environment to strategically place select amino acids at helix termini to ‘start’ and ‘stop’ α-helices. The stabilization of these helix termini is a consequence of sequence dependent structural preferences to form helix capping motifs. The studies on helix transitions and distortions highlight that membrane proteins are not only packed as α-helices but also accomodate 310 - and π-helical fragments. These transitions and distortions help in harboring more hydrophobic amino acids and aiding inter-helical interactions important for maintaining the fold of the membrane protein. Appendix A describes a comparison of α-helix assignments in globular and membrane proteins by two algorithms, one based on Cα trace (ASSP) and the other using a combination of hydrogen bond pattern along with backbone torsion angles φ and ψ (STRIDE) ...|$|E
