40|$|CERN defines and {{implements}} a Safety Policy {{that sets}} out the <b>general</b> principles governing <b>safety</b> at CERN. As an intergovernmental organisation, CERN further establishes its own Safety Rules as necessary for its proper functioning. In this process, it {{takes into account}} the laws and regulation of the Host States (France and Switzerland), EU regulations and directives, as well as international regulations, standards and directives. For the safety of cryogenic equipment, this is primarily covered by the Safety Regulation for Mechanical Equipment and the <b>General</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Instruction</b> for Cryogenic Equipment. In addition, CERN has also developed Safety Guidelines to support the implementation of these safety rules, covering cryogenic equipment and oxygen deficiency hazard assessment and mitigation. An overview of the cryogenic safety rules and these safety guidelines will be presented...|$|R
40|$|CERN as an {{intergovernmental}} organization establishes its own Safety Rules as necessary for its proper functioning. In particular, the CERN <b>General</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Instruction</b> for cryogenic equipment requires that cryogenic pressure equipment at CERN shall {{comply with the}} European Pressure Equipment Directive (PED). However, due to the particular features {{of some of the}} cryogenic equipment required for the accelerators, as well as the existence of international collaborations with in-kind contributions from non-EU countries, full compliance with the PED may not always be achieved. This situation is foreseen in the Safety Rules, where CERN HSE will define the Safety requirements applicable to such equipment as well as any eventual additional compensatory measure as to ensure a commensurate level of Safety for our pressure equipment. Where compliance with PED may not be achieved, CERN HSE will become the de facto Notified Body and therefore {{be in charge of the}} assessment of the conformity of the equipment to the applicable Safety requirements. This talk will further describe the strategy CERN HSE takes for the achievement of conformity with CERN Safety Rules for pressure equipment when exempt from CE-marking and some examples of undergoing projects (HL-LHC crab cavities, Inner Triplet Quadrupoles) will be presented...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyHuman NutritionEdgar Chambers IVConsumer {{food safety}} often is lacking, with many {{studies showing that}} we need to {{understand}} consumer behavior better and find new ways to provide information. The objective of this research was to better understand consumer food safety behaviors, find possible avenues for communicating food <b>safety</b> <b>instructions</b> to consumers, and determine how those avenues could work for demonstrating food safety today. Results from this research showed that two of the main potential avenues for communicating food <b>safety</b> <b>instructions,</b> namely recipes and cooking shows, were wholly lacking in good information and behaviors. A survey of egg dish recipes found that almost none contained temperature information, despite recommendations of food safety agencies. Observing celebrity chefs prepare food showed that every chef repeatedly had poor food safety practices which would lead to foodborne illness if followed by consumers at home. Two consumer studies were done with observers watching consumers prepare poultry and egg items. In the first study, consumers were asked to prepare poultry and egg items using both stovetop and oven methods. This study demonstrated that consumers do not follow many food safety behaviors, such as hand washing and using thermometers, and that those who used a thermometer were not better at reaching a safe temperature than those who didn’t use one. The second study had consumers prepare poultry items following a recipe, with half receiving food <b>safety</b> <b>instructions</b> on hand washing and thermometer use with their recipes. This study demonstrated that the addition of food <b>safety</b> <b>instructions</b> dramatically improved food safety behaviors in consumers. A separate study looked at the effect of changing lighting due to recent changes in efficiency regulations. This study found that some forms of modern lighting, such as LEDs, are more likely to make consumers think that poultry products are finished cooking before they are done, showing an even greater need for thermometer use. These studies present a message for the industry: food safety information and behaviors are lacking in consumers, but simple efforts such as adding food <b>safety</b> <b>instructions</b> to recipes can make consumers more aware of appropriate behaviors and improve their food safety...|$|R
