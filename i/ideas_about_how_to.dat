25|$|During a {{visit to}} the Cleveland Indians, Beane meets Peter Brand, a young Yale {{economics}} graduate with radical <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> assess players' value. Beane tests Brand's theory by asking whether he would have drafted him (out of high school), Beane having been a Major League player before becoming general manager. Though scouts considered Beane a phenomenal prospect, his career in the Major Leagues was disappointing. Brand admits that he would not have drafted him until the ninth round and surmised that Beane would probably have accepted a college scholarship instead. Impressed, Beane hires Brand to be the Athletics assistant general manager.|$|E

Though some of these were to bear fruit, the [...] "big idea" [...] of this time would come from Edwin McMillan with his concept of phase stability {{which led to the}} synchrocyclotron. Refining and extending this concept, the Lawrence team would build the world's then-largest proton accelerator, the Bevatron, which began operating in 1954. Though the Bevatron could produce copious amounts of interesting particles, particularly in secondary collisions, these complex interactions were hard to detect and analyze at the time.|$|E

Steven Spielberg's original conception of Falling Skies was that {{the characters in the}} series would be nomadic. The idea for the second season was to [...] "create a mobile refugee camp made up of vehicles and rag-tag tents." [...] Chris Faloona, who was the Director of Photography in the first season, was unable to return due to commitments on another series, and Nate Goodman was hired. Aubuchon and Beeman discussed what was a head for the characters this season, and soon after, Beeman called Connor Jessup, who plays Ben Mason, and said [...] "I’ve just heard what the plans are for you for this season. [...] And my strong advice is that you get a trainer and start eating your Wheaties!

500|$|Verbal {{report is}} widely {{considered}} to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness, but it raises a number of issues. [...] For one thing, if verbal reports are treated as observations, akin to observations in other branches of science, then the possibility arises that they may contain errors—but it is difficult {{to make sense of the}} idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences, and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected. [...] Daniel Dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology, which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true, but his <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do this have not been widely adopted. [...] Another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language: [...] this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species, pre-linguistic children, or people with types of brain damage that impair language. [...] As a third issue, philosophers who dispute the validity of the Turing test may feel that it is possible, at least in principle, for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely: [...] a philosophical zombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness.|$|E
500|$|The {{physicists}} at Aldermaston {{had plenty}} of <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> follow up Grapple X. Possibilities were discussed in September 1957. One was to tinker with {{the width of the}} shells in the Dick to find an optimal configuration. If they were too thick, they would slow the neutrons generated by the fusion reaction; if they were too thin, they would give rise to Taylor instability. Another was {{to do away with the}} shells entirely and use a mixture of uranium-235, uranium-238 and deuterium. Ken Allen had an idea, which Sam Curran supported, of a three-layer Dick that used lithium deuteride that was less enriched in lithium-6 (and therefore had more lithium-7), but more of it, reducing the amount of uranium-235 in the centre of the core. This proposal was the one adopted in October, and it became known as [...] "Dickens" [...] because it used Ken's Dick. The device would otherwise be similar to Round A, but with a larger radiation case. The safety limit was again set to [...] Keith Roberts calculated that the yield could reach , and suggested that this could be reduced by modifying the tamper, but Cook opposed this, fearing that it might cause the test to fail. Because of the possibility of a moratorium on testing, plans for the test, codenamed Grapple Y, were restricted to the Prime Minister, who gave verbal approval, and a handful of officials.|$|E

For balance, just as he had in the previous year, Bayh voted against the appointment of a George W. Bush Supreme Court nominee when he cast his [...] "no" [...] vote for Samuel Alito. However, his fellow potential Democratic presidential peers, voted in a similar fashion. Late in January, Bayh gained the position as speaker at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in North Carolina for the upcoming April. The gain came as a loss for North Carolinian John Edwards, who also was considered a potential candidate for the Democratic nomination. A Bayh spokesman, commented that the Senator was chosen because he [...] "has a lot of <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> fix Washington and make America better". Prior to the event, in the beginning of February, Bayh made an appearance at the Congressional Black Caucus political action committee, spoke to the United Auto Workers conference, and made a trip back to Iowa for a plethora of events during the February 11–13 weekend. By {{the end of the month}} and into March, Bayh criticized the Bush administration from the right, attempting to appeal to all segments of the political spectrum by speaking out against the plan to sell American ports to United Arab Emirates companies.|$|E

[...] In contrast, the [...] "realized niche", was described as all of the places a species actually did occupy, and was expected to be less than the extent of the fundamental niche as a result of competition with other species. [...] However, the source-sink model demonstrated that the majority of a population could occupy a sink which, by definition, did not meet the niche requirements of the species, and was therefore outside the fundamental niche (see Figure 2).

2500|$|Allenby was {{promoted}} to temporary lieutenant general on 10 October 1914. As the BEF was expanded in size to two Armies, he was rewarded by being made commander of the Cavalry Corps. On 6 May 1915, Allenby voluntarily left the Cavalry Arm to take up command of V Corps which was engaged at that moment in severe fighting at the Second Battle of Ypres. Commanding a corps seemed to make Allenby's bad temper even worse where anything from a split infinitive in a staff paper to discovering a corpse in the field without the tin helmet that Allenby ordered his men to wear sent Allenby off into a rage. The V Corps was victorious in defeating the German assault but incurred controversially heavy losses in the process through Allenby's tactical policy of continual counter-attacks at the German attacking force. In September 1915, V Corps attempted a diversion of German strength to facilitate the concurrent British offensive at Loos. They executed a minor attack in the Hooge Sector in the Ypres Salient under Allenby's direction, which once again incurred substantial losses to its units involved in the affair. In October 1915, Allenby {{was promoted}} to lead the British Third Army, being made lieutenant-general (substantive rank) on 1 January 1916. In mid-Summer 1916, he was the Army Commander {{in support of the}} launch of the Battle of the Somme offensive, with responsibility for the abortive assault by 3rd Army troops on the trench fortress of the Gommecourt salient, which failed with severe casualties to the units under his command in the operation. By this time in 1916, Archibald Wavell who was one of Allenby's staff officers and supporters, wrote that Allenby's temper seemed to [...] "confirm the legend that 'the Bull' was merely a bad-tempered, obstinate hot-head, a 'thud-and-blunder' general". Allenby harboured doubts about the leadership of the commander of the BEF, General Sir Douglas Haig, but refused to allow any of his officers to say anything critical about Haig. However, despite Allenby's rages and obsession with applying the rules in a way that often seemed petty, Allenby's staff officers found an intellectually curious general who was interested in finding new ways of breaking the stalemate. J. F. C. Fuller called Allenby [...] "a man I grew to like and respect", a man who always asked his staff if they had any new <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> win the war. Allenby had wider interests than many other British generals, reading books on every conceivable subject from botany to poetry and was noted for his critical intellect.
