40|$|Vanilla is tropic {{plant that}} has high {{economic}} value. Indonesian vanilla {{is the most}} popular because of vanillin content. Vanillin is the major of flavor compound in vanilla. Vanillin is formed during processing fresh to <b>dry</b> <b>vanilla</b> benas. Decreasing vanillin content and moisture content of <b>dry</b> <b>vanilla</b> beans during storage cause degradation of quality. The objective of this research was determined permeability of plastic packaging, the kinetic of quality degradation of <b>dry</b> <b>vanilla</b> beans were packaged all types of plastic during the storage, and predicted <b>dry</b> <b>vanilla</b> shelf-life. In this research classified for 3 steps, determined water vapour permeability of plastic, the kinetic of quality degradation of <b>dry</b> <b>vanilla</b> beans during the storage, and determined <b>dry</b> <b>vanilla</b> shelf-life. Result value was analyzed descriptively. The result of research showed that permeability of polipropilen 0, 08 mm was 0, 4 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg and permeability of polipropilen 0, 03 mm was 0, 675 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. But permeability of polietilen 0, 08 mm was 0, 46 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg and permeability of polietilen 0, 03 mm was 0, 795 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. In the other, permeability of zaack plastic was 8, 14 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. Polipropilen was the most because vanilin content changes was longest time among polietilen and zaack plastic packages, for this reason the stability of vanilla beans quality could be controlled. Polipropilen plastic has Ea = 8 Kal/mol K with A value = 16085, 93; polietilen plastic has Ea = 7, 89 Kal/mol K with A value = 14433, 30; and bagor plastic has Ea = 7, 64 Kal/mol K with A value = 10544, 9. The shelf life of vanilla beans that packaged with Polipropilen was 47 days, polietilen for 44 days, and zaack plastic for 43 days.

40|$|Modified {{cured vanilla}} was {{processed}} to vanilla extract by maceration method. The {{aim of this}} research were to optimize the method of maceration, type of vanilla bean with highest vanillin content, extraction solvent composition,and other variables that could optimize the vanillin content and characterize the extract from half <b>dried</b> cured <b>vanilla.</b> The optimation used response surface method with 22 factorial and 23 factorial. One step of maceration could extract vanillin (average 2. 3 g/l) much more than two steps maceration (average 2. 1 g/l). Vanillin content of the half <b>dried</b> cured <b>vanilla</b> (average 0. 98 g/l) was higher than cured vanilla 1 and cured vanilla 2 (average 0. 41 g/l and 0. 32 g/l). The suitable ethanol-water composition for half <b>dried</b> cured <b>vanilla</b> was 7 : 3 (vanillin content 1. 78 g/l). The first optimation was conducted with two variables maceration time and sucrose concentrations. The maximum vanillin content of the first optimation was 4. 5 g/l at maceration time of 15. 9 days and sucrose concentration of 7. 3 g. The second optimation used two variables: maceration time and glycerol concentrations. The maximum vanillin content of the second optimation was 3. 8 g/l at maceration time of 22 days and glycerol concentration 19. 9 ml. The third optimation process used three variables:maceration time, sucrose concentrations and glycerol concentrations. The maximum vanillin content of the third optimation was 3. 4 g/l at maceration time of 12 days sucrose concentration of 7 g, and glycerol concentration 4. 7 ml.

Aroma and taste in vanilla extract depend on variety of plants, {{cultivation}} methods, and curing process. Indonesian vanilla extract tend to give woody and phenolic aroma {{because it was}} harvested too early {{and it did not}} cure perfectly. This study was to identify the physicochemical and aroma characteristics of vanilla extracts from importer, exporter, and vanilla extracts from the newest experiment from our laboratory. There were seven samples, three from importers (Tahiti grade I, Tahiti grade II, Virginia Dare), two from Indonesian Vanilla exporters (Djasula Wangi, Cobra), and two from our laboratory (G 11, 57). The physicochemical characteristics which were analyzed were vanillin content, ash, soluble ash, alkalinity of soluble ash, alkalinity of total ash, total acidity, and lead number, all compared with the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) standard. Sensory analysis used aroma description test consist of qualitative descriptive test (in-depth interview and focus group methods) and quantitative descriptive analysis. The result showed that the laboratory's sample from modified curing process (G 11) followed the FDA standard in physicochemical characters, but the aroma description was not as strong as the aroma of vanilla extract from exporters, namely Cobra with creamy, sweet, and vanilla aroma; and vanilla extract from importer, namely Virginia with smoky and spicy arom...|$|R
30|$|Vanilla is a {{tropical}} orchid, which originated in Mexico (Lubinsky et al. 2008). It {{is one of}} the most important and popular aromatic compound used in food, beverages, and cosmetics (Kaur and Chakraborty 2013; Korthou and Verpoorte 2007). The fruit of a fully grown and mature vanilla is called vanilla pod. Vanilla pods are flavorless, but develop a characteristic aroma during the curing process. Traditional curing process generally comprises four steps, namely killing, sweating, <b>drying,</b> and conditioning. <b>Vanilla</b> bean refers to the vanilla pod after the curing process (Frenkel et al. 2011; Mariezcurrena et al. 2008; Sreedhar et al. 2009).|$|R

Through the “Pacific Horticultural and Agricultural Market Access” programme of Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC-PHAMA), the project aimed at developing shelf stable vanilla bean pastes for human consumption {{with the use of}} <b>dried</b> <b>vanilla</b> beans sourced and cultivated at the Spices of Fiji plantation. Ten (10) prototypes of SpiceFiji vanilla bean paste were formulated, chemically and microbiology tested and evaluated through descriptive profiling and consumer acceptance test that helped determined the final product formulation. Two popular commercial vanilla bean pastes (Com 1 and Com 2) were used as comparison in the identification and determination of the degree of consumer acceptability of two vanilla bean paste finalists SpiceFiji (SpiceFiji 1 and SpiceFiji 2). Overall, results revealed that the newly developed vanilla bean paste SpiceFiji 1 ranked first, followed by SpiceFiji 2 as second and then followed by vanilla pastes of the two competitors brands (Com 1 and Com 2). The differences observed between the four vanilla pastes on appearance, colour, aroma, flavour, texture and aftertaste revealed a highly significant difference (P < 0. 001) using Kruskal Wallis test. SpiceFiji 1 outperformed the Com 1 brand on five sensory attributes, i. e. appearance (P < 0. 05), colour (P < 0. 01), flavour (P < 0. 001), texture (P < 0. 001) and aftertaste (P < 0. 001) which were highly significant. Aroma was the only sensory attribute that showed no significant difference between SpiceFiji 1 and Com 1 which may be interpreted as similarity in aroma. Similarly, when SpiceFiji 1 was compared with Com 2, all of the sensory attributes showed a highly significant difference (P < 0. 001) revealing superiority of SpiceFiji 1 over Com 2. Microbial tests and other tests that verified the safety of vanilla bean pastes for human consumption confirmed their stability and shelf life of 24 months. The data gathered and the success of this project proved the greater potential in developing world-class products from home grown crops in Fiji. However, strengthening collaboration with government and academic institutions in the realization of their role in producing skilled and knowledge workers in the area of food product {{development and}} food engineering is critical in enhancing import substitution drive of healthy processed foods to fill our local supermarket shelves enabling self –sustainable approach and independence...|$|R
40|$|The drying and {{fermentation}} are {{the processing}} steps which influence {{the quality of}} vanilla. Thus, an effort to produce instrument which can <b>dry</b> and ferment <b>vanilla</b> by turns automatically was done. Based on the test result on the instrument, it was known that the heater and heat-exchanger can function excellently. It {{can be seen from}} the increase of temperature after passing heater and heat-exchanger; and the decrease of air humidity in the drying chamber. The small differences of air flow speed between racks proved the uniformity of air flow speed in the drying chamber. The time and temperature control system showed temperature stability on drying process (i. e. 60 °C) and on fermentation process (i. e. 40 °C); moreover, temperature response reached 60 °C and did not exceed the setting time (maximum 30 minutes). The water percentage depletion from 88 % to 55 % is relatively slow (in 5 days fermentation-drying process). The depletion is appropriate with the recommendation for fermentation-drying vanilla processing...|$|R
40|$|The astonishingly {{high value}} and low bulk of most spices {{have made them}} ideal cash crops. But the market {{for many of the}} world's major spices is now grossly oversupplied: it is understood, for instance, that in 1990, Madagascar alone held enough unsold stocks of vanilla to meet total world {{consumption}} for up to three years. The resulting crisis in export prices has focused attention on meeting the requirements for home consumption and on products whose quality characteristics are associated with particular countries of origin. Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is now the world's most heavily traded spice. It has a long history and is known to have been grown as early as 3, 000 years BC, when it was used to preserve and season meat. It still has a high value relative to other crops, but its price is continuing to fall and is now at a record low. Three years ago black pepper sold for US$ 2, 428 /t on the US market. By 1991 the value had nearly halved and, by mid 1992, prices had fallen still further to under US$ 1, 000 /t. Falling prices on world commodity markets for a spice which is mainly supplied by countries in Asia and South America may seem to be of little concern to people in ACP countries. However, while pepper may be relatively unimportant in gross economic terms, it does have considerable importance to many countries which are minor suppliers to the world market, such as Kenya and Madagascar, and to individual growers throughout the tropics who are growing on a small scale for local consumption. Furthermore, what is happening to pepper prices is also happening to cloves, vanilla and cardamom and, in some regions, to ginger. Buyers will pay well for the specific characteristics of a particular country of origin. Jamaican ginger (Zingiber officinale), for example, was fetching US$ 4. 95 per pound on the US market in early 1992 compared with the less highly favoured Nigerian ginger at US$ 0. 54 per pound. So, for those producers who can supply small quantities of very high quality product with specific and desirable characteristics there are opportunities in the spice industry. Since spice production does not necessarily depend on high technology, heavy investment or complicated production processes, opportunities are open to the very smallest producers in the most remote and isolated parts of the world. Why prices are low So why have prices fallen so dramatically? The answers vary according to the spice, but the main reason is that the growth potential in the spice market was fully exploited in the 1960 s and 70 s. Then, high prices continued to tempt new growers, many often anxious to diversify production from other crops. National governments, ever mindful of the need for foreign exchange, have done nothing to discourage them, although it could be added that many have failed to do much to support their growers' entrepreneurial efforts. High prices in the mid- 1980 s encouraged new plantings of pepper in many countries. Those pepper vines are now reaching their maximum bearing age and are producing more pepper worldwide than consumers can use. The market in cloves (Syzygium aromaticum) is also suffering from over-production. New York spot prices for Madagascan and Tanzanian cloves had fallen to US$ 0. 80 per pound in March 1992, compared with prices a decade ago of over US$ 5 per pound. This is largely because Indonesia, which used to import vast quantities from these countries for the manufacture of their 'Kretek' cigarettes is now not only self-sufficient in cloves but has a large surplus. It is estimated that between 80, 000 and 90, 000 t annually are used in the Indonesian cigarette industry. This is a major loss to traditional producing nations which have no hope of being able to sell production at this level elsewhere. There is a market for smaller quantities in India and Saudi Arabia but the US and European markets are tiny, and in any case, Penang cloves are preferred. Meanwhile, in Madagascar, clove trees are being used for firewood. The international political situation has also affected the world spice trade. The Gulf War has interrupted sales of cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) to Kuwait and Iraq, the principal importing consumers of this spice. The break-up of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the changes in eastern Europe have left the economies of those countries weak. Their imports of spices, traditionally supplied by India, have fallen heavily and this leaves {{the rest of the world}} with yet more over-production. As if problems on an international scale were not enough, problems on a national scale can be equally devastating. Vanilla is important to Madagascar, accounting for 25 % of its foreign exchange earnings and employing some 60, 000 producers, but burdened with unsold stocks, some smaller producers are forced to pull out their vanilla in order to grow rice to eat. Others are simply exchanging their harvested vanilla beans for a few litres of petrol, for soap or for plastic shoes, because, only one planter in ten is receiving the official price for his produce. In 1990 Madagascar produced a further 800 t of vanilla to add to its 4, 000 t of unsold stocks, the equivalent of two to three years' total world consumption. Marketing agreements Each year the organization of vanilla producing countries (Collège de I'Océan Indien) which comprises Madagascar, Comoros and Reunion, negotiates a globe I quota with the main importing countries, in particular USA and France. In 1990 this was fixed at 744 t from Madagascar, 155 t from Comoros and 20 t from Reunion. This system has been in operation for nearly 30 years. In 1990 the price per kg of <b>dried</b> <b>vanilla</b> pods was fixed at US$ 74. But Indonesia, which is not a member of the cartel, is now selling vanilla at US$ 50 /kg and has succeeded in capturing 35 % of the American market. This blows a very chill wind indeed across the Indian ocean and it is hard to see how Madagascar can respond to this challenge. The Comoros, equally vulnerable to the competition from Indonesia, have taken a different approach to Madagascar and have abolished the state marketing board. This was set up to protect the industry from fluctuating world prices and changes in the dollar rate, but it proved ineffective and its abolition has been widely welcomed. This measure, together with the change in fiscal policy to reduce export tax on vanilla, a move it has financed by increasing the import tax on tobacco, has made Comorien vanilla producers jubilant. However, there seems little doubt that the move will bring about increased production for a nonexpanding market and therefore the probability of falling prices. Vanilla from Comoros, like that from other small producing nations such as Mauritius or certain South Pacific islands, including Tonga and Vanuatu, may continue to hold its price if buyers are convinced that they are getting a better product. Those wishing to attract premium prices will have to ensure that high quality standards are maintained and that they do not over-produce. Producers are no doubt watching the trade figures. US imports (by tonnage) of Madagascan vanilla had dropped by 1990 to 59 % of the 1986 total. Meanwhile imports from Indonesia had risen over the same period by 57 % and vanilla from Comoros rose by 20 %. Total imports into France from Madagascar, Comoros and Reunion fell to 430 % of the 1986 levels whereas imports from Indonesia rose from 1 ton in 1986 to 44 tons in 1990, contributing just over half the total volume of French imports. At least producers of high quality vanilla are not directly threatened by vanillin, the artificial vanilla. This is not just because it is suitable only for the lower end of the market but because there is an increasing demand for natural flavourings. 'Natural' is often perceived to be better than 'artificial', regardless of any scientific justification for this view. Despite this, 90 % of US imports of vanilla flavourings are satisfied by vanillin and other synthetic vanilla products. Manufacturers who merely require a 'natural flavouring' label on their produce, as opposed to the high quality flavour itself, can achieve this by using the cheaper Indonesian product. Indonesia is now the major producer of nutmegs, although Grenada in the West Indies produces about 25 % of world exports. Here again there are problems of over-production and falling prices. There have been attempts to limit production and put a brake on the downward price trend and Indonesia and Grenada have now set up a joint marketing venture with a Dutch company to coordinate international sales of nutmeg and mace. The Netherlands is a major reexporter of nutmeg. Exports of Grenadian nutmegs fell 20 % during 1990 / 91 whereas exports from Indonesia doubled. Even though West Indian nutmegs fetch as much as four times the price of those from Indonesia, their higher oil content makes some processing difficult and this reduces marketing opportunities for the raw spice. However, Grenada is planning to open a nutmeg oil distillery and this may go some way towards alleviating the problem of over-production. Local marketing initiatives within Grenada have linked spices with another major industry, tourism. Small-scale processing of nutmeg, for example, into nutmeg syrup and jam, and other spice products such as chutneys and preserves, make attractive gifts for tourists to take home. Such enterprises are valuable but are not likely to solve the problem of over-production Outlook for spices The outlook for these major spices is not encouraging, but there are other spices which may be more promising. Chilli and paprika peppers are doing well. This has been good news for Papua New Guinea and it seems there is room for more growth. The market for cassia and cinnamon remains steady because of the demand for cola drinks in which they are used as flavouring. Allspice (pimento) is in short supply and prices have therefore risen. Those spices which|$|R
