40|$|In {{this thesis}} I study {{the impact of}} physically-backed {{precious}} metal ETPs on the related precious metal prices. I focus on gold, silver, palladium and platinum as they attract majority of the physically-backed ETP assets. Previous research has focused mainly on the {{on the impact of}} speculators' derivatives positions, so this thesis is among the first ones to study the purchases and sales of ETPs in the commodity spot market. The thesis contributes to the heated debate on the increased amount of speculators in the commodity markets described as the financialization of the commodity markets. The data set consists of daily net changes in the precious metal ETP holdings and the related precious metal spot prices from 25 April 2007 to 24 January 2014. I study the relationship between ETP holdings and the related spot prices through hypothesis testing and employ Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron unit root tests, Johansen test for cointegration, Granger-causality test, and OLS-regression. For robustness, I use two different lag selection criteria (Akaike information criterion and Schwarz criterion) and two time periods. The regression model is tested for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. The empirical results show that the precious metal ETP holdings and the related spot prices are not cointegrated supporting the previous research. This implies {{that there is not a}} long-term equilibrium that would avoid these two from drifting apart from each other. I also find only weak evidence supporting the causal relationship of the ETP holdings and the related spot prices. The changes in <b>gold</b> ETP <b>holdings</b> Granger-cause <b>gold</b> spot price in the post-crisis period. For the full-sample period and for the rest of the metals I find no evidence on causality. On the contemporaneous relationship I find new evidence. The OLS-regression results show that the daily net changes in <b>gold</b> ETP <b>holdings</b> have an immediate impact on gold spot price. An increase/decrease in <b>gold</b> ETP <b>holdings</b> increases/decreases the <b>gold</b> spot price. The impact is strongest on the concurrent day but proves significant for the subsequent day also. The regression results for the rest of the metals are similar but statistically insignificant. My findings for gold suggest that the commodity prices are no longer simply determined by their true supply and demand. Instead, financial innovations such as physically-backed ETPs may play an important role in the price determination if they grow large enough in relative to the size of the market...|$|R
40|$|The {{downward}} {{movement in the}} total <b>gold</b> and dollar <b>holdings</b> of foreign countries that began in mid- 1951 was reversed during {{the early part of}} 1952. At {{the end of the year}} these holdings were 1. 2 billion dollars larger than a year earlier. The improvement resulted primarily from a substantial reduction in the United States export surplus, as exports declined and imports of goods and services increased. Loans and grants from the United States Government to foreign countries declined somewhat and the flow of private capital abroad remained near its 1951 level. Renewed progress toward monetary stability in most countries helped to bring about the upward movement in foreign reserves. This movement also reflected improved supply conditions abroad and, in some countries, tightening of import restrictions on goods from the dollar area. Total <b>gold</b> and dollar <b>holdings</b> of foreign countries, after falling 900 million dollars during the second half of 1951, declined a further 250 million in the first quarter of 1952. During the rest of the year holdings rose nearly 1. 5 billion dollars, and the increase has continued in 1953. The recovery in foreign reserves in 1952 took the form of increases in dollar holdings, the bulk of which was invested in United States Government securities.

50|$|Internationally, gold is traded {{primarily}} via over-the-counter (OTC) transactions {{with limited}} amounts {{trading on the}} New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM). These forward contracts are known as gold futures contracts. Spot gold is traded for settlement two business days following the trade date, with a business day defined as a day when both the New York and London markets are open for business. Unlike many commodity markets, the forward market for gold is driven by spot prices and interest rate differentials, similar to foreign exchange markets, rather than underlying supply and demand dynamics. This is because gold, like currencies, is borrowed and lent by central banks and in the interbank market. Interest rates for gold tend to be lower than US domestic interest rates. This encourages gold borrowings so that central banks can earn interest on their large <b>gold</b> <b>holdings.</b> Except in special circumstances the gold market tends to be in positive contango, i.e. the forward price of gold {{is higher than the}} spot price. Historically this has made it an attractive market for forward sales by gold producers and contributed to an active and relatively liquid derivatives market.|$|E

Stewart, a Canadian-Swiss dual {{citizen and}} {{graduate}} of the University of Manitoba {{who had worked with}} Canada's foreign service in Africa for seven years before entering the private sector on African mining and petroleum projects, served as a consultant for the American engineering firm Bechtel International Corporation and drafted Bechtel's $5 bn. reconstruction plan for the DRC known as [...] "An Approach to National Development. Democratic Republic of Congo". [...] The Bechtel plan was presented to the Congolese government in November 1997 and centred on natural resource-based partnerships in copper and cobalt, diamonds, tin, gold in the east of the country, along with hydro-electric development, forestry, oil and agriculture elsewhere. [...] The Congolese government rejected the Bechtel proposal, devising its own three-year development plan, which it brought to a World Bank-sponsored [...] "Friends of the Congo" [...] meeting of seventeen countries as well as international institutions in Brussels in December 1997; donors pledged to commit $450m. of the $575m. that the DRC team was requesting from them, out of a total plan budgeted at $1.7bn. [...] Also present at the December 1997 meeting in Brussels were the Canadian-registered mining companies Barrick Gold, America Mineral Fields, Tenke Mining, and International Panorama Resource Corp. [...] In 1997, Stewart also became advisor, and then briefly in 1998, chairman of America Mineral Fields Inc., a company headquartered in Arizona, U.S.A., but incorporated in Canada (renamed Adastra Minerals Inc. in 2004).

[...] At the Non-Aligned Movement summit in South Africa in September 1998, Stewart was identified as an advisor to the Council of the Federal Democratic Republic of Congo, a group of exiled Congolese technocrats that sought to restore democracy in their country, and Stewart claimed that a relative of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe had been granted Stewart's DRC mining concessions. [...] While Stewart claimed at this meeting that President Kabila had [...] "asked Mineral Fields for bribes", American Mineral Fields denied this, adding that Stewart was dismissed shortly following his appointment.
