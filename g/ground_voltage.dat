40|$|Abstract—With the {{technology}} {{moving into the}} deep sub- 100 -nm region, the increase of leakage power consumption necessitates more aggressive power reduction techniques. Power gating is a promising technique. Our research emphasizes that with the latest and future technologies, power gating operates frequently in its transition mode, especially for aggressive leakage reduction. The dynamic characteristics of power gating during its mode transition is critical for making design decision. Hence we derive a fast, accurate, and temperature-aware model to characterize the dynamic behavior of power gating during mode transition. The applications of this model include the estimation of several key design parameters for power gating, such as dynamic virtual <b>ground</b> <b>voltage,</b> dynamic leakage variation and energy break-even time. It provides an efficient estimation engine for power gating design optimization. The accuracy of the model has been verified by extensive HSPICE experiments. The model is computationally efficient due to the usage of various approximation methods.

Previous works, however, assume {{the availability of a}} single virtual <b>ground</b> <b>voltage,</b> thus making the decision of whether to gate or not a given cluster a binary choice: a cluster is either gated or not. In this work, we consider a limited set of virtual ground voltages, which allows us to assign to a cluster the virtual <b>ground</b> <b>voltage</b> that offers the best leakage-performance tradeoff for that cluster. We propose two algorithms for solving two power-gating variants: one in which the entire design is gated (given an allowable delay degradation), and another one in which only a subset of the rows is gated (given an allowable delay degradation and sleep transistor area). Our algorithm automatically finds the set of clusters with optimal virtual ground voltages so as to minimize leakage while respecting timing and area constraints. The number of power-gating domains can be user-bounded, in accordance with power grid or library characterization limitations.
