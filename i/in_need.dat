5|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, Cedar Point was <b>in</b> <b>need</b> of {{financial}} help. The wood of the Cyclone roller coaster was rotting, the boardwalk was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock was <b>in</b> <b>need</b> of repair. In 1946, Cedar Point's oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957, and is still in use. The president of Cedar Point, Bernie Zeiher, was replaced by George Roose around 1958, and Emile Legros was elected chairman that same year.|$|E

The thesis then analyzes the method of assessing the state of material need and the individual benefits from the system of assistance <b>in</b> material <b>need.</b> <b>In</b> the analysis the elements further marked as motivational elements are described. Subsequently the thesis explains the addiction to benefits of assistance <b>in</b> material <b>need</b> and the sources of dependence on welfare benefits. In conclusion motivation elements of system of assistance <b>in</b> material <b>need</b> are demonstrated by comparing their stance before year 2012 with the year after and by comparing present motivation elements with sources of social welfare models...|$|R
