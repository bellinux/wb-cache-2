40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the evidence {{on the distribution of}} income in the Netherlands by constructing decile and quintile income shares for gross- and for <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> covering almost the entire twentieth century. It suggests some interpretations of the general trends, while the cyclical properties of the Dutch income distribution are empirically investigated through time-series analysis. It shows that income inequality experienced a marked decrease over the period 1914 – 1975, but remained stable ever since. Since the observed dynamics are notably different between <b>gross</b> and <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> taxation and redistribution played an influential role in determining the income distribution. More unemployment is associated with more income inequality in gross income, but this association vanishes when the distribution of <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> is concerned. Actual inflation does not have a strong effect on the size distribution of <b>gross</b> or <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> but speculation that a transitory increase in inflation reduces the income inequality seems justified (cyclical economic prosperity being pro-poor).

40|$|It is {{commonly}} argued that high tax rates motivate individuals {{to start a}} business as it is easier to avoid and evade taxes if self-employed compared to employed. If this is the case we would expect small business owners to be more responsive to tax rate changes than employees. This study investigates how responsive existing small business owners are to tax rate changes by estimating the elasticities of taxable income, gross income and reported income from business ventures for small business owners and contrast them to corresponding elasticities for employees. This is done by using a particularly rich Swedish data set and the 1990 / 91 Swedish tax reform as a “natural experiment”. I find that small business owners’ taxable income is about twice as responsive to tax rate changes than employees’. When it comes to reported income from business ventures the difference between small business owners and employees are even greater. For <b>gross</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> however, business owners are not more responsive. This is consistent with the hypothesis that small business owners have greater means to shift income between different income sources in order to avoid taxation.

In the thesis were used time series analysis and measurement of dependence between two quantities. The development of terms of trade indices was highly variable, and the resulting models do not describe too much variability.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the rates of}} poverty and inequality in Israel over time and in comparison with other OECD countries. It looks at two main groups: those aged 59 and under and those aged 66 and over. In the age 59 and under population, Israel's poverty and inequality rates are among the highest relative to other developed countries in both market income (household income from work, occupational pensions and capital, before taxes) and <b>gross</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> (including transfer payments) minus taxes. From 2002 - 2011, employment rates among the population in Israel rose, leading {{to a reduction in}} market income inequality (though this was not accompanied by a substantial decline in poverty rates). Disposable income inequality rates rose until 2006 and have since stabilized, while poverty rates have increased fairly consistently, especially among Arab Israelis and Haredim. Among the retirement-age population, disposable income poverty rates are substantially higher than in OECD countries. Nevertheless, the overall resources (public and private pension arrangements) that are available to the elderly, place Israel in a relatively good position among the developed countries. That is, the level of public and private pensions is not low compared {{to the rest of the}} world, but its distribution among the elderly is not equitable. The relative tax revenues in Israel are among the lowest in the Western world, and this is one of the reasons that the average overall public expenditure is relatively low.

40|$|The main aim of {{the paper}} is an {{investigation}} whether consumer tendency survey (CTS) data can be useful for short-term forecasting of real private consumption expenditures in Poland. A consumer sentiment index and as well balances for individual questions (from consumer survey conducted by Research Institute for Economic Development of Warsaw School of Economics – RIED WSE) {{were used in the}} paper. This {{is one of the first}} attempts to model private consumption using RIED consumer survey data or even generally any consumer survey data in Poland. The data are quarterly and covers the 1996 - 2007 period. An investigation of predictive relationship between CTS results and real private consumption was done by using in-sample and out-of-sample approach. Under the first one unconditional and conditional causality analysis was performed. Unconditional approach is a standard bivariate Granger causality test, where appropriate pairs of variables were tested: real private consumption expenditures and particular CTS indicators. In the case of conditional Granger causality test aside from consumer survey results other macro variables were used, i. e. : lagged dependent variable, real <b>gross</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> of households, net financial assets of households, retail sales and wage-pension fund. It was realized by doing redundancy tests for survey indices in ARMAX equation specified for consumption expenditures and other variables mentioned above. The research is also extended by assessing whether this predictive in-sample conditional relationship has changed over time by running a series of recursive regressions and doing tests outlined above. The out-of-sample analysis focused on testing recursive one-step forecast errors of restricted (without CTS variables) and unrestricted ARMAX models. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose to}} {{estimate}} the economic cost for Palestine and for Palestinian residents {{due to the lack}} of peaceful resolution with Israel. Thereto we make use of the consensus estimates of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) of real growth rates of economic variables and of the nominal national accounts for Palestine over the period 1994 - 2006. We identify four periods: 1994 - 1999 with high real growth rates of gross domestic product (GDP) and of gross national income (GNI); 2000 - 2002 with a strong decline; 2003 - 2005 with a modest growth; and 2006 with a renewed decline. We derive the real national accounts (prices 1999) for the end years: 1999, 2002 and 2005. It follows that over 2000 - 2002 the real GDP declined by 27. 5 %; GNI by almost one third; but that real <b>gross</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> (GDI) “only” declined by 11. 3 %; and that over 2000 - 2005 the declines were 13. 8 % (GDP); about 20 %(GNI); and 2. 9 % (GDI), respectively. Consequently, in 2005, the year preceding the renewed isolation of Palestine, real GDP, GNI and GDI were still below their 1999 level. Based on the modest growth scenario of IMF and WB (3 % real growth and 3 % price increase) we estimate that over the period 2000 - 2002 the cost for Palestine, measured in terms of nominal GNI, was equal to the GNI of 1999 (5. 5 billion US$), and over 2000 - 2005 to two-and-a-half times the 1999 GNI. Based on the same growth scenario, we estimate the loss for a Palestinian resident, measured in terms of nominal GDI per capita, to be 30 % of the 1999 level by the end of 2002 and 25 % by the end of 2005...|$|E
40|$|The article {{begins by}} {{establishing}} that {{the share of}} wages in GDP has declined quite sharply in Belgium {{over the past five}} years. The fall in the wage share in 2003 - 2005 was due partly to the deteriorating economic conditions {{at the beginning of this}} century. It can also be seen as a continuation of the decline which started in the early 1980 s, attributable to structural developments such as globalisation, technological progress and the growing importance of the services sector. However, the downward trend in the total disposable income of individuals as a percentage of GDP is due mainly to the reduction in their net interest income, which is in turn attributable to falling interest rates. In absolute terms, however, the disposable income of individuals has risen, even if inflation is taken into account. The main effect of the reduction in the <b>gross</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> of individuals in relation to GDP has been to cut the savings ratio, as consumption expenditure has only fallen slightly as a percentage of GDP. Moreover, since 2004 individuals’ investment spending has surged, reducing their financing balance to less than 1 p. c. of GDP. The primary counterpart of the recent contraction of the wage share has been the strong rise in the gross operating surplus of companies. On the other hand, companies have also paid more taxes on income and wealth, made higher net dividend payments to other sectors, and invested more in fixed assets. Nonetheless, the financing balance of companies has risen steadily, reaching an average of 2. 4 p. c. of GDP in the past three years, so that they have been able to move gradually towards financing more of their investment out of internal resources, thus further consolidating their balance sheets. wage share, operating surplus, disposable income, financing balance...|$|E
