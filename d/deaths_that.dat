5|$|After {{moving slowly}} through the Caribbean Sea, Charley crossed Cuba on Friday, August 13 as a Category 3 hurricane, causing heavy damage and four <b>deaths.</b> <b>That</b> same day, it crossed over the Dry Tortugas, just 22hours after Tropical Storm Bonnie had struck northwestern Florida.

5|$|In 2013 {{the road}} {{was one of three}} that tied for the #1 ranking on the Tri-State Transportation Campaign's list of the top ten most {{dangerous}} roads for pedestrians in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. The route, along with U.S. Route 40/U.S. Route 322 in Atlantic County and U.S. Route 1 in Middlesex County, were so ranked due to the nine pedestrian <b>deaths</b> <b>that</b> occurred on each of those roads from 2009 to 2011.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a series of <b>deaths</b> <b>that</b> occur immediately after an ancient artifact is brought to Boston from an excavation site in South America. According to Scully, the deaths {{appear to be the}} result of political terrorism, but Mulder suspects something more improbable.|$|E
5|$|MS is {{the most}} common {{autoimmune}} disorder of the central nervous system. As of 2010, the number of people with MS was 2â€“2.5 million (approximately 30 per 100,000) globally, with rates varying widely in different regions. It is estimated to have resulted in 18,000 <b>deaths</b> <b>that</b> year. In Africa rates are less than 0.5 per 100,000, while they are 2.8 per 100,000 in South East Asia, 8.3 per 100,000 in the Americas, and 80 per 100,000 in Europe. Rates surpass 200 per 100,000 in certain populations of Northern European descent. The number of new cases that develop per year is about 2.5 per 100,000.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so {{within minutes of}} the injury, due to {{complications}} such as pneumothorax and insufficient airway and to other injuries that occurred at the same time. Most late <b>deaths</b> <b>that</b> occur in TBI are attributed to sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If the condition is not recognized and treated early, serious complications {{are more likely to}} occur; for example, pneumonia and bronchiectasis may occur as late complications. Years can pass before the condition is recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E

5|$|Not {{included}} in the official number of fatalities were <b>deaths</b> <b>that</b> were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning (brought on {{by the use of}} gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims. The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached , enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases. A total of 42workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.|$|E
5|$|The UK Anime Network had Andy Hanley {{review the}} first four episodes and he {{expressed}} a much more positive outlook than previous reviewers. Hanley wrote about how fast the series was in setting up its premise and described it as an in at the deep end experience. Hanley cited the ruination of Tokyo {{at the end of}} the first episode and the countless <b>deaths</b> <b>that</b> occur by episode four to support this. Hanley argued that while this pace leaves the series open to being labelled as shallow, it's actually very effective in keeping the viewer engaged.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how effectively the edict was enforced. Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets. The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains), widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps {{within a year of}} the edict's issue. Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the <b>deaths</b> <b>that</b> came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic, and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.|$|E

5|$|Daisy re-strengthened into a Category2 {{later on}} October6, and peaked with winds of 110mph (175km/h). The outerbands of Daisy {{produced}} strong winds and heavy surf in Bermuda, but caused no damage. It weakened {{back to a}} Category1 again on October7. While passing offshore New England, the storm, combined with a nor'easter, produced flooding and strong winds. Two fatalities were {{directly related to the}} hurricane, and 24other people died in traffic related <b>deaths,</b> <b>that</b> were caused by slick roads from the heavy rain. Total damage in New England was estimated to be over $1.1million (1962USD). Early on October8, Daisy made landfall near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, several hours before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. In Atlantic Canada, the storm brought rough seas, causing coastal flooding and six fatalities in Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Ewiniar {{killed at}} least 34people in China, with areas as far {{northwest}} as Gansu and Shanxi affected by landslides. It is not known if the landslides were triggered directly {{as a result of}} Ewiniar, or whether it was caused by a combination of Ewiniar and other weather. Therefore, the <b>deaths</b> <b>that</b> can be attributed to Ewiniar from the landslides are assumed to be indirectly caused, and not directly. Average rainfall reported in Shandong was 3.4mm (0.133inches) per hour from 6a.m. July 9 through midnight July 10 (totalling about 61.2mm or 2.4inches). At least 300 flights out of Beijing's Capital International Airport had to be delayed due to thunderstorms and effects of Ewiniar, while Air China and China Eastern Airlines cancelled flights to South Korea heading out of China. As Ewiniar did not affect the mainland directly, there are little to no reports of major damage.|$|E
5|$|Worried by the events, the {{hospital}} coordinator, Dr. Theresa Shannon, tells Mulder and Scully about a similar series of <b>deaths</b> <b>that</b> {{occurred at the}} same hospital ten years prior. They suspect Rebecca Waite (O-Lan Jones), a nurse who {{is the only person}} present at all the death scenes. The agents visit Waite's house, discovering evidence that she practices witchcraft; however, the audience learns that the evidence was planted there by a staff member of {{the hospital}}. Elsewhere, Dr. Jack Franklin (Richard Beymer) is non-fatally assaulted by Waite at his house. There, Waite is arrested and approached by the agents, who attempt to question Waite but are prevented when she starts to vomit pins, dying shortly thereafter. After the incident, Mulder visits Dr. Jack Franklin, hoping to learn more about Waite's possible motivation. Although Franklin is seemingly innocent, when Mulder leaves the room, he begins to levitate and devilishly smile. Later that night, Mulder deduces that the birthdays of all the victims match up with the dates of the Witches' Sabbath and that Waite was actually trying to protect the victims from Dr. Jack Franklin (she had placed the pentagramsactually protective symbolson and around the victims in the hopes of protecting them from dark magic). This also explains why Waite tried to kill Franklin. Unfortunately, Mulder also realizes that because Waite was not the murderer, the spree of murders will continue. And as he suspected, another patient is murdered with acid back at the hospital.|$|E
