5|$|Dorset South was {{the most}} {{marginal}} Labour seat in the 2001 general election, won by 153 votes. Jim Knight was expecting to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> 2005 election, yet he won with a margin of 1,812 votes—this was in contrast to other areas, where Labour suffered a decline in popularity. This was helped by a high-profile anti-Conservative campaign by musician Billy Bragg. The seat was gained from Labour by Drax for the Conservatives at the 2010 General Election.|$|E
5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The mood in the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time to come to aid.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} mind (ToM) {{impairment}} describes a difficulty {{someone would have}} with perspective-taking. This is also {{sometimes referred to as}} mind-blindness. This means that individuals with a ToM impairment would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time seeing phenomena from any other perspective than their own. Individuals who experience a theory of mind deficit have difficulty determining the intentions of others, lack understanding of how their behavior affects others, and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time with social reciprocity. ToM deficits have been observed in people with autism spectrum disorders, people with schizophrenia, people with nonverbal learning disorder, people with attention deficit disorder, persons {{under the influence of alcohol}} and narcotics, sleep-deprived persons, and persons who are experiencing severe emotional or physical pain.|$|E

25|$|The shape, size, position, symmetry, spacing, firmness, {{and amount}} of sagging of {{individual}} women's breasts vary considerably. Manufacturers' bra size labeling systems vary {{from country to country}} because no international standards exist. Even within a single country, one study found that the bra label size was consistently different from the measured size. As a result, about 25% of women <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time finding a properly fitted bra. Some women choose to buy custom-made bras due to the unusual size or shape of their breasts.|$|E

The Jewish Agency acts as a partial guarantor for the loans, to support those businesses that otherwise would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time qualifying for loans or presenting the necessary collateral for them. The various funds have different eligibility criteria, with some focusing on stimulating the economy in specific regions of Israel, and others focusing on specific populations of business owners, such as Israeli Arabs, Ethiopian-Israelis, immigrants, etc.|$|E
25|$|Chinese input {{methods are}} methods that allow a {{computer}} user to input Chinese characters. Most, if not all, Chinese input methods fall {{into one of}} two categories: phonetic readings or root shapes. Methods under the phonetic category usually are easier to learn but are less efficient, thus resulting in slower typing speeds because they typically require users to choose from a list of phonetically similar characters for input; whereas methods under the root shape category allow very precise and speedy input but <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> learning curve because they often require a thorough understanding of a character's strokes and composition.|$|E

In correspondence with the United States Government {{he noted that}} the country seemed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> climate, few North Americans and no roads. Attempts to deliver on Buchanan's instructions for a cross-border treaty with Peru were also rebuffed, as the Peruvian Government had not been advised that Appleton would be undertaking this task and declined to negotiate with him. Discontented and in poor health, Appleton requested that he be recalled to the United States. He resigned on May 4, 1849, less than six months after assuming his post.|$|E

25|$|Circular {{migration}} {{has also}} been connected with the current spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This is partly because migrants can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time moving to new environments, as they lack the natives’ resistance to local diseases and infections. Many migrants are also {{at greater risk of}} becoming sick because of the marginal conditions in which they live. However, as described above, the majority of the attention has been on circular migrants as disease carriers. Contact with migrant workers places their rural partners at greater risk for acquiring STDs. Due to the nature of their work, circular migrants are gone from home often and for great lengths of time, which can disrupt the balance of their family and sex lives.|$|E
25|$|A form {{of sexual}} {{violence}} {{on the rise in}} the United States is Human Trafficking. Poverty can lead to increased trafficking due to more people on the streets. Women who are impoverished, foreign, socially deprived, or at other disadvantages are more susceptible to being recruited into trafficking. Many laws stated in Kelsey Tumiel’s dissertation, have recently been made to try to combat the phenomenon, but it is predicted that human trafficking will surpass illegal drug trafficking amounts in the US. Women that are victims of these sexual violence acts <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> time escaping the life due to abuse of power, organized crime, and insufficient laws to protect them. There are more people current enslaved in trafficking than there were during the African slave trade. “Branding” of human trafficking brings awareness to the issue claims Tam Mai, the author. This allows for public assertion and intervention. A claim made in Tam Mai's article states that by reducing poverty, thus may lead to a decrease in trafficking from the streets.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Bill Presley and his deputies <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> task {{ahead of}} them {{as they attempt to}} solve the {{shocking}} double murder discovered Sunday morning. Texarkana residents can help in this investigation {{and at the same time}} if they are not careful, they can hinder the investigation and cause the officers to spend many hours following blind trails. Persons who have information which might furnish a clue to the identity of the slayer or slayers or which might indicate a motive for the crime should not divulge such information on street corners or at cold drink stands but should immediately make it available to the officers. Do not spread rumors regardless of how much basis for fact there is in them. Do not say 'I heard' or 'they say', because the chances are that the person listening will repeat your information and enlarge upon it. Before long the story grows to such proportions as to necessitate a detailed investigation by the officers, thereby perhaps pulling them off the true trail and sending them up a blind alley. Stick to facts that you know of your own personal knowledge and relay those facts as quickly as possible to the officers.|$|E
