5|$|The {{effect of}} {{diffusion}} damping is greatly augmented by the finite {{width of the}} surface of last scattering (SLS). The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations we see are not all in phase. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|E
5|$|Cold {{cyclones}} {{are stronger}} aloft {{than at the}} Earth's surface, or stronger {{in areas of the}} troposphere with lower pressures, per the thermal wind relationship and the hypsometric equation. The hypsometric equation dictates that colder atmospheres have less room between pressure surfaces, which corresponds to the concept of lower atmospheric thickness, and the thermal wind relation indicates that in this situation, the wind increases with height. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that an isolated pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. Because of its cold center, the center shows an area of thickness minimum. Since the temperature at any given radius is similar and parallel to the orientation of the pressure gradient, and therefore the wind, it is barotropic in nature. The movement of cold-core cyclones can be erratic since they are separated from the main belt of the Westerlies, which would otherwise steer them progressively to the east.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, dryer lint burns readily. Although {{this may}} present a hazard in the household, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that lint makes {{excellent}} tinder for starting fires. It is especially useful for catching sparks from flint and steel, or similar striker-type fire starters {{in the absence}} of matches.|$|E
50|$|In Italian {{the main}} meaning of giogo is yoke, but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> gap, {{mountain}} pass; Toirano is a {{village on the}} southern side of the pass.|$|R

25|$|On December 8, 2014, it was {{announced}} that the lasers had been switched from ion lasers to solid-state lasers. This saves approximately 64,000 watts of energy per show. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that the laser will no longer need a water cooling system, which also reduced water consumption by thousands of gallons.|$|E
25|$|Unicode {{deals with}} the issue of {{simplified}} and traditional characters as part of the project of Han unification by including code points for each. This was rendered necessary {{by the fact that the}} linkage between simplified characters and traditional characters is not one-to-one. While this means that a Unicode system can display both simplified and traditional characters, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that different localization files are needed for each type.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> {{that one}} does not need a {{sampling}} frame listing all elements in the target population. Instead, clusters can be chosen from a cluster-level frame, with an element-level frame created only for the selected clusters. In the example above, the sample only requires a block-level city map for initial selections, and then a household-level map of the 100 selected blocks, rather than a household-level map of the whole city.|$|E

40|$|Question: Unpriming means a {{decrease}} in the influence of primed knowledge, but does <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> a lowered activation level? Method: Measuring the effect of unpriming with Lexical Decision Task instead of random answering. Findings: The answer is NO. Reaction times were faster after individuals first acted upon the primed concept (unpriming) ...|$|R

25|$|As established, these {{measurements}} are taken daily from the milk bulk tank {{and not from}} individual cows. This is because testing of individual animals at each milking would be expensive, but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that milk from a sick cow is diluted and averaged down by the healthy animals. Greater bulk tanks at very great commercial farms are accommodating of more sick animals in the herd, without the sick animals affecting the overall milk quality rating.|$|E
25|$|While the {{admissibility}} criterion guarantees {{an optimal}} solution path, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that A* must examine all equally meritorious paths {{to find the}} optimal path. To compute approximate shortest paths, {{it is possible to}} speed up the search at the expense of optimality by relaxing the admissibility criterion. Oftentimes we want to bound this relaxation, so that we can guarantee that the solution path is no worse than (1 + ε) times the optimal solution path. This new guarantee is referred to as ε-admissible.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{problem is the}} vastness of space. Despite piggybacking on the world's most sensitive radio telescope, Charles Stuart Bowyer said, the instrument could not detect random radio noise emanating from a civilization like ours, which has been leaking radio and TV signals for less than 100 years. For SERENDIP and most other SETI projects to detect a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization, the civilization {{would have to be}} beaming a powerful signal directly at us. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that Earth civilization will only be detectable within a distance of 100 light-years.|$|E
25|$|Globophobia {{has been}} used to refer to the fear of globalization, though <b>it</b> can <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> the fear of balloons.|$|R

25|$|After {{reaching}} Quorn, work moved {{ahead to}} extend the second track to Loughborough. The double track between Loughborough and Rothley opened on 1 June 2000. This gave additional capacity, which is especially useful at galas, where up to six trains may be in operation at any one time. This enables the running of non-passenger-carrying trains (freights, TPO set) during galas {{to a greater extent}} than any other heritage railway. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that the timetable can be generally adhered to, as delays do not cascade, as they do on single track lines.|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} basic systems, one {{character}} is converted at a time. This makes a very time consuming input process. Not only does the user have to select characters one at a time, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that the input system {{does not have the}} ability to prioritize character choices using word phrases, grammatical structure, or context. In addition, since the input method only supports one character at a time, it likely requires the user to type out the full pinyin spelling to narrow down the selection. This system still exists in embedded applications such as cell phones.|$|E
25|$|Self-synchronization: The leading bytes and the {{continuation}} bytes {{do not share}} values (continuation bytes start with 10 while single bytes start with 0 and longer lead bytes start with 11). This means a search will not accidentally find the sequence for one character starting {{in the middle of}} another character. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> the start of a character can be found from a random position by backing up at most 3 bytes to find the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream starts mid-sequence, and a shorter sequence will never appear inside a longer one.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} of plant-pollinator networks may have large {{consequences for the}} way in which pollinator communities respond to increasingly harsh conditions. Mathematical models, examining the consequences of this network structure for the stability of pollinator communities suggest that the specific way in which plant-pollinator networks are organized minimizes competition between pollinators and may even lead to strong indirect facilitation between pollinators when conditions are harsh. This means that pollinator species together can survive under harsh conditions. But <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that pollinator species collapse simultaneously when conditions pass a critical point. This simultaneous collapse occurs, because pollinator species depend on each other when surviving under difficult conditions.|$|E
25|$|Murphy concludes that,"Just as the Son of God limited {{himself by}} taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine {{action in the}} world to be in accord with {{rational}} laws which God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that natural processes hide God from scientific observation."For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a methodological naturalism, meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a metaphysical naturalism, which proposes that nature is all that there is.|$|E
25|$|Like the Bf 109, the Fw 190 {{featured}} a fairly small wing planform with relatively high wing loading. This presents a trade-off in performance. An aircraft {{with a smaller}} wing suffers less drag under most flight conditions and therefore flies faster and may have better range. However, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> the wing generates less lift at lower speeds, making it less maneuverable and also reduces performance in the thinner air at higher altitudes. The wings spanned 9.5m (31ft 2in) and had an area of 15m² (161ft²). The wing was designed using the NACA 23015.3 airfoil at the root and the NACA 23009 airfoil at the tip.|$|E

25|$|A major, but non-technical {{difference}} between Perl 5 and Perl 6 is that Perl 6 {{began as a}} specification. This means that Perl 6 can be re-implemented if needed, and <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that programmers don't {{have to read the}} source code for the ultimate authority on any given feature. Perl 5's documentation is regarded as excellent, even outside of the Perl community where even mixed reviews typically note its maturity and breadth. However, the documentation is not considered authoritative and only describes the behavior of the actual Perl 5 interpreter informally. Any discrepancies found between the documentation and the implementation may lead to either being changed to reflect the other, a dynamic which drives the continuing development and refinement of the Perl 5 releases.|$|E
25|$|This diagram shows a {{productive}} {{use of space}} by West Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final which led to Gerd Müller's game-winning goal against the Netherlands. German midfielder Rainer Bonhof made a long diagonal run out {{to the right side}} of the field, putting put him clear of the Dutch opposition. Deep into the Dutch half, Bonhof received a ball from Jürgen Grabowski and beat Arie Haan. Bonhof sent a low cross in to Müller, who found the back of the net. Moving diagonally is one of the best offensive movements, whether at the near or far posts, or out to the wings farther back in midfield. Diagonal movement creates added space to maneuver, compared to simply running straight ahead or laterally. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that players must be willing to switch positions as the situation demands.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, ZFS {{allocate}} writes across vdevs {{based on the}} free space in each vdev. This ensures that vdevs which have proportionately less data already, are given more writes when new data is to be stored. This helps to ensure that as the pool becomes more used, the situation does not develop that some vdevs become full, forcing writes to occur on {{a limited number of}} devices. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that when data is read (and reads are much more frequent than writes in most uses), different parts of the data can be read from as many disks as possible at the same time, giving much higher read performance. Therefore, as a general rule, pools and vdevs should be managed and new storage added, so that the situation does not arise that some vdevs in a pool are almost full and others almost empty, as this will make the pool less efficient.|$|E
