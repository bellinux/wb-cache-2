50|$|For each EU member country, a {{hierarchy}} of three NUTS levels is established by Eurostat in agreement with each member state; the subdivisions in some levels do not necessarily correspond to administrative divisions within the country. A NUTS code begins with a two-letter code referencing the country, which {{is identical to the}} ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (except UK instead of <b>GB</b> for the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> and EL instead of GR for Greece). The subdivision of the country is then referred to with one number. A second or third subdivision level is referred to with another number each. Each numbering starts with 1, as 0 is used for the upper level. Where the subdivision has more than nine entities, capital letters are used to continue the numbering. A similar statistical system is defined for the candidate countries and members of the European Free Trade Association, but they are not technically part of NUTS governed by the regulations.|$|R
40|$|<b>GB</b> <b>United?</b> is {{the story}} of the only time that the four parts of the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> of Great Britain & Northern Ireland managed to settle their {{differences}} and play as a team in the Olympic Games. As the book charts the history of a team that played long before the World Cup existed but vanished four decades ago, the story of the lingering death of the amateur ethos in football unfolds. Told through interviews with dozens of players, <b>GB</b> <b>United?</b> is the previously untold history of a team that will reappear again at the London Olympics in 2012 and grab the world's attention, and is the first and only book to chart the history of the British Olympic football team and alternative history of professional football; it looks at how the only attempt to field a British team and the entire amateur dream ethos both foundered and died. ...|$|R
