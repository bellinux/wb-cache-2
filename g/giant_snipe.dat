50|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>snipe</b> can be {{distinguished}} from sympatric common and Magellan snipe by its huge size and rounded wings. The other large species, Andean, Fuegian and imperial snipe, are upland species which lack the well-defined upperpart markings and white belly shown by <b>giant</b> <b>snipe.</b> Noble snipe is more similar to giant, but obviously smaller-bodied.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>snipe</b> has a kek-kek {{call when}} flushed, and a rasping trisyllabic call {{is given in}} its nocturnal display flight.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} rarely {{seen on the}} ground, and its habitat, {{reluctance}} to flush until almost trodden on, cryptic plumage, and nocturnal feeding mean its habits are almost unknown. Its diet apparently includes frogs. The <b>giant</b> <b>snipe</b> is usually seen alone when flushed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>snipe</b> (Gallinago undulata) is {{a stocky}} wader. It breeds in South America. The {{nominate}} subspecies G. u. undulata occurs in two distinct areas, one in Colombia, {{and the other}} from Venezuela through Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana to extreme north-eastern Brazil. The southern subspecies G. u. gigantea is found in eastern Bolivia, eastern Paraguay and south-east Brazil, and probably also in Uruguay and north-eastern Argentina.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>snipe</b> is hunted {{through most}} of its range, its large size {{making it easier to}} shoot than other snipes. Habitat loss is also a threat, at least in part of its range. It is nowhere common, and is local and {{uncommon}} in Colombia and Venezuela, but its nocturnal habits and extremely secretive behaviour might exaggerate its apparent scarcity, and it is currently not thought to be threatened.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>snipe</b> has {{a stocky}} body and {{relatively}} short legs for a wader. It has broad rounded wings like a woodcock {{and a very}} long bill. Its upperparts, head and neck are streaked and patterned with black and brown, and chestnut edges to the feathers form distinct lines down its back. The belly is white with brown barring on the flanks. The flight feathers are barred, a feature unique to this snipe. The horn-coloured bill is very long and straight. The legs and feet are greyish-green.|$|E
