5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that {{he could}} no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{after the}} emperor showed Shahrbaraz intercepted letters from Khosrow {{ordering}} the Persian general's death, the latter switched to Heraclius' side. Shahrbaraz then moved his army to northern Syria, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> decide to support either Khosrow or Heraclius at a moment's notice. Still, with the neutralization of Khosrow's most skilled general, Heraclius deprived his enemy {{of some of}} his best and most experienced troops, while securing his flanks prior to his invasion of Persia.|$|E

5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was {{the addition of a}} Welsh flag to the side of his helmet in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Wilson tricks Neto {{and brings}} {{him to a}} {{hospital}} where he is forcibly admitted without any examination to verify its necessity. Neto is sedated by a nurse before receiving the diagnosis of Dr. Cintra. When he wakes up, Neto encounters Ceará, a hyperactive man, and finds out the hospital is decaying and careless. He also meets Rogério, an injectable drugs user committed by his family, who tells him {{it is impossible to}} escape and that if he were to try he would be drugged with haloperidol or electrocuted. Rogério also tells him not to consume the medications administered by nurses because it awakes the appetite in order to make patients look healthier. Meanwhile, Cintra has a conversation in which he discusses that if necessary <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> admit more people, mostly homeless, to avoid losing the government subsidy.|$|E
25|$|Temperance {{was very}} much a women's rights issue at that time because of laws that gave husbands {{complete}} control of the family and its finances. A woman with a drunken husband had little legal recourse even if his alcoholism left the family destitute and he was abusive to her and their children. If she obtained a divorce, which was difficult to do, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> end up with guardianship of the children.|$|E
60|$|Young Twitter {{followed}} suit, but Sammy {{was neither}} expert nor graceful. True, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> ride <b>easily,</b> and travel long distances, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only mount {{by means of}} the somewhat clumsy process of hopping behind for several yards.|$|R

25|$|Many {{of these}} Grey adaptations were remakes of earlier silent films. In {{an effort to}} save on {{production}} costs, Paramount utilized stock footage from the silent version and even hired {{some of the same}} actors, such as Raymond Hatton and Noah Beery, to repeat their roles. For the 1933 films The Thundering Herd and Man of the Forest, Scott's hair was darkened and he sported a trim moustache so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be matched to footage of Jack Holt, the star of the silent versions.|$|E
25|$|Farnese, {{supported}} by Medici and his supporters, received twelve initial votes, all from creations of Leo X. If Farnese could have secured {{the votes of}} Leo X's other cardinals (twenty-eight of the thirty-nine electors), <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> have been elected. The Roman mob looted him home (as was customary for newly elected popes) and his odds increased to 40 to 100, although his votes dropped to four on the second day. After the second ballot, one cardinal pleading ill health {{was released from the}} conclave by a two-thirds vote.|$|E
25|$|Rachmaninoff possessed {{extremely}} large hands, {{with which}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> maneuver {{through the most}} complex chordal configurations. His left hand technique was unusually powerful. His playing was marked by definition—where other pianists' playing became blurry-sounding from overuse of the pedal or deficiencies in finger technique, Rachmaninoff's textures were always crystal clear. Only Josef Hofmann and Josef Lhévinne shared this kind of clarity with him. All three men had Anton Rubinstein {{as a model for}} this kind of playing—Hofmann as a student of Rubinstein's, Rachmaninoff from hearing his famous series of historical recitals in Moscow while studying with Zverev, and Lhevinne from hearing and playing with him.|$|E

25|$|Eclipse {{continues}} {{the drama of}} Bella and Edward's relationship. Edward explains that he is reluctant to change Bella into a vampire because he believes that vampires are soulless creatures who {{have no place in}} heaven. Bella, whose opinion of marriage is jaded by her own parents' early divorce, agrees to marry Edward on the condition that he will make love with her while she is still human and then turn her into a vampire. He initially refuses, saying that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> lose control {{in the heat of the}} moment and unintentionally kill her. However, seeing how important it is to Bella, he agrees to try, but only after they are married.|$|E
25|$|By 1636, Lord Boyle had {{opted to}} live in the West country to see out the rest of his days. He {{purchased}} from James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven, for £5,000, the manor of Stalbridge in Dorset which became his English seat, and in 1637, he laid out a further £20,000 for Temple Coombe Manor, close by in Somerset. Boyle, at the insistence of the Howards, also bought Annery House near Bideford in 1640 for £5000. The Earl was most delighted with Annery House and the living that came with the estate; he was also delighted that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> travel to Youghal from Bideford. Annery House was left to his sixth son Francis Boyle upon his death in 1643. Boyle had also been left the manor of Salcombe in Devon by his friend Thomas Stafford, the illegitimate son of George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes. Salcombe, along with Halberton Manor, was also left to his son Francis and his wife Elizabeth Killigrew.|$|E
25|$|Roche {{was only}} 39 seconds behind Delgado {{in the general}} classification. Roche could still win the Tour, but it {{depended}} on if he could recover {{in time for the}} 22nd stage. That stage included the last serious climb of the Tour, so Delgado had his final opportunity to gain time on Roche, and he attacked. However, Roche was able to come back to Delgado twice. Then, Roche attacked, and Delgado could not keep up. Roche won back 18 seconds on Delgado, so he had reduced his margin to 21 seconds. Being a talented time-trialist, he knew that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> make up for it on the penultimate stage (an individual time trial at Dijon). Indeed, Roche won almost a minute on Delgado, and this was enough to secure the overall win. This time trial was won by Jean-François Bernard, who finished the Tour in third place; if Bernard had not lost four minutes after the flat tire in the nineteenth stage, he would have won the Tour.|$|E
50|$|Lubiano {{comments}} on Radio Raheem's murder {{by the police}} as a cinematic cliché. Lubiano emphasizes on Spike Lee's particular representative selection of Radio Raheem {{as a victim of}} police violence, when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>easily</b> turned off his boombox to avert the tension.|$|R
60|$|He {{would not}} have delayed had Arthur been alone; but since John was there, he thought their sudden arrival might be more encumbering than consoling, and decided {{to wait for a}} further account, and finish affairs that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>easily</b> leave.|$|R
60|$|Tom {{saw that}} Martin looked at Mr Pecksniff as though <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>easily</b> {{found it in}} his heart to give HIM an {{invitation}} to a very warm place; but he was quite silent, and standing opposite that gentleman at the table, regarded him attentively.|$|R
25|$|Christophe {{was still}} in Grenoble {{at the start of}} stage eleven, when tour {{organiser}} Henri Desgrange gave him a yellow jersey, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> be recognized. The colour was inspired by the colour of the organizing newspaper l'Auto, although another explanation is that other colours were not available in the post-war shortage. Christophe was not happy with his yellow jersey, and other cyclists called him a canary. At that point in the race, it was likely that Christophe would stay the leader {{until the end of the}} Tour de France, because he remained in that yellow jersey after the Pyrénées and the Alps. In the penultimate stage, Firmin Lambot, who was in second position, more than 28 minutes behind, attacked. Christophe, still leading the race, chased him, but broke his fork close to Valenciennes. The rules were such that cyclists could get no help at all, so Christophe repaired his bicycle himself. This same thing had already cost him the victory in 1913, and would happen to him for a third time in 1922. It took him over two and a half hours, and he had lost the lead to Lambot. In the last stage, Christophe had a record number of punctures, and also lost his second place to Jean Alavoine.|$|E
25|$|There are early {{hints that}} Seishirō {{may not be}} all that he appears. Hokuto jokes about him {{being a member of}} the family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are {{pronounced}} to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having met someone under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite recall what was being said. This person was actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually wears on the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.|$|E
25|$|After the Ridda Wars, {{a tribal}} chief of north eastern Arabia, Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha, raided the Persian towns in Mesopotamia (what is now Iraq). Abu Bakr {{was strong enough}} to attack the Persian Empire in the {{north-east}} and the Byzantine Empire in the north-west. There were three purposes for this conquest: 1. Along the borders between Arabia and these two great empires were numerous Arab tribes leading a nomadic life and forming a buffer-like state between the Persians and Romans. Abu Bakr hoped that these tribes might accept Islam and help their brethren in spreading it. 2. The Persian and Roman populations suffered with very high taxation laws; Abu Bakr believed that they might be persuaded to help the Muslims, who agreed to release them from the excessive tributes. 3. Two gigantic empires surrounded Arabia, and it was unsafe to remain passive with these two powers on its borders. Abu Bakr hoped that by attacking Iraq and Syria he might remove the danger from the borders of the Islamic State. With the success of the raids, a considerable amount of booty was collected. Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha went to Medina to inform Caliph Abu Bakr about his success and was appointed commander of his people, after which he began to raid deeper into Mesopotamia. Using the mobility of his light cavalry <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> raid any town near the desert and disappear again into the desert, into which the Sassanid army was unable to chase them. Al-Muthanna's acts made Abu Bakr think about the expansion of the Rashidun Empire.|$|E

25|$|Goichi Suda {{stated that}} he would not mind seeing Travis appear in the Super Smash Bros. series. Joystiq editor Randy Nelson agreed, stating that he would love to see Travis with his beam katana in the next title. Destructoid editor Jim Sterling {{stated that he}} would love to see Travis {{included}} just by the virtue that it is a creation of Suda's, who he is a fan of. He commented that the close relationship between Suda and Hideo Kojima, whose character Solid Snake is already in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, makes it possible that he could appear. Inc Gamers editor Tim McDonald described Travis as a good fit for the Super Smash Bros. franchise. Kombo editor David Oxford stated that while {{he did not want to}} see the cast of the Super Smash Bros. series diluted by third party characters, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> see Travis not only fitting into the series, but being fun to play with. Escapist Magazine editor Keane Ng expressed the opinion that while the two third party characters included in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog, were highly popular characters, Travis is an unlikely character due to being far less recognizable. He added that while Snake was from a Mature-rated video game, he fit in well; Travis' personality would make him too difficult to include, despite his fighting style being similar to other Smash Bros. characters. As such Travis Touchdown was not added to the final cut of the game.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the years, Enríquez {{remained}} mostly {{focused in}} his role as a merchant, exploiting this distinction to move legal and smuggled products with success. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> use his privateering ships to launder goods that were otherwise illegal, investing the saving in land and properties. On occasion, he even received permission to openly import illegal merchandise. He used these exceptions to compensate for materials that were lacking in Puerto Rico. His enemies tried to expose him, but with little success. In 1718, they testified that Enríquez had smuggled clothes and other items hidden aboard the sloop La Gloria. Led by Pozo, the group launched another defamatory campaign against him. The attorney of San Juan even blamed him for a shortage of food, after he attempted to export 700 units of merchandise citing that the market was oversaturated. Due to this action the food was retained at port and spoiled. As a consequence, Enríquez deduced that for the well-being of his business, the best was to move and sell the merchandise as far away as possible. His sloops were sent in long voyages, with the incursions of La Aurora and El Aguila lasting periods of nearly two years and nine months respectively. They operated and moved merchandise between Habana, Santiago and Cartagena. These ships were in fact buying and selling contraband by veiling it as products captured by privateering. Upon returning to San Juan, both of these vessels arrived without any privateering spoils. Despite this, Enríquez gathered so much merchandise that it was unrivaled in Puerto Rico, selling anything that covered basic necessities of the citizens, ranging from food to brushes, razors, leather, locks and clothes. They also offered other commodities, such as playing cards, wines imported from Spain and equipment required for horse riding. Enríquez managed four warehouses, which besides storing merchandise were also used to manufacture anything that his ships needed. He divided them by class, separating the ones where food was stored from the ones where backup equipment was kept.|$|E
500|$|Jardine's {{achievements}} {{in the season}} were widely reported in the local and national press. He played two representative matches, for the best schoolboy cricketers, at Lord's Cricket Ground, [...] scored 44, 91, 57 and 55 and won favourable reviews in the press. Wisden, in 1928, described Jardine at this time as being obviously of a much higher standard than his contemporaries, particularly in defence and on side batting. However, he was criticised for being occasionally too cautious and not using all the batting strokes {{of which he was}} capable—his good batting technique gave the impression that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> score more quickly.|$|E
