2500|$|Velocity {{sensitivity}} (also {{found under}} the keyword touch sensitivity in some manuals): While {{the least expensive}} keyboards are simply [...] "on-off" [...] switches, mid-range and higher-range instruments simulate the process of sound generation in chordophones (string instruments) which {{are sensitive to the}} speed (or [...] "hardness") of a key press. Mid-range instruments may only have two or three levels of sensitivity (e.g., soft-medium-loud). More expensive models may have a broader range of sensitivity. For implementation, two sensors are installed for each key: the first sensor detects when a key is beginning to be pressed and the other triggers when the key is pressed completely. On some higher-end electronic keyboards or digital pianos, a third sensor is installed. This third sensor allows the player to strike a key and still sound a note even when the key has not yet come to its full resting position, allowing for faster (and more accurate) playing of repeated notes. The time between the two (or three) signals allows a keyboard to determine the velocity with which the key was struck. As the key weight is constant this velocity can be considered as the strength of the press. Based on this value the sound generator produces a correspondingly loud or soft sound. The least sophisticated types of touch sensitivity cause the keyboard to change the volume of the instrument voice. The most sophisticated, expensive types will trigger both a change in volume and a change in timbre, which simulates the way that very hard strikes of a piano or electric piano cause a difference in tone—as well as an increase in volume. Some sophisticated touch-sensitivity systems accomplish this by having several samples of an acoustic instrument note per key (e.g., a soft strike, a mid-level strike, and a hard strike). Alternatively, a similar effect can be accomplished using synthesis-modelling of the ADSR envelope or <b>digital</b> <b>modelling</b> (e.g., for the hard strike, the keyboard would add the timbres associated with a hard strike—in the case of a Fender Rhodes voice, this would be a biting, [...] "bark" [...] sound).|$|E

Three examiners measured distances on plaster <b>models</b> with a <b>digital</b> caliper and on <b>digital</b> <b>models</b> using Ortho Analyzer software. The <b>digital</b> <b>models</b> were also compared by means of superimposition of the models using the Geomagic Qualify software.

METHODS: Ten dry human skulls were scanned; from the scans, stereolithographic <b>models</b> and <b>digital</b> <b>models</b> were made. Two observers measured transversal distances, mesiodistal tooth widths, and arch segments on the skulls and the stereolithographic and <b>digital</b> <b>models.</b> All measurements were repeated 4 times. Arch length discrepancy and tooth size discrepancy were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed by using paired t tests. RESULTS: For the measurements on the stereolithographic and <b>digital</b> <b>models,</b> statistically significant differences were found. However, these differences {{were considered to be}} clinically insignificant. <b>Digital</b> <b>models</b> had fewer statistically significant differences and generally the smallest duplicate measurement errors compared with the stereolithographic models.

50|$|The Leslie {{speaker is}} a {{specially}} constructed amplifier/loudspeaker cabinet {{used to create}} special audio effects such as vibrato, chorus and tremolo. The Leslie creates these effects by rotating the tweeters or horns or a spinning a sound-directing duct around the bass woofer speaker, which causes the Doppler effect. Named after its inventor, Donald Leslie, it is particularly associated with the Hammond organ, but is used {{with a variety of}} instruments (notably electric guitar) and sometimes with vocals. The Hammond/Leslie combination has become a key element of the sound in many genres of music, including early heavy metal music (e.g., Deep Purple), blues, jazz organ trios and some rock genres. The Leslie Speaker and the Hammond Organ brands are currently owned by Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation. Due to the large size and heavy weight of the Leslie Speaker cabinet, some keyboardists use a small effects unit, such as the Uni-vibe, instead, and plug the unit into a regular keyboard amp. The most expensive rotating speaker effect units use <b>digital</b> <b>modelling</b> and digital signal-processing to produce a realistic-sounding recreation of the real Leslie speaker system.|$|E

As a result, in the mid-eighties the Dutch heavy units equalled the British in number and the Dutch Corps sector at the Elbe was the only one to have its own reserve division; it was conceived as to be able to hold an attack by nine reinforced Soviet divisions, or about 10,000 AFVs including materiel reserves. These facts were obscured somewhat by international press attention to the relaxation of discipline, part of a deliberate policy to better integrate the forces into the larger society.

40|$|Purpose: Due to the {{development}} of technology, communications related to designprojects have become more complex. Previous studies show that physical threedimensional (3 D) models are more useful tools for communications than <b>digital</b> <b>models.</b> Despite this, the use of physical models has decreased. The aim of this study is toincrease knowledge about how architects, 3 D-visualizers, and modelers find physicaland <b>digital</b> <b>models</b> work as communication tools, and to give suggestions for theirability to collaborate. Method: The study is based on a qualitative approach. Used methods are literaturestudies and interviews. The literature gives an up-to-date research in the field. Theinterviews contribute with rich answers and provide an overall picture of the subject. The respondents consist of architects, 3 D-visualizers and modelers. Findings: According to internal and external communication, physical models haveseveral strong advantages and a number of distinct disadvantages. Physical models arestraightforward, they give an overview and open up for discussion. Furthermore, theyhave a valuable influence on designers’ creativity in conceptual design stages. However, physical models are ineffective at visualizing technical information, and theyare not considered to be time and cost efficient. The advantages with <b>digital</b> <b>models</b> aremainly linked to the latter and more detailed stages of the planning process. The modelsare informative and able to visualize technical information. Furthermore, they are timeefficient when making revisions and valuable when selling. Simple <b>digital</b> <b>models</b> areeffective in rapid investigations during the project. More detailed <b>digital</b> <b>models</b> canhowever inhibit creativity in early stages of the planning process. Proposals can easilybe found definite which affects communications negatively. Physical and <b>digital</b> <b>models</b> can cooperate in communications in two ways. The firstway consists of using physical models {{in the early stages of}} the process and then transferthe extracted information into <b>digital</b> <b>models.</b> The second way consists of using physicaland <b>digital</b> <b>models</b> parallel during the process, to take advantage of both of theirdifferent qualities. Implications: Physical and <b>digital</b> <b>models</b> have different qualities and contributes withdifferent information. Depending on which information that is important in every stepof the process, the models should be used in different ways. To reach an efficientcommunication, physical and <b>digital</b> <b>models</b> should complement each other. Limitations: The study discuss internal and external communication. The result isbased on the perspective of architect, 3 D-visualizer and modeler. The interviews arebased on personal values, but after both empiricism and theory are considered, the resultis found relatively general. The study provides an indication of what the threeprofessions think about the subject. The result can’t however be applied on otherprofessions.

The AC30CC and AC15CC were later replaced with the AC30C2 and AC15C1 which had solid state rectification and a revised chassis. In 2010 Vox released a Hand-Wired version of the AC30 and AC15 with turret board construction, valve rectification and a choice of Celestion Greenback or Alnico Blue speakers.

5000|$|During the 1990s, as five-string basses {{became more}} widely {{available}} and more affordable, {{an increasing number}} of bassists in genres ranging from metal to gospel began using five-string instruments for added lower range—a low [...] "B" [...] string.
