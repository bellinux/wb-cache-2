5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And we got to do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> art project.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, Chachachá {{music had}} a close {{relationship}} with the dancer's steps. The well-known name Chachachá came into being {{with the help of the}} dancers at the Silver Star Club in Havana. When the dance was coupled to the rhythm of the music, it became evident that the dancer's feet were making a peculiar sound as they grazed the floor on three successive beats. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> onomatopoeia that sounded as: Chachachá. From this peculiar sound, a music genre was born which motivated people from around the world to dance at its catchy rhythm.|$|E
25|$|For defense, Toyota's {{starting}} unit {{had a better}} defensive stance against their counterparts in Crispa. With Jaworski, Fernandez and King anchoring the defense, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> impregnable Fort Knox to penetrate the individual defenses lay down by the team. It was a tribute therefore to Crispa's individuals' capabilities to go beyond this defense {{set up by the}} three. Crispa, however had the edge at the bench since they had noted defensive aces like Padim Israel, Joy Dionisio, Yoyoy Villamin, Bay Cristobal (especially in 1983 under Coach Tommy Manotoc) while Toyota had to contend with Herrera, Javier, Coloso and Bulaong to provide the defensive spunk.|$|E
25|$|Methinks <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> weasel.|$|R
25|$|Zarqa:"Scatterer", because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{scattering}} of notes.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> woman, he thought, {{to fasten}} upon the unessential.|$|R
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E
60|$|She {{threw her}} arms around his neck, and he rested his head upon her shoulder. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> elixir of life for him.|$|E
60|$|She gave {{it back to}} him. There {{was some}} one, then, whom he had injured very deeply. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> echo from that stormy past of which many people had spoken.|$|E
60|$|Scores {{of voices}} took it up until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> war-chant of wolves.|$|R
60|$|She {{answered}} so {{low that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sigh shaped into faint words.|$|R
60|$|Everything seemed strange to-day. Everyone said queer, {{unexpected}} things. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had come}} a step nearer, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{invitation}} {{to return to}} the arbour. [...] "This is the test of us!" [...] all that was good in Tommy cried once more to him.|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{the whole}} drove was {{housed in the}} house, and, great guns!--well, I never saw {{anything}} like it. Nor ever heard anything like it. And never smelt anything like it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> insurrection in a gasometer.|$|E
60|$|This {{had been}} the fact once, and Philip was glad of the recollection; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{inspiration}} to enable him to excuse his crying. He had to accept eau-de-Cologne and to refuse creosote in consequence; but that was easy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{plant that}} grows and {{blossoms}} {{in response to}} being cared for.|$|R
60|$|She sniffed in her quaint fashion. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> half-pleased shrug of the shoulders.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little arrow of {{exquisite}} light {{shot into}} {{the very heart of}} his life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> explosion," [...] said Sir Walter Carey at last. [...] "And {{really the}} man himself seems to have {{suddenly}} exploded. But he has blown himself up somehow without touching the tower. He's burst more like a bubble than a bomb." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won’t have it," [...] {{said the}} captain, sternly, {{with a side}} glance at the door. [...] "If {{you want to talk}} to {{yourself}} go outside and do it. I never heard such a laugh. What did you do it for? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old woman with a bad cold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Touche',' Mr. Durgin says. He fences, it seems, and {{he speaks}} French. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> animal {{speaking}} French; you always {{expect them to}} speak English. But I don't mind your swearing before me; I know that it helps to carry off the electricity." [...] She laughed, and made him laugh with her.|$|E
50|$|The {{significance}} test requires only one hypothesis. The {{result of the}} test is to reject the hypothesis (or not), a simple dichotomy. The test distinguish between truth of the hypothesis and insufficiency of evidence to disprove the hypothesis; so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> criminal trial in which the defendant's guilt is assessed in (so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> criminal trial in which the defendant is assumed innocent until proven guilty).|$|R
5000|$|Phulka (India, Pakistan): {{made from}} whole wheat flour, water and salt. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> baked variety of Puri.|$|R
5000|$|Fritz Reiner commented: [...] "The Academy {{has very}} good {{acoustics}} although somewhat dry. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Italian opera house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "First-rate!" [...] {{called the}} captain from above. [...] "Never mind the hat." [...] But the girl {{continued}} fondly trying to reshape it, while {{the old man}} fidgeted anxiously, and protested {{that he would be}} sure to be left. It was like a half-shut accordion when she took it from his head; when she put it back <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> accordion pulled out.|$|E
60|$|When {{people in}} our set are introduced, it is {{customary}} for them to ask each other's age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question to ask him; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> examination paper that asks grammar, when {{what you want to}} be asked is Kings of England.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{unrolled}} full {{copies of}} the number of men and supplies on the Wall--down to the sick that very day in Hunno Hospital. Oh, but I groaned when his pen marked off detachment after detachment of our best--of our least worthless men! He took two towers of our Scythians, two of our North British auxiliaries, two Numidian cohorts, the Dacians all, and half the Belgians. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> eagle pecking a carcass.|$|E
5000|$|... 259 AD, autumn, ninth month. A {{purple cloud}} was seen {{east of the}} palace. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> storied tower.|$|R
50|$|Chaura Bazaar, Ludhiana is {{the main}} and old market of the city. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{commercial}} hub of the Ludhiana.|$|R
60|$|A poignant anguish thrilled {{within her}} breast; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{thing that had}} life, and was {{struggling}} to get out.|$|R
6000|$|We {{stayed in}} Glasgow one day, and Jone was delighted with it, {{because he said}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> American city. Now, on principle, I like American cities, but I didn't come to Scotland to see them; and the {{greatest}} pleasure I had in Glasgow was standing with a tumbler of water in my hand, repeating to myself {{as much of the}} [...] "Lady of the Lake" [...] as I could remember.|$|E
60|$|M. Dessault, with Ulysse in his hand, stood {{foremost}} on the quay, and the {{two children}} were instantly in each other's embrace. Their uncle had to be helped out. He was more bewildered than gratified by the welcome. He required to be assured that the multitudes assembled meant him no harm, and would not move without Lanty; and though he bowed low in return to M. Dessault's greeting, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> automaton, and with no recognition.|$|E
60|$|His voice, poignant and musical, {{blended with}} the suave {{music of the}} words so that Margaret felt she had never before known their divine significance. She was {{intoxicated}} with their beauty. She wished him to continue, but had not the strength to speak. As if he guessed her thought, he went on, and now his voice had a richness in it as of an organ heard afar off. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> overwhelming fragrance and she could hardly bear it.|$|E
60|$|He {{went out}} into the hallway, leaving Al with his wife. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> funeral, George thought, as he waited.|$|R
60|$|One day he got {{a letter}} from Flaxen that startled and puzzled him. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cry for help, somehow.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man {{possessed of}} devils that the Lord of Stoutenburg ran {{out through the}} mist toward the molens.|$|R
