5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Red Army's exploitation of Germany's Army Group South's defenses in late January and early February, the fronts involved included the Bryansk, Voronezh and Southwestern Fronts. These were under the command of Generals M. A. Reiter, Filipp Golikov and Nikolai Vatutin, respectively. On 25 February, Marshal Rokossovsky's Central Front also joined the battle. These were positioned {{in such a way that}} Reiter's Briansk <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> on the northern flank of Army Group South, while Voronezh was directly opposite of Kursk, and the Southwestern <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> located opposite their opponents. Central <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> deployed between the Briansk and Voronezh Fronts, to exploit the success of both of these Soviet units, which had created a gap in the defenses of the German Second Panzer Army. This involved an estimated 500,000 soldiers, while around 346,000 personnel were involved in the defense of Kharkov after {{the beginning}} of the German counterstroke.|$|E

5|$|Weather <b>fronts.</b> Significant shear <b>is</b> {{observed}} {{when the}} temperature difference across the <b>front</b> <b>is</b> 5°C (9°F) or more, and the front moves at 30 knots or faster. Because <b>fronts</b> <b>are</b> three-dimensional phenomena, frontal shear can be observed at any altitude between surface and tropopause, and therefore be seen both horizontally and vertically.

5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E

5|$|Once Soviet {{resistance}} {{along the}} Vyazma-Bryansk <b>front</b> <b>was</b> eliminated, German forces were to press east, encircling Moscow by outflanking {{it from the}} north and south.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the multidimensional {{stability}} of time periodic V-shaped traveling fronts in bistable reaction–diffusion equations.

In particular, we show that the <b>fronts</b> <b>are</b> algebraically stable if the initial perturbations belong to L 1 in a certain sense. Furthermore, we prove that there exists a solution oscillating permanently between two time periodic V-shaped traveling fronts, which implies that time periodic V-shaped traveling <b>fronts</b> <b>are</b> not always asymptotically stable under general bounded perturbations. Finally we show that time periodic V-shaped traveling <b>fronts</b> <b>are</b> only time global solutions of the Cauchy problem if the initial perturbations lie between two time periodic V-shaped traveling fronts...|$|R
5|$|The Armia Krajowa's primary {{resistance}} operations were the sabotage of German activities, including transports {{headed for the}} Eastern Front in the Soviet Union.

5|$|The Red Army's winter counter-offensive {{drove the}} Wehrmacht from Moscow, {{but the city}} was still {{considered}} to be threatened, with the front line relatively close. Because of this, the Moscow theater remained a priority for Stalin, who at first {{appeared to be in}} shock due to the initial German success. In particular, the initial Soviet advance was unable to reduce the Rzhev salient, held by several divisions of Army Group Center. Immediately after the Moscow counter-offensive, a series of Soviet attacks (the Battles of Rzhev) were attempted against the salient, each time with heavy losses on both sides. By early 1943, the Wehrmacht had to disengage from the salient as the whole <b>front</b> <b>was</b> moving west. Nevertheless, the Moscow <b>front</b> <b>was</b> not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Center was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk landbridge and from the left shore of the upper Dnieper {{at the end of the}} Second Battle of Smolensk.|$|E

50|$|The main (north) {{front and}} the west <b>front</b> <b>are</b> {{constructed}} in coursed buff sandstone; the south <b>front</b> <b>is</b> in brick with stone dressings on a stone plinth. The roofs are slated and the chimneys constructed of stone. The house has two storeys and attics. The north <b>front</b> <b>is</b> E-shaped. It has a central porch with a balustrade, and three-light mullioned and transomed windows on each side. Above the porch is a two-light sash window. The parapet is plain, rising in two steps to the projecting wings. These have three-light mullioned windows in the lower level, three-light mullioned and transomed windows in the upper level, and a single-light window in the gable. The west front has sash windows, a projecting chimney, and a canted four-light oriel window. The south <b>front</b> <b>is</b> irregular in plan, with a recessed gabled portion to the left containing one window, a central portion with three windows, and a right gabled portion containing a canted two-storey bay window. To {{the right of the}} south <b>front</b> <b>is</b> a wing with a bow window containing a French window. Above this is a Doric cornice. The east <b>front</b> <b>is</b> obscured behind a 19th-century service wing.|$|R

The First Baltic <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> ordered by STAVKA to move westward in order to stop Army Group North's remaining forces from escaping to Germany. Despite this, Bagramyan understood that many of the general orders being given to the German Army were directed by Adolf Hitler, rather than the General Staff, and knew that while there was a possibility that they would confront them in the Lithuanian city of Kaunas, he felt the more likely location would be in Latvia's capital, Riga. He spoke with Vasilevsky who agreed to change the plans if his theory and intuition proved correct.|$|E

French, British and Russian troops arrived in Salonika between 1916 and 1917 and became known as the Allied Army of the Orient or Allied Army of the East, under the overall command of French General Maurice Sarrail.|$|E
5|$|About halfway along Euston Road, at the {{junction}} with Upper Woburn Place, is St Pancras New Church, built in 1822.

Almost opposite is Euston Road fire station, built 1901–2, in an Arts and Crafts style by Percy Nobbs. The Shaw Theatre opened at No.100–110 in 1971, in honour of George Bernard Shaw.

5|$|Although {{the trench}} warfare on the Western <b>Front</b> <b>was</b> {{dominated}} by the artillery and infantry, the cavalry still suffered 5,674 dead and 14,630 other casualties. For comparison, one infantry regiment—the Northumberland Fusiliers—had 16,000 casualties. Unlike the huge losses in the infantry regiments, only ten cavalry regiments suffered over 200 dead. The 3rd Dragoon Guards, with 333 dead, had the most killed, while the 7th Hussars had eighty dead, one less than the 21st Lancers, which had remained in India throughout the war. The dead included one major general, eleven brigadier generals, but only twenty-eight of the 1,161 lieutenant colonels killed during the war were from the cavalry, several of those after having assumed command of an infantry battalion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the behaviour of heavy particles in an argon plasma expanding from a cascaded arc. The plasma is characterized using high-accuracy spatially resolved Thomson-Rayleigh measurements. It is {{shown that the}} expansion of the heavy particles, neutral particles and ions, is close to adiabatic and that three-particle recombination has a small effect on the ion density. The measurements are compared with an adiabatic model and are found to be in good agreement. The behaviour of the neutral particles in the shock <b>front</b> <b>is</b> independent from that of the ions. The neutral particle shock <b>front</b> <b>is</b> identical to the shock front found in neutral gases and is accordingly characterized by the neutral particle Mach number. It is experimentally confirmed that the shape of the shock <b>front</b> <b>is</b> of the Mott-Smith type.
