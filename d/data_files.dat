5|$|Hubble {{data can}} be {{analyzed}} using many different packages. STScI maintains the custom-made Space Telescope Science Data Analysis System (STSDAS) software, which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw <b>data</b> <b>files,</b> {{as well as many}} other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data. The software runs as a module of IRAF, a popular astronomical data reduction program.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system; the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system {{is known as a}} job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, <b>data</b> <b>files,</b> directories, executables and/or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks.|$|E

40|$|A FORTRAN coded {{computer}} program which generates CalComp plots of trajectory parameters is examined. The trajectory parameters are calculated {{and placed on}} a <b>data</b> <b>file</b> by the Near Earth Mission Analysis Routine {{computer program}}. The plot program accesses the <b>data</b> <b>file</b> and generates the plots as defined by inputs to the plot program. Program theory, user instructions, output definitions, subroutine descriptions and detailed FORTRAN coding information are included. Although this plot program utilizes a random access <b>data</b> <b>file,</b> a <b>data</b> <b>file</b> of the same type and formatted in 102 numbers per record could be generated by any computer program and used by this plot program...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} method to read external data into a SAS Â® data set {{consists of the}} following steps:- Allocate the <b>data</b> <b>file</b> using a FILENAME statement- Create a DATA step to read the data using INFILE and INPUT statements. The allocation creates {{a link between the}} SAS program and the <b>data</b> <b>file.</b> Normally SAS will access the <b>data</b> <b>file</b> during the compilation phase of the DATA step to determine the availability and the attributes of the <b>file.</b> If the <b>data</b> <b>file</b> is not available, the DATA step will fail during the compilation and you are left without control about what to do next. By using the FILEVAR option of the INFILE statement you can move the process of allocation from the compilation to the execution phase of the DATA step and regain control over what is happening with the input file. This allows for corrective actions in case that the input <b>data</b> <b>file</b> is not available...|$|R
5|$|The {{creation}} of user-made scenarios or series of scenarios (campaigns) {{for the game}} was made possible using the Scenario Builder. This tool is simpler and easier to learn than comparable editors used in more modern games, but it has fewer capabilities as a result. Ensemble Studios used the Scenario Builder to make the single-player campaigns which shipped with the retail game. Various unofficial sites exist where custom scenarios can be submitted and downloaded. In late 2005, {{it was discovered that}} by modifying various <b>data</b> <b>files,</b> units present in the beta versions of the game could be made available in the editor. Some obscure units include a spaceship and a hero that changes ownership when units move near it. Through data editing, the rules of unit placement can also be modified. This allows units to be placed on any terrain and on top of other units, which creates new possibilities for design. Other significant discoveries include new terrain templates, a mode to triple each unit's hitpoints and a tool to edit map sizes.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 83) A {{method of}} file organization which combines fast access, ease of maintenance, and sequential ordering is proposed for a dynamic random access file. This method, termed the Gemini Algorithm, {{is a combination}} of the scatter storage (hashing) technique for the <b>data</b> <b>file</b> and a B+tree index organization. During query and <b>data</b> <b>file</b> record modification processes, only the hash component of the Gemini algorithm is utilized. The B+tree component of Gemini algorithm is utilized solely in the periodic processing. During <b>data</b> <b>file</b> record insertion and deletion, both the hash and B+tree components must be maintained. The major premise behind the development of the Gemini algorithm is that additional overhead can be allowed for <b>data</b> <b>file</b> record insertion and deletion as these processes are relatively minor segment of total file interaction.

25|$|The V8 Security Feature Pack (a mid-release product update {{designated}} 8.5) added {{important new}} security features designed to lock down Pervasive.SQL <b>data</b> <b>files.</b> Prior to 8.5, access to Btrieve data {{was controlled by}} the operating system's security mechanism. This meant that any user who needed read/write access to the database, also needed read/write access to the underlying <b>data</b> <b>files.</b> 8.5 introduced new security models, which allow administrators to control access to the Btrieve data using database security. Once activated, database security no longer requires that the user {{has access to the}} underlying files. In addition, client/server configurations no longer require the use of network shares or mapped drives. Applications can reference secure Btrieve data using a URI connection string.|$|E

25|$|The Victorian era {{is famous}} for the Victorian {{standards}} of personal morality. Historians generally agree that the middle classes held high personal moral standards (and usually followed them), but have debated whether the working classes followed suit. Moralists in the late 19th century such as Henry Mayhew decried the slums for their supposed high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births. However, new research using computerized matching of <b>data</b> <b>files</b> shows that the rates of cohabitation then were quite low â under 5% â for the working class and the poor.|$|E

5000|$|FOCUS {{features}} {{the ability for}} the user to construct a <b>data</b> description <b>file</b> (called a [...] "master file description") referring to the actual <b>data</b> <b>file,</b> or even several different <b>data</b> description <b>files</b> addressing the same <b>data</b> <b>file</b> in different ways, rather than the usual practice of having the file structure hard-coded into the program. In this way, files of any structure from any source can be accessed or produced in many different ways, eliminating much of the data manipulation (for example concatenation, or parsing) usually required with other earlier programming languages to change variable formats or data structures. For instance, the same actual <b>data</b> <b>file</b> can be accessed (read or write) as each record being an 80 byte text string, or as 40 2 character numerical fields, other as 10 8-byte floating point numbers, etc., by the user simply re-writing the appropriate master file description as needed.|$|R
