5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the <b>inactive</b> <b>character</b> to gradually recover some life they might have lost. At certain points, an inactive character's life bar may flash, giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in. If the life bar of either of a player's fighters runs out, that player loses the round. If time runs out, the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.|$|E
500|$|Excluding the massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XII is {{the first}} entry in the main Final Fantasy series not to include random encounters. Instead, enemies are visible in the overworld and the player may choose to fight or avoid them. Battles unfold in real time using the [...] "Active Dimension Battle" [...] (ADB) system. Battles begin when the party comes within range of an aggressive enemy, the party attacks an enemy, or a story event initiates a confrontation. When a character or enemy begins an action, target lines connect characters to other party members or enemies; different colors represent {{the different types of}} action. The player may swap to and issue commands to any of the three characters in the party, but guest characters are controlled by artificial intelligence (AI). Battle commands are initiated through a series of menus, and include Attack, Magicks, Technicks, Mist, Gambits, and Items. The player may switch any active character with an <b>inactive</b> <b>character</b> at any time, unless the active character is targeted by an attack or ability. Characters who are knocked out may also be substituted.|$|E
60|$|Three {{successive}} legates {{carried on}} the affairs of Britain during {{the latter part of}} Nero's reign, and during the troubles occasioned by the disputed succession. But they were all of an <b>inactive</b> <b>character.</b> The victory obtained by Paulinus had disabled the Britons from any new attempt. Content, therefore, with recovering the Roman province, these generals compounded, as it were, with the enemy {{for the rest of the}} island. They caressed the troops; they indulged them in their licentiousness; and not being of a character to repress the seditions that continually arose, they submitted to preserve their ease and some shadow of authority by sacrificing the most material parts of it. And thus they continued, soldiers and commanders, by a sort of compact, in a common neglect of all duty on the frontiers of the Empire, in the face of a bold and incensed enemy.|$|E
50|$|Chaos Rings III {{has five}} playable characters. Unlike {{previous}} {{games in the}} series, parties are now composed of up to three characters, and the two <b>inactive</b> <b>characters</b> are also able to receive experience, albeit less {{than those in the}} active party. Like previous games in the series, the game features voice acting in key scenes, though only in Japanese.|$|R
5000|$|When {{characters}} fight, {{they are}} taken to a separate combat screen and stand face-to-face. The screen will show their various skills and gallery of items; as well as specific traits of the boss. They are able to gain combat experience and raise their character's level, or gain extra rewards during a [...] "perfect battle". A new feature of this game is that the players can switch characters {{in the middle of}} the battle, or use items to control their character. Players can also change strategies to influence their <b>inactive</b> <b>characters,</b> which are controlled by artificial intelligence.|$|R
5000|$|... 1982-1984: a 15-issue series. Issues 13-14 are {{titled the}} Book of the Dead and <b>Inactive,</b> {{featuring}} <b>characters</b> and groups who were, at the time, believed dead or inactive. Issue 15 is titled the 'Book of Weapons, Hardware, and Paraphernalia', featuring technical drawings of {{equipment such as}} the shield of Captain America and the web-shooters of Spider-Man. One issue of the series (#9) {{can be seen in}} the movie Explorers.|$|R
60|$|But on {{the point}} of moral preferability, there seems at first sight to be room for doubt. I am not {{referring}} to the religious feeling which has so generally existed in favor of the <b>inactive</b> <b>character,</b> as being more in harmony with the submission due to the divine will. Christianity, as well as other religions, has fostered this sentiment; but it is the prerogative of Christianity, as regards this and many other perversions, that it is able to throw them off. Abstractedly from religious considerations, a passive character, which yields to obstacles instead of striving to overcome them, may not indeed be very useful to others, no more than to itself, but it might be expected to be at least inoffensive. Contentment is always counted among the moral virtues. But it is a complete error to suppose that contentment is necessarily or naturally attendant on passivity of character; and useless it is, the moral consequences are mischievous. Where there exists a desire for advantages not possessed, the mind which does not potentially possess them by means of its own energies is apt to look with hatred and malice on those who do. The person bestirring himself with hopeful prospects to improve his circumstances is the one who feels good-will towards others engaged in, or who have succeeded in the same pursuit. And where the majority are so engaged, those who do not attain the object have had the tone given to their feelings by the general habit of the country, and ascribe their failure to want of effort or opportunity, or to their personal ill luck. But those who, while desiring what others possess, put no energy into striving for it, are either incessantly grumbling that fortune does not do for them what they do not attempt to do for themselves, or overflowing with envy and ill-will towards those who possess what they would like to have.|$|E

50|$|The game plays {{similar to}} the 3D Ys series games, also {{produced}} by Falcom, with real time battles and a fixed camera that follows the main character from a medium distance. One major difference {{is the presence of}} an <b>inactive</b> secondary <b>character</b> who follows the player's character for most of the game, usually either Alwen or Ragna, depending on who the player isn't controlling at that point in time. Initialising a physical attack forces the player to control Ragna, while initialising a magical attack causes Alwen to fight. Both characters are controlled in the same way, although they have different offensive and defensive stats.|$|R
40|$|The {{heterochromatic}} {{region of}} chromosomes contains highly repeated satellite DNAs with no or very few genes and is usually transcriptionally <b>inactive.</b> Its repetitive <b>character</b> {{has led to the}} suggestion that it is »junk DNA« with no utility, although some important inheritance functions have been mapped to it. Beetles from the family Tenebrionidae (Insecta, Coleoptera) contain a substantial amount of heterochromatin and satellite DNA in their genome and represent a suitable system for structural and organizational studies. Here, the data on the primary and higher order structure and organization of satellite DNAs from ten different tenebrionid species are presented, as well as on mutational processes effecting their evolution. Using these data, we have tried to determine conserved structural elements within satellites which can be important for maintaining the heterochromatin structure and compactness. Such analyses could help to define the structural components of the chromosome responsible for some heterochromatic functions, like chromosome pairing, centromere function and sister chromatid adhesion...|$|R
40|$|Establishment of the mesodermal {{germ layer}} {{is a process}} {{dependent}} on the integration of multiple transcriptional and signaling inputs. Here I investigate {{the role of the}} transcription factor FoxD 3 in zebrafish mesodermal development. FoxD 3 gain-of-function results in dorsal mesoderm expansion and body axis dorsalization. FoxD 3 knockdown results in axial defects similar to Nodal loss-of-function, and was rescued by Nodal pathway activation. In Nodal mutants, FoxD 3 did not rescue mesodermal or axial defects. Therefore, FoxD 3 functions through the Nodal pathway and is essential for dorsal mesoderm formation. The FoxD 3 mutant, sym 1, previously described as a null mutation with neural crest defects, was reported to have no mesodermal or axial phenotypes. We find that Sym 1 protein retains activity and induces mesodermal expansion and axial dorsalization. A subset of sym 1 homozygotes display axial and mesodermal defects, and penetrance of these phenotypes is enhanced by FoxD 3 knockdown in mutant embryos. Therefore, sym 1 is a hypomorphic allele, and reduced FoxD 3 function results in reduced cyclops expression and subsequent mesodermal and axial defects. The sym 1 molecular lesion, a point deletion leading to a seven codon frameshift and premature termination, is predicted to be a truncated protein lacking part of the DNA-binding domain and an essential Groucho corepressor interaction domain (GEH). Strongly predicted to be functionally <b>inactive,</b> the hypomorphic <b>character</b> of sym 1 suggested that a - 1 translational frameshift may correct the reading frame and produce functional protein. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutation of the distal GEH ablated sym 1 cDNA activity. Within the frameshift region are three rarely used codons predicted to cause ribosomal pausing and promote translational frameshifting. Conversion of these codons to highly used codons encoding the same residues rendered the sym 1 cDNA inactive. Biochemical analyses confirm that a full length FoxD 3 protein is produced from sym 1 cDNA, but not when the rare codons are replaced. These results indicate that the null character of the sym 1 mutation is suppressed by a novel translational frameshifting mechanism, and support the conclusion that FoxD 3 is a Nodal-dependent regulator of zebrafish mesodermal development. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} two {{composition of}} CS containing as crystalline phase mullite or quartz for production concrete was studied. The pozzolanic activity of CS (Q) significantly depend on dispersion and treatment time in Ca(OH) 2 solution. Due to high content of amorphous SiO 2, the specific character of crystalline structure of mullite and structural collapse (increase amounts of reactive Al 2 O 3) after 14 days treatment of M specimens, a {{sharp increase in}} activity of spheres exceeded an activity of fine-grained particles. On the surface of CS (M) and broken areas, formation of amorphous white deposits and crystalline phase - calcium aluminate has been observed. CS (Q) pattern remains without significant changes {{on the surface of the}} sphere. Investigation behaviour of CS in cement paste showed pozzolanic activity of mullite containing CS and <b>inactive</b> <b>character</b> of crystalline quartz containing CS. Investigated CS dependent on chemical composition can be recommended both as reinforcing filler (crystalline quartz containing) and pozzolanic additive (mullite containing) in cement paste structure...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} the stability/bioavailability and in vivo antihypertensive {{activity of the}} tripeptide, Ala-Val-Phe, that was recently purified from insect protein (Spodoptera littoralis; Lepidoptera) and that showed in vitro angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. This tripeptide is partly hydrolyzed by mucosal peptidases to Val-Phe, a more potent in vitro ACE inhibitor. In organ bath experiments using rat aorta, Val-Phe showed ACE inhibition, while Ala-Val-Phe did not. Single oral administration (5 mg/kg body weight) to spontaneously hypertensive rats led to {{a significant decrease in}} blood pressure for both peptides. Docking experiments indicated an active character for Val-Phe and an <b>inactive</b> <b>character</b> for Ala-Val-Phe as potential inhibitors of human ACE. From our results, it can be suggested that after oral administration of Ala-Val-Phe, Val-Phe is released by in vivo peptidases and is responsible for in vivo activity of Ala-Val-Phe. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first report of in vivo antihypertensive activity of peptides derived from insect protein. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
