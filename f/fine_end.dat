That run continued into the 2003-04 with a club record of 26 league matches unbeaten being ended in December 2003, at which point the Angels were comfortable leaders of the Eastern Division.

After an initial period of mixed results, Dolby steadied the ship and brought in Mike Rutherford as assistant coach before keeping the Angels in the title battle until the penultimate game of the season.

40|$|In {{considering}} what I {{have to say}} to-night, I {{would like it to}} be clearly appreciated from the outset that the business of growing and processing flax?its conversion into yarns?their later weaving into linen fabrics?and the final cloth-bleaching, dyeing, and finishing processes constitutes a craft trade of a very high order. It is essential to keep this fact prominently in mind, for it severely limits the extent to which productivity in the industry can be increased by a process of mechanisation similar to that which has taken place in the manufacture of rayon or cotton. For this reason the manufacture of linen, particularly in the <b>fine</b> <b>end</b> of the trade associated with Northern Ireland, involves a much higher proportion of operatives to machinery than rules in the cotton trade of Lancashire, or in the rayon industry...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Aluminum ions {{as well as}} {{hydroxide}} precipitates promote improved {{extraction of}} iron from kaolinites during leaching. Selective aggregation f ultrafine particles in kaolinites, eemingly induced by precipitation ofaluminum hydroxide, gives brightness improvement i excess of that which can be ascribed to iron extraction. Aggregation ofanatase, a primary discolorant confined mostly to the <b>fine</b> <b>end</b> of the kaolinite particle size distribution, is the suggested mechanism for complementary b ightness improvement. Precipitation ofaluminum hydroxide in kaolinite systems substantially changes flocculation charac-teristics, surface area (methylene blue), and rheology. Edge-edge and edge-face flocculation are pro-moted where sulfate retention is high, becoming progressively more face-face with sulfate removal. The character of the flocculation can be interpreted by the combined use of surface area and low shear viscosity data. The extent o which kaolinites can be dispersed after processing increases with increase in sulfate retention. Stability of suspensions deftocculated with polyphosphates shows an inverse relationship, decreasing with increase in sulfate retention...|$|E
40|$|The {{portable}} fibre-testing instrument OFDA 2000 has {{applications in}} the mohair industry for both fibre classing and animal selection. A comparison was completed between single-staple mid-side testing using an OFDA 2000 and conventional laboratory mid-side testing using an OFDA 100. Mid-side mohair samples (n= 504) were collected from two consecutive shearings of a mixed sex group of Angora kids at 6 and 12 months of age. The samples were at the <b>fine</b> <b>end</b> (average 20. 9 µm) of the mean fibre diameter range of mohair. There was a bias between the estimates of mean fibre diameter at both shearings. The other traits studied also had biases between measurement methods. The regression analyses results of mean fibre diameter from the two test methods accounted for 91 % and 88 % of the variance for first and second shearings, respectively. Regression analyses between test methods for standard deviation, coefficient of variation of fibre diameter and fibre curvature accounted for less variance than the regressions of mean fibre diameter results. The results indicate OFDA 2000 is suitable for estimation of mean fibre diameter of greasy kid mohair staples and is therefore useful for both mohair classing and Angora selection. ______________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{processing}} of harvested E. coli cell broths is examined where the expressed protein product {{has been released}} into the extracellular space. Pre-treatment methods such as freeze–thaw, flocculation, and homogenization are studied. The resultant suspensions are characterized {{in terms of the}} particle size distribution, sensitivity to shear stress, rheology and solids volume fraction, and, using ultra scale-down methods, the predicted ability to clarify the material using industrial scale continuous flow centrifugation. A key finding was the potential of flocculation methods both to aid the recovery of the particles and to cause the selective precipitation of soluble contaminants. While the flocculated material is severely affected by process shear stress, the impact on the very <b>fine</b> <b>end</b> of the size distribution is relatively minor and hence the predicted performance was only diminished to a small extent, for example, from 99. 9 % to 99. 7 % clarification compared with 95 % for autolysate and 65 % for homogenate at equivalent centrifugation conditions. The lumped properties as represented by ultra scale-down centrifugation results were correlated with the basic proper-ties affecting sedimentation including particle size distribu-tion, suspension viscosity, and solids volume fraction. Grade efficiency relationships were used to allow for the particle and flow dynamics affecting capture in the centrifuge. The size distribution below a critical diameter dependant on the broth pre-treatment type was shown to be the main determining factor affecting the clarification achieved...|$|E

40|$|Cylpebs are {{slightly}} tapered cylindrical grinding media with {{a ratio of}} length to diameter of unity. The manufactures have made conflicting claims regarding the milling performance of Cylpebs in comparison with balls. One major point of interest is which one grinds finer at the same operating conditions. The difficulty in comparison {{is due to the}} shape difference. The two grinding media have different surface area, bulk density and contact mechanisms in grinding action. Comparative tests were conducted using the two types of grinding media in a laboratory Bond ball mill at various conditions of equality such as media mass, size distribution, surface area and input specific energy. The laboratory results indicate that at the same specific energy input level the Cylpebs produce a product with slightly less oversize due to their greater surface area, but essentially the same sizing at the <b>fine</b> <b>end</b> as that produced with the balls. The reason may be that the advantage of greater surface area is balanced by the line contact and area contact grinding actions with the Cylpebs. A new ball mill scale-up procedure [Man, Y. T., 2001. Model-based procedure for scale-up of wet, overflow ball mills, Part 1 : outline of the methodology. Minerals Engineering 14 (10), 1237 - 1246] was employed to predict grinding performance of an industrial mill from the laboratory test results. The predicted full scale operation was compared with the plant survey data. Some problems in the original scale-up procedures were identified. The scale-up procedure was therefore modified to allow the predicted ball mill performance to match the observed one. The calibrated scale-up procedure was used to predict the Cylpebs performance in the full scale industrial mill using the laboratory tests results. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
