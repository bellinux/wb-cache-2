500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s {{a number of}} American {{painters}} began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips. Roy Lichtenstein made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958. Andy Warhol produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced Look Mickey and Popeye in 1961. Although Warhol had produced silkscreens of comic strips and of other pop art subjects, he supposedly relegated himself to Campbell's Soup Cans as a subject {{at the time to}} avoid competing with the more finished style of comics by Lichtenstein.

500|$|During {{the comic}} book phase of his career, Lichtenstein often {{slightly}} altered the colorization of the original source. According to Marco Livingstone, his early comic subjects comprise a [...] "loose and improvised style clearly derived from de Kooning." [...] Art historian Jonathan Fineberg describes a Lichtenstein painting of 1960 as an [...] "...abstract expressionist picture with Mickey Mouse in it, related stylistically to the de Kooning Women". When Leo Castelli saw both Lichtenstein's and Warhol's large comic strip-based works, he elected to show only Lichtenstein's, causing Warhol to create the Campbell's Soup Cans series to avoid competing with the more refined style of comics Lichtenstein was then producing. He once said [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that really {{will have a lot}} of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." [...] Lichtenstein's foray into comics led to the abandonment of the topic by Warhol. Although Lichtenstein continued to work with comic sources, after 1961 he avoided the easily identified sources like Popeye and Mickey Mouse.|$|E

[...] However, nobody bought the manuscript. Forrest J Ackerman, later Hubbard's literary agent, recalled that Hubbard told him [...] "whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that {{the last time he had}} shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window." [...] Hubbard's failure to sell Excalibur depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: [...] "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name.

[...] In February 1962, Lichtenstein displayed at a sold-out exhibition of cartoon pictures at Leo Castelli's eponymous Leo Castelli Gallery, ending the possibility of Warhol exhibiting his own cartoon paintings. Castelli had visited Warhol's gallery in 1961 and said that the work he saw there was too similar to Lichtenstein's, although Warhol's and Lichtenstein's comic artwork differed in subject and techniques (e.g., Warhol's comic-strip figures were humorous pop culture caricatures such as Popeye, while Lichtenstein's were generally of stereotypical hero and heroines, inspired by comic strips devoted to adventure and romance). Castelli chose not to represent both artists at that time, but he would, in 1964, exhibit Warhol works such as reproductions of Campbell's Tomato Juice Box, 1964 (pictured above, left), and Brillo Soap Boxes. He would again exhibit Warhol's work in 1966. Lichtenstein's 1962 show was quickly followed by Wayne Thiebaud's April 17, 1962 one-man show at the Allan Stone Gallery featuring all-American foods, which agitated Warhol as he felt it jeopardized his own food-related soup can works. Warhol was considering returning to the Bodley gallery, but the Bodley's director did not like his pop art works. In 1961, Warhol was offered a three-man show by Allan Stone at the latter's 18 East 82nd Street Gallery with Rosenquist and Robert Indiana, but all three were insulted by this proposition.|$|E

The Centre of Excellence in Changes in Sacred Texts and Traditions (CSTT) is a large community and the research topics we operate with resonate only to a certain extent with those of our colleagues. Some of the most fruitful and engaging discussions within the entire group have been those that somehow address philosophy of research and involve everyone. Both aspects, research categories and community, are relevant for the CSTT. On the one hand, some researchers within the CSTT directly inquire about gender in antiquity. On the other hand, any research that deals with cultural objects left behind by ancient people is necessarily dealing with gender to some degree, as gender (just like social class) is generally a significant part of human societies...|$|R

40|$|The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Fremantle Campus July {{graduation}} ceremony saw School of Nursing Lecturer, Christine Michel, graduate {{as the first}} PhD student from the School of Nursing. Notre Dame’s School of Nursing opened in 2000 and its Doctoral Degree program was introduced in 2003. Under the supervision of Professor Selma Alliex, Dean of the School of Nursing, Dr Michel’s topic: Implementing A Forensic Educational Package for Registered Nurses in Two Emergency Departments in Western Australia, looked at forensic education for nurses in Western Australia. In particular, it focused on emergency departments. “I chose the emergency department (ED) because that is my speciality. EDs are where you see {{a higher percentage of}} forensic patients coming in daily,” said Dr Michel. “I was introduced to forensic nursing in America in 1996. When I came home in 2000, I started working in the ED again and I unfortunately {{was one of those people}} who were on the wrong side of a patient and was assaulted at work. Nobody really knew what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and there were no protocols in place,” said Dr Michel. “Given my experience in an ED system that worked really well in America and across Canada, I thought there’s <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be <b>something</b> <b>done</b> about this. Patients shouldn’t have to feel helpless. People being on the receiving end of violence shouldn’t have to fumble their way through the system, which is what I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> because nobody knew how to guide me. ” Dr Michel looked at options of educating nurses in forensic education with the goal of empowering nurses with knowledge which she believed would greatly benefit their work. Dr Michel used many different methodologies in the process of completing her PhD. She looked through educational material and completed trials with control groups and intervention groups which involved working with several hospitals and their nursing staff. “Everybody who has been involved in the project has been very positive about the outcomes and they want the end product. People didn’t have a great knowledge of the management of forensic patients and the possible legal implications. Hopefully this will bridge that ‘knowledge gap’. ” Media contact: Rebecca Cassidy 08 9433 0611, 0408 959 13...|$|R
