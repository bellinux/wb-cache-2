5|$|The show's {{original}} puzzle {{board had}} three rows of 13 manually operated trilons, {{for a total}} of 39 spaces. On December 21, 1981, a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows (11, 13, 13 and 11 trilons) was adopted. This board was surrounded by a double-arched border of lights which flashed {{at the beginning and end}} of the round. Each trilon had three sides: a green side to represent spaces not used by the puzzle, a blank side to indicate a letter that had not been revealed, and a side with a letter on it. While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next puzzle, with these older boards in segments where more than one puzzle was present, a stop-down of taping took place during which the board was be wheeled offstage and the new puzzle loaded in by <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight of the contestants. On February 24, 1997, the show introduced a computerized puzzle board composed of 52 touch-activated monitors in four rows (12 on the top and bottom rows, 14 in the middle two). To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay, the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to reveal it. The computerized board obviated the stop-downs, allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company.|$|E
25|$|On February 28, 2016, {{after winning}} the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, during his victory lap, driver Jimmie Johnson held his <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his window, with three fingers {{extended}} in tribute to Earnhardt. This was following Johnson's 76th Cup Series win, which tied the career mark of Earnhardt's. This is also the track where Earnhardt claimed his sixth Winston Cup Series title.|$|E

His WrestleMania opponent, AJ Styles, interrupted him, {{saying that he}} wanted to stay on SmackDown, and then shook Shane's <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> respect. The following week, Styles was confirmed to stay on SmackDown and he defeated Baron Corbin and Sami Zayn, who had moved over from Raw, to become the number one contender for the United States Championship at Backlash.|$|E

25|$|Yamazaki {{was raised}} in Okinawa, growing up on the streets alone {{fighting}} against sailors during his teenage years, then as an enforcer for a criminal mob. In contrast {{with most of the}} other fighters in combat video games, Yamazaki does not use any particular martial art - he is a self-taught brawler, and uses a wide variety of attacks in his fighting, including unfair and dishonest moves such as kicking sand in his opponent's eyes, and his ever-present knife. He also rarely takes his right <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his pocket unless he is using his knife. In order to adapt him to KOF, the game planner had to provide new moves to Yamazaki. The new moves were initially noted to be failures, but designers later thought of them as successful. Yamazaki is a very sadistic person who enjoys violence as well as injuring people and making them bleed. However, he normally hides this madness with a calmer and more confident personality which he has when he is not fighting. As a criminal, Yamazaki started a rivalry with the Hong Kong detective Hon Fu, who becomes determined to arrest Yamazaki, while Yamazaki continually evades him.|$|E
2500|$|Saltwater is {{particularly}} inimical to iron artefacts including metal shipwrecks, and sea organisms will readily consume organic material such as wooden shipwrecks. [...] On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all {{the thousands of}} potential archaeological sites destroyed or grossly eroded by such natural processes, occasionally sites survive with exceptional preservation of a related collection of artifacts. An {{example of such a}} collection is the Mary Rose. Survival in this instance is largely due to the remains being buried in sediment ...|$|E
2500|$|The early Heinlein biographer {{and critic}} Alexei Panshin, in his 1968 {{biography}} Heinlein in Dimension, {{took note of}} a controversial theme: [...] "The romantic situation in this story is a very interesting, very odd one: it {{is nothing less than}} a mutual sexual interest between an engineer of thirty and a girl of twelve ('adorable' is Heinlein's word for her), that culminates in marriage after some hop-scotching around in time to adjust their ages a bit." [...] The novel [...] "worried and bothered" [...] John W. Campbell, who said [...] "Bob can write a better story, with one hand tied behind him, than most people in the field can do with both hands. But Jesus, I wish that son of a gun would take that other <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his pocket." ...|$|E

2500|$|Family members {{expressed}} {{suspicions that}} Zahau's {{hands and feet}} were bound. In an interview {{about a week after}} the incident, San Diego county sheriff Roy Frank stated, [...] "There are documentations of incidents throughout the country where people have secured their feet and hands as well to commit suicide," [...] to prevent themselves from changing their minds. Police re-enacted the scenario in an effort to determine whether it would have been possible for Zahau to bind herself in that fashion, and showed a video demonstration in which a woman wrapped a rope around her hands several times in front of her, slipped one <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the binding, then placed her hands behind her back, rebound them, and tightened the bindings {{with the aid of a}} string similar to the one which police found in Zahau's hands.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{time after}} the {{beginning}} of the pull, the other arm begins its recovery. The recovery moves the elbow in a semicircle in a vertical plane in the swimming direction. The lower arm and the hand are completely relaxed and hang down from the elbow close to the water surface and close to the swimmer's body. The beginning of the recovery looks similar to pulling the <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the back pocket of a pair of pants, with the small finger upwards. Further into the recovery phase, the hand movement has been compared to pulling up a center zip on a wetsuit. [...] The recovering hand moves forward, with the fingers trailing downward, just above the surface of the water. In the middle of the recovery one shoulder is rotated forward into the air while the other is pointing backwards to avoid drag due to the large frontal area which at this specific time is not covered by the arm. To rotate the shoulder, some twist their torso while others also rotate everything down to their feet.|$|E
2500|$|Piper {{goes through}} a Boom Tube to Apokolips that opens {{in front of him}} after {{thinking}} he's seeing the [...] "light {{at the end of the}} tunnel". Once on Apokolips, Piper begins to despair, thinking he is in Hell, and contemplates pulling Trickster's <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its cuff and killing himself. Piper is stopped by an unknown person before he sets off the bomb. The person reveals himself to be Desaad, who frees Piper from the cord, which is revealed to be based on his technology. Desaad claims Piper is able to channel the Anti-Life Equation in a manner beyond that of a New God. However, before Piper can play the equation on his pipe, Brother Eye finishes assimilating Apokolips. After recovering, Desaad confesses to masterminding Trickster and Piper's ordeal. However, they are attacked by an OMAC and Piper is captured. Desaad continues to pursue Piper and convinces him to finally play. Piper uses his pipe to kill Desaad and destroy Apokolips (the latter by playing Queen's [...] "The Show Must Go On", knowing it would be the last he would perform), causing Brother Eye to escape when Apokolips explodes. Piper reawakens in Gotham City and decides to become a hero after seeing the Bat-Signal.|$|E

2500|$|Eddie and Jake {{give their}} {{statements}} at police headquarters. Jake learns that Eddie {{wanted to be}} a policeman like his father. But he lost an eye in a training accident, and having a glass eye means he cannot now join the force. The two go to Eddie's place and start having sex. [...] Jake handcuffs Eddie to his bed and goes in search of condoms. As he's returning, the killer stabs him and leaves him for dead. Eddie hears the struggle and calls out. As the killer approaches and Eddie struggles with the cuffs, Jake hits the killer from behind with a baseball bat. Eddie slips a <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cuffs, tends to Jake's wound and heads off to call an ambulance, but the killer wakes and disables the phone. Eddie runs to the kitchen. He finds a knife but also finds the heads of Joey, Chaz, and Tobey in a closet. Eddie evades the killer and retreats to his bedroom, locking Jake and himself in. As the killer chops at the door, Eddie retrieves his father's gun and some bullets. Eddie pushes Jake out onto the fire escape and loads the gun. The killer breaks down the door and attacks Eddie again, knocking him out the window and over the fire escape railing. As Eddie dangles from the fire escape, the killer turns toward Jake. Eddie fires the gun, grazing Jake (as Eddie lacks the stereoscopic vision and depth perception to aim well). Eddie fires again, hitting the killer in the forehead.|$|E
