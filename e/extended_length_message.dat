50|$|In most {{channel models}} with {{variable}} <b>length</b> <b>messages,</b> {{the probability of}} error-free reception diminishes in inverse proportion with increasing <b>message</b> <b>length.</b> In other words it's easier to receive a short message than a longer message. Therefore standard ARQ techniques involving variable <b>length</b> <b>messages</b> have increased difficulty delivering longer messages, as each repeat is the full length. Selective re-transmission applied to variable <b>length</b> <b>messages</b> completely eliminates the difficulty in delivering longer messages, as successfully delivered sub-blocks are retained after each transmission, {{and the number of}} outstanding sub-blocks in following transmissions diminishes. Selective Repeat is implemented in UDP transmission.|$|R

40|$|The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Message Authentication Code (MAC) is an {{authentication}} method {{which is}} widely used in practice. It {{is well known that}} the naive use of CBC MAC for variable <b>length</b> <b>messages</b> is not secure, and a few rules of thumb for the correct use of CBC MAC are known by folklore. The first rigorous proof of the security of CBC MAC, when used on fixed <b>length</b> <b>messages,</b> was given only recently by Bellare, Kilian and Rogaway [3]. They also suggested variants of CBC MAC that handle variable <b>length</b> <b>messages</b> but in these variants the <b>length</b> of the <b>message</b> has to be known in advance (i. e., before the message is processed). We study CBC authentication of real time applications in which the <b>length</b> of the <b>message</b> is not known until the message ends, and furthermore, since the application is real-time, {{it is not possible to}} start processing the authentication only after the message ends. We first present a variant of CBC MAC, called double MAC (DMAC) which handles messages of variable unknown lengths. Computing DMAC on a message is virtually as simple and as efficient as computing the standard CBC MAC on the message. We provide a rigorous proof that its security is implied by the security of the underlying block cipher. Next, we argue that the basic CBC MAC is secure when applied to prefix free message space. A message space can be made prefix free by authenticating also the (usually hidden) last character which marks the end of the message...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an attack on}} Anderson and Lomas's proposed password-based authenticated key exchange protocol that uses collisionful hash functions. The weaknesses of the protocol when an old session key is compromised are studied and alternative solutions are given. 1 Introduction Cryptographic hash functions are used for providing security {{in a wide range}} of applications [2, 8]. A collision-free hash function uniformly maps an arbitrary <b>length</b> <b>message</b> into a fixed <b>length</b> <b>message</b> digest, so that, finding two distinct messages that produce the same digest is computationally infeasible. This property of hash functions is used to provide data integrity. A typical application of hash functions is to generate a checksum of a message whose integrity needs to be protected. Additionally, one can incorporate a secret key in the hashing process function to provide protection against an active intruder who wishes to modify the message or impersonate the message originator. Such functions [...] ...|$|R

This answers a previously open conjecture of Bellare and Palacio on the existence of fully plaintext-aware encryption schemes. ...|$|R
