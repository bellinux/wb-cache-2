The coefficient-based method for low-rise masonry buildings is then calibrated by the published experimental results obtained from shaking table tests.

Preliminary trials were conducted in a two-dimensional environment, and accelerometer data was used to estimate heading and generate positional maps of the paths traveled.

40|$|Drift current {{near the}} sea surface has an {{important}} effect on momentum, heat, and mass transfers across the air-sea interface, and consequently, influences physical, chemical, and biological processes within the upper ocean and the atmospheric surface layer. These currents also govern dispersion of oil slicks, chemical pollutants and other man-made discharges near the sea surface. Accurate estimates of sea surface drift currents are critical to forecasting slick transport and fate. The majority of existing drift models employ a <b>drift</b> <b>factor</b> and deflection angle, based on local wind speed, to estimate the sea surface drift vector. In addition, the models are restricted to deep water regions. The effects of wind induced shear and wave induced transport are lumped together in these formulations. In the present study the conservation of momentum, water mass, and turbulent energy equations are solved using an implicit finite difference method to predict the vertical distribution of current, turbulent energy, and eddy viscosity at one point. The model includes coupling between the wave and shear induced currents and is valid for both deep and shallow water. Input energy from the atmosphere to the turbulent energy and the current fields are represented through free surface boundary conditions. The numerical model showed excellent agreement to analytic solutions of the wind forced shear flow problems. ^ The model was applied to predict surface drift currents for various wind speeds and gave results in general agreement with field observations and other numerical/theoretical studies. ^ In deep water the model predicted <b>drift</b> <b>factor</b> and deflection angle decreased with increasing wind speed.

Most of the QoS (Quality of Service) metrics known so far assume that the communication channel is lossless. In this paper, since we use UDP for CM data transmission, we adopt a new QoS metric that is applicable to lossy streams to evaluate the performance of our CM server.

In {{this paper}} a {{physically}} based snow transport model (SnowTran- 3 D) {{was used to}} simulate snow drifting over a 30 m grid and was compared to detailed snow water equivalence (SWE) surveys on three dates within a small 0. 25 km 2 subwatershed, Upper Sheep Creek. Two precipitation scenarios and two vegetation scenarios were used to carry out four snow transport model runs in order to (1) evaluate the blowing snow model, (2) evaluate {{the sensitivity of the}} snow transport model to precipitation and vegetation inputs, and (3) evaluate the linearity of snow accumulation patterns and the utility of the <b>drift</b> <b>factor</b> concept in distributed snow modeling. Spatial comparison methods consisted of (1) pointwise comparisons of measured and modeled SWE, (2) visual comparisons of the spatial maps, (3) comparisons of the basin-wide average SWE, (4) comparisons of zonal average SWE in accumulation and scour zones, and (5) comparisons of distribution functions. We found that the basin average modeled SWE was in reasonable agreement with observations and that visually the spatial pattern of snow accumulation was well represented except for a pattern shift. Pointwise comparisons between the modeled and observed SWE maps displayed significant errors. The distribution functions of SnowTran- 3 D-modeled drift factors from two precipitation scenarios on three dates were compared with the distribution function of observation-based drift factors obtained previously by calibration to evaluate the assumption of linearity. We found only a 14 % reduction in explained variance in the distribution function of drift factors for a 69 % increase in precipitation, suggesting that the simplification provided by the use of <b>drift</b> <b>factor</b> distributions will result in errors that are tolerable in many cases. 1...|$|E

Forecasting oil spill reverse trajectories to determine the exact oil spill sources is crucial for taking proactive and effective emergency measures. In this study, the backward-in-time model (BTM) is proposed for identifying sources of oil spills in the East China Sea. The wind, current and random walk are three major factors in the simulation of oil spill sources. The wind drag coefficient varies along with {{the uncertainty of the}} wind field, and the random walk is sensitive to various traits of different regions, these factors are taken as constants in most of the state-of-the-art studies.

It can be well adapted to the regional characteristics of different sea areas. The correlation factor between predicted positions and actual locations of the drifters is used to estimate optimal coefficients of the BTM. A comparison between the BTM and the traditional method is also made in this study.

With this being said, there is limited literature on the interaction effects between these individual factors. This dissertation focuses specifically on quality, value, low volatility and momentum and determines which factors have the largest impact on portfolio return. In addition to testing these single factor portfolios, the various interaction effects between the individual factors are investigated. This framework is divided into two parts. The first, is an empirical study on the JSE Top 100 over the 15 year period beginning September 2001 and ending September 2016. Quarterly and monthly rebalancing as well as transaction costs of 100 basis points (per trade) have been employed to mimic realistic investment management.
