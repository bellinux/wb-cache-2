5|$|Like Conrad von Soest, Lochner often applied black {{cross-hatching}} on gold, {{usually to}} render metallic {{objects such as}} brooches, crowns or buckles, in <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> goldsmiths work on precious objects such as reliquaries and chalices. He was heavily influenced by the art and process of metalwork and goldsmithing, especially in his painting of gold grounds, {{and it has been}} suggested that he may have once trained as a goldsmith. Evidence of his <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> elements of their craft is apparent even in his underdrawings. Notable and elaborate painted examples include the tooled gold border of the angelic concert in his Last Judgement, and Gabriel's clasp on the outer wing of the Dombild altarpiece.|$|E

25|$|With {{his tone}} poems Amazonas (1917, first {{performed}} in Paris in 1929) and Uirapurú (1917, first performed 1935) he created works dominated by indigenous Brazilian influences. The works use Brazilian folk tales and characters, <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> {{the sounds of}} the jungle and its fauna, <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> the sound of the nose-flute by the violinophone, and not least <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> the uirapuru itself.|$|R

5|$|The lack of {{codification}} of Sharia {{leads to}} considerable variation in its interpretation and application.

5|$|After 1261, {{new church}} {{architecture}} in Constantinople consisted mainly of additions to existing monastic churches, {{such as the}} Monastery of Lips and Pammakaristos Church, {{and as a result}} the building complexes are distinguished in part by an asymmetric array of domes on their roofs. This effect may have been in <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> the earlier triple-church Pantokrator monastic complex.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDescribing complex sounds {{with words}} is a {{difficult}} task. In fact, previous {{studies have shown that}} vocal <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> sounds are more effective than verbal descriptions [Lemaitre and Rocchesso (2014). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 135, 862 – 873]. The current study investigated how vocal <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> sounds enable their recognition by studying how two expert and two lay participants reproduced four basic auditory features: pitch, tempo, sharpness, and onset. It used 4 sets of 16 referent sounds (modulated narrowband noises and pure tones), based on 1 feature or crossing 2 of the 4 features. Dissimilarity rating experiments and multidimensional scaling analyses confirmed that listeners could accurately perceive the four features composing the four sets of referent sounds. The four participants recorded vocal <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> the four sets of sounds. Analyses identified three strategies: (1) Vocal <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> pitch and tempo reproduced faithfully the absolute value of the feature; (2) Vocal <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> sharpness transposed the feature into the participants' registers; (3) Vocal <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> onsets categorized the continuum of onset values into two discrete morphological profiles. Overall, these results highlight that vocal imitations do not simply mimic the referent sounds, but seek to emphasize the characteristic features of the referent sounds within the constraints of human vocal production...|$|R

5|$|Burke also {{criticizes the}} {{learning}} {{associated with the}} French philosophes; he maintains that new ideas should not, in an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> the emerging discipline of science, be tested on society {{in an effort to}} improve it, but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the trail}} of the related {{negative}} publicity, Turner accepted the lead role in Ross Hunter's remake of <b>Imitation</b> <b>of</b> Life (1959) under the direction of Douglas Sirk. Universal Studios capitalized on her new-found notoriety; the result {{was one of the biggest}} hits of the year, and the biggest of Turner's career; she owned 50% of the earnings of the picture and during just the first year of the film's release she earned $11 million. According to Hunter, the film made an excess of $50 million in box office receipts. Critics and audiences could not help noticing that the plots of Peyton Place and <b>Imitation</b> <b>of</b> Life each seemed to mirror certain parts of Turner's private life. Specifically, both films depicted the troubled, complicated relationship between a single mother and her teenaged daughter.|$|E

5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit.

However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E
