We discuss the CATSIM (CATastropheSIMulation) model developed at IIASA for assistance in such planning exercises. CATSIM represents a simple but risk-based economic framework for evaluating economic disaster impacts, and {{the costs and benefits}} of measures for reducing those impacts. CATSIM uses stochastic simulation of disaster risks in a specified region and examines the ability of the government and private sector to <b>finance</b> <b>relief</b> and recovery. The model is interactive in the sense that the user can change parameters and test different assumptions about hazards, exposure, vulnerability, general economic conditions and the government's ability to respond. As a capacity building tool it can illustrate the tradeoffs and choices government authorities are confronted with for increasing their economic resilience to the impacts of catastrophic events. The model can be used for supporting policy planning processes for the allocation of resources between ex-ante spending on disaster risk management (such as prevention, national reserve funds, sovereign insurance) and ex-post spending on relief and reconstruction.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an Ex Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program Engagement for Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone has had almost continuous involvement with IMF programs since 1994 under {{a variety of}} arrangements.

Their near-term objectives, however, varied with existing circumstances. Each of the programs emphasized disciplined macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Performance relative to program objectives improved over time and was the strongest under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.
