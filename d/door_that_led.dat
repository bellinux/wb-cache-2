5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E
25|$|According {{to court}} transcripts, at {{approximately}} 5:00a.m. on March 11, 1979, Stanley Williams entered the Brookhaven Motel lobby and then broke down the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> {{to the private}} office. Inside the office, Williams shot and killed Yen-Yi, Tsai-Shai, and Yu-Chin, after which he emptied the cash register and fled the scene.|$|E
500|$|Hitler's {{accommodations}} {{were in this}} newer, lower section, and by February 1945 it {{had been}} decorated with high-quality furniture taken from the Chancellery, along with several framed oil paintings. After descending the stairs into the lower section and passing through the steel door, {{there was a long}} corridor with a series of rooms on each side. On the right side were a series of rooms which included generator/ventilation rooms and the telephone switchboard. On the left side was Eva Braun's bedroom/sitting room (also known as Hitler's private guest room), an ante-chamber (also known as Hitler's sitting room), which led into Hitler's study/office. On the wall hung a large portrait of Frederick the Great, [...] one of Hitler's heroes. A door led into Hitler's modestly furnished bedroom. Next to it was the conference/map room (also known as the briefing/situation room) which had a <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> out into the waiting room/ante-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, there's a cab at the door!" [...] cried Inglewood, {{springing}} {{up with an}} unconscious energy and bursting open the glass <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> into the garden.|$|R
60|$|At <b>that</b> {{moment the}} <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> {{to the palace}} flew open {{and the people of}} Ev and the people of Oz were {{disclosed}} to view. They paused, astonished, at sight of the warriors and the angry Nome King, seated in their midst.|$|R
60|$|But Cassy laughed wildly, {{and fled}} on. He heard her open the entry <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the garret. A wild {{gust of wind}} swept down, {{extinguishing}} the candle he held in his hand, {{and with it the}} fearful, unearthly screams; they seemed to be shrieked in his very ear.|$|R
60|$|She {{pointed to}} the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> into the dining-room. Julian hesitated.|$|E
60|$|Lucilla rose, bitterly disappointed, {{and opened}} the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> into her own room.|$|E
60|$|At the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> {{from the}} {{verandah}} to the doctor's consulting-room, {{he paused and}} smiled.|$|E
50|$|The two L-1011 {{aircraft}} {{delivered to}} Pacific Southwest Airlines were configured with internal airstair <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> into an entry hall {{in what was}} normally the forward lower baggage hold. This was to allow operations from airfields {{that did not have}} terminal buildings with jet bridges. These two aircraft were later in service with Aeroperú and Worldways Canada.|$|R
5000|$|... “Shaw kept {{everybody}} {{in their little}} kingdom,” Kwei told The Hollywood Reporter in 2011. “Directors in one block and stars in the next building... My mother was a Foley artist and I was used to coconut shells, buckets of gravel and <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> nowhere on a sound stage. My math tutor was the projectionist. I grew up there." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{payphone}} was a touch {{tone and}} was {{located on the}} left of the [...] "Restrooms" [...] door in the pilot episode. For the first season, it was moved {{to the right of the}} <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the kitchen section of the diner. For the second season, it was moved to the wall between the two <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> became two separate restrooms and was replaced by a phone with a rotary dial. From 1978 to 1985, the phone was a touch tone and was located at a section that was a few steps away from the entrance to the diner.|$|R
60|$|As {{the words}} passed his lips, the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> {{to the picture}} gallery was opened. Lord Loring entered the library.|$|E
60|$|The nurse moved {{softly to}} the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> into the passage and locked it, putting the key into her pocket.|$|E
60|$|Blanche {{had barely}} left the room, by the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> into the hall, when Geoffrey entered it {{by one of}} the lower windows opening from the lawn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a word," [...] Caldwell promised as {{they left}} the office {{together}} and went downstairs to the strong iron <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the Cotton Department. The showing through of occasional visitors had grown rather tiresome; but now his curiosity and interest were aroused, he was conscious of a keen stimulation when he glanced at Janet's face. Its illumination perplexed him. The effect was that of a picture obscurely hung and hitherto scarcely noticed on which the light had suddenly been turned. It glowed with a strange and disturbing radiance....|$|R
50|$|The west corner has a 6 meter high <b>door</b> <b>that</b> {{originally}} <b>led</b> to {{a wooden}} staircase. Internally, the tower {{is divided into}} three floors.The tower is a small circular tower with a base. It once had a massive walled fence.|$|R
50|$|This new {{restaurant}} converted the 1933 addition {{at the back}} of the building into a bar and sitting (waiting) area for guests. The bar had an impressive bar wood and a large fireplace that welcomed visitors to warm themselves in the winter and housed bouquets constructed from donations from the walled garden (The Friends of Maplelawn) in the warmer months. The western side of the addition housed French <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to a large flagstone patio and outdoor reception area. The patios and reception areas were extensively renovated by a landscape architect who, with the help of their team, did an outstanding job.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the tall}} man opened a little <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> into a dark passage, and Beppo {{followed}} him. They went along the passage, and then the man opened another door.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish {{to speak}} to him," [...] said La Fleur, and with a very slight nod of the head she left the kitchen by the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> into the grounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "One moment! one moment, my lord," [...] said Jellyband, as {{he threw}} open the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> {{to the kitchen and}} shouted lustily: [...] "Sally! Hey, Sally there, are ye ready, my girl?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now the {{gooseberry}} garden had {{two doors}} {{by which it}} might be entered, and once a small person like Nicholas could slip in there he could effectually disappear from view amid the masking growth of artichokes, raspberry canes, and fruit bushes. The aunt had many {{other things to do}} that afternoon, but she spent an hour or two in trivial gardening operations among flower beds and shrubberies, whence she could keep a watchful eye on the two <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the forbidden paradise. She was a woman of few ideas, with immense powers of concentration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{platform}} has two staircases in {{the center}} that go up to a passageway, which leads to three elevators. The floor of the passageway contains a 1987 artwork titled Clark Street Passage by Ray Ring and the elevators go up to fare control, {{which is on the}} first floor of the now-defunct Hotel St. George. The station is not fully ADA-accessible, since there are no elevators or ramps that lead to the platform. The fare control area contains a small arcade of businesses and two <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the former lobby and checking room of the hotel. The station's two entrances have awnings that read [...] "Hotel St. George." ...|$|R
50|$|When Bute House {{was first}} {{furnished}} {{as an official}} residence in 1970, this room was intended as the Library or private study of the Secretary of State. With {{the establishment of the}} Scottish Government in 1999, it became the cabinet room. The original appearance of the room, with its robust colour scheme picking up the brown marble of the chimneypiece, is recorded in Harry More Gordon’s conversation piece portraying all the successive Secretaries of State for Scotland. This room retains its original cornice but the chimneypiece and the shaped treatment of the south wall, which replaces the 19th-century double folding <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> into the front drawing room, were introduced in 1923 by Lord Bute and Balfour Paul.|$|R
60|$|As {{the youth}} {{passed through the}} <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the room beyond, Gian Maria caught {{for a moment the}} accents of an {{exquisite}} male voice singing a love-song to the accompaniment of a lute.|$|E
60|$|Carrie turned when he did, and {{in another}} moment she was {{standing}} {{with her back to}} the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the corridor, while Eveline Annersly, who gasped, looked at her with horror in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} speech failed Mr. Carmyle, for, {{even as he}} began the sentence, the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the {{bathroom}} opened and Gerald Foster came out. Mr. Carmyle gaped at Gerald: Gerald gaped at Mr. Carmyle.|$|E
5000|$|... “If {{today for}} convenience’s sake the museum keyword ‘Exit’ hangs over <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> once <b>led</b> {{directly}} to a certain death,” says Gottfried Knapp, “then the thoughtless analogy with reference systems, distorted through this discrepancy, takes on a macabre dimension.” Controversial entries in the guestbooks of the Badischer Kunstverein in Karlsruhe and the Lenbachhaus in Munich attest to viewers’ intense and uneasy reactions to “EXIT” in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|A {{dozen or}} so SS men drove the women along with whips and fixed bayonets {{all the way to}} the {{building}} and from there up three steps to a hall. There the askers counted 750 people for each gas chamber. Those women who tried to resist were bayoneted until the blood was running. Eventually all the women were forced into the chambers. I heard the doors being shut; I heard shrieks and cries; I heard desperate calls for help in Polish and in Yiddish. I heard the blood- curdling wails of women and the squeals of children, which after a short time became one long, horrifying scream. This went on for fifteen minutes. The engine worked for twenty minutes. Afterwards there was total silence. Then the askers pushed open the <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> outside. — Rudolf Reder, Bełżec ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first single}} was [...] "Hidin' from Love" [...] in 1980 (#43 on the Billboard dance charts) which was {{followed}} up by [...] "Give Me Your Love" [...] and [...] "Remember". Although the album never received any US notoriety on its debut, {{it was the}} <b>door</b> opener <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to getting radio play, tours, management, agents and the music business in general, interested in the 20-year-old songwriter.|$|R
60|$|She {{opened the}} <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> into her bedchamber, and shut herself in. Perfectly impenetrable to any repulse {{that could be}} offered to her, Mrs. Sowler looked at the closed door with a sardonic smile, and waited.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{turned to}} a <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to {{the kitchen of the}} house. The door was shut, and he tried in vain to open it. The others were behind him and they, too, tried to open the barrier.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Hetty Bumpus, a tall thin maiden lady, {{with a sharp}} eye {{and pointed}} nose, went with her; but at the <b>door</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the dining-room both stopped short, and after one look came flying back, calling out together,-- ...|$|E
500|$|When Berlin was {{a divided}} city, the Berlin Wall ran along Bernauer Straße. [...] The street itself {{belonged to the}} French sector of West Berlin and the East German {{authorities}} declared that the windows and <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> out onto Bernauer Straße should be bricked up. [...] In the early morning of 22 August 1961, Ida Siekmann {{was the first of}} 98 people to die while attempting to escape. [...] She was living on the fourth floor of number 48 (third floor, 3te Stock, by German standards), threw bedding and some possessions down onto the street, and jumped out of the window of her apartment. She fell on the sidewalk and was severely injured, dying shortly afterwards {{on her way to the}} Lazarus Hospital. [...] On 8 March 1989, Winfried Freudenberg became the last person to die in an attempt to escape from East Germany to West Berlin across the Berlin Wall by falling from his balloon.|$|R
50|$|After renovations and {{extensions}} in 1896, Wood Street was {{the largest}} Congregational church in South Wales, with 2000 people regularly attending its services. Although the scandal had not been fatal, the church's finances remained delicate until the late 1910s. In , an adjoining building, the Rapers Hotel, was purchased by the Cardiff & District Congregational Board, and was used by Wood Street as a Sunday School. The Big Tent Mission, {{one of the earliest}} Evangelist movements, pitched its camp behind the church in 1923. The two World Wars, combined with the Great Depression, caused the church to fall on leaner times. Temperance Town was demolished in the late 1930s, depriving the church of many of its attendees. The building subsequently fell into a poor condition. In 1964, three young architectural students inspected the run-down building, and discovered that it had several unusual construction quirks: <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> nowhere, windows which were actually false, and five doors facing onto Havelock Street which had brick walls behind them.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the city}} and castle is a vast {{labyrinth}} of connected passageways and cellars, Znojmo Catacombs, developed in the 14th and 15th century for defensive purposes and containing wells, drainage, fireplaces, trap <b>doors</b> and escapeways <b>that</b> <b>led</b> beyond the fortifications of the city.|$|R
