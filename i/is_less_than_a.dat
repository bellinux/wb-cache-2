5|$|Interstate 805 (I-805) {{is a major}} north–south Interstate Highway in Southern California.

5|$|Saturn (9.5AU), {{distinguished}} by its extensive ring system, has several similarities to Jupiter, {{such as its}} atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> third as massive, at 95 Earth masses. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn {{are made up of}} small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 62 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity. Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is large and}} triangular, with a pointed apex and a concave {{trailing}} margin; it originates roughly over the posterior insertions of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> third {{as high as the}} first, and originates ahead of the anal fin. There is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The long pectoral fins are broad and slightly falcate (sickle-shaped), becoming narrow and pointed at the tips. The anal fin has a sharply notched trailing margin. The caudal peduncle has a deep notch on its upper surface at the caudal fin origin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical, with a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near its tip.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Mercury the maximal apparent brightness of Venus {{as seen from}} Earth does not occur at phase angle zero.

Near inferior conjunction the planet typically fades to about magnitude −3 although the exact value depends on the phase angle.
