5|$|A {{special unit}} of the Stasi secret police worked covertly within the Grenztruppen, posing as regular border guards, between 1968 and 1985, to weed out {{potential}} defectors.

Stasi operatives were <b>directly</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> some aspects of security; passport control stations at crossings were manned by Stasi officers wearing Grenztruppen uniforms.|$|E

Districts are <b>directly</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers. The voting members of each district consist of volunteer representatives from each chartered organization having at least one BSA unit, plus annually elected members-at-large who in turn elect the district chairman.

5|$|Flooding from Komen was {{worst in}} Rakhine State, where water {{distribution}} was contaminated, and entire towns were largely destroyed. Waters started to recede by August4, allowing residents to return home; by September 2015, {{most of the}} displaced residents nationwide had returned home. High winds in Lailenpi within Chin State damaged a school and a training center for community health workers. Four schools were damaged nationwide by Komen alone. The storm and the preceding floods damaged 490,000houses and destroyed another 21,000, causing 132deaths, at least 55 of whom in Rakhine State. Komen was <b>directly</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> at least 39deaths in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, however, it was {{reported}} that the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be <b>directly</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.|$|E

5|$|Asad's {{resolution}} in confronting the khagan, and the wise strategic choice of making Balkh his residence, paid off, and {{allowed him to}} salvage a situation that, {{in the wake of}} several defeats {{at the hands of the}} Turgesh, appeared seemingly hopelessâ€”indeed, Caliph Hisham is said to have been incredulous at the first news of Asad's victory. The victory at Kharistan consolidated the Arab position in Khurasan, and particularly in Tokharistan, where the local rulers would certainly have gone over to the Turgesh if the latter had won or remained unopposed. Conversely the defeat diminished the prestige of Suluk, and may possibly have played a role in his assassination early in 738, although rivalries between the Turgesh, fanned by the Chinese court, were more <b>directly</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> it. The Turgesh khaganate then collapsed into infighting, and stopped being a serious threat to Arab interests in the area. As a result, the Battle of Kharistan is considered a turning point for the Arab fortunes in Central Asia.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{automotive}} industry and others were <b>directly</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the decline of public transportation. The Great American streetcar scandal saw GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90percent of city trolleys had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued {{that this was a}} deliberate destruction of streetcars {{as part of a larger}} strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. In United States v. National City Lines, Inc., many were found guilty of antitrust violations. The story has been explored several times in print, film and other media, for example in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Taken for a Ride and The End of Suburbia.|$|E

Citrus officials estimated a loss of 15,000metric tons of grapefruit on the Isle of Youth, while strong winds ruined 66,000metric tons of citrus trees in the Havana area. Charley also destroyed around 57,000acres (230kmÂ²) of fruit trees in the Havana area. Approximately 95% of the sugar cane, bean, and banana crops were affected in Cuban territory. In all, Charley was <b>directly</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> four deaths in Cuba, and was responsible for $923million in property damage, primarily from agricultural losses.|$|E

Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in Institutional Care, which brought to wide public notice the experiences of children who had been placed in care in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was <b>directly</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of abuse or neglect; the Select Committee on Mental Health, which contributed to widespread discussion of mental health issues and to a major funding boost for services in 2006; and the 2006 inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, which contributed to a government decision not to proceed with controversial migration legislation.|$|E

In personal command of the FIRST Marine Raider Battalion during the initial operation, Colonel Edson advanced the attack of his Battalion and its supporting units with such skill, courage and aggressiveness that he was an inspiration to the entire Combat Group and was <b>directly</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the capture of Tulagi Island.

5|$|The lack of radial nodes in the 2p {{subshell}} is <b>directly</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{many of the}} anomalous {{properties of}} the first row of the p-block, especially in nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The 2p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the 2s shell, facilitating orbital hybridisation. It also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the 2s and 2p shells, resulting in very high electronegativities. Hypervalency is almost unknown in the 2p elements for the same reason, because the high electronegativity {{makes it difficult for}} a small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron-rich three-center four-electron bond since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself. Thus, despite nitrogen's position at the head of group 15 in the periodic table, its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.|$|E
