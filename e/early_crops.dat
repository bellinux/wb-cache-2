5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for <b>early</b> <b>crops,</b> while heavy clays retain moisture better and are more suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce <b>early</b> <b>crops</b> the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E

25|$|Before European Settlement in South Australia {{much of the}} Adelaide Plains was {{swamps and}} woodland. In {{what was to become}} Burnside, plains leading out to Unley hosted the large Black Forest of Grey Box woodland, to the north the {{floodplains}} of First and Second Creeks there was Blue Gum and River Red Gum. Nearer to the foothills, in Mount Osmond and Waterfall Gully a more diverse range of plant species existed; Manna Gum and Blue Gum were predominant however. With colonisation underway, much of the native foliage was cut down to be used for crops and grazing. Market Gardens in the Adelaide Hills lowered the amount of water flowing down the creeks and some of the Hills Face was used for quarrying. <b>Early</b> <b>crops</b> grown included olive groves, grapes for winewaking, wheat and barley. Agriculture greatly declined and only vineyards survive today in Magill and Waterfall Gully.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} work studied the {{occurrence}} of Ochratoxin A (OTA) in dried beans from southern Bahia (Brazil) harvested in two periods of the year (<b>early</b> <b>crop</b> and harvest seasons) then fermented and dried under the sun. Nearly 92. 5 % of the cocoa samples presented OTA levels below the limits suggested by the European Community (2 μg/kg). The highest toxin content was found in fine and flavour cocoa beans harvested in the <b>early</b> <b>crop.</b> Ochratoxigenic species of the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium were isolated from the cocoa beans.

40|$|Paddy {{fields are}} a major global {{anthropogenic}} source of methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O), which are very potent greenhouse gases. China has the second largest area under rice cultivation, so developing valid and reliable methods for reducing {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} while sustaining crop productivity in paddy fields is of paramount importance. We examined the effects of applying straw, a residual product of rice cultivation containing high amounts of carbon and nutrients, to rice crops during both an <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> season (5 April – 25 July 2012) and a late crop season (1 August – 6 November 2012) on CH₄ and N₂O emissions in a subtropical paddy field in southeastern China. CH₄ fluxes had two seasonal peaks, on 5 May and 28 June, in the <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> but only one peak, on 13 August, in the late crop, which could be attributed to the lower temperatures after the final tillering stage in the late crop. Straw application significantly increased mean CH₄ cumulative production (g m־²) relative to the control in the late crop (37. 3 vs. 8. 34 mg m⁻² P 0. 05). The application of straw significantly increased N₂O cumulative production relative to the control in the late crop (75. 9 vs. 43. 4 μg m⁻² h⁻¹) but decreased N₂O cumulative production by over 43 % in the <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> (15. 60 vs. 27. 27 μg m⁻² h⁻¹) (P < 0. 05). Straw application increased rice yield by 9. 63 % and 12. 58 % in <b>early</b> and late <b>crop</b> respectively. Straw incorporation decreased global warming potential in the early season, but increased it in the late season. Thus, despite straw application enhances emissions of greenhouse gases in some situations, its application in the adequate season (here <b>early</b> <b>crop)</b> may be an effective soil amendment that can increase soil fertility without enhancing or even mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases and thus climate change...|$|R
30|$|In this context, {{real-time}} <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> {{identification is}} not possible with the classical NDVI-based approach. At IRI we are investigating new alternative techniques to perform <b>early</b> <b>crop</b> identification without waiting {{to the end of}} the season. In particular, we are exploring the use of hyperspectral data and LANDSAT images which provide an increase of the available spectral data. The analysis of Hyperion hyperspectral data obtained in the middle of the growing season has led to promising results regarding crop discrimination. The study showed the strong influence of the stage of growth (i.e. the degree of crop maturity) on the spectrum morphology in the near-infrared. Second, the analysis of NDVI time series showed that <b>early</b> discrimination of <b>crops</b> is a challenging task and that the maximum NDVI is the most discriminative parameter. This latter result has been corroborated by studying the separability of the classes during the first 100 days of the phenological cycle (Valero et al., 2013). Future works will be conducted to study the intra-variability of the crop classes at the early growing stages.|$|R
