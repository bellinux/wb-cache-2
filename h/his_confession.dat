5|$|From 28 December 1945 to 4 January 1946, seven Wehrmacht {{servicemen}} {{were tried}} by a Soviet military court in Leningrad. One of them, Arno Düre, who {{was charged with}} murdering numerous civilians using machine-guns in Soviet villages, confessed to having taken part in burial (though not the execution) of 15,000 to 20,000 Polish POWs in Katyn. For this he was spared execution and was given 15 years of hard labor. <b>His</b> <b>confession</b> was full of absurdities, and thus he was not used as a Soviet prosecution witness during the Nuremberg trials. He later recanted <b>his</b> <b>confession,</b> claiming that {{he was forced to}} confess by the investigators.|$|E
5|$|Because Andrew Wilson {{was given}} a death sentence, his case was not {{reviewable}} on the same grounds by the Appellate Court, and it {{went directly to the}} Illinois Supreme Court. In April 1987, the Supreme Court overturned Andrew's conviction with a ruling that <b>his</b> <b>confession</b> had been coerced involuntarily from him while under duress. It ordered a new trial.|$|E
5|$|In August, Marsden reappears when Ben confesses Heather's murder. She {{does not}} believe <b>his</b> <b>confession,</b> {{thinking}} it is another lie to get attention from Phil. However, Ben is {{arrested and charged with}} the murder after Marsden helps DS Luke Crisp (Rufus Wright) convince Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) to implicate Ben as Heather's killer.|$|E

5|$|La Salle's mission had {{remained}} secret until 1686 when former expedition member Denis Thomas, who had deserted in Santo Domingo, {{was arrested for}} piracy. Trying to have his punishment reduced, Thomas informed his Spanish jailers of La Salle's plan to found a colony and eventually conquer Spanish silver mines. Despite <b>his</b> <b>confession,</b> Thomas was hanged.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Manfred Berg {{speculated that}} Washington {{probably}} murdered Fryer, but doubted that he raped her. The same year, Julie Armstrong of the University of South Florida argued that Washington was possibly innocent of both charges. Bernstein notes that Washington's motives {{have never been}} established. She also states that <b>his</b> <b>confession</b> could have been coerced, and that the murder weapon—perhaps the strongest evidence against him—could have been planted by authorities.|$|E
5|$|After Flores' {{murder on}} 30 May 2010—five {{years to the}} day after Holloway's disappearance—Van der Sloot fled to Chile, where he was arrested and extradited back to Peru for {{questioning}} regarding the murder. On 7 June 2010, he confessed to bludgeoning Ramírez. He later tried to formally retract <b>his</b> <b>confession,</b> claiming that he had been intimidated by the National Police of Peru and framed by the FBI. A Peruvian judge ruled on 25 June 2010 that the confession was valid and on 13 January 2012, Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment for Flores' murder.|$|E

50|$|The {{credibility}} of Quick's confessions had been widely debated in the Swedish media since 1993, up until 2008, when Quick withdrew all of <b>his</b> <b>confessions.</b> There have been consistent {{doubts about the}} reliability of his statements, and some of <b>his</b> <b>confessions</b> have been proven to be fabrications - The two African refugees Quick confessed to murdering in Norway {{were found to be}} alive and well.|$|R

5|$|Each {{successive}} {{scene in}} the sequence was shorter {{than the one before}} it by exactly one frame. The scene where Bart writes <b>his</b> <b>confession</b> was done as one long take to balance the shorter scenes elsewhere in the episode. It was animated in the United States by Dan Haskett. There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. The banana in the opening scene was colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were unfamiliar with the fruit, and the final bathtub scene was particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode was the best of several attempts.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28 April 2012, Martínez Pérez was murdered inside her home in Xalapa after being {{severely}} beaten. A suspect was arrested in October 2012 and publicly confessed to the murder, while the Mexican authorities concluded that the motive of the murder was theft. But the suspect later retracted <b>his</b> <b>confession</b> and stated that he had been tortured and threatened by officials to lie and admit to the murder. Investigators have relied solely on the suspect's confession to incriminate him; the DNA and fingerprint samples collected at the murder scene did not match the suspect's according to sources close to Committee to Protect Journalists.|$|E
5|$|Kasab's {{trial began}} on 6 May 2009. He {{initially}} pleaded not guilty, but later admitted his guilt on 20 July 2009. He initially apologised {{for the attacks}} and claimed that he deserved {{the death penalty for}} his crimes, but later retracted these claims, saying that he had been tortured by police to force <b>his</b> <b>confession,</b> and that he had been arrested while roaming the beach. The court had accepted his plea, but {{due to the lack of}} completeness within his admittance, the judge had deemed that many of the 86 charges were not addressed and therefore the trial continued.|$|E

5|$|On 16 June 2016, {{shortly after}} he {{returned}} to Hong Kong, Lam Wing-kee gave a long press conference {{in the presence of}} legislator Albert Ho in which he detailed the circumstances surrounding his eight-month detention, and describing how <b>his</b> <b>confession</b> and those of his associates had been scripted and stage-managed. Lam indicated the involvement of the Central Investigation Team, which is under direct control of the highest level of the Beijing leadership. His revelations stunned Hong Kong and made headlines worldwide, prompting a scurry of counter-accusations and denials from mainland authorities and supporters.|$|E
5|$|Sumaji withdrew <b>his</b> <b>confession,</b> then {{alleged that}} police had {{encouraged}} him to confess after plying him with alcohol and bribing him with money, a prostitute, and a better job if he confessed to the crime. Sunarti, incredulous that her husband could be a murderer, wrote letters to several high-ranking officials and bodies, including President Suharto. Only one, to the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM), received a reply: on 28 October, the commission {{announced that it would}} investigate irregularities in Sumaji's arrest and internment. Meanwhile, Sumaji's counsel and the White Kijang team located several witnesses to corroborate Sumaji's account, including the prostitute.|$|E
5|$|The Grangegorman killings {{were the}} {{homicide}} on 6 March 1997 of Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan, patients at St Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital in Grangegorman, Dublin, Ireland. After giving a false confession, Dean Lyons {{was charged with}} the murders and placed on remand. In his statement to the Garda Síochána (police), Lyons gave details that would only be known to the murderer or to the investigators. After Lyons was charged, Mark Nash confessed to the killings, but later retracted <b>his</b> <b>confession.</b> In April 2015, Nash's trial {{for the murder of}} Shields and Callinan began after an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the trial from going forward.|$|E

Beauchamp's shoe did not match a track found outside Sharp's house the morning of the murder. The posse lost a {{handkerchief}} found {{at the scene of the}} crime and believed to belong to the murderer. (Beauchamp later claimed to have stolen and burned it after the posse had gone to sleep one night).|$|E
5|$|This poem can be {{interpreted}} as criticizing the failure of the salt monopoly established by Wang Anshi, embodied in the persona of a hard-working old man who was cruelly denied his means to flavor his food, with the severity of the laws and the only salt available being charged at rates that were too expensive. After <b>his</b> <b>confession,</b> Su Shi was found guilty in court, and was summarily exiled to Hubei Province. More than thirty of his associates were also given minor punishments for not reporting his slanderous poems to authorities before they were widely circulated to the educated public.|$|E
5|$|Through <b>his</b> <b>confession,</b> Cobb makes {{peace with}} his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's {{projection}} and wakes Fischer {{up with a}} kick. Revived at the mountain hospital, Fischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake {{on the plane and}} Saito makes a phone call.|$|E

5|$|Tyrion Lannister is able {{to trick}} Lysa Arryn into {{summoning}} a court to listen to <b>his</b> <b>confession,</b> at which he confesses various misdemeanours committed during his life, but nothing about the attempt on Bran's life or Lysa's husband's death. After, Tyrion publicly demands a trial by combat, and the mercenary Bronn volunteers to fight for him. Lysa Arryn {{has no choice but}} to allow it. Bronn defeats Lysa's champion Ser Vardis Egen by tiring the heavily armored knight and kicking him out the Moon Door, and Tyrion is allowed to walk free with Bronn as his escort, much to the dismay of the Tully sisters.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had wanted}} to study for a {{doctorate}} and proceed with a career in archaeology, Buczynski was dying. He became ill with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions, leaving him irritable and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989. By this stage, he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own, including eating and dressing himself, and required almost constant care, from both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital. He began to talk with the hospital's Roman Catholic priest and finally decided to return to the faith of his birth, undertaking <b>his</b> <b>confession</b> of reconciliation in February. In March, his condition deteriorated, and he was admitted to the hospital, where he fell into a coma and died on the morning on Thursday, March 16.|$|E
5|$|As Ricko {{finishes}} <b>his</b> <b>confession,</b> {{the police}} arrive and he realises that Jared has turned him in.

In the weeks that follow, Jared's life collapses. Despite learning of Diane's illness, he moves out of her house, choosing instead to be homeless. Jared returns home one day to collect his belongings; after arguing with Diane, he confesses that he witnessed Tracy's rape and could have saved her life if he had intervened or helped her afterwards. Later that day, Jared joins Diane and Cherie in cleaning graffiti from Tracy's grave.|$|E
