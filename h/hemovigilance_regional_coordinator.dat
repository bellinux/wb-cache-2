They are responsible for conducting regular small-group meetings with family medicine trainees. This study wanted to explore the attitudes and opinions of <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators</b> and family medicine trainees concerning this new method. Methods: This was a qualitative study based on focus groups. The participants were <b>regional</b> <b>coordinators</b> and family medicine specialist trainees.
