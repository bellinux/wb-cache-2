2500|$|Without a doubt, one of {{the most}} popular dishes in Romania, and perhaps can be called the {{national}} dish is Sarmale, or Sarma in other cultures of the Balkans, and the Caucasus; a mixture of pork, beef, and lamb, or just plain pork, with onions and rice, wrapped in semi-sour cabbage or grape leaves, and then placed usually in a porcelain pot with tomato paste and pork cuts. This dish is then slow-cooked, and commonly served with cornmeal (mămăligă, which is a type of polenta). One of the most common meals is the mămăligă, a cornmeal mush, for a long time considered the [...] "poor man's meal" [...] (N-are nici o mămăligă pe masă - [...] "He hasn't even a mămăligă on the table"), but it has become very appreciated in recent times. Pork is the main meat used in Romanian cuisine, but also beef is consumed and a good lamb or fish dish is never to be refused. In conjunction with special events or periods, different recipes are prepared. During Christmas, nearly every family slaughters a pig and cooks it using a wide variety of traditional recipes like cârnaţi - a type of long sausage with meat; caltaboşi - sausages made with liver and other internal organs; piftie - a jelly made from parts like the feet, head and ears; tochitură (a kind of stew) - served along with mămăligă and wine ("so that the pork can swim"); and tobă (<b>head</b> <b>cheese).</b> The meal is sweetened with the traditional cozonac (sweet bread with nuts, poppy seeds or lokum - rahat in Romanian, known in English as Turkish delight). Lamb is traditional for Easter; the main dishes are borș de miel (lamb sour soup), roast lamb and drob - a cooked mix of offal, meat and fresh vegetables, which is quite similar to Scottish haggis, served with pască (pie made with cottage cheese) as a sweetener.|$|E
