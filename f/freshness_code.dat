50|$|Archway's {{flagship}} varieties were Oatmeal, Date-Filled Oatmeal, Frosty Lemon, Molasses and Pecan Ice Box, with Oatmeal varieties {{accounting for}} {{thirty percent of}} product sales. The company emphasized its home-made and freshness approach to baking cookies, and often used the term 'Archway Homestyle Cookies'. Most varieties were packaged in two stacks of six large cookies, and wrapped in clear cellophane with a <b>freshness</b> <b>code</b> printed on the front label. Many varieties, such as Ruth's Golden Oatmeal, were 'state fair winning' recipes, selected from among entries of company-sponsored baking competitions. Archway's product line quickly expanded to several dozen varieties, including many classic and unique selections; Peanut Jumble, Rocky Road, Mississippi Mud Cake, Fudge Nut Bar, German Chocolate, Black Walnut Ice Box, Date Nut Bar, Iced Spice, New Orleans Cake, Pineapple Filled, Sour Cream, Soft Sugar, and Cookie Jar Hermit.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} Compact-Security (C-Sec), {{an energy}} efficient link layer encryption protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The protocol minimizes energy consumption {{by eliminating the}} need for transmitting all header and trailer fields related to security, while keeping security functions and services intact. Such fields include message authentication <b>code,</b> <b>freshness</b> counter, and source address. Our work relies on merging security related data with the essential headers of the next packet. This will dramatically reduce security related communication overhead. In addition, it includes a unique security feature that does not exist in any of the current protocols: hiding the packet header information. C-Sec is implemented using Very high speed integrated circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL). Experimental results using synthesis for Spartan- 6 low-power FPGA demonstrates that the proposed protocol outperforms related work in terms of computational time and energy consumption, in addition to the large savings in communication energy and bandwidth...|$|R
40|$|Security plays a {{vital role}} in Wireless Personal Area Network where the data has to be {{transmitted}} in free space. The security of the data depends upon the key used for encryption/decryption. Also a secret key has to be shared among the nodes to establish a secure link. The secret key should be resilient to attacks. Key distribution among the nodes in Wireless Personal Area Network is a challenging task. To guarantee the message <b>freshness,</b> a rolling <b>code</b> sequence is appended with the transmitted message. In this paper, various feedback shift registers were analyzed for generating the rolling code and a polynomial based Key distribution scheme is proposed for secured communication protocol in Wireless Personal Area Network. Nonlinear feedback shift register with high linear complexity is used for generating the rolling code. Also the Node Capture Impact for the proposed scheme is compared with other existing scheme. The proposed scheme features a Node Capture Impact equals to zero for even any number of compromised nodes, which is recommended characteristic of a key distribution scheme...|$|R
