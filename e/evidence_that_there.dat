5|$|In 1699 a Spanish {{expedition}} {{under the}} command of sergeant Martín de Montoya was sent from the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (formerly Nojpetén) to investigate Indian activity in the former Ch'ol and Mopan territories. He found <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were still surviving Maya in all the lands he crossed, as evidenced by the carefully tended cacao and vanilla orchards. At this time there were said to be 400 relocated Maya from the same area living in Belén.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson found no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio call was received from Amana to indicate the nature of any problem, or even that the crew was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E
5|$|The {{chapter house}} has 40sedilia lining its walls, {{and may have}} {{originally}} provided seating for more when it was the meeting room for the abbey community. In 1714 it was refurbished to become a library, and its floor was raised by about 1m (3ft). Its east end was damaged in the Bristol riots of 1831, requiring considerable restoration, {{and at that time}} or later the library furnishings were removed. In 1832, when the floor was lowered again, a Saxon stone panel depicting the Harrowing of Hell was found underneath. The discovery of the stone provides strong <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a church or shrine on the site before Robert Fitzharding founded the Abbey in 1140.|$|E

5|$|There is some <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were {{at least}} two inns during the 18th century, {{although}} their precise locations and names are unknown. In 1827, Parson and White's Directory listed the Brown Jug, adjoining Carr Hill Pottery at Carr Hill Lane {{and it is likely}} that this venue is one of those earlier inns. The second is likely the Old Fellows Inn, located near the Brown Jug at Carr Hill Lane, listed in 1844, but later listed as 'The Free Gardeners Arms". By 1856, both the Brown Jug and the Free Gardeners Arms were well established and thriving and continued to prosper well into the 20th century, under the slightly different names of The Old Brown Jug and The Gardeners Arms.|$|E

For example, 'P2' class 2001 was originally allocated '2981' until it was decided to give it a 'significant number' instead.|$|E
25|$|Evidence-based {{practice}} is {{an approach that}} tries to specify {{the way in which}} professionals or other decision-makers should make decisions by identifying such <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> may be for a practice and rating it according to how scientifically sound it may be. Its goal is to eliminate unsound or excessively risky practices in favor of those that have better outcomes.|$|E

In his senior years, he was assisted by Giovanni Ferrini, who went on to have his own distinguished career, continuing his master's tradition.

Furthermore, many patients who are 'cured' continue to have some degree of symptoms indefinitely.|$|E

25|$|The young Earth creationist {{belief that}} {{the age of the}} Earth is 6,000 to 10,000 years old {{conflicts}} with the age of 4.54 billion years measured using independently cross-validated geochronological methods including radiometric dating.

25|$|Bestiality {{is seen by}} the {{government}} of the United Kingdom as profoundly disturbed behavior (as indicated by the UK Home Office review on sexual offences in 2002). Andrea Beetz states there is <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> can be violent zoosadistic approaches to sex with animals. Beetz argues that animals might be traumatized even by a non-violent, sexual approach from a human; however, Beetz also says that in some cases, non-abusive bestiality can be reciprocally pleasurable for both the human and non-human animal.|$|E

25|$|While {{there has}} been a {{tendency}} to focus on the bystander effect in disease due to the possibility of therapeutic avenues there is <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a more central role in normal development of tissues. Death of some cells and their surrounding matrix may be required for a tissue to reach its final configuration and gap junctions also appear essential to this process. There are also more complex studies that try and combine our understanding of the simultaneous roles of gap junctions in both wound healing and tissue development.|$|E
25|$|The Swami {{received}} an anonymous threat {{only a week}} before his assassination. Ashram authorities also filed a First Information Report (or FIR) with the local police. However, no steps were taken to provide appropriate security cover to Swamiji, despite ample <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were very real threats being made on his life {{and the lives of}} those he served. The Government of Odisha would later admit that lapses might have occurred in his security and would place Kandhamal Superintendent of Police Nikhil Kanodia and officer-in-charge of Tumudibandha police station Jena under suspension.|$|E
25|$|In addition, had Uthman {{changed the}} Quran, {{it would have}} served as the clearest {{argument}} for, and major justification of, his public assassination. His opponents would have brought this up against him, {{but there are no}} records of this. Al-Khoei also argues that if Uthman had altered the Quran, Ali would have restored it to its original state upon the death of Uthman, especially if verses of his rule had been removed. Instead Ali is seen promoting the Quran during his reign, which is <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no alteration.|$|E

(2005) in which extracts of M. anisopliae showed antagonistic activity against P. luminescens, proving their antimicrobial abilities at concentrations of 1000  µg/mL.|$|R
