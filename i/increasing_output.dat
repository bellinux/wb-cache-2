2500|$|Increases in {{productivity}} {{are the major}} factor responsible for per capita economic growth – this has been especially evident since the mid-19th century. Most of the {{economic growth in the}} 20th century was due to <b>increased</b> <b>output</b> per unit of labor, materials, energy, and land (less input per widget). The balance of the growth in output has come from using more inputs. Both of these changes <b>increase</b> <b>output.</b> [...] The <b>increased</b> <b>output</b> included more of the same goods produced previously and new goods and services.|$|R

25|$|In 2001, the {{fisheries}} scientists Reg Watson and Daniel Pauly expressed concerns {{in a letter}} to Nature that China was over reporting its catch from wild fisheries in the 1990s. They said that made it appear that the global catch since 1988 was increasing annually by 300,000 tonnes, whereas it was really shrinking annually by 350,000 tonnes. Watson and Pauly suggested this may be have been related to Chinese policies where state entities that monitored the economy were also tasked with <b>increasing</b> <b>output.</b> Also, until more recently, the promotion of Chinese officials was based on production increases from their own areas.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture’s role in {{developed}} countries has drastically {{changed in the last}} century due to many factors, including refrigeration. Statistics from the 2007 census gives information on the large concentration of agricultural sales coming from {{a small portion of the}} existing farms in the United States today. This is a partial result of the market created for the frozen meat trade by the first successful shipment of frozen sheep carcasses coming from New Zealand in the 1880s. As the market continued to grow, regulations on food processing and quality began to be enforced. Eventually, electricity was introduced into rural homes in the United States, which allowed refrigeration technology to continue to expand on the farm, <b>increasing</b> <b>output</b> per person. Today, refrigeration’s use on the farm reduces humidity levels, avoids spoiling due to bacterial growth, and assists in preservation.|$|E

It represented {{an attempt to}} create a standard type, incorporating many changes which had been introduced during production of the G-6, and which led to a plethora of variants, plaguing decentralized mass production. The standardization attempt proved to be a failure, but overall the type offered improved combat performance, as MW 50 power boosting water injection (<b>increasing</b> <b>output</b> to 1,800PS (1,775hp, 1,324kW), the clear-view Erla Haube was now standard installation.

The ASM engine was built with a larger capacity supercharger, and had a higher rated altitude, and correspondingly the top speed of the G-14/AS was 560km/h (348mph) at sea level, and 680km/h (422mph) at 7.5km (24,600ft) altitude.|$|E

25|$|The second work, {{targeted}} at a specialist audience, {{was not intended}} as a textbook but {{as a means to}} show Romanian grammar as it existed in reality; this was in contrast with Tiktin's 1891 teaching manual. Philippide discussed words selected from the dictionary by Alexandru Cihac, the only one he found respectable; and from writers, Moldavians especially: Ion Creangă foremost, but also Mihai Eminescu, Alexandru Odobescu, Costache Negruzzi, Petre Ispirescu, Costache Conachi and Vasile Alecsandri; and from the Moldavian chronicles, as well as a bit of Anton Pann. The book features many examples of the spoken language, some of them in the Moldavian subdialect. He believed the examples would help illustrate the development of the language's inflection and syntax; this methodology is unique in the annals of Romanian grammar works. Here, he introduced the (debated) notion that the Romanian literary language was not based on a particular subdialect, but resulted from each one's contributions. While the Wallachian form was previously dominant, the <b>increasing</b> <b>output</b> of Moldavian writers meant that, {{by the end of the}} 19th century, the written language had become a compromise between the two.|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{analyzes}} how {{performance feedback}} {{and information on}} heterogeneity affect behavior in dynamic contests, using data on two-player-contests from a smartphone/tablet application called ``Wordblitz for Friends''. We find that players <b>increase</b> <b>output</b> as underdogs and decrease output as favorites, where being an underdog (favorite) refers to being matched against an opponent who was more (less) successful in previous contests. Performance feedback, i. e. information about past performance within one particular contest, induces players to reduce output when being ahead and <b>increase</b> <b>output</b> when being behind. The strength of these effects <b>increases</b> in <b>output</b> differences. An analysis of the interaction of information on heterogeneity and performance feedback reveals that the output reducing effect of being ahead is entirely driven by favorites, as players generally <b>increase</b> their <b>output</b> when being an underdog, independent of being ahead or behind...|$|R

As such, for 1987 the Thunderbird received a significant refresh complete with new sheetmetal and a revised front fascia with more aerodynamic single-piece headlamps. Mechanically the car was mostly unchanged. V6s models carried over port fuel injection from 1986 while the Turbo Coupe's turbocharged 4-cylinder engine gained an intercooler, <b>increasing</b> <b>output</b> to [...] and 240lbs of torque. 1988 was this Thunderbird generation's last as Ford prepared to unveil an all-new Thunderbird for 1989.|$|E
