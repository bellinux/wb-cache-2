500|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 November, Pedro II was in Petrópolis when he {{received}} the first telegram from Ouro Preto informing him of the rebellion. However, he did not assign much import to the news. At 11a.m. as he left a mass {{in honor of the}} 45th anniversary of his sister Maria II's death, the monarch received a second telegram and decided to return to Rio de Janeiro. His wife expressed concern, but he told her, [...] "On what ma'am? When I arrive there it will be over!" [...] He travelled by train, reading periodicals and scientific magazines. Not imagining the gravity of the situation, he arrived at the city palace at 3p.m. André Rebouças suggested that he go to the countryside to organize resistance. The Marquis of Tamandaré asked for his permission to lead the Armada (navy) and suppress the rebellion. He dismissed all the ideas put <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "This is nothing. I know my countrymen." [...] The Emperor asked the Conservative senator Manuel Francisco Correia what he thought of the situation. Correia answered that he believed that {{it was the end of}} the monarchy. Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the possibility.|$|E
2500|$|In his memoirs, A Moveable Feast, Ernest Hemingway {{wrote that}} [...] "Zelda Fitzgerald... leaned <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to me, telling me her great secret, 'Ernest, don't you think Al Jolson {{is greater than}} Jesus?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{relationship}} with his Jewish identity was [...] "unresolved and tragic", Davies states. He would have died without Jewish rites, had not a Jewish stranger stepped <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> the kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, over his coffin. Chagall is buried alongside his last wife Valentina [...] "Vava" [...] Brodsky Chagall, in the multi-denominational cemetery in the traditional artists' town of Saint Paul de Vence, in the French region of Provence.|$|E
50|$|Later, Dwayne Hillis, one of {{the jurors}} in the trial, came <b>forward</b> {{publicly}} <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he was pressured into a guilty verdict with assurances that Richard Paey would serve no jail term.|$|R
2500|$|Cecil Abercrombie {{played for}} United Services RFC and was capped six times for [...] between 1910 and 1913. He played as a <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> was <b>said</b> to have 'abundant energy... a splendid physique, great speed and height, {{and a good}} pair of hands'. He tackled hard and low, and was also an adept place-kicker.|$|R
6000|$|Rollo held forward {{his right}} hand, and, lo! {{it was the}} pear. But he {{could not bear to}} part with it, <b>and</b> he brought <b>forward</b> the other, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|R
2500|$|About a sequel, Shahrukh Khan said: [...] "It {{would be}} great to revisit Don after sometime. I’ve told Farhan that we could take 60 days out of our {{schedule}} and make a Don 3. But we need a script first, one that could take the last 10 minutes of Don 2 forward to another differently exciting thriller." [...] Farhan Akhtar also expressed a desire to take the story <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he was fascinated by the character of Don. However, the filmmaker wanted to explore other genres without restriction and added that he was currently focusing on his acting career.|$|E
2500|$|Before dawn on {{the second}} day, Forsyth said, [...] "Some one must go to Wallace for assistance." [...] Sharp Grover, who was chief of scouts, said [...] "It is {{impossible}} to get out." [...] Then Stilwell came <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Let me choose the man {{to go with me}} and I will go." [...] Grover said, [...] "Jack is too young and inexperienced, he can’t get through." [...] Ft. Wallace was about [...] to the south east. But Forsyth tore off the fly leaf out of his daybook, wrote a note to Col. Bankhead at Ft. Wallace, and gave it to Stilwell.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly then {{heard the}} {{approach}} of Kennedy and Scanlan, and the four gang members concealed themselves, some behind logs, {{and one in the}} tent. They forced McIntyre to sit on a log, and Kelly threatened, [...] "Mind, I have a rifle for you if you give any alarm." [...] Kennedy and Scanlan rode into the camp. McIntyre went <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Sergeant, I think you had better dismount and surrender, as you are surrounded." [...] Kelly at the same time called out, [...] "Put up your hands." [...] Kennedy appeared to think it was Lonigan who called out, and that a jest was intended, for he smiled and put his hand on his revolver case. He was instantly fired at, but not hit. Kennedy then realised the hopelessness of his position, jumped off his horse, and begged for his life, [...] "It's all right, stop it, stop it." [...] Scanlan jumped down and tried to make for a tree, but before he could unsling his rifle, he was shot and killed.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are odds between going <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> backward," [...] <b>said</b> Master Headley, dryly. [...] "Ha! Art hurt? Thou bleedst," [...] he exclaimed, laying {{his hand}} on Stephen's shoulder, and drawing him to the light.|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding this {{assertion}} she again {{looked out at}} Bob the next afternoon when his footsteps rustled on the gravel, and studied his appearance under all the varying angles of the sunlight, as if fine clothes and uniforms were not altogether a matter of indifference. He certainly was a splendid, gentlemanly, and gallant sailor {{from end to end}} of him; but then, what were a dashing presentment, a naval rank, and telling scars, if a man was fickle-hearted? However, she peeped on till the fourth day, and then she did not peep. The window was open, she looked right out, and Bob knew that he had got a rise to his bait at last. He touched his hat to her, keeping his right shoulder <b>forwards,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Good-day, Miss Garland,' with a smile.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shall come {{backwards}} <b>and</b> <b>forwards</b> continually,' <b>said</b> Arthur, 'but {{she must}} not be alone; I shall be very glad if you can stay, or I shall be driven {{to have one of}} the Mosses here.' ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{held the}} {{position}} of vice president of public affairs for the Church of Scientology International in 2009, and was a Reverend within the organization. Adams traveled to Melbourne, Australia in December 2009 for the World Religions Conference. In an appearance on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program hosted by Tony Eastley, AM, Adams stated, [...] "From one church in 1954 to ... we're in 165 nations now; we have 8,000 churches, missions and groups right across this fair earth of ours." [...] Adams disputed assertions of abuse within Scientology publicized {{on the floor of}} the Australian Senate by Senator Nick Xenophon and commented, [...] "It's not that the allegations aren't serious charges; the fact of the matter is that they are unsubstantiated rumours. Many of these so-called charges, so-called allegations are very old. I mean, 12 or 15 years ago, these incidents occurred, were thoroughly reviewed." [...] Regarding statements by Senator Xenophon that women within Scientology who became pregnant were pressured into having abortions, Adams said, [...] "That's someone's statement of... it's totally false. There's no proof whatsoever; no one has ever made... no one has come <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> here's the proof." [...] Adams asserted to The Age that all of the critical statements made by Senator Xenophon about Scientology in the Australian Senate were [...] "meritless". He commented, [...] "One way to measure that is how law enforcement responds to any of these allegations. There has been no interest because there has been no evidence. Apostates are not credible witnesses, like former spouses or employees - they are trying to find a reason why they departed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the men {{in black}} stepped <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We arrest you, {{in the name of}} the holy Inquisition, on the charge of heresy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, noting this disturbance, the King {{spoke to}} the youth at his side, who came <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> in a pleasant, courteous voice, {{addressing}} Hugh: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{seem to be}} in a hurry," [...] {{said the}} unknown Englishman, falling back a step or two in order to laugh with an unnatural heartiness. [...] "What's it all about, eh?" [...] Then before MacIan could get past his {{sprawling}} and staggering figure he ran <b>forward</b> again <b>and</b> <b>said</b> with a sort of shouting and ear-shattering whisper: [...] "I say, my name is Wilkinson. You know--Wilkinson's Entire was my grandfather. Can't drink beer myself. Liver." [...] And he shook his head with extraordinary sagacity.|$|R
5000|$|... "We wanted {{sound of}} the album to be {{straight}} <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> simple," [...] <b>said</b> Tony Rombola. [...] "I {{think that was the}} theme. There are elements of punk in some of the grooves that Sully brought in, and even in the selection of some of the riffs that I had as well. A lot of it is simpler, with some different feels." ...|$|R
2500|$|William Fennex (born c.1763 at Gerrards Cross, Bucks; died 4 March 1838 at Stepney, London) was {{a famous}} English cricketer. [...] He was a noted all-rounder and right arm fast bowler. [...] As a batsman, Fennex was reputed {{to be one of}} the first to use <b>forward</b> play <b>and</b> was <b>said</b> to be a good driver of the ball.|$|R
6000|$|The {{girl had}} {{got rid of}} her tears, and was gazing at her, and Mrs. Rooth leaned <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> portentously: [...] "She knows four languages." ...|$|E
6000|$|One of them, {{a slight}} man, made a step <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The Queen hath dropped her kerchief. Mayhap the young gentlewoman will restore it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The veiled {{attendant}} {{drew back}} and waved her hand, and some one glided <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> in a low, soft voice, [...] "You have not forgotten me?" ...|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{fighting}} during the night of August 10–11 and during {{the day of the}} 11th, the regimental commander decided that he could not safely move the regimental trains and the artillery through the pass during the day, and accordingly he had made plans to do it that night. That afternoon, however, division commander William B. Kean wanted the division to move <b>forward</b> rapidly, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that a battalion of the US 24th Infantry Regiment would come up and protect its right, north flank. General Kean apparently did not believe any considerable force of enemy troops was in the vicinity of Pongam-ni, despite representations to the contrary.|$|R
6000|$|I {{stooped to}} make sure the noose upon the idiot's neck, and flung the end over the branch, and Sikandar Khan held up the lamp that she might well see. Then {{appeared}} suddenly, a little beyond the light of the lamp, the spirit of Kurban Sahib. One hand he held to his side, even where the bullet had struck him, and the other he put <b>forward</b> thus, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "No. It is a Sahibs' war." [...] <b>And</b> I <b>said,</b> [...] "Wait a while, Child, and thou shalt sleep." [...] But he came nearer, riding, as it were, upon my eyes, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "No. It is a Sahibs' war." [...] <b>And</b> Sikandar Khan <b>said,</b> [...] "Is it too heavy?" [...] and set down the lamp and came to me; and as he turned to tally on the rope, the spirit of Kurban Sahib stood up within arm's reach of us, and his face was very angry, and a third time he said, [...] "No. It is a Sahibs' war." [...] And a little wind blew out the lamp, and I heard Sikandar Khan's teeth chatter in his head.|$|R
60|$|My kind {{friend the}} Lord Chief Commissioner offered to {{interfere}} {{to have me}} named a Privy Councillor; but besides that when one is poor he ought to avoid taking rank, I would be much happier if I thought any act of kindness was done to help <b>forward</b> Charles; <b>and,</b> having <b>said</b> so much, I made my bow, and declared my purpose of remaining satisfied with the article of my knighthood. And here I am, {{for the rest of}} my life I suppose, with a competent income, which I can [increase].|$|R
6000|$|Upon {{this the}} Indian chief again stood <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The Peigans are not double-tongued. They {{have not seen}} Pale-faces till to-day. They can say no more." ...|$|E
60|$|Several voices here {{expressed}} dissent, and {{an elderly}} seaman stepped <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that they didn't intend to become pirates, {{so they had}} better not begin with murder.|$|E
60|$|Rachel {{straightened}} herself {{upon her}} seat, gripping {{the edge of}} it with her hands, for her temper was rising, while Noie bent <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> something in her ear.|$|E
5|$|América won {{the next}} ten editions of the Mineiro, and Atlético only won the league again in 1926, led by striker Mário de Castro. In 1927, <b>forwards</b> <b>Said</b> <b>and</b> Jairo joined Castro to form an attacking {{partnership}} nicknamed the Trio Maldito ("Unholy Trio"), which guided Atlético to another state league triumph. In 1929, the club played its first international encounter, against Portuguese club Vitória de Setúbal, winning 3–1 in a match played at the Presidente Antônio Carlos Stadium. The ground had opened earlier that year, and would be the club's home for the following two decades.|$|R
60|$|Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby {{proclaim}} {{and declare}} that the said Proclamation {{does not apply}} to the cases of persons who, at the time when they seek to obtain the benefits thereof by taking the oath thereby prescribed, are in military, naval, or civil confinement or custody, or under bonds, or on parole of the civil, military, or naval authorities, or agents of the United States, as prisoners of war, or persons detained for offences of any kind, either before or after conviction; and that on the contrary it does apply only to those persons who, being yet at large, and free from any arrest, confinement, or duress, shall voluntarily come <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> take the <b>said</b> oath, with the purpose of restoring peace, and establishing the national authority.|$|R
5000|$|She told no {{one about}} the abuse until 2002, after she {{collapsed}} while jogging, and decided {{that she had to}} confront the past and stop being a victim. [...] Her story was met with disbelief and dismay by those around her, including her family. [...] However the next year, she received a letter from the US division of Wycliffe, which said that two other people who had been abused had come <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> had <b>said</b> that she too had been abused. [...] The next year Wycliffe held a meeting in the US to discuss what had happened, which Krüsi attended, and {{the full extent of the}} abuse emerged. [...] A formal report was generated by SIL International and authorities were informed, but because the statute of limitations had long expired, no legal action could be taken. [...] Additionally, three of the five perpetrators were dead at that time. [...] SIL and Wycliffe issued written apologies to Krüsi and the other people who had been abused, and provided them with some money. [...] Wycliffe also implemented numerous policy changes to protect children and SIL, together with New Tribes Mission, formed the Child Protection and Safety Network in 2006.|$|R
6000|$|As he spoke, a tall, gentlemanly-looking young man, in a red-flannel shirt, round-crowned wide-awake, long boots, and corduroys, stepped <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'll help you, if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{reaching}} the rock he advanced towards the strangers, {{both of whom}} were stout, thickset men, with grave, stern countenances. One of them stepped <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Your name is--" ...|$|E
6000|$|She came slowly towards them--erect, gray, grim--a still {{handsome}} apparition. Paul started. To his horror, Yerba ran impulsively <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> eagerly: [...] "Is he better? Can he see us now?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Things are {{not going}} well for me. My chef at the Charité {{strongly}} disapproves of women students and took this means of showing it. About a hundred men (no women except myself) went round the wards today, {{and when we were}} all assembled before him to have our names written down, he called and named all the students except me, and then closed the book. I stood <b>forward</b> upon this, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> quietly, [...] "Et moi aussi, monsieur." [...] me, Sir. He turned on me sharply, and cried, [...] "Vous, vous n'êtes ni homme ni femme; je ne veux pas inscrire vôtre nom." [...] you are neither man nor woman; I don't want to write your name. I stood silent {{in the midst of a}} dead silence." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Guatemoc came <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> {{when the}} priest would have cut {{him with the}} knife, he laughed <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> {{pointing}} to the bullet wound upon his neck: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do we," [...] said {{both girls}} eagerly. After a pause Kate clasped her knees with her locked fingers, and rocking {{backwards}} <b>and</b> <b>forwards,</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Milly <b>and</b> I have got an idea, and don't you say 'No' to it. We've had {{it ever since}} that brute talked in that way. Now, through him, we know more about this Mr. Spindler's family connections than you do; and we know all the trouble you and he'll have in getting up this party. You understand? Now, we first {{want to know what}} Spindler's like. Is he a savage, bearded creature, like the miners we saw on the boat?" ...|$|R
