5|$|Forms of {{traditional}} football have been played throughout Europe and beyond since antiquity. Many of these involved {{handling of the}} ball, and scrummage-like formations. These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighboring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers {{at each end of}} a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. These antiquated games went <b>into</b> <b>sharp</b> decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.|$|E
5|$|The Clifford family took {{possession}} of Brough after the Second Barons' War in the 1260s; they built Clifford's Tower and undertook {{a sequence of}} renovations to the castle, creating a fortification in a typical northern English style. In 1521, however, Henry Clifford held a Christmas feast at the castle, after which a major fire broke out, destroying the property. The castle remained abandoned until Lady Anne Clifford restored the property between 1659 and 1661, using {{it as one of}} her northern country homes. In 1666 another fire broke out, once again rendering the castle uninhabitable. Brough Castle went <b>into</b> <b>sharp</b> decline and was stripped first of its fittings and then its stonework. The castle's masonry began to collapse around 1800.|$|E
5|$|The Raptors {{finished}} 41-41, six fewer wins {{than the}} previous season, but still good enough for a playoff spot as the 6th seed. They were pitted against Dwight Howard and the resurgent Orlando Magic. In Game 1, Dwight Howard gave the Magic their first playoff win since 2003 as they practically led the entire game. Howard would put up a 29–20 in Game 2, as Hedo Türkoğlu scored the final four go-ahead points to give the Magic a 2–0 lead. The Raptors would respond with a strong Game 3 victory keyed by great point guard play from Ford and José Calderon. However, Jameer Nelson, Rashard Lewis and Keith Bogans keyed strong three point shooting in Game 4 and overcame Bosh's 39 points and 15 rebounds to bring the Magic out of Toronto with a 3–1 lead. Howard would finish off the series in Game 5 as impressively as he started: 21 points, 21 rebounds, 3 blocks. Whereas the preceding season was considered a success, the 2007–08 campaign was considered a disappointment. Weaknesses in Toronto's game—rebounding, defence, {{and a lack of}} a swingman—were brought <b>into</b> <b>sharp</b> focus during the playoffs, and changes were expected to be made to the roster.|$|E

25|$|Gathering war {{clouds in}} Europe and Asia {{during the late}} 1930s caused some {{military}} planners to prepare for possible U. S. involvement. This led to several important developments at Fort Riley. The first was the rebuilding of Camp Funston and the stationing of the 2nd Cavalry Division there in December 1940. Barracks {{were built in the}} area known as Republican Flats and renamed Camp Forsyth. In addition, 32,000 acres (129km²) were added to the post for training purposes.

25|$|Sicily {{served a}} level of high {{importance}} for the Romans, as it acted as the empire's granary. It was divided into two quaestorships, {{in the form of}} Syracuse to the east and Lilybaeum to the west. Some attempt was made under Augustus to introduce the Latin language to the island, but Sicily was allowed to remain largely Greek in a cultural sense.

25|$|Ciliary muscles {{around the}} lens allow the eye's focus to be adjusted. This process {{is known as}} accommodation. The near point and far point define the nearest and {{farthest}} distances from the eye at which an object can be brought <b>into</b> <b>sharp</b> focus. For a person with normal vision, the far point is located at infinity. The near point's location {{depends on how much}} the muscles can increase the curvature of the lens, and how inflexible the lens has become with age. Optometrists, ophthalmologists, and opticians usually consider an appropriate near point to be closer than normal reading distance—approximately 25cm.|$|E

25|$|In November 1849, Effie and John Ruskin visited Venice, {{staying at}} the Hotel Danieli.

For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise, while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he {{made a point of}} drawing the Ca' d'Oro and the Doge's Palace, or Palazzo Ducale, because he feared they would be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops.

25|$|After 1973, Germany {{was hard}} {{hit by a}} {{worldwide}} economic crisis, soaring oil prices, and stubbornly high unemployment, which jumped from 300,000 in 1973 to 1.1 million in 1975. The Ruhr region was hardest hit, as its easy-to-reach coal mines petered out, and expensive German coal was no longer competitive. Likewise the Ruhr steel industry went <b>into</b> <b>sharp</b> decline, as its prices were undercut by lower-cost suppliers such as Japan. The welfare system provided a safety net for {{the large number of}} unemployed workers, and many factories reduce their labor force and began to concentrate on high-profit specialty items. After 1990 the Ruhr moved into service industries and high technology. Cleaning up the heavy air and water pollution became a major industry in its own right. Meanwhile, formerly rural Bavaria became a high-tech center of industry.|$|E

Trey and Matt are off to a great 13th-season start." [...] James Poniewozik of Time said [...] "The Ring" [...] was better than any of the twelfth season episodes. Poniewozik said the episode, [...] "demonstrated that the cartoon is best when it focuses on the four kids and when it is driven by a white-hot moral fury". Travis Fickett of IGN also particularly applauded the Disney satire, which he said, [...] "elevates this beyond shock humor and <b>into</b> <b>sharp</b> satire."

500|$|In a mixed review, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone was {{impressed}} by its music, but found Cudi's raps [...] "pedestrian". Ian Cohen of Pitchfork gave the album a negative review, finding it frustrating that the album felt like a failed opportunity rather than a [...] "non-starter". He further wrote that Cudi largely smears his verses with a [...] "flat warble" [...] that is salvaged by Auto-Tune, which he remarked would be [...] "numbing enough on its own" [...] {{had it not been}} for the frequent [...] "terrifyingly underwritten lyric to jolt you <b>into</b> <b>sharp</b> pangs of embarrassment." [...] In a largely mixed review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times expressed his astonishment at the emotional honesty embedded into Cudi's songwriting but felt his restrained vocal performance diminished his presence on the album, writing, that the album [...] "is a colossal, and mystifying, missed opportunity, misguided if it is in fact guided at all." [...] Citing the tracks [...] "Solo Dolo" [...] and on [...] "Cudi Zone" [...] as Cudi's most [...] "appealingly creepy" [...] and intricate vocal performance, on his general view of the album, Caramanica wrote that the rest of the album lacks that liveliness and drive, reducing Cudi to a [...] "gaseous nonentity".|$|E

[...] MacPherson continued praising the song's slow [...] "contemptuous grind" [...] and the singers' vocal delivery further concluding that T.I. and Wayne [...] "get comprehensively owned". The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh described the track as part of the album's [...] "lovable" [...] material and went on saying, [...] " [...] takes a ludicrous premise... and turns it <b>into</b> <b>sharp,</b> coldblooded electro-pop". Andy Battaglia writing for The A.V. Club felt that the song and [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] "make sassy end-runs around notions of womanly subservience, but their best musical moments hide in tiny melismatic twirls instead of hooks". The Guardian writer Caroline Sullivan described the track as [...] "juddering" [...] while BBC's Nick Reynolds called it [...] "good fun". In a review of the song, Tom Breihan, an editor of Pitchfork Media, wrote that [...] "Soldier" [...] would have been a [...] "perfectly acceptable album track" [...] on The Writing's on the Wall (1999), but noted that its sound was different from the songs played on mainstream pop radio.

500|$|Whale's career went <b>into</b> <b>sharp</b> decline {{following}} {{the release of}} his next film, The Road Back (1937). The sequel to Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, which Universal had filmed in 1930, the novel and film follow the lives of several young German men who have returned from the trenches of World War I and their struggles to re-integrate into society. The Los Angeles consul for Nazi Germany, George Gyssling, learned that the film was in production. He protested to PCA enforcer Joseph Breen, arguing that the film gave an [...] "untrue and distorted picture of the German people". Gyssling eventually met Whale, but nothing came of it. Gyssling then sent letters {{to members of the}} cast, threatening that their participation in the film might lead to difficulties in obtaining German filming permits for them and for anyone associated in a film with them. While the low volume of business conducted by Universal in Germany made such threats largely hollow, the State Department, under pressure from the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and the Screen Actors Guild, stepped in and the German government backed down. Whale's original cut of the film was given generally positive reviews, but sometime between preview screenings and the film's general release, Rogers capitulated to the Germans, ordering that cuts be made and additional scenes be shot and inserted. Whale was furious, and the altered film was banned in Germany anyway. The Germans were successful in persuading China, Greece, Italy and Switzerland to ban the film as well.|$|E
