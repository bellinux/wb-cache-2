5|$|Although Fuchs {{had given}} Ruth his {{unconditional}} release, no major league team {{expressed an interest}} in hiring him in any capacity. Ruth still <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hired as a manager if he could not play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement {{and the end of the}} 1937 season. Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner Alva Bradley replied negatively.|$|E

The band <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to start recording the album later on in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Whitehead {{resigned}} {{his senior}} lectureship in mathematics at Trinity {{and moved to}} London without first lining up another job. After being unemployed for a year, Whitehead accepted a position as lecturer in applied mathematics and mechanics at University College London, but was passed over a year later for the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, a position {{for which he had}} <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seriously considered.|$|E

5|$|The {{town was}} home to a {{motorcycle}} speedway team, Reading Racers. Speedway came to Reading in 1968 at Tilehurst Stadium, until the team moved to Smallmead Stadium in Whitley, which was demolished {{at the end of}} 2008. The team is inactive pending the building of a new stadium, which was once <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, he {{attempted}} to secure a position with the Tyler administration, claiming {{that he was a}} member of the Whig Party. He <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appointed to the Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert, an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas. Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas believed that he had been drunk. Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others.|$|E

5|$|In 1885 Farsari had a daughter, Kiku, by a Japanese {{woman whom}} {{he may not}} have married. He {{described}} himself as living like a misanthrope, associating with very few people outside of business, and his correspondence indicates that he increasingly hoped to return to Italy. He tried to regain the Italian citizenship lost when he emigrated to the United States, and he even <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made a cavaliere and thereby join the Italian aristocracy. His success in these endeavours is not clear. Nevertheless, in April 1890 he and his daughter left Japan for Italy. On 7 February 1898 Farsari died in his family home in Vicenza.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Donaldson {{stated that}} he wanted to play for Jamaica, his parents' country. He had <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{selected}} for the 2015 Copa América or for the Gold Cup, but did not receive his Jamaican passport in time. He was called up for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in November 2015 against Panama and Haiti, and made his full international debut in the first of those matches, at Independence Park in Kingston on 13 November. He entered the match with Jamaica already 2–0 down, replacing Darren Mattocks after 62 minutes, but was unable to affect the score. Donaldson started against Haiti, and scored the only goal of the match after 62 minutes with a header from a corner.|$|E
5|$|Madgwick's {{second term}} as {{chairman}} expired on 30 June 1973 and he <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extended for a third. McClelland, however, told Madgwick in early 1973 that Whitlam {{was concerned about}} Madgwick's age and therefore planned to replace him. Privately, Madgwick felt that Whitlam wanted him replaced because Whitlam suspected Madgwick and his vice-chairman of being biased in favour of the previous government. Madgwick, as with Darling, was not officially informed that would be replaced as chairman until shortly before his term expired. The new chairman was Richard Downing, Assistant Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne and a Labor supporter.|$|E

5|$|Murray had {{repeatedly}} refused {{to become a}} Member of Parliament, saying he {{had no interest in}} politics. In 1742, however, the government of Sir Robert Walpole fell, and Murray's brother-in-law, the Earl of Nottingham, became First Lord of the Admiralty in the new Cabinet. With this added political influence, Murray <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> appointed to a government office, and when Sir John Strange resigned as Solicitor General, Murray was made a Member of Parliament for Boroughbridge on 15 December 1742 and immediately succeeded Strange as Solicitor General.|$|E
5|$|Robson {{started her}} 2014 {{season at the}} Hobart International, where she had to retire in her first round match against Yanina Wickmayer due to a left wrist injury. Her wrist {{continued}} to affect her at the Australian Open, where Kirsten Flipkens defeated her in straight sets. After taking three-months rest from the tour, Robson underwent surgery on her left wrist in April. The surgery forced her to miss the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, and although Robson initially <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> playing {{by the end of}} the season, she only started training in October, and did not play again in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Ryder had <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a fashion}} designer, {{undertaking}} a course at Central Saint Martins {{which he did}} not complete; from there he worked in retail, first for Prowler and then for the designer Vivienne Westwood. Subsequently, appearing in gay pornography as a twink bottom for production companies like Eurocreme and UK Naked Men, he starred in such films as Drunk on Spunk and Stretch that Hole, winning numerous awards for his work. By the time he made Uncle David, he was also running his own weekly gay wrestling night in London.|$|E

5|$|Shelby had <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{given the}} {{contract}} to produce the Tiger in America, but Rootes was somewhat uneasy about the closeness {{of his relationship with}} Ford, so it was decided to build the car in England. The Rootes factory at Ryton did not have the capacity to build the Tiger, so the company contracted the job to Jensen in West Bromwich. Any disappointment Shelby may have felt was tempered by an offer from Rootes to pay him an undisclosed royalty on every Tiger built.|$|E
5|$|The Committee {{hoped to}} avoid the Germans {{becoming}} involved in the day-to-day administration of the territory as they had during World War I, while also allowing Belgium to maintain a degree of national autonomy and independence. The Committee also <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to prevent the implementation of more radical German policies, like forced labor and deportation. The legal basis of the Committee was a law of 7 September 1939, through which in times of crisis, a Secretary-General could exert full control over his own department, but without having the full status of being a minister.|$|E
5|$|The Sunbeam Tiger is a {{high-performance}} V8 {{version of the}} British Rootes Group's Sunbeam Alpine roadster, designed in part by American car designer and racing driver Carroll Shelby and produced from 1964 until 1967. Shelby had carried out a similar V8 conversion on the AC Cobra, and <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> offered the contract to produce the Tiger at his facility in America. Rootes decided instead to contract the assembly work to Jensen at West Bromwich in England, and pay Shelby a royalty on every car produced.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} had escalated when, in 40 AD, Caligula {{announced to the}} senate {{that he planned to}} leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worshipped as a living god. The prospect of Rome losing its emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. Such a move would have left both the senate and the Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.|$|E
5|$|Unluckily for Galland, his {{excellence}} at evaluation {{earned him}} a place at Tutow training facility where {{he was asked to}} test fly prototype reconnaissance and strike aircraft. This was not what he wanted, and he <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> returned to a fighter unit to fly the Bf 109. During his time there, he gave positive evaluations on types such as the Focke-Wulf Fw 189 and Henschel Hs 129. During his test piloting career at Tutow, Galland received unwelcome news; he was to become Gruppenkommandeur of II.(Schlacht)/Lehrgeschwader 2 (II.(S)/LG 2—2nd battle group of the 2nd Demonstration Wing). It was not a fighter unit, but a special mixed Geschwader of ground attack aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After a year's {{training}} at Gwelo under the Empire Air Training Scheme, Smith passed {{out with the}} rank of pilot officer in September 1942. He <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stationed in Britain, but was posted to the Middle East instead; there he joined No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF, flying Hurricanes. In October 1943, in Egypt, Smith crashed his Hurricane after his throttle malfunctioned during a dawn takeoff. Suffering serious facial disfigurements, he also broke his jaw, leg and shoulder. Doctors and surgeons in Cairo rebuilt Smith's face through skin grafts and plastic surgery, and he was passed fit to fly again in March 1944. Turning down an offer to return to Rhodesia as an instructor, he rejoined No. 237 Squadron, which had switched to flying Spitfire Mk IXs, in Corsica in May 1944.|$|E
