40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} low-complexity {{parameter}} update algorithm to spatio-temporal filter for suppressing the cochannel interference in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation systems. The conventional spatio-temporal filter employs the recursive eigenvalue decomposition algorithm {{to perform the}} parameter estimation and update. In the mobile environment, all the points during a data OFDM symbol are used for parameter update. This paper proposes an <b>incomplete</b> <b>parameter</b> update for the conventional spatio-temporal filter, where {{only a fraction of}} points during a data OFDM symbol are used for parameter update, while the others are ignored. In this way, the computational complexity of the parameter update can be reduced to some extent with negligible performance degradation. Computer simulations under IEEE 802. 11 a demonstrate the validity of the proposed <b>incomplete</b> <b>parameter</b> update algorithm.

40|$|Kinetic {{modeling}} of metabolic pathways has important applications in metabolic engineering, but significant challenges still remain. The difficulties faced vary from finding best-fit parameters {{in a highly}} multidimensional search space to <b>incomplete</b> <b>parameter</b> identifiability. To meet some of these challenges, an ensemble modeling method is developed for characterizing a subset of kinetic parameters that give statistically equivalent goodness-of-fit to time series concentration data. The method {{is based on the}} incremental identification approach, where the parameter estimation is done in a step-wise manner. Numerical efficacy is achieved by reducing the dimensionality of parameter space and using efficient random parameter exploration algorithms. The shift toward using model ensembles, instead of the traditional “best-fit” models, is necessary to directly account for model uncertainty during the application of such models. The performance of the ensemble modeling approach has been demonstrated in the {{modeling of}} a generic branched pathway and the trehalose pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using generalized mass action (GMA) kinetics...|$|R

40|$|A two-layer {{mathematical}} model proposed by Tong et al. (2010) {{was used to}} predict soluble chemical transfer from soil into surface runoff with ponded water on the soil surface. Infiltration-related <b>incomplete</b> mixing <b>parameter</b> γ and runoff-related <b>incomplete</b> mixing <b>parameter</b> α in the analytical solution of the Tong et al. (2010) model were assumed to be constant. In this study, different laboratory experimental data of soluble chemical concentration in surface runoff from initially unsaturated and saturated soils were used to identify the variables γ and α based on the analytical solution of the model. The values of γ and α without occurrence of surface runoff were constant and equal to their values {{at the moment when}} the surface runoff started. It was determined from the results that γ decreases with the increase of the ponded water depth, and when the initial volumetric water content is closer to the saturated water content, there is less variation of parameter γ after the occurrence of surface runoff. As infiltration increases, the soluble chemical concentration in surface runoff decreases. The values of parameter α range from 0 to 1 for the fine loam and sand under the controlled infiltration conditions, while it can increase to a very large value, greater than 1, for the sand under the restrained infiltration conditions, and the analytical solution of the model is not valid for experimental soil without any infiltration if α is expected to be {{less than or equal to}} 1. The soluble chemical concentrations predicted from the model with variable <b>incomplete</b> mixing <b>parameters</b> γ and α are more accurate than those from the model with constant γ and α values...|$|R

Our results further refine the findings of Chattopadhyay and Maitra (2017) by providing groups that are more distinct.
