The exact circumstances of Sikorski's death have been disputed and {{have given rise to}} a number of different theories surrounding the crash and his death. Sikorski <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> prestigious leader of the Polish exiles, and his death was a severe setback for the Polish cause.|$|E

5|$|The Carter {{administration}} {{years were}} difficult for Kennedy; he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important Democrat in Washington {{ever since his}} brother Robert's death, but now Carter was, and Kennedy at first {{did not have a}} full committee chairmanship with which to wield influence. Carter in turn sometimes resented Kennedy's status as a political celebrity. Despite generally similar ideologies, their priorities were different. Kennedy expressed to reporters that he was content with his congressional role and viewed presidential ambitions as almost far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until about}} the time of his death, Diarmait <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{powerful}} king in southern Ireland. In consequence of the void left by his demise, Diarmait's erstwhile ally Toirdelbach seized the initiative, and moved to enforce his own claim to the high-kingship of Ireland. He immediately imposed his overlordship on Leinstera task almost certainly expedited by the aforesaid infighting amongst the Uí Chennselaigand took control of Dublin. Whilst the imposition of authority upon rival provincial kingdoms was a fundamental part in gaining the high-kingship, Toirdelbach's decision to march-on Dublin reveals that the acquisition of this coastal kingdom had also become {{an essential part of the}} process.|$|E
5|$|Edward II {{began working}} towards a recall before Gaveston had even left. Through {{distribution}} of patronage and concessions to political demands, he won over {{several of the}} earls who had previously been of a hostile disposition. Lincoln, who {{was the leader of}} the baronial opposition due to his age and great wealth, was reconciled with Edward by late summer 1308. Even Warwick, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> unyielding of the King's enemies, was gradually mollified. Significantly, though, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, who had not been involved in the campaign to exile Gaveston, seems to have become disaffected at this time. Nevertheless, by 25 April 1309, Pope Clement V was satisfied that the difficulties between the King and his magnates had been settled, and agreed to lift the interdict against Gaveston. At the parliament that met at Stamford in July, Edward had to agree to a series of political concessions. The so-called Statute of Stamford was based on a similar document Edward I had consented to in 1300, called the articuli super carta, which was in turn based on Magna Carta. Before the Stamford Parliament, however, on 27 June, Gaveston had returned to England.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, McCool gained {{selection}} {{as part of}} Australian team to tour England in 1948 under Donald Bradman. Australia had traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the opening match of the tour, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Although he was only selected sporadically during the preceding Test series against India, McCool was chosen alongside off spinner Ian Johnson {{and appeared to be}} part of Bradman's Test plans. The home side batted first and McCool took his maiden wicket on English soil, having former England captain Bob Wyatt stumped by fellow Queenslander Don Tallon. He removed Wyatt's replacement for a duck without further addition to the score and ended with 2/38 as the home side were dismissed for 233. McCool returned the favour during Australia's innings. Coming in at No. 5, he made a fifth ball duck and was part of a middle-order collapse that saw Australia lose 4/38 before steadying to declare at 8/462. In the second innings, McCool did the bulk of the damage, taking four of the five first wicketstwo of whom were stumped by Tallonto leave the hosts at 5/122 before Australia completed an innings victory. McCool <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> successful bowler in the opening match.|$|E
5|$|Vittorio Veneto {{remained}} in Malta until 14 September, {{when she and}} Italia were moved to Alexandria, Egypt {{and then to the}} Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal on 17 October. The two battleships remained there until 6 October 1946, when they were permitted to return to Italy. Vittorio Veneto went to Augusta, Sicily before moving to La Spezia on 14 October. In the Treaty of Peace with Italy, signed on 10 February 1947, Vittorio Veneto was allocated as a war prize to Britain. She was paid off on 3 January 1948, stricken from the naval register on 1 February, and subsequently broken up for scrap. Vittorio Veneto <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> active Italian battleship of the war, having participated in eleven offensive operations. Twelve 90mm anti-aircraft guns taken from Vittorio Veneto were reused by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) as armament of its Žirje Island coastal artillery battery. The battery surrendered without resistance to the Croatian National Guard on 14 September 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, and played a pivotal role in 1622 September Battle of Šibenik, helping defend the city of Šibenik against the JNA.|$|E
5|$|By {{the ninth}} century the many kingdoms {{of the early}} Anglo-Saxon period had been {{consolidated}} into four: Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria and East Anglia. In the eighth century, Mercia <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> powerful kingdom in southern England, {{but in the early}} ninth, Wessex became dominant under Æthelstan's great-great-grandfather, Egbert. In the middle of the century, England came under increasing attack from Viking raids, culminating in invasion by the Great Heathen Army in 865. By 878, the Vikings had overrun East Anglia, Northumbria, and Mercia, and nearly conquered Wessex. The West Saxons fought back under Alfred the Great, and achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington. Alfred and the Viking leader Guthrum agreed on a division that gave Alfred western Mercia, while eastern Mercia was incorporated into Viking East Anglia. In the 890s, renewed Viking attacks were successfully fought off by Alfred, assisted by his son (and Æthelstan's father) Edward and Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians. Æthelred ruled English Mercia under Alfred and was married to his daughter Æthelflæd. Alfred died in 899 and was succeeded by Edward. Æthelwold, the son of Æthelred, King Alfred's older brother and predecessor as king, made a bid for power, but was killed at the Battle of the Holme in 902.|$|E
