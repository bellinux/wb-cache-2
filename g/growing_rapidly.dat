5|$|In 2000, {{about six}} million people lived within the Columbia's {{drainage}} basin. Of this total about 2.4million {{people lived in}} Oregon, 1.7million in Washington, 1million in Idaho, half a million in British Columbia, and 0.4million in Montana. Population in the watershed has been rising for many decades and is projected to rise to about 10million by 2030. The highest population densities are found west of the Cascade Mountains along the I-5 corridor, especially in the Portland-Vancouver urban area. High densities are also found around Spokane, Washington, and Boise, Idaho. Although much of the watershed is rural and sparsely populated, areas with recreational and scenic values are <b>growing</b> <b>rapidly.</b> The central Oregon county of Deschutes is the fastest-growing in the state. Populations have also been growing {{just east of the}} Cascades in central Washington around the city of Yakima and the Tri-Cities area. Projections for the coming decades assume growth throughout the watershed, including the interior. The Canadian part of the Okanagan subbasin is also <b>growing</b> <b>rapidly.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the US Navy was <b>growing</b> <b>rapidly.</b> The Navy {{commissioned}} its first battleships in 1895, {{and by the}} middle of the next decade, Jane's Fighting Ships ranked its battle line second only to the British Navy. However, this rapid growth was not universally supported either within the government or within the Navy. Compromises between powerful groups were frequently necessary to get funding.|$|E

Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion {{has been declining}} since {{the mid to late}} 1980s, and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious. According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time. Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.|$|E

By August 2009 wind power capacity was a fraction short of 1.5 GW and total renewables capacity had reached over 3.1 GW. By mid-2011 these figures were 2.76 GW and 4.6 GW respectively.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s, the {{population}} of Berlin was <b>growing</b> <b>rapidly</b> with the influx of around 50,000 people a year, creating a large administrative burden. When construction began on the Rotes Rathaus, the city had around half a million inhabitants, but this grew to 800,000 {{by the time of}} its completion in 1869. By the 1880s, the city had offices in ten additional buildings near the Rotes Rathaus and since it could not be extended, it was clear that a second administration building was required.|$|E

The surge in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated both economic benefits and environmental concerns—and thus, considerable controversy.|$|E
5|$|The Methodist {{movement}} was <b>growing</b> <b>rapidly</b> in pre-Civil War America, but was beset by disputes about slave-holding {{and the rule}} over the church by bishops, resulting in a formal split into two groups in 1844.

Those in opposition formed the Methodist Protestant Church in the United States. As the impending Civil War loomed over {{the nation in the}} 1850s, local Towson Methodists continued to worship together at Epsom Chapel.|$|E
5|$|Though Newark {{is not the}} {{industrial}} colossus of the past, the city does have {{a considerable amount of}} industry and light manufacturing. The southern portion of the Ironbound, also known as the Industrial Meadowlands, has seen many factories built since World War II, including a large Anheuser-Busch brewery that opened in 1951 and distributed 7.5 million barrels of beer in 2007. The service industry is also <b>growing</b> <b>rapidly,</b> replacing those in the manufacturing industry, which was once Newark's primary economy. In addition, transportation has become a large business in Newark, accounting for more than 17,000 jobs in 2011.|$|E

5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on <b>growing</b> <b>rapidly</b> for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-2000s, Great Southern's {{business}} was <b>growing</b> <b>rapidly,</b> with sales and market capitalisation increasing {{at more than}} 100 per cent per annum. However, in its 2005 Annual Report, the company disclosed that it was subsidising the returns to its 1994 forestry scheme by approximately A$3 million, and that it expected to have to similarly subsidise the 1995 and 1996 schemes by up to A$12 million in future years. Board Chairman Peter Patrikeos and non-executive director Jeffry Mews both {{expressed concern about the}} way in which Great Southern was funding shortfalls on the sales of timber products, with the issue leading directly to Mews' resignation. Although the company continued to sell over A$800 million of MIS products in the two financial years after incurring losses on its early offerings, it was not meeting sales targets, and its share price was falling.|$|E
5|$|Professor Calculus, Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Calculus' {{assistant}} Frank Wolff are aboard {{an atomic}} rocket-powered spacecraft leaving the Earth {{bound for the}} Moon. Soon after takeoff they discover that the detectives Thomson and Thompson have accidentally stowed away onboard, putting a strain on the oxygen supply.
