40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{impeller}} construction, non contact driving method and performance of a newly developed shaftless <b>floating</b> <b>pump</b> with centrifugal impeller. The drive principle of the floating impeller pump used the magnet induction method similar to the levitation theory of the linear motor. In {{order to reduce the}} axial thrust by the pressure different between shroud and disk side, the balance hole and the aileron blade were installed in the floating impeller. Considering the above effect, floating of an impeller in a pump was realized. Moreover, the performance curves of a developed pump are in agreement with a general centrifugal pump, and the dimensionless characteristic curve also agrees under the different rotational speed due to no mechanical friction of the rotational part. Therefore, utility of a non contacting magnetic-drive style pump with the floating impeller was made clear...|$|E

Wastes collected in these tanks are typically acidic when generated and are neutralized with sodium hydroxide to protect the tanks from corrosion; however, the high pH of the solution causes the formation of insoluble compounds that precipitate. These precipitates formed a sludge layer approximately 0. 6 to 1. 2 m (2 to 4 ft) deep {{in the bottom of}} the tanks. The sludge in the MVSTs and the evaporator service tanks will eventually need to be removed from the tanks and treated for final disposal or transferred to another storage facility. The primary options for removing the sludge include single-point sluicing, use of a <b>floating</b> <b>pump,</b> robotic sluicing, and submerged-nozzle sluicing.

40|$|In November 2016 a {{brand new}} and highly {{technological}} hospital called New Karolinska Solna opened in Stockholm. In connection with the planning of the hospital, new medical devices were procured, including a new infusion system that is now in use. Previously, each ward at the hospital had their own pumps and was responsible for updates and maintenance. Now, the hospital will instead have a <b>floating</b> <b>pump</b> system, {{which means that the}} hospital will own the pumps. The infusion pumps will be floating between the wards without being linked to a specific ward or department. The updates that were previously done when the need arose at the ward will now be a common process for the entire hospital. The aim of the project was to develop new guidelines for how the update process should be done on New Karolinska Solna's new infusion pump system. Through interviews with key personnel during the procurement process, the medical technicians department and caseworkers, new guidelines have been written, given the already existing technical conditions. During the course of the project it has been found that there are major shortcomings of information and communication within the hospital. The guidelines presented in the result are an important part to ensure that information related to the update comes to the caregivers at New Karolinska Solna, thus simplifying and streamlining the update of the infusion pumps...|$|E

This will result in greater dependence on storage of raw water in lakes and reservoirs and produce greater variability in water levels as lakes fill and drain. During the 2007 / 08 Level 4 drought in Georgia, Gwinnett County Department of Water Resources (GCDWR) was faced with historical low lake levels in Lake Lanier. Since Lake Lanier is their sole drinking water source, GCDWR was concerned that the lake level could drop below their intake elevations and the entire county of 800, 000 people could be out of water. Faced with such a dire situation, GCDWR was making preparations to contract with a contractor under “emergency authority” to construct a <b>floating</b> intake <b>pump</b> station to withdrawal water {{from the center of}} the lake, which would cost upwards of $ 11 M. GCDWR was faced the circumstance of $ 1 spent too soon or implementation 1 second too late and the opportunity for backlashed was intensified. Therefore, GCDWR contracted with Hazen and Sawyer to develop a reliability model of the lake that predicts the numbers of days remaining until the water level drops below the intake. The model used lake release flows and the historical, worst-case climate conditions for the coming months to estimate the probability and the number of days remaining until their intake goes dry. They were able to see seasonal variation in the water level and understand the cause and effect relationship with the Army Corps of Engineer’s release flows. This was combined with internal procurement practices to create a more effective process that allows GCDWR to make risk-based decisions to implement a cost-effective land-based temporary pump station. Capital expenditures were to be triggered at specific risk levels – combination of lake level and season. Even with the drought behind them, GCDWR now has a contingency plan in place for next drought. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division; U. S.

40|$|The eThekwini {{coastline}} is {{a vulnerable}} coastline subject to chronic erosion and damage due to sea level rise. In 2007 a severe storm caused major physical and economic damage along the coastline, proving {{the need for}} action. Umhlanga Rocks is a densely populated premium holiday destination on the eThekwini coastline suffering from similar problems due to its narrow beaches and lack of dunes in certain places. Interference with the coast of Umhlanga can entice fierce resistance from different groups of stakeholders, which makes finding a suitable solution more difficult. The above leads to the following problem definition: Due to erosion and extreme weather conditions the coastline of Umhlanga Rocks is shifting on shore, causing narrow beaches, decrease of tourism and increased risk of failures of the coastal structures. The current situation requires a new long term safety strategy, {{taking into account the}} social, economic and environmental vitality of the Umhlanga Rocks area as well. To solve the problem definition the main question states: How can the eThekwini municipality create a sustainable Umhlanga coastline while adding value to the area? To answer the main question many different elements, varying from conventional coastal protection measures to experimental ideas that would increase local business, were formulated during a brainstorm session. These elements are ranked on their cost, added value and technological feasibility. From the highest ranked elements in each category 11 different alternatives are created. By performing a multi criteria analysis these 11 alternatives are narrowed down to three alternatives and an additional `do nothing’ option is included. The do nothing option assumes that the beach will be completely gone in 30 - 40 years. It is further assumed Umhlanga Rocks recreational businesses are coupled to the beach and property values will drop by 12 % once the beach is gone. This gives a NPV of R. 15, 000, 000, 000. It is suspected that the equilibrium that normally exists in the cross shore sediment transport is disturbed and more sediment moves offshore than onshore. The sill is designed to prevent the sediment form moving too far offshore and thus to create a new equilibrium. The bar retaining sill consists of prefab concrete elements located just outside the surf zone. From the Delft 3 D model it followed that the beach stays roughly the same size after construction of the sill. The NPV bases the cost of the sill on reference projects. With the beach maintaining its current size the total NPV amounts to R. 116, 000, 000, 000. The nourishment option adds enough sand to the beach to compensate for erosion and add 15 meters of beach according to the Delft 3 D model. It is assumed the nearby sand depot can be used to perform the nourishment. The nourishment itself will be done using a dredger connected to a <b>floating</b> pipeline to <b>pump</b> the sand to the beach. Shovels will be used to divide the sand over the beach area. The cost of the nourishment is based on the cost of a similar project, with the benefit of the added beach area the total NPV is R. 142, 000, 000, 000. The submerged breakwater creates a calmer wave climate near the coast and will thereby reduce erosion and increase beach growth. The Delft 3 D model suggests an average beach growth of 20 meters. For the breakwater design different materials are considered. Geotextile systems look very promising and have several advantages over a rock or concrete breakwater. A design with geotextile bags and one with geotextile tubes is made for the Umhlanga Rocks area. The NPV of the breakwater amounts to R. 131, 000, 000, 000. A second multi criteria analysis is performed to determine the overall best option. According to this analysis the construction of a submerged breakwater made of geotextile tubes provides the best solution to the problem from social and technical preferences. Social preferences include perceptions of stakeholders involved like environmental groups and property owners, but take the construction and maintenance costs of the alternative into account as well. In this case the geotextile tube breakwater uses conforming materials, does not cause any visual horizon pollution and seems to deliver the best benefits for the price involved. At the same time the results from the 3 D simulations have shown that the breakwater is able to perform well on the technical preferences including the breakage of waves offshore and increase of beach width.
