40|$|Building energy {{simulation}} {{programs have}} undergone {{an increase in}} use for evaluating energy consumption and energy conservation retrofits in buildings. Utilization of computer simulation programs for large facilities with multiple buildings, however, has been relatively rare. Due to the immense size of certain facilities such as college campuses and correctional institutes, simulating energy consumption for the entire campus and reporting the energy use by individual building is a time consuming task. Initially, many computer simulation programs were designed to operate {{on the assumption that}} the user is simulating one building. Provisions are not usually made to knit together outputs from multiple buildings. Furthermore, programs such as DOE- 2 have limits to the number of walls, windows, and zones that can be simulated in one run. This paper presents a methodology to model an entire campus by simulating each building as a single zone consistent with <b>electrical</b> <b>feeders</b> instead of as a separate entity. Since most simulation programs calculate energy use by means of one-dimensional heat transfer, utilizing this method becomes a practical solution, particularly if the facility does not contain buildings with complex internal systems. The energy use can then be extracted from the individual simulations and combined with specially written data handling scripts into a whole-campus energy use. The methods are presented using the DOE- 2. 1 E building energy simulation program to model a 1, 000 bed case study correctional unit located in Texas...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the final}} report for the {{development}} of a toxonomy of prototypical <b>electrical</b> distribution <b>feeders.</b> Two of the primary goals of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Modern Grid Initiative (MGI) are 'to accelerate the modernization of our nation's electricity grid' and to 'support demonstrations of systems of key technologies that can serve as the foundation for an integrated, modern power grid'. A key component to the realization of these goals is the effective implementation of new, as well as existing, 'smart grid technologies'. Possibly the largest barrier that has been identified in the deployment of smart grid technologies is the inability to evaluate how their deployment will affect the electricity infrastructure, both locally and on a regional scale. The inability to evaluate the impacts of these technologies is primarily due to the lack of detailed <b>electrical</b> distribution <b>feeder</b> information. While detailed distribution feeder information does reside with the various distribution utilities, there is no central repository of information that can be openly accessed. The role of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in the MGI for FY 08 was to collect distribution feeder models, in the SynerGEE{reg_sign} format, from electric utilities around the nation so that they could be analyzed to identify regional differences in feeder design and operation. Based on this analysis PNNL developed a taxonomy of 24 prototypical feeder models in the GridLAB-D simulations environment that contain the fundamental characteristics of non-urban core, radial distribution feeders from the various regions of the U. S. Weighting factors for these feeders are also presented so that they can be used to generate a representative sample for various regions within the United States. The final product presented in this report is a toolset that enables the evaluation of new smart grid technologies, with the ability to aggregate their effects to regional and national levels. The distribution feeder models presented in this report are based on actual utility models but do not contain any proprietary or system specific information. As a result, the models discussed in this report can be openly distributed to industry, academia, or any interested entity, in order to facilitate the ability to evaluate smart grid technologies...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{an application of}} machine learning techniques toward the problem of predicting which network protector switch {{is the cause of}} an Alive on Back-Feed (ABF) event in the New York City power distribution system. When an <b>electrical</b> <b>feeder</b> is shut down, all network protector switches connected to the feeder should open to isolate the feeder. When a switch malfunctions and does not open, electrical current flows into the feeder, which remains energized. This causes the feeder to be “alive ” on back-feed current, and maintenance cannot proceed. Our goal is to provide a ranking of network protector switches according to their susceptibility to such malfunction. Such a ranking can assist prioritization of which switches to repair when an ABF event occurs. We compare three methods for computing a ranking: an SVM classification approach, a maximum entropy density estimation approach and an SVM-ranking approach. ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{opportunities}} {{exist for}} large-scale energy conservation projects in housing. Energy savings performance contracting (ESPC) is now receiving greater attention, {{as a means}} to implement such projects. This paper proposes an improved method for prior (to construction) savings estimates for these projects. The proposed approach to prior estimates is verified against data from Fort Polk, LA. In the course of evaluating the ESPC at Fort Polk, the authors have collected energy use data which allowed them to develop calibrated engineering models which accurately predict pre-retrofit energy consumption. They believe that such calibrated models could be used to provide much more accurate estimates of energy savings in retrofit projects. The improved savings estimating approach described here is based on an engineering model calibrated to field-collected data from the pre-retrofit period. A dynamic model of pre-retrofit energy use was developed for all housing and non-housing loads on a complete <b>electrical</b> <b>feeder</b> at Fort Polk. The model included the heat transfer characteristics of the buildings, the pre-retrofit air source heat pump, a hot water consumption model and a profile for electrical use by lights and other appliances. Energy consumption for all 200 apartments was totaled, and by adjusting thermostat setpoints and outdoor air infiltration parameters, the models were matched to field-collected energy consumption data for the entire feeder. The energy conservation measures were then implemented in the calibrated model: the air source heat pumps were replaced by geothermal heat pumps with desuperheaters; hot water loads were reduced to account for the low-flow shower heads; and lighting loads were reduced to account for fixture delamping and replacement with compact fluorescent lights. The analysis of pre- and post-retrofit data indicates that the retrofits have saved 30. 3 % of pre-retrofit electrical energy consumption on the feeder modeled in this paper...|$|E

At the same time, other efficiency measures such as compact fluorescent lights (CFLs), low-flow hot water outlets, and attic insulation were installed. Pre- and post-retrofit data were taken at 15 -minute intervals on energy flows through the <b>electrical</b> distribution <b>feeders</b> that serve the family housing areas of the post. 15 -minute interval data was also taken on energy use from {{a sample of the}} residences. This paper summarizes the electrical energy and demand savings observed in this data. Analysis of feeder-level data shows that for a typical year, the project will result in a 25. 6 million kWh savings in electrical energy use, or 32. 4 % of the pre-retrofit electrical consumption in family housing. Results from analysis of building-level data compare well with this figure. Analysis of feeder-level data also shows that the project has resulted in a reduction of peak electrical demand of 6, 541 kW, which is 39. 6 % of the pre-retrofit peak electrical demand. In addition to these electrical savings, the facility is also saving an estimated 260, 000 therms per year of natural gas.

40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns related to climate change, fiscal incentives from governments around the world, and falling prices of proved and ever-improving technology, {{the use of}} renewable energy sources has been rising considerably over the past years. A considerable amount of these sources, among which solar is to be highlighted, is used by gridconnected generators that are installed in electrical distribution systems. Solar photovoltaic generators are characterised for using an intermittent source of energy. Since {{they do not have}} any moving parts and therefore no inertia, variations in irradiance levels directly and instantaneously affect output power. Therefore, fluctuations in generated power from PV systems result in unbalancing between consumption and generation. In such context, this project aims to study the impact of high PV systems penetration in voltage and unbalance levels of <b>electrical</b> distribution <b>feeders,</b> such as percentages of unbalance and rise in pu voltage that can be expected under a certain penetration level of distributed PV generation, feeder sensitivity to photovoltaic penetration, times of the day when maximum unbalance can be expected… among others. After a literature review that defines power quality issues and the power-flow analysis method, the methodology for the analysis is presented. Two software tools, OpenDSS and MATLAB, have been integrated to program the code that is necessary to run the simulations that will provide the necessary results. The general characteristics of the resulting code are reviewed. Three types of analysis have been implemented: 1. Snapshot analyses, which provide the state of the system under certain loading conditions; 2. Feeder sensitivity to PV penetration analyses, which calculate the highest unbalance that occurs in the feeder under increasing PV penetration conditions; and 3. Time-series simulations, which use time-series solar irradiance and load data drawn from real sources to simulate realistic situations. These analyses have been performed on two very different feeders: on a smaller, 37 -Bus delta-connected distribution feeder from IEEE, and on a bigger, 2998 -Bus wye-connected distribution feeder from EPRI. The results of these simulations and the conclusions regarding the main objectives are then presented...|$|R
40|$|As {{penetration}} {{levels of}} PV Distributed Generation (DG) {{continue to increase}} into Low Voltage distribution <b>feeders,</b> <b>electrical</b> utility companies are finding that traditional strategies for managing the voltage profile along these feeders are becoming less effective because of the bidirectional variations in real power flow that are caused by these PV systems. Various strategies have been proposed to resolve this issue, commonly by enhancing the inverter systems of the PV sources to inject reactive power to help flatten the feeder voltage profile. However, such approaches usually require coordinated communication between the PV inverters, and are technically complex to implement. This paper proposes an alternative approach, by incorporating an electronic tap changer into the distribution transformer that supplies the LV feeder so that the LV supply voltage magnitude can step change on a 50 Hz cycle by cycle basis. A simple algorithm then varies the transformer tap position as the power flow through the transformer changes, to keep the voltages along the feeder well within regulatory limits irrespective of the magnitude and direction of power flow.
