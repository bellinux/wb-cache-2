500|$|The {{remainder}} of Rome's territory--if not its nature--was defended {{for several decades}} following 410 AD largely by Flavius Aëtius, who managed to play off each of Rome's barbarian invaders against one another. In 436 AD he led a Hunnic army against the Visigoths at the Battle of Arles, and again in 436 AD at the Battle of Narbonne. In 451 AD he led a combined army, including his former enemy the Visigoths, against the Huns at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, beating them so soundly that although they later sacked Concordia, Altinum, Mediolanum, Ticinum, and Patavium, they never again directly threatened Rome. Despite being the only clear champion of the Empire at this point Aëtius was slain by the Emperor Valentinian III's own hand, leading Sidonius Apollinaris to observe, [...] "I am ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>know</b> that you have acted {{like a man who}} has cut off his right hand with his left".|$|E
500|$|The plot of Man of Steel {{employs a}} {{nonlinear}} narrative, and tells {{parts of the}} story in flashback. During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises in 2008, David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context. Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight. Nolan admired Bryan Singer's work on Superman Returns for its connection to Richard Donner's version, stating that [...] "A {{lot of people have}} approached Superman {{in a lot of different}} ways. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>know</b> the way that has worked for us that's what I know how to do," [...] emphasizing the idea that Batman exists in a world where he is the only superhero and a similar approach to the Man of Steel would assure the integrity needed for the film. [...] "Each serves to the internal logic of the story. They have nothing to do with each other." [...] Nolan, however, clarified that the new film would not have any relationship with the previous film series.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} between the wars, feminists fought {{discrimination}} and establishment opposition. In Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, Woolf describes {{the extent of the}} backlash and her frustration at the waste of so much talent. By now, the word [...] "feminism" [...] was in use, but with a negative connotation from mass media, which discouraged women from self-identifying as such. In 1938, Woolf wrote of the term in Three Guineas, [...] "an old word ... that has much harm in its day and is now obsolete". When Rebecca West, another prominent writer, had been attacked as [...] "a feminist", Woolf defended her. West has been remembered for her comment [...] "I myself {{have never been able to}} find out precisely what feminism is: <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>know</b> that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute." [...] Woolf's writing also examined gender constructs and portrayed lesbian sexuality positively.|$|E

'What is necessary', writes Gleizes, 'is to take {{everything}} up {{again from the}} foundations and to start out from the unquestionable reality of two currents which, unaware of each other, were finally enfolded under a single heading, the movement that was called 'Cubism'. You can then avoid confusion if, right from the start, you make the distinctions that must, in all honesty, be acknowledged. The history of the 'Bâteau Lavoir' belongs {{to those who were}} part of that particular grouping. Personally, <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>know</b> what has been said about this history; I do not know the details, nor did my comrades of the other group Metzinger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger... But what I do know well, because I lived it and remember it perfectly, is the origin of our relations and their development to 1914, passing by the notorious Room 41 of the Indépendants of 1911, which provoked the 'involuntary scandal' out of which Cubism really emerged and spread in Paris, in France and through the world...

2500|$|Late that year, an {{incident}} involving Xu Yushi's son Xu Ziran (許自然) {{would lead to}} Xu Yushi's removal. [...] Xu Ziran, {{who was in charge}} of imperial wagons, had gone out on a hunt, and during the hunt, he had damaged a farmer's crops. [...] When the farmer became angry, Xu Ziran fired arrows toward the farmer. [...] Xu Yushi caned Xu Ziran 100 times, but did not report this to the emperor. [...] When the farmer submitted a formal accusation, the accusation was initially put aside by the official Yang Deyi (楊德裔), but another official, Yuan Gongyu (袁公瑜), then resubmitted the accusation directly to the emperor under a pseudonym. [...] Emperor Gaozong, in anger, stated, [...] "Xu Yushi is a chancellor, but when the people's lives and properties were interfered with, he did not report to me. [...] Is this not an abuse of power?" [...] Xu responded, [...] "I serve in a key position of the government, and I serve Your Imperial Majesty with honesty and fairness, and I could not please everyone. [...] That is why I am being attacked. [...] As for abusing power, only someone who commands strong troops or is stationed at a key military post can do so. [...] I am but a civilian who serves the emperor, and <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>know</b> how to perfect myself behind closed doors. [...] How can I abuse power?" [...] This caused Emperor Gaozong to be angrier, and he stated, [...] "Are you displeased that you do not command troops?" [...] Another chancellor, Xu Jingzong, who happened to be present, stated, [...] "For an imperial subject to have this kind of attitude, death would be too good of a treatment for him!" [...] Emperor Gaozong ordered that Xu Yushi be expelled from his presence and removed from his post.|$|E
