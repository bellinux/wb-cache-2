Over 40,000people lit candles and {{observed}} {{up to two}} hours of silence {{at the site of}} the collapse, before walking to Kyle Field for yell practice. At the stadium, fans spontaneously relit their candles as the Parsons Mounted Cavalry fired the Aggie cannon twelve times, once for each victim. Former President George H. W. Bush, his wife Barbara, Texas <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> and his wife Laura attended the remembrance ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The Latino {{community}} was deeply {{affected by the}} news of Selena's death; some people traveled thousands of miles to visit her home, boutiques, and the crime scene, while churches with large congregations of Latinos held prayers in her name. All major television networks in the United States interrupted their regular programming to break the news. The public's reaction to Selena's death was compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy. Some Americans who were unaware of the singer and her popularity criticized the attention she and her murder received from both {{the media and the}} Latino community. Radio personality Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder, burial, and her mourners and criticized her music, playing her songs with gunshots in the background, causing an uproar among the Latino population. On April 12, 1995—two weeks after her death—then-Texas <b>governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Some Americans were offended because Selena Day that year coincided with Easter.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{the city}} {{is a blend of}} {{downtown}} liberalism and suburban conservatism but leans to the political left as a whole.

25|$|Objections to {{the electoral}} vote count are rarely raised, {{although}} it did occur during the vote count in 2001 after the close 2000 presidential election between <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> of Texas {{and the vice president}} of the United States, Al Gore. Gore, who as vice president was required to preside over his own Electoral College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections, all of which were raised by only several representatives and would have favored his candidacy, after no senators would agree to jointly object. Objections were again raised in the vote count of the 2004 elections, and on that occasion the document was presented by one representative and one senator. Although the joint session was suspended, the objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both Houses of Congress. If there are no objections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer simply includes a state's votes, as declared in the certificate of vote, in the official tally.|$|E

5000|$|In 1998, Coverdell, {{running with}} the slogan [...] "Coverdell Works," [...] made history by {{becoming}} the first Republican from Georgia ever to be re-elected to the U.S. Senate. In 1999 before an exploratory committee was formed, Coverdell took on the job of liaison between then <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush's</b> campaign and the Senate. Early in the campaign, Coverdell's job was to line up Republican senators to endorse Governor Bush instead of Senator John McCain and he succeeded in getting the endorsement of almost every Senate Republican. After Bush locked up the nomination, Coverdell dealt with requests from senators who {{wanted to talk to}} Bush. [...] "We don't want black holes," [...] Coverdell said.

500|$|McCain was {{the main}} {{challenger}} to Texas <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> who had the political and financial support {{of most of the}} party establishment.

50|$|The Lieutenant Governor {{assumes the}} powers of the Governor of Texas when the {{governor}} is out of the state or otherwise unable to discharge the office. The Lieutenant Governor is elected separately from the Governor, rather than on the same ticket; it is therefore possible for the Governor and Lieutenant Governor to be from different political parties (which was the case during <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush's</b> first term and also during Bill Clements's two non-consecutive terms). The Lieutenant Governor becomes Governor if the elected Governor resigns, dies or is removed from office via impeachment and conviction. Former Governor Rick Perry took office upon <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush's</b> resignation on December 21, 2000. Bush became US President on January 20, 2001. When Perry became lieutenant governor on 19 January 1999, he became the first Republican since Albert Jennings Fountain in 1873 to serve as lieutenant governor, and the first Republican to be elected as Lieutenant Governor since James W. Flanagan in 1869.|$|R

500|$|Rove, {{while an}} advisor to Texas <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> during the 2000 {{election}} campaign, often {{spoke of the}} parallels he saw between McKinley and his 1896 campaign, and the 2000 election, {{going so far as}} to fax copies of books on McKinley. The media took the parallels further than Rove intended, making comparisons between him and Hanna, hinting that Rove controlled Bush like it was said Hanna controlled McKinley. Williams also saw the lasting effect of McKinley's 1896 campaign, [...] "a new approach to campaigning, the educational or merchandising style, continues to mold campaigns today, as does McKinley's focus on message, Hanna's use of money, and Dawes's reliance on efficiency and education... more than a century later, Americans and their political leaders can still learn from the events of the 1890s, whose lessons echo down the years today." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Texas <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> {{successfully}} {{ran for the}} presidency. [...] As {{the campaign}} progressed, the media compared Hanna and Bush adviser Karl Rove, who was believed by some to hold a Svengali-like influence over the Texas governor. [...] During the campaign, and until his departure from the White House in 2007, media members often suggested that Rove was able to manipulate Bush, and that Rove exerted considerable control over the government. [...] Bush's advisor was deemed a present-day incarnation of Hanna, who was almost invariably presented negatively and at variance with historical fact. [...] For example, writer Jack Kelly in a 2000 column incorrectly stated that McKinley's front porch campaign was {{at the direction of}} Hanna to ensure the candidate did not vary from campaign themes, rather than McKinley deciding that it was his best response to Bryan's national tour. [...] These comparisons were fuelled by Rove's interest in, and from some reports, liking for Hanna. Rove studied the McKinley administration at the University of Texas under McKinley biographer Lewis L. Gould, and believes that Hanna's influence has been overstated.|$|E
