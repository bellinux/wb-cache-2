40|$|Forty five rice genotypes {{originating}} from Bangladesh, IRRI (Philippines), Japan and China were evaluated under irrigated ecosystem {{with a view}} to finding out genetic divergence for 10 characters including yield. The genotypes were constellated into five distinct groups with the range of three genotypes <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> V and 16 genotypes <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> III. The inter-cluster distances were larger than the intra-cluster distances in all cases except <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> III, suggesting wider genetic diversity among the genotypes of different groups. The intra- cluster distance was highest <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> III and least <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> V. Maximum inter- cluster distance was observed between genotypes of cluster I and II followed by cluster I and III; II and IV; III and IV and the minimum was found between genotypes of cluster II and III.

Though grains/panicle, days to flowering and grain length were positive contributors to genetic diversity based on the latent vectors. Clusters with small intra-cluster distances were considered less diverse than those with large distances. The mean yield, grains/panicle, plant height and days to flowering was lowest <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> I and therefore, crosses involving the genotypes from this cluster with those from cluster II and III may exhibit high heterosis for earliness and grains/panicle.

5|$|A common mushroom, Mycena nargan {{is found}} growing singly or <b>in</b> <b>clusters</b> on the {{underside}} of rotting wood in wet and shaded areas, and is especially partial to Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster. Fruit bodies usually appear from April to June. The species has been recorded from Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap initiative has reported isolated collections in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, although the majority of sightings have been in Tasmania and Victoria. The fungus is saprobic, meaning it derives nutrients from dead or dying organic matter. A field study conducted in Tasmania showed that it is {{much more likely to be}} found in mature eucalypt forest (defined as having grown at least 70 years before the last wildfire) than young, regenerating forest that had experienced clearfelling, burning, and sowing two to three years previously.|$|E

40|$|The {{nutrient}} use efficiency (NUE) of a system, generally computed as {{the amount}} of nutrients in valuable outputs over the amount of nutrients in all inputs, is commonly used to benchmark the environmental performance of dairy farms. Benchmarking the NUE of farms, however, may lead to biased conclusions because of differences in major decisive characteristics between farms, such as soil type and production intensity, and because of epistemic uncertainty of input parameters caused by errors in measurement devices or observations. This study aimed to benchmark the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE N; calculated as N output per unit of N input) of farm clusters with similar characteristics while including epistemic uncertainty, using Monte Carlo simulation. Subsequently, the uncertainty of the parameters explaining most of the output variance was reduced to examine if this would improve benchmarking results. Farms <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> 1 (n = 15) were located on sandy soils and farms <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> 2 (n = 17) on loamy soils. Cluster 1 farms were more intensive in terms of milk production per hectare and per cow, had less grazing hours, and fed more concentrates compared to farms <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> 2. The mean NUE N of farm <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> 1 was 43 %, while <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> 2 it was 26 %. Input parameters that explained most of the output variance differed between clusters. For cluster 1, input of feed and output of roughage were most important, whereas for cluster 2, the input of mineral fertilizer (or fixation) was most important. For both clusters, the output of milk was relatively important. Including the epistemic uncertainty of input parameters showed that only 37 % of the farms <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> 1 (out of 105 mutual comparisons) differed significantly in terms of their NUE N, whereas <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> 2 this was 82 % (out of 120 comparisons). Therefore, benchmarking NUE N of farms <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> 1 was no longer possible, whereas farms <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> 2 could still be ranked when uncertainty was included. After reducing the uncertainties of the most important parameters, 72 % of the farms <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> 1 differed significantly in terms of their NUE N, and <b>in</b> <b>cluster</b> 2 this was 87 %. Results indicate that reducing epistemic uncertainty of input parameters can significantly improve benchmarking results. The method presented in this study, therefore, can be used to draw more reliable conclusions regarding benchmarking the NUE of farms, and to identify the parameters that require more precision to do so. </p...|$|R
