5|$|During {{the baby}} boom, DeLee's {{prophylactic}} forceps approach found new life. Busy physicians were often eager to adopt this systematic approach to anesthetized delivery because its efficiency {{allowed them to}} care for more patients. By 1968, nearly 40% of the babies born in U.S. hospitals were delivered with forceps. The use of episiotomies also continued to increase throughout DeLee's career and after his death. By the 1970s, 90% of delivering women received an <b>episiotomy.</b> A 1983 study did not support good outcomes with this practice, and by the year 2000, only 20 percent of U.S. deliveries involved an <b>episiotomy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vaginal tears {{can occur}} during childbirth, most {{often at the}} vaginal opening as the baby's head passes through, {{especially}} if the baby descends quickly. Tears can involve the perineal skin or extend to the muscles and the anal sphincter and anus. The midwife or obstetrician may decide to make a surgical cut to the perineum (<b>episiotomy)</b> to make the baby's birth easier and prevent severe tears that {{can be difficult to}} repair. A 2017 Cochrane review compared <b>episiotomy</b> as needed (restrictive) with routine <b>episiotomy</b> to determine the possible benefits and harms for mother and baby. The review found that restrictive <b>episiotomy</b> policies appeared to give a number of benefits compared with using routine <b>episiotomy.</b> Women experienced less severe perineal trauma, less posterior perineal trauma, less suturing and fewer healing complications at seven days with no difference in occurrence of pain, urinary incontinence, painful sex or severe vaginal/perineal trauma after birth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{a typical}} sub-Saharan African rural hospital, {{maternity}} staff seems to avoid <b>episiotomies.</b> The {{aim of this}} research is to develop a deeper understanding in the attitude of maternity staff regarding <b>episiotomies.</b> We used a descriptive qualitative approach: interviews, written questionnaires, and a group discussion. All methods showed strong reservations toward <b>episiotomies</b> among staff members. Most staff members have been trained to be very restrictive concerning <b>episiotomies</b> to prevent the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As a result of training and hence changing attitudes, the use of <b>episiotomies</b> is limited in all patients; even when strong indications are present and sometimes regardless of HIV status. This might increase the number of neonatal deaths...|$|R

25|$|The {{condition}} is sometimes {{classified as a}} psychiatric disorder. However, {{it can also be}} caused by medical problems such as diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, genital mutilation, complications from genital surgery, pelvic trauma (such as from a straddle injury caused by falling on the bars of a climbing frame, bicycle or gymnastics beam), hormonal imbalances, total hysterectomy, spinal cord injury, cauda equina syndrome, uterine embolisation, childbirth trauma (vaginal tearing through the use of forceps or suction or a large or unclosed <b>episiotomy),</b> vulvodynia and cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Vaginal {{changes that}} happen with aging and {{childbirth}} include mucosal redundancy, rounding of the posterior {{aspect of the}} vagina with shortening of {{the distance from the}} distal end of the anal canal to the vaginal opening, diastasis or disruption of the pubococcygeus muscles caused by poor repair of an <b>episiotomy,</b> and blebs that may protrude beyond the area of the vaginal opening. Other vaginal changes related to aging and childbirth are urinary incontinence, rectocele, cystocele, and stress. Similar vaginal and labial changes may be due to significant weight gain and subsequent loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause is poor {{contraction}} of the uterus following childbirth. Not all of the placenta being delivered, a tear of the uterus, or poor blood clotting are other possible causes. It occurs more commonly in those who: already have a low amount of red blood, are Asian, with bigger or more than one baby, are obese or are older than 40 years of age. It also occurs more commonly following caesarean sections, those in whom medications are used to start labor, {{and those who have}} an <b>episiotomy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Use of a {{continuous}} fetal monitor {{is the norm}} in hospitals and physician-run clinics, but precisely when this is typically applied is hard to discern from existing literature. <b>Episiotomies</b> were in 1995 still common in Japan: in the hospital the rate for primiparas was 88% and 41% for multiparas. (Matsuoka & Hinokuma 2009) Maternity homes tend to use far less technology and interventions. For example, the rate of <b>episiotomies</b> in maternity homes for primiparas was 5% and for multiparas it was 1%.|$|R

25|$|Most {{babies are}} born head first; however about 4% are born feet or buttock first, known as breech. During labour a woman can {{generally}} eat and move around as she likes, but pushing is not recommended during the first stage or during delivery of the head, and enemas are not recommended. While making a cut {{to the opening of}} the vagina, known as an <b>episiotomy</b> is common, it is generally not needed. In 2012, about 23 million deliveries occurred by a surgical procedure known as Caesarean section. Caesarean sections may be recommended for twins, signs of distress in the baby, or breech position. This method of delivery can take longer to heal from.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} shaving {{of the area}} around the vagina, was common {{practice}} due to the belief that hair removal reduced the risk of infection, made an <b>episiotomy</b> (a surgical cut to enlarge the vaginal entrance) easier, and helped with instrumental deliveries. It is currently less common, though it is still a routine procedure in some countries even though a systematic review found no evidence to recommend shaving. Side effects appear later, including irritation, redness, and multiple superficial scratches from the razor. Another effort to prevent infection has been the use of the antiseptic chlorhexidine or providone-iodine solution in the vagina. Evidence of benefit with chlorhexidine is lacking. A decreased risk is found with providone-iodine when a cesarean section is to be performed.|$|E
500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the American Gynecological Society in 1920, DeLee sparked {{controversy}} when he presented a paper advocating for the use of a systematic approach to childbirth for physicians, including the use of forceps and <b>episiotomy</b> even in women who had no labor complications. DeLee's [...] "prophylactic forceps operation" [...] consisted of several steps: scopolamine injections in the first stage of labor, ether anesthesia in the next stage, then <b>episiotomy</b> and forceps delivery. Ergot was used in the subsequent manual extraction of the placenta. DeLee reasoned that the <b>episiotomy</b> prevented perineal tears which could cause complications like uterine prolapse and vesicovaginal fistula. He said that the early use of forceps would avoid pressure from the pelvic bones against a baby's head, thus preventing complications like epilepsy and cerebral palsy; DeLee said that fatal complications occurred in 4â€“5% of labors managed with the traditional conservative approach. Though DeLee said that such interventions should only be carried out by a well-equipped physician specialist, John Whitridge Williams and other prominent obstetricians criticized DeLee sharply. They felt that DeLee was being too aggressive by removing a baby before complications occurred; DeLee's colleagues preferred to be conservative and to manage complications as they arose.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} uterine fundal pressure during {{the second stage of}} labor (Kristeller maneuver) on pelvic floor dysfunction (urinary and anal incontinence, genital prolapse, pelvic floor strength). METHODS: 522 primiparous women, enrolled 3 months after vaginal delivery, were divided in two groups: group A (297 women) identifies the women who received Kristeller maneuvers with different indications (e. g. fetal distress, failure to progress, mother exhaustion), group B (225 women) the women without maneuver. Participants were questioned about urogynecological symptoms and examined by Q-tip test, digital test, vaginal perineometry and uroflowmetric stop test score. RESULTS: Mediolateral <b>episiotomies,</b> dyspareunia and perineal pain were significantly higher in Kristeller group, whereas urinary and anal incontinence, genital prolapse and pelvic floor strength were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Kristeller maneuver does not modify puerperal pelvic floor function but increases the rate of <b>episiotomies...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} rates of {{obstetrical}} complications and interventions among patients managed or comanaged by family physicians. DESIGN: Case series. Retrospective review of hospital records. SETTING: Victoria Hospital, a tertiary care centre affiliated with the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred forty-two women in labour admitted consecutively by family physicians from October 1, 1990, to September 31, 1991. There were no exclusions based on antenatal risk. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Degree of risk on admission, and rates of cesarean sections, inductions, epidurals, forceps deliveries, <b>episiotomies,</b> perineal tears, postpartum hemorrhages, and postpartum fever for mothers. For newborns, Apgar scores and rate of need for a pediatric critical care unit or special observation nursery. RESULTS: Except for rates of inductions and <b>episiotomies,</b> which were lower than those reported elsewhere, results were all comparable to those in previous North American studies of low-risk family medicine obstetric patients. CONCLUSION: Family physicians care for women {{with a range of}} antenatal risks.

2500|$|The {{functioning}} of the anal canal can be damaged, traumatically or atraumatically. The resting tone of the anal canal {{is not the only}} factor which is important, both the length of the high pressure zone and its radial translation of force are required for continence. This means that even with normal anal canal pressure, focal defects such as the keyhole deformity can be the cause of substantial symptoms. External anal sphincter (EAS) dysfunction is associated with impaired voluntary control, whereas internal anal sphincter (IAS) dysfunction is associated with impaired fine tuning of fecal control. Lesions which mechanically interfere with, or prevent the complete closure of the anal canal can cause a liquid stool or mucous rectal discharge. Such lesions include piles (inflamed hemorrhoids), anal fissures, anal cancer or fistulae. Obstetric injury may tear the anal sphincters, and some of these injuries may be occult (undetected). The risk of injury is greatest when labor has been especially difficult or prolonged, when forceps are used, with higher birth weights or when an midline <b>episiotomy</b> is performed. Only when there is post operative investigation of FI such as endoanal ultrasound is the injury discovered. FI is a much under-reported complication of surgery. The IAS is easily damaged with an anal retractor (especially the Park's anal retractor), leading to reduced resting pressure postoperatively. Since the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions contribute 15% of the resting anal tone, surgeries involving these structures may affect continence status. Partial internal sphincterotomy, fistulotomy, anal stretch (Lord's operation), hemorrhoidectomy or transanal advancement flaps may all lead to FI post operatively, with soiling being far more common than solid FI. The [...] "keyhole deformity" [...] refers to scarring within the anal canal and is another cause of mucus leakage and minor incontinence. This defect is also described as a groove in the anal canal wall, and may occur after posterior midline fissurectomy or fistulotomy, or with lateral IAS defects. Rare causes of traumatic injury to the anal sphincters include military or traffic accidents complicated by pelvic fractures, spine injuries or perineal lacerations, insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum, and sexual abuse. [...] Nontraumatic conditions causing anal sphincter weakness include scleroderma, damage to the pudendal nerves and IAS degeneration of unknown cause. Radiation induced FI may involve the anal canal as well as the rectum, when proctitis, anal fistula formation and diminished function of internal and external sphincter occur. Irradiation may occur during radiotherapy, e.g. for prostate cancer.|$|E
