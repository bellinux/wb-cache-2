40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} major environmental impacts {{associated with the}} production of hemp yarn using Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). A reference scenario of traditional hemp warm water retting was compared to: (1) bio-retting, i. e. hemp green scutching followed by water retting, (2) babyhemp, based on stand <b>retting</b> <b>of</b> pre-mature hemp, (3) <b>dew</b> <b>retting</b> <b>of</b> flax. overall, neither of the alternative scenarios was unambiguously better than the reference. The impacts of the hemp reference scenario and the flax scenario were similar, except for pesticide use (higher for flax) and water use during processing (higher for hemp). Bioretting had higher impacts than the reference scenario for climate change and energy use, due to higher energy input in fibre processing. Babyhemp had higher impacts than the reference scenario for eutrophication, land occupation and pesticide use. A reduction of {{the environmental impacts of}} hemp yarn should give priority to reduction of energy use in the fibre processing and yam production stages and to reduction of eutrophication in the crop production phase...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-seven samples {{representing}} variations <b>of</b> <b>retted</b> flax fibers {{are analyzed}} using a color spectrophotometer and CIELAB models. Variables included enzyme or <b>dew</b> <b>retting,</b> fiber or seed flax, enzyme and chelator concentrations, and sequential cleaning steps. In addition {{to differences in}} color with enzyme or <b>dew</b> <b>retting,</b> the variables involved in enzyme retting also contribute to differences in the lightness, redness-greenness, and yellowness-blueness of the resulting fibers. <b>Dew</b> <b>retted</b> fiber flax, as well as seed flax that has weathered during storage prior to enzyme retting, is significantly darker than non-weathered, enzyme retted fiber flax. Painvise comparisons show that lower enzyme concentrations (0. 05 % v/v as commercially supplied) produce redder and yellower fiber samples than those retted with higher (0. 3 % v/v) enzyme levels. Higher chelator levels, (i. e., 50 versus 25 mmol ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) produce redder fibers. Fiber lightness significantly increases with additional cleaning steps. Results indicate that objective color measurements and color standards can define important fiber properties in order to tailor raw materials for specific industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} <b>of</b> <b>retting</b> flax {{recently}} developed {{to suit the}} United Kingdom climate has allowed the reintroduction of flax growing to this country. The weed killer glyphosate is sprayed on the crop which then rets before harvesting six weeks later. The acute bronchoconstrictor responses of 11 normal subjects to dust from <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> and from pre-harvest retted flaxes were compared in a double blind crossover fashion. There {{were no significant differences}} in the dust levels nor in the size of the dust particles in the experimental dust room.

40|$|Seven {{strains of}} {{filamentous}} fungi and one yeast were isolated from flax that was <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> in the United States. These filamentous fungi were subcultured to purity and identified, and six appear {{not to have}} been reported earlier as isolates from dew-retted flax. Five of the purified U. S. strains, two fungi isolated from flax that was <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> in Europe, and a laboratory culture of Aspergillus sojae were tested for their ability to ret flax stems. The monocultures were evaluated for the degree <b>of</b> <b>retting,</b> fiber strength, dry weight loss, and tactile response (i. e., feel of softness) as reflected in the retted fiber. Structural modifications of representative samples <b>of</b> the <b>retted</b> flax were assessed by scanning electron microscopy. All of the filamentous fungi were able to carry out some retting, whereas the isolated yeast could not. All organisms produced pectinases when they were cultivated in shake flasks on ball-milled flax as the sole carbon source. Some fungi also produced cellulases, mannanases, and xylanases. Rhizomucor pusillus and Fusarium lateritium were noteworthy as retting organisms by their high level of pectinase activity, ability to attack noncellulosic cell types without attacking cellulose, capacity to penetrate the cuticular surface of the stem, and efficient fiber release from the core. The results indicated that these organisms deserve further study as potential organisms for <b>retting</b> <b>of</b> bast fibers in industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Grading of {{flax fibre}} in Canada, {{and in all}} other flax-producing countries, is done by {{professional}} graders who judge the flax by appearance (cleanness, glossiness, length of fibre, colour), by handle or feel (weight, softness), and by strength (breaking a few strands of fibre in the hands). Because this method is based on human judgment, two graders may award different grades to samples of the same fibre. It was felt that if some scientific method for ascertaining grades could be obtained, {{it would be a}} valuable contribution. Hence, a series of chemical determinations was made on flax fibre of various grades produced by water and <b>dew</b> <b>retting</b> in an attempt to assess the quality of flax fibre by chemical analysis. Concurrently, use was made of the Pressley Cotton Fibre Strength Tester {{to determine whether or not}} this machine could be adapted to flax fibre and yarn to differentiate between grades by means of physical tests. An investigation was made also of various types <b>of</b> chemical <b>retting</b> procedures. Because <b>of</b> the speed with which flax straw can be retted by chemical solutions, an attempt was made to determine if fibre of quality equal to that obtained by water and <b>dew</b> <b>retting</b> could be produced thereby. The chemically retted fibre then was subjected to the physical and chemical tests used in the attempts to appraise flax produced by water and <b>dew</b> <b>retting.</b> [ [...] . ...|$|R
2500|$|The cut hemp is laid in swathes to dry {{for up to}} four days.

50|$|However, {{the varying}} {{properties}} of the base material of first generation Setralit {{turned out to be}} a serious disadvantage because these variations affected the performance characteristics of the final product in an unforeseeable way.

These effects are particularly critical during <b>dew</b> <b>retting.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bacteria {{are used}} to {{separate}} fibres of jute, hemp, and flax in the process <b>of</b> <b>retting.</b> The plants are immersed in water and when they swell, inoculated with bacteria which hydrolyze pectic substances of the cell walls and separate the fibres.

30|$|In retting, {{producing}} a long fiber {{is a difficult}} task during the processing of bast plants. The standard strategies used for separating the long bast fibers are <b>dew</b> and water <b>retting,</b> each <b>of</b> those requires 14 – 28  days. Although the fibers made from water <b>retting</b> can be <b>of</b> prime quality, the long time and pollution have created this technique undesirable (Paridah et al. 2011). With the approach of biotechnology within the textile industry, new biological treatments emerge at recent times. Bacterial/enzymatic retting is superior to other retting processes by having much shorter retting time, higher fiber quality without significant damage and lower pollution (Hoondal et al. 2002; Van Sumere 1992).|$|R

5000|$|In {{this section}} Marx {{explains}} that commodities come in double form: natural form and value form. We {{do not know}} commodities' value until we know how much human labor was put in it. Commodities are traded for one another after their values are decided socially. Then there is value-relation, which lets us trade between different kind of commodities. Marx explains value without using money. Marx uses 20 yards <b>of</b> <b>linen</b> and a coat to show the value of each other (20 yards <b>of</b> <b>linen</b> = 1 coat, or 20 yards <b>of</b> <b>linen</b> are worth 1 coat). The statement [...] "20 yards <b>of</b> <b>linen</b> are worth 1 coat" [...] label two forms of value. The first form, the relative form of value, is the commodity that comes first in the statement (the 20 yards <b>of</b> <b>linen</b> in the example). The second form, the equivalent form of value, is the commodity that comes second in the statement (the 1 coat in the example). He adds that comparing 20 yards <b>of</b> <b>linen</b> to itself (20 yards <b>of</b> <b>linen</b> = 20 yards <b>of</b> <b>linen,</b> or 20 yards <b>of</b> <b>linen</b> are worth 20 yards <b>of</b> <b>linen)</b> is meaningless, {{because there is no}} expression <b>of</b> value. <b>Linen</b> is an object of utility whose value cannot be determined until it is compared to another commodity. Determining the value of a commodity depends on its position in the expression of comparative exchange value.|$|R

40|$|A {{homogeneous}} batch <b>of</b> <b>dew</b> <b>retted</b> {{hackled flax}} {{was divided into}} two portions. One was untreated {{and the other was}} steamed for 45 minutes at 125 degrees C in three pressure/vacuum cycles in an autoclave. Dust was collected when the two flaxes were separately processed by industrial doubler and stapler machines. From untreated flax 7. 2 g of dust was collected per kilogram of flax after two processing operations. From the steamed flax 4. 4 g of flax was obtained per kilogram after four operations. A method was devised to disperse the dust in a room to produce dust levels similar to those encountered in a dusty mill (4. 5 - 5. 7 mg/m 3). Twelve normal volunteers from the managerial staff <b>of</b> the <b>linen</b> industry <b>of</b> Northern Ireland inhaled the dust over six hour periods. With the untreated flax decreases were obtained in mean forced expiratory measurements of 7. 6 % in FEV 1 and 4. 5 % in FVC (p less than 0. 01). A double blind crossover comparison of similar levels of untreated and steamed flax dusts showed 30 % less impairment of the forced expirations with steamed than with untreated flax (p less than 0. 05). If these responses reflect the long term airway effects of flax dust then the steaming of flax may help in reducing byssinosis...|$|R

40|$|A {{process for}} the aerobic {{biological}} decomposition of guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) prior to extraction of the rubber by mechanical means was patented by Spence (1933). The process, called <b>retting</b> because <b>of</b> the loose analogy to the <b>retting</b> <b>of</b> flax for the production <b>of</b> <b>linen</b> fiber, produced a marked decrease in the impurities of the rubber and improved the physical properties of the vulcanized rubber. It also decreased the resinous acetone-soluble contam-inant from about 20 per cent of the crude rubber product to about 10 per cent, but no conclusions were drawn as to the agent responsible for the changes in composition and properties. The work reported in this paper is one phase of a reinvestigation <b>of</b> the <b>retting</b> <b>of</b> guayule by the natural microflora; it deals specifically with the decomposition of guayule resins. The resin of guayule {{is a mixture of}} acetone-soluble constituents of the plant. When the shrub is injured a clear resin exudes and dries. Other resin preparations were made by exhaustive extraction of guayule rubber with acetone and removal of the solvent. A variety of microorganisms normally present in the soil flora have been shown to oxidize compounds ordinarily considered relatively resistant to biochemical oxidation. Numerous species of bacteria have been found to oxidize phenols, and aromatic, alicyclic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The literature on these subjects prior to 1940 is briefly reviewed by Bushnell and Haas (1941). Many species of actinomycetes oxidize aliphatic hydrocarbons (Umbreit, 1939) and the olefinic rubber hydrocarbon (Spence and Van Niel, 1936; Kalinenko, 1938, 1940; ZoBell and Grant, 1942). Fungi, especially species of Aspergillus and Peni-ciUium, have also been shown to oxidize aliphatic hydrocarbons (Rahn, 1906) an...|$|R

40|$|Extracting flax fibers {{from the}} stems of Liriiirn usitatissitiizim plants has {{traditionally}} been a costly, labor-intensive process, largely restricted to Europe and Asia. The naturally long, strong fibers are typically processed on wet spinning machines that are not available in the United States.
