500|$|After the {{remixing}} of {{the songs}} started, Benitez noted, [...] "We decided on basic questions like 'How loud should the drums be? <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>should</b> the vocals stand out?' These are creative decisions which will change the finished piece of music." [...] Shep Pettibone, one of the producers of the album commented that [...] "normally, without some music to work on, the remixer has nothing. But we already had Madonna's catalogue of danceable songs which was enough material for lifetime." [...] The mixes on You Can Dance exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques. Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing, which undermined the tighter structure of the original pop song. Vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes, panned across the stereophonic sound outlets. At certain points, almost no music is heard except the drums and at others, the drums are removed with only the hi-hat left to keep time.|$|E
500|$|On May 20, 2016 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{announced}} {{changes to}} the Nutrition Facts panel displayed on all foods, to be effective by July 2018. New to the panel is a requirement to list [...] "Added sugars" [...] by weight and {{as a percent of}} Daily Value (DV). For vitamins and minerals the intent of DVs is to indicate <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>should</b> be consumed. For added sugars, the guidance is that 100% DV should not be exceeded. 100% DV is defined as 50 grams. For a person consuming 2000 calories a day, 50 grams, the amount to not exceed, is the same as 200 calories, and thus 10% of total calories - same guidance as the World Health Organization. To put this into context, most 12 ounce (335 mL) cans of soda contain 39 grams of sugar. In the United States, a recently published government survey on food consumption reported that for men and women ages 20 and older the average total sugar intakes - naturally occurring in foods and added - were, respectively, 125 and 99 g/day.|$|E
500|$|After {{buying the}} rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put it in active {{development}} in November 1995. Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film adaption of the book before, when he bought {{the rights to}} the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey. In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg and had an argument with him <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>should</b> the film appeal to adults. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he deemed some of Adamson's ideas, such as adding sexual jokes and Guns N' Roses music to the soundtrack, to be too outrageous. Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film , and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson. Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific detail questions about the film's sequences; [...] "We both ended up doing a lot of everything," [...] Adamson said. [...] "We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{this paper}} Ramsey's {{contribution}} to economic theory was the elegant concept of Ramsey pricing. This is applicable {{in situations where}} a (regulated) monopolist wants to maximise consumer surplus whilst {{at the same time}} ensuring that its costs are adequately covered. This is achieved by setting the price such that the markup over marginal cost is inversely proportional to the price elasticity of demand for that good. Like its predecessor this paper was published in The Economic Journal in 1927. Ramsey poses the question that is to be solved {{at the beginning of the}} article: [...] "a given revenue is to be raised by proportionate taxes on some or all uses of income, the taxes on different uses being possibly at different rates; <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>should</b> these rates be adjusted in order that the decrement of utility may be a minimum?" [...] (Ramsey 1927). The problem was suggested to him by the economist Arthur Pigou and the paper was Ramsey's answer to the problem.|$|E

6000|$|After Homer and Hesiod, {{our most}} ancient {{authorities}} for Greek cosmogonic myths {{are probably the}} so-called Orphic fragments. Concerning the dates and the manner of growth of these poems volumes of erudition have been compiled. As Homer is silent about Orpheus (in spite of the position which the mythical Thracian bard acquired as the inventor of letters and magic {{and the father of}} the mysteries), it has been usual to regard the Orphic ideas as of late introduction. We may agree with Grote and Lobeck that these ideas and the ascetic [...] "Orphic mode of life" [...] first acquired importance in Greece about the time of Epimenides, or, roughly speaking, between 620 and 500 B.C.(1) That age certainly witnessed a curious growth of superstitious fears and of mystic ceremonies intended to mitigate spiritual terrors. Greece was becoming more intimately acquainted with Egypt and with Asia, and was comparing her own religion with the beliefs and rites of other peoples. The times and the minds of men were being prepared for the clear philosophies that soon [...] "on Argive heights divinely sang". Just as, when the old world was about to accept Christianity, a deluge of Oriental and barbaric superstitions swept across men's minds, so immediately before the dawn of Greek philosophy there came an irruption of mysticism and of spiritual fears. We may suppose that the Orphic poems were collected, edited and probably interpolated, in this dark hour of Greece. [...] "To me," [...] says Lobeck, [...] "it appears that the verses may be referred to the age of Onomacritus, an age curious in the writings of ancient poets, and attracted by the allurements of mystic religions." [...] The style of the surviving fragments is sufficiently pure and epic; the strange unheard of myths are unlike those which the Alexandrian poets drew from fountains long lost.(2) But how much in the Orphic myths is imported from Asia or Egypt, how much is the invention of literary forgers like Onomacritus, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>should</b> be regarded as the first guesses of the physical poet-philosophers, and how much is truly ancient popular legend recast in literary form, it is impossible with certainty to determine.|$|E
