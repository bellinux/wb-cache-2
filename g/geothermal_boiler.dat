40|$|The {{importance}} of calcium phosphates (Ca/P) {{as the major}} constituents of in-dustrial mineral deposits has stimulated extensive research on the precipitation and inhibition of these com-pounds. In cooling, <b>boiler,</b> <b>geothermal,</b> and desalination applications, the insulating nature of scales on equipment surfaces results in decreased system efficiency and premature equipment failure. In addition to scaling problems, cooling water sys-tems and boilers constructed of carbon steel also experience corrosion problems caused by dissolved oxygen. Effective water treatment programs must control scale, corrosion, particulate matter, and microbiological growth. Many different inhibitors {{have been developed to}} provide corrosion protec...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{optimization}} of an advanced energy supply systems for two dwellings: a standard home and an advanced domotic home, where some demand side energy saving strategies have been implemented. In both cases the optimal synthesis, design and operation of the whole energy supply system have been obtained and a sensitivity analysis has been performed, by introducing different economic constraints. The optimization model {{is based on a}} Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and includes different kinds of small-scale cogenerators, <b>geothermal</b> heat pumps, <b>boilers,</b> heat storages, solar thermal and photovoltaic panels. In addition, absorption machines, supplied with cogenerated heat, can be used instead of conventional electrical chiller to face the cooling demand. The aim of the analysis is to address the question if advanced demand strategies and supply strategies have to be regarded as alternatives, or if they have to be simultaneously applied, in order to obtain the maximum energy and economic benefit...|$|R
40|$|RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY DEPLOYMENTThe use of {{renewable}} energy systems for both domestic and industrial heating and cooling applications has received relatively little attention compared with renewable electricity or transport biofuels. Where a good biomass, geothermal or solar thermal resource exists, heating technologies can often be competitive with those using fossil fuels. In a few countries their natural deployment has occurred with little if any policy support, resulting in greenhouse gas reductions. Elsewhere, several of the few national policies in place to remove barriers and encourage the greater deployment {{of renewable}} heat, (such as from using wood-burning <b>boilers,</b> <b>geothermal</b> ground-heat pumps, and solar water heaters) {{have proved to be}} cost-effective, yet other countries have been slow to replicate them. In regions where cooling has a greater energy demand than heating, especially during peak summer periods, renewable energy cooling systems show good potential for further development. This timely report examines the technologies, current markets and relative costs for heat and cold production using biomass, geothermal and solar-assisted systems. It evaluates a range of national case studies and relevant policies. Should the successful and more cost-effective policies be implemented by other countries, then the relatively untapped economic potential {{of renewable energy}} heating and cooling systems could be better realised, resulting in potential doubling of the present market within the next few years.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis aims at {{investigate how}} a specified house can optimize its energy consumption. Today the house often {{stands for the}} {{major part of the}} energy consumption in a consumers’ life, whereas an energy optimization creates economic as well as environmental advantages. It is important to make old houses more energy efficient, but putting high energy demands on new houses could be argued to be more important. The installations functions as both the heart and brain in a house, thus making it important to energy optimize these. Since the background describes the importance of energy efficiency and optimization in a house, the focus area of this report will be an investigation of different types of heating systems {{in order to be able}} to choose the one most suited for the house. Aspects considered when choosing the heating system was how economic the system is both in service- and investment costs and how environmental and operational friendly the system is. Through literature reviews there were sufficient information gathered that served as a foundation when comparing and choosing between the four systems - district heating, pellet-fired <b>boiler,</b> <b>geothermal</b> heating and solar heating. The comparison aims at investigate which of the systems that will suit the house best, based on given conditions. Solar heating could be eliminated since the angel of the roof is too flat. Pellet-fired boiler was deemed too demanding for the consumer since it requires constant maintenance – something which is not desirable given that the house is designed for a family. Depending on what is combusted in the district heating the environmental impact could either be minimized or maximized, but even with the environmental impact minimized district heating is still more expansive in the longer run than geothermal heating. This led to that geothermal heating was considered the most suitable heating system option for the house, a cheap system that requires no maintenance and does not affect the environment...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2003 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 116 - 119) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxviii, 137 leavesİzmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH), {{founded in}} 1992, {{is the third}} state university of İzmir. At present IZTECH Campus has individual fuel boiler heating systems for each faculty building and the Campus is still under development. But the Campus has also a geothermal source. In 2002, 5 gradient wells were drilled. Of these, one well has a geothermal fluid of 33 Â°C is obtained but the actual flowrate of the geothermal fluid has not been measured yet. The aim of this Thesis is to investigate this source whether {{it can be used}} for district heating application for IZTECH Campus. Mainly two heating system types have been considered;. Heat pump heating system (HPHS) (using a renewable energy source, <b>geothermal</b> energy),. Fuel <b>boiler</b> heating system (FBHS) (using a conventional energy source, fuel-oil). HPHS is considered as HPO type since the existing geothermal fluid temperature is low. While HPHS is considered only as district, FBHS is considered as district and individual. Each heating system is simulated using hourly outdoor temperature data. For these heating simulations, the main control parameter is the indoor temperature of the buildings. Mathematical models are derived using Matlab [16] and EES [17] programs. Various heating regime alternatives have been studied for HPHS for the various condenser outlet temperature and geothermal fluid flowrate. Consequently, the heating regime with 35 Â°C condenser inlet and 45 Â°C condenser outlet temperature with 120 kg/s geothermal fluid flowrate considered to be the best option. FBHSs are also simulated for various boiler set temperatures. Boiler set emperatures have been recommended by Demirdöküm [39], is the best alternative with the least fuel consumption and best indoor temperature around 20 Â°C. Besides heating system simulations, piping network simulation is made using the software Pipelab [18]. The piping network of the Campus has been considered with two loops as geothermal and Campus. Each loop contains supply and return main. The location of the heat centre and the pressure loss per unit length are common design parameters for economy of the system. Therefore, several alternatives have been studied and because of the lowest investment and operational cost, Alternative 3, where the heat centre {{is in the middle of}} the Campus, is considered to be the best option with target pressure loss of 150 Pa/m. For installation type of piping network, underground (buried) pipeline installation is selected. Furthermore, economic analysis has also been done for each heating system alternative depending on investment and operational costs. For operational cost, 3 heating scenarios are considered depending on the heating period of the buildings in the Campus. According to the results of economical analyses, while heat pump district heating system (HPDHS) has the biggest investment cost with 3, 040, 125 US$, it has minimum operational cost. The alternatives are evaluated according to internal rate of return (IRR) method, which shows the profit of the investment. The results indicate that, the HPDHS has minimum 3. 02 % profit according to the fuel boiler district heating system (FBDHS) at the end of the 20 -year period. The profit increases with increasing operating period of the heating systems...|$|R
