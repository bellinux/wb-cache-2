25|$|This rather {{straightforward}} {{account of}} the Ring's origins, however, has been disputed {{by a number of}} authorities, who accuse Wagner of deliberately distorting the facts so as to bring them into harmony with his own private version of history. The actual sequence of events, it seems, was not nearly as clear-cut as he would <b>have</b> <b>us</b> <b>believe.</b> It was in October 1846 – some sixteen months before the February Revolution – that he first drew up a plan for a five-act drama based on the life of Friedrich Barbarossa. He may even have considered writing an opera on Siegfried as early as 1843, when he read Jacob Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie (German Mythology), or possibly in 1844, when he borrowed several works on the Nibelungs from the Royal Library in Dresden. As for Die Wibelungen, it would appear that he only started work on this essay in December 1848 at the earliest, finishing it sometime before 22 February 1849, when he read it to his friend Eduard Devrient.|$|E

But Fodor complains that Pinker, Plotkin {{and other members of}} what he sarcastically calls [...] "the New Synthesis" [...] have taken modularity and similar ideas way too far. He insists that the mind is not [...] "massively modular" [...] and that, contrary to what these researchers would <b>have</b> <b>us</b> <b>believe,</b> the mind is still a very long way from having been explained by the computational, or any other, model.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the Internet upon marketing dynamics within UK banks. It draws upon ongoing empirical research in the retail sector of the financial services industry to report some preliminary findings as to the nature of change that is taking place. A number of marketing strategies are emerging that can be categorized along a continuum between evolutionary and revolutionary change. Hence there are likely to be implications for the way in which banks are organized and managed. The preliminary conclusions however, indicate that established norms seem to be enduring and online banking innovations are not in themselves transforming business priorities in the industry in the way that early predictions might <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>us</b> <b>believe...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary. In general {{relativity}} space-time ends at singularities. The big bang is considered as the Beginning {{and the big}} crunch, the End. However these conclusions are arrived at by using {{general relativity}} in regimes which lie well beyond its physical domain of validity. Examples where detailed analysis is possible show that these singularities are naturally resolved by quantum geometry effects. Quantum space-times can be vastly larger than what Einstein <b>had</b> <b>us</b> <b>believe.</b> These non-trivial space-time extensions enable us to answer of some long standing questions and resolve of some puzzles in fundamental physics. Thus, a century after Minkowski’s revolutionary ideas {{on the nature of}} space and time, yet another paradigm shift appears to await us in the wings. 1. ...|$|R

Time's arrow captures the uniqueness and distinctive character of sequential events, whereas time's cycle provides these events with another kind of meaning by evoking lawfulness and predictability.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} study {{was to understand the}} extent that consumers report purchasing wine on mobile devices and to empirically examine potential drivers of m-wine purchasing across six countries to guide theoretical research enquiry moving forward. Purposive sampling was employed. An online survey involving 2853 respondents from France, Germany, Greece, Canada, US and South Africa forms the basis for the current study. The results of the study indicate that though mobile phone usage, wine consumption and purchasing rates are high, mobile-wine purchasing prevalence is low within all six countries. While technology hype <b>has</b> <b>us</b> <b>believe</b> an online presence is essential for business revenue growth and performance; the current study indicates wineries should carefully consider consumer readiness towards mobile-wine purchasing.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} factors that {{motivated}} sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in their massive investment operations in European or US company equity, especially banking institutions. Considered to be investors with considerable financial clout, albeit passive and long-term, SWFs have long {{been seen as a}} restoring force in financial markets able to soften the impact of the destabilizing speculative strategies practiced by certain institutional operators. Over 2007, their massive cash injections into the banking sectors of industrialised countries could even go as far as <b>having</b> <b>us</b> <b>believe</b> that these investors were acting as saviours of the system. The rise of SWFs could hence be seen, at that time, as a change in financial capitalism in which States would act both as investors and regulators. Nevertheless, a sharper analysis of strategies conducted by SWFs shows that some of them are opportunistic, comparable to the strategies implemented by private institutional investors.

[...] His passions are so manifest that they are the very essence of the theatre.

'A poem {{should not}} mean,/ But be,' {{or so the}} twentieth century literati would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>us</b> <b>believe.</b> Yet from the {{earliest}} of classical narratives to modern-day e-zines, literary works have been turned to political, didactic and symbolic ends. In this groundbreaking work, Lee Rourke traces {{the long history of}} a form currently enjoying a resurgence online and in the works {{of some of the most}} talented young authors in print. As we begin to emerge from modernism and its aftermath, fables - the briefest of narratives given the most expansive of significations - have gained in popularity. Author and literary critic Rourke here considers the permutations of the form, from Aesop's tortoise and hare, via Plato's socio-political works and the later ribald medieval tales, to Kafka's anthropomorphism and present-day authors including Blake Butler, Joseph Young, Shane Jones and Jonathan Lethem. A Brief History of Fables offers a bold take on the new face of literature.|$|R
