6000|$|Joan had {{difficulty}} in deciding {{on her own}} frock. Her four evening dresses, as she walked round them, spread out upon the bed, all looked too imposing, for what Mrs. Phillips had warned her would be a [...] "homely affair." [...] She had one other, a greyish-fawn, with sleeves to the elbow, {{that she had had}} made expressly for public dinners and political At Homes. But that would be going to the opposite extreme, and might seem discourteous--to her hostess. Besides, [...] "mousey" [...] colours didn't really suit her. They gave her a curious sense of being affected. In the end she decided to risk a black crepe-de-chine, square cut, with a girdle of gold embroidery. There couldn't be anything quieter than black, and the gold embroidery was of the simplest. She would wear it without any jewellery whatever: except just a star in her hair. The result, as she viewed the effect in the long glass, quite satisfied her. Perhaps the <b>jewelled</b> <b>star</b> did scintillate rather. It had belonged to her mother. But her hair was so full of shadows: it wanted something to relieve it. Also she approved the curved line of her bare arms. It was certainly very beautiful, a woman's arm. She took her gloves in her hand and went down.|$|E
50|$|The Irish Crown Jewels {{were the}} heavily <b>jewelled</b> <b>star</b> and badge regalia of the Sovereign and Grand Master of the Order of St. Patrick. They {{were stolen from}} Dublin Castle in 1907 along with the collars of five knights of the Order. The theft was never solved and the jewels never recovered.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} attribute distinguishing a {{field marshal}} is a baton. The baton nowadays is purely ornamental, {{and as such}} may be richly decorated. That said, {{it is not necessary}} for the insignia to be a baton. (Such is the case in Russia post-1991 and the former Soviet Union, which use a <b>jewelled</b> <b>star</b> referred to as a Marshal's Star.) ...|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{climbed up}} one of the silver chains, holding in her hand the little porter who, in spite of his minute size, opened a secret door with his golden key and let her in. She entered a {{magnificent}} room which appeared to occupy the entire Castle, and which was lighted by gold and <b>jewelled</b> <b>stars</b> in the ceiling. In the midst of this room stood a couch, draped with curtains of all the colours of the rainbow, and suspended by golden cords so that it swayed with the Castle in a manner which rocked its occupant delightfully to sleep.|$|R
25|$|She was the 976th Dame of the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa. In 1923, the Pope conferred {{upon her}} the Golden Rose {{which was the}} first time this honor had been awarded on a British-born princess since 1555 when Pope Julius III conferred one upon Queen Mary I of England. She was also granted the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert by her grandmother, Queen Victoria. The Queen was also awarded the Spanish Red Cross Merit Order (First Class) and the <b>jewelled</b> breast <b>star</b> was paid for by a {{subscription}} undertaken by the Corps of Lady Nurses of the Spanish Red Cross.|$|R
6000|$|Within {{the sand}} of what far river lies The gold that gleams in tresses of my Love? What highest {{circle of the}} Heavens above Is <b>jewelled</b> with such <b>stars</b> as are her eyes? And where is the rich sea whose coral vies With her red lips, that cannot kiss enough? What dawn-lit garden knew the rose, whereof The fled soul lives in her cheeks' rosy guise? ...|$|R
