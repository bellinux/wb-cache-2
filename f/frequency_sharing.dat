40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how airlines share the passengers, attracted to air transportation. The percentage of these passengers, that one airline will carry in any given market, where it is in competition with other airlines, depends mostly on the frequency it operates, number of competitors in the market, stage length number of daily non-stop and one-stop flights, type of aircraft and the connecting flights. Market share furthermore depends on variables such as passenger service, the image of the airline, the amount of money spent on advertising in the given market. These variables are called behavioral variables and are impossible to be included in the models because of the inavailability of data on them. In this study investigation was restricted to the variables on which data can be fairly easily obtained. Until recently it was assumed that market share depends mostly on <b>frequency</b> <b>share</b> and furthermore that the relation between these is linear. This implies that if for example one airline operates 70 % of the flights in any given market, it will carry 70 % of the passengers in that market. The models presented in this study investigate this hypothesis as well as the effects that some of the other variables have on the market share. Model 1 investigates the effects of varying stage length and <b>frequency</b> <b>share.</b> Model 2 brings in additional explanatory variables including the second most important variable, number of competitors in the market. At this stage of investigation it was recognized that market share depends almost completely on <b>frequency</b> <b>share.</b> However the form of the relationship was not yet clear. Models 3 to 6 are an attempt to determine this relationship. Models 7 and 8 investigate the effects of times of flight through the day and the quality of service offered.

The station's original studios and antenna were atop the Hotel McAlpin, located on Herald Square and from which WMCA's call letters derive.

Four million listeners tuned in nightly to hear Jackson’s mix of music and conversations with jazz and show business celebrities.In 1971, Jackson and Percy Sutton, a former Manhattan borough president, co-founded the Inner City Broadcasting Corporation (ICBC), which acquired WLIB — becoming the first African-American owned-and-operated station in New York. The following year, ICBC acquired WLIB-FM, changing its call letters to WBLS ("the total BLack experience in Sound"). As of the late 2000s ICBC, of which Jackson was group chairman, owns and operates stations in New York, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Fort Lauderdale, Columbia, South Carolina, and Jackson, Mississippi.

To reduce {{the level of}} interference from the HUTs that can harm a geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite receiver in a space station, previous studies have taken two approaches: <b>frequency</b> <b>sharing</b> using a separated distance (FSSD) and <b>frequency</b> <b>sharing</b> using power control (FSPC).
