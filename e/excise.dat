5|$|Many {{residents}} of the western frontier petitioned against passage of the whiskey <b>excise.</b> When that failed, some western Pennsylvanians organized extralegal conventions to advocate repeal of the law. Opposition to the tax was particularly prevalent in four southwestern counties: Allegheny, Fayette, Washington, and Westmoreland. A preliminary meeting held on July 27, 1791 at Redstone Old Fort in Fayette County called for the selection of delegates to a more formal assembly, which convened in Pittsburgh in early September 1791. The Pittsburgh convention was dominated by moderates such as Hugh Henry Brackenridge, who hoped to prevent the outbreak of violence. The convention sent a petition for redress of grievances to the Pennsylvania Assembly and the U.S House of Representatives, both located in Philadelphia. As {{a result of this}} and other petitions, the <b>excise</b> law was modified in May 1792. Changes included a 1-cent reduction in the tax that was advocated by William Findley, a congressman from western Pennsylvania, but the new <b>excise</b> law was still unsatisfactory to many westerners.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{principal}} sources of revenue Hamilton prevailed upon Congress to approve was an <b>excise</b> tax on whiskey. In his first Tariff Bill in January 1790, Hamilton proposed to raise the three million dollars needed to pay for government operating expenses and interest on domestic and foreign debts {{by means of an}} increase on duties on imported wines, distilled spirits, tea, coffee, and domestic spirits. It failed, with Congress complying with most recommendations excluding the <b>excise</b> tax on Whiskey (Madison's tariff of the same year was a modification of Hamilton's that involved only imported duties and was passed in September).|$|E

40|$|Pulvinar motor {{tissues of}} Samanea saman are often <b>excised</b> for {{in vitro studies}} of ion {{transport}}. Because ion transport may be regulated in part by hydrostatic pressure (P), this study explores how P and water potential (Ψ) change when motor tissues are <b>excised.</b> Water potential (Ψ) of <b>excised</b> extensor and flexor tissues {{was measured by the}} Chardakov method and compared with Ψ measurements made on extensor and flexor tissues of intact pulvini (HL Gorton 1987 Plant Physiol 83 : 945 - 950). Ψ values for <b>excised</b> extensor and flexor tissues were always substantially more negative than for the same tissues in intact pulvini. Extensor tissues <b>excised</b> from open pulvini had slightly more negative Ψ than <b>excised</b> flexor tissues, and the opposite was true for closed pulvini. Extensor and flexor tissues elongate immediately when <b>excised</b> from open or closed pulvini, suggesting that in intact pulvini they are constrained from elongating by the nonextensible vascular core. In addition, both tissues in both open and closed pulvini are under compression imposed by oppositely positioned motor tissue. Excision relieves constraint and compression, decreasing P, and thus decreasing Ψ. This finding may explain, at least in part, the difference between Ψ measurements on intact and <b>excised</b> motor tissues. Implications of these data for the planning and interpretation of in vitro experiments requiring <b>excised</b> strips of extensor and flexor tissues are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Oilseed rape {{seedlings}} and <b>excised</b> cotyledons {{and roots}} {{were exposed to}} phosphorus and osmotic stress (- 1 MPa: NaCl or PEG). The stress factors limited {{the growth of the}} seedlings and inhibited the growth of the <b>excised</b> roots and cotyledons. The phosphorus content in the cotyledons and roots depended on its level in the media and on the stress factors used. Phosphorus deficiency differentiated total phosphatase activity in seedling cotyledons and increased the activity in the <b>excised</b> cotyledons. In the <b>excised</b> and seedling roots, the lack of phosphorus, its deficiency and stress imposed by the addition of NaCl, caused an increase in total and specific phosphatase activity. Osmotic stress caused proline accumulation in both the seedling and <b>excised</b> cotyledons, but the effect of phosphorus stress was much smaller. Proline increase in seedling roots followed only after the osmotic stress caused by NaCl. The proline content in the <b>excised</b> roots was low. Stress factors lowered the protein content in the seedling and <b>excised</b> cotyledons. In both seedling and <b>excised</b> roots, the lowering of the protein content occurred mainly in response to osmotic stress. Kinetin modified metabolic responses in seedling cotyledons and roots. The use of in vitro culture allowed the elucidation of the tested responses. In <b>excised</b> cotyledons grown under stress conditions, kinetin increased the phosphorus and protein contents and lowered proline accumulation, suggesting that kinetin had the ability to overcome phosphorus and osmotic stress. The <b>excised</b> oilseed rape roots responded only slightly to kinetin (Drozdowska and Rogozińska 1984) and its effect was much smaller...|$|R

5|$|Ashmole {{embarked}} on further catalogues, {{including one of}} the Roman coin collection of the Bodleian Library, which he finally completed in 1666 {{after eight years of}} work. It may have taken so long because Ashmole's progress was interrupted by the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, when Ashmole's loyalty was richly rewarded with political offices. He was appointed Secretary and Clerk of the Courts of Surinam and Comptroller of the White Office. While these two titles do not seem to have provided either an income or any specific duties, he also became Commissioner and then Comptroller for the <b>Excise</b> in London, and later was made the Accountant-General of the <b>Excise,</b> a position that made him responsible for {{a large portion of the}} King's revenue. These latter posts yielded him considerable income as well as considerable power of patronage.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole {{supported}} {{the side of}} Charles I in the Civil War. At the outbreak of fighting in 1642, he left London for the house of his father-in-law, Peter Mainwaring of Smallwood, Cheshire. There he lived a retired life until 1644, when he was appointed King's Commissioner of <b>Excise</b> at Lichfield. Soon afterwards, {{at the suggestion of}} George Wharton, a leading astrologer with strong court connections, Ashmole was given a military post at Oxford, where he served as an ordnance officer for the King's forces. In his spare time, he studied mathematics and physics at his lodgings, Brasenose College. There he acquired a deep interest in astronomy, astrology, and magic. In late 1645, he left Oxford to accept the position of Commissioner of <b>Excise</b> at Worcester. Ashmole was given the additional military post of captain in Lord Astley's Regiment of Foot, part of the Royalist Infantry, though as a mathematician, he was seconded to artillery positions. He seems never to have participated in any actual fighting.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There are no univocal {{opinions}} on the management of incompletely <b>excised</b> basal cell carcinoma (BCC); early re-excision or clinical observation represent the two possible options. The main objective {{of the present study}} was to compare the rate of recurrence between incompletely <b>excised</b> BCCs, not re-excised, and completely <b>excised</b> BCCs within a 3 - 5 year follow-up period in order to reach indications about the most appropriate care strategy. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study on a cohort of 39 incompletely <b>excised</b> and 107 completely <b>excised</b> BCCs. Patients were recalled for a visit. RESULTS: Three (8 %) BCCs recurred among the incompletely <b>excised</b> tumors and 3 (3 %) among those completely <b>excised,</b> without significant difference. Advanced age and chronic occupational sun exposure were found to be associated with BCC recurrence. Thirty-seven percent of patients developed new BCCs during follow-up. Half of the patients did not adhere to the scheduled visits after BCC excision. The rate of patients with diagnosis of new or recurrent BCC at the recall visit was higher among non-adherent patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the case of incompletely <b>excised</b> BCCs, long-term clinical observation may be pursued, especially when immediate surgical re-excision is contraindicated. Difficulty in maintaining follow-up due to poor patient adherence represents a concern in clinical practice...|$|R

5000|$|Skin {{cancer and}} {{malignant}} melanoma — Cutaneous malignancies of the helical rim can be <b>excised</b> and closed with the Antia-Buch helical advancement technique. Cancerous lesions in the concha {{or over the}} antihelix can usually be <b>excised</b> and skin grafted. If the cartilage is involved, it can be <b>excised</b> and the graft placed directly on the posterior skin. Malignant melanomas should be <b>excised</b> with the same margins as melanomas of the equivalent depth {{in other parts of}} the body. Melanoma in situ does not require a full-thickness excision, and is <b>excised</b> with a 5-mm margin, to preserve the perichondrium, and then covered with a skin graft. Invasive melanomas of the helical rim require wedge resection to achieve adequate margins; these defects might be large and require secondary reconstruction as in Figure 30.11.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an <b>excise</b> tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the <b>excise</b> on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790. Among the {{farmers in the}} region, the whiskey <b>excise</b> was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners. Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills. Farmers living west of the Appalachian Mountains distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A whiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers. Additionally, cash was always in short supply on the frontier, so whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. For poorer people who were paid in whiskey, the <b>excise</b> was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistance}} came to {{a climax}} in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney William Rawle issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the <b>excise</b> tax. Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means. At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing <b>excise</b> trials {{to be held in}} local state courts. But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General William Bradford later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.|$|E

When cotyledons were <b>excised</b> with a full hook and were partially or totally shielded from light with aluminum foil, the samples with the hook covered accumulated more chlorophyll than the wholly exposed samples.

40|$|Ion {{channels}} in <b>excised</b> patches of plasma membrane are {{generally considered to}} be isolated from any intracellular regulation mechanisms. For example, in <b>excised</b> patches of vertebrate rod outer segment plasma membrane, the cGMP-activated cation channels have traditionally been studied in room light because the enzyme cascade linking photon absorption to channel closure was assumed to be inoperative. To investigate the possibility that, in fact, such <b>excised</b> patches retain a functional phototransduction enzymatic cascade, this same preparation was studied in darkness. Patches <b>excised</b> in the dark were found to retain the light sensitivity of their cGMP-induced conductance and the ability to synthesize cGMP. In the presence of guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]), a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, light suppresses the cGMP-induced conductance irreversibly. Furthermore, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase activity reduce light sensitivity, whereas activated phosphodiesterase or activated transducin does not directly affect the channels. These results (i) establish that <b>excised</b> patches from rod outer segment retain functional phototransduction enzymes, (ii) support the classical view that channel opening is modulated by phosphodiesterase-mediated cGMP hydrolysis, and, most surprisingly, (iii) demonstrate that diffusion in <b>excised</b> patches is so restricted that local enzymes can induce variations in the concentration of small molecules. The indication that <b>excised</b> patches are not as simple as usually surmised opens the possibility of using them to study other intracellular transduction mechanisms...|$|R

5|$|Illicit distilleries were commonplace {{throughout}} the Speyside area from medieval times but were largely made redundant {{with the passing}} of the <b>Excise</b> Act in 1823. It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, was allegedly instrumental in the passing of this legislation. Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an illicit distillery at the time, became the first person in Glenlivet to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit. This would prove to be an unpopular decision; every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new <b>Excise</b> Act would be repealed, something which would not happen if some distillers accepted the new law. Threats were made against George Smith, so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the distillery. In 1824, The Glenlivet distillery was established at Upper Drumin by George and his youngest son John Gordon Smith.|$|E
40|$|Introns <b>excised</b> {{from the}} primary {{transcript}} of Delta (Dl), a Drosophila neurogenic gene, accumulate to unusually high levels in embryos. High resolution in situ hybridization reveals a striking localization of the <b>excised</b> introns to two foci per embryonic nucleus. The number of foci can be altered by varying the number of Dl genes present in the embryonic nucleus, suggesting that the <b>excised</b> introns are localized near sites of Dl transcription. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} observation that larval and imaginal disc nuclei containing two copies of Dl exhibit only one focus of intron accumulation, as expected for nuclei in which homologous chromosomes are paired. Interestingly, the <b>excised</b> introns do not appear to diffuse away from the foci until late prophase, at which time the foci disperse into numerous small dots of hybridization. These results suggest that the <b>excised</b> Dl introns may be associated with a structural element within the nucleus that is dissociated during cell division...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The use of {{autogenous}} vein, {{whether in}} situ or <b>excised,</b> for arterial bypass procedures is well accepted. However, this usually requires {{the presence of}} a length of good-quality vein of adequate diameter. In patients lacking sufficient length of vein, two or more pieces of vein may be spliced together to complete the reconstruction. The effect of vein splicing on vein bypass patency is not well studied. Methods: Over a 14 -year period, 1956 lower extremity revascularizations were performed with a single autogenous vein, 1806 in situ and 150 <b>excised</b> veins. During the same time, 184 bypasses required splicing vein segments together, of which 111 were in situ bypass procedures, which required splicing of one or more pieces of <b>excised</b> vein to complete the reconstruction (partial in situ bypass). Seventy-three bypasses were completed with multiple pieces of spliced <b>excised</b> vein. The source for the <b>excised,</b> spliced vein segments was the distal ipsilateral greater saphenous vein (GSV) in 40 %, accessory ipsilateral GSV in 8 %, contralateral GSV in 13 %, lesser saphenous vein in 28 %, and arm vein in 11 %. Results: The 1 - and 4 -year primary patency rates for the entire spliced vein group were 72 % and 45 %, with secondary patency rates of 79 % and 61 %. The 1 - and 4 -year secondary patency rates of partial in situ bypasses were 80 % and 70 %, compared with 91 % and 83 % for in situ bypasses completed without a spliced segment (p < 0. 0001). The 1 - and 4 -year secondary patency rates were 78 % and 67 % in the spliced <b>excised</b> vein group and 85 % and 75 % in the single <b>excised</b> vein group (p = not significant). The 4 -year limb salvage rates were as follows: in situ (96 %), partial in situ (85 %), single <b>excised</b> vein (95 %), and spliced <b>excised</b> vein (90 %). Conclusions: We conclude that the use of <b>excised</b> vein segments to complete partial in situ bypasses may be associated with a decrement of bypass patency. Use of spliced <b>excised</b> vein segments of good quality for arterial bypass can produce acceptable patency rates. Such spliced autogenous conduits are clearly preferable to prosthetic bypasses for infrageniculate arterial reconstructions.
