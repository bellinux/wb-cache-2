2500|$|Mr Frederick, {{one of the}} {{neighbouring}} farmers, attacks the farm, using blasting powder {{to blow up the}} restored windmill. Though the animals win the battle, they do so at great cost, as many, including Boxer the workhorse, are wounded. Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon, explaining that better care can be given there. Benjamin, the cynical donkey who [...] "could read as well as any pig", notices that the van belongs to a <b>knacker</b> and attempts a futile rescue. Squealer quickly assures the animals that the van had been purchased from the <b>knacker</b> by an animal hospital, and the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. In a subsequent report, Squealer reports sadly to the animals that Boxer died peacefully at the animal hospital; the pigs hold a festival one day after Boxer's death to further praise the glories of Animal Farm and have the animals work harder by taking on Boxer's ways. However, the truth was that Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the <b>knacker,</b> allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves. (In 1940s England, one way for farms to make money was to sell large animals to a <b>knacker,</b> who would kill the animal and boil its remains into animal glue.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Boxer – A loyal, kind, dedicated, {{extremely}} strong, hard working, and respectable cart-horse, although quite {{naive and}} gullible. Boxer does {{a large share}} of the physical labour on the farm. He is shown to hold the belief that 'Napoleon is always right'. At one point, he had challenged Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, earning him an attack from Napoleon's dogs. But Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared to the Stakhanovite movement. He has been described as [...] "faithful and strong"; he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder. When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a local <b>knacker</b> to buy himself whisky, and Squealer gives a moving account falsifying Boxer's death.|$|E

Mr. Neigh was going to pull down the old huts here, and improve the place and build a mansion--in short, he went so far as to have the grounds planted, and the roads marked out, and the fish-pond made, and the place christened Farnfield Park; but he did no more. [...] "I shall never have a wife," [...] he said, [...] "so why should I want a house to put her in?" [...] He's a terrible hater of women, I hear, particularly the lower class.' ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was with}} a heavy heart that Caleb, {{defeated}} and shamed, shook the dust of the village of the Essenes off his feet. At dawn {{on the morning after}} the night that he had fought the duel with Marcus, he also might have been seen, a staff in his bandaged hand and a bag of provisions over his shoulder, standing upon the little ridge and gazing towards the house which sheltered Miriam. In love and war things had gone ill with him, so ill that at the thought of his discomfiture he ground his teeth. Miriam cared nothing for him; Marcus had defeated him at the first encounter and given him his life; while, worst of all, these two from whom he had endured so much loved each other. Few, perhaps, have suffered more sharply than he suffered in that hour; for what agonies are there like those of disappointed love and the shame of defeat when endured in youth? With time most men grow accustomed to disaster and rebuff. The colt that seems to break its heart at the cut of a whip, will hobble at last to the <b>knacker</b> unmoved by a shower of blows.|$|E

50|$|The <b>knacker</b> Heinrich Dittenburger (also Dillenburger) {{was sent}} in 1705 {{by the joint}} Sponheim {{government}} from Spall to Münchwald to preserve Sponheim’s rights in Münchwald. He was given {{the use of a}} cottage belonging to the Dalberg subjects that had stood empty owing to disagreements between the inhabitants of the Amt of Winterburg and the Münchwald villagers. He was to make as much land into cropland as the Dalberg subjects had cleared. Heinrich Dittenburger, however, died in 1707. His widow Susanna (d. 28 August 1759), married Lorenz Litter (d. 24 June 1758), likewise a <b>knacker,</b> in 1708. He, too, was “forced by the common lordship to remain on the Münchwald to oppose Dalberg intentions as much as possible”. Lorenz Litter had built himself a house by 1727 and had at last set up his estate. Seemingly, the <b>knacker</b> was even accepted over time by the Dalberg lordship, for on 15 March 1730, Franz Eckenbert, Steward of Worms and Baron of Dalberg, awarded him the right to practise the knacker’s trade in the Dalberg lordly domain “as long as he lives”, and also the Molkenborner Wiese (a meadow), although he had to pay for this right. The fee was 10 Rhenish guilders yearly, to be paid each year at Martinmas to the stewardship in Wallhausen. From the Sponheim side, too, Lorenz Litter received a letter of Erbbestand (a uniquely German landhold arrangement in which ownership rights and usage rights are separated; this is forbidden by law in modern Germany) dated 25 June 1737. On 8 October 1737, the <b>knacker</b> Johannes Roth from Wesel wed Anna Maria, Lorenz Litter’s daughter, and thus founded the Family Roth, who lived in Münchwald until the early 20th century. The Family Roth also earned great fame as Knochenheiler (“bone healers”).|$|E
