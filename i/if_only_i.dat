[...] Carr observes that Mahler could conceivably have lived to see [...] "his day"; his near-contemporary Richard Strauss survived until 1949, while Sibelius, just five years younger than Mahler, lived until 1957.|$|E

Several days before the event Hitler took Albert Speer aside when both {{were on their way}} to the former's Munich apartment with an entourage, and declared to him that [...] "We will create a great empire. All the Germanic peoples will be included in it. It will begin in Norway and extend to northern Italy. I myself must carry this out. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> keep my health!"

A widow after only six months of marriage, she suffered a miscarriage shortly after, reportedly due to [...] "psychological trauma". Holly's mother, on hearing the news on the radio at home in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. María Elena Holly {{did not attend the}} funeral and has never visited the gravesite. She later said in an interview: [...] "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour.

500|$|In 1921, {{after years}} of {{pleading}} for proper schooling, Nancy was allowed a year's boarding at Hatherop Castle, an informal private establishment for young ladies of good family. Laura Thompson, in her biography of Nancy, describes Hatherop as not so much [...] a school, [...] "more a chaste foretaste of debutante life". Here Nancy learned French and other subjects, played organised games and joined a Girl Guide troop. It was her first extended experience of life away from home, and she enjoyed it. The following year she was allowed to accompany four other girls on a cultural trip to Paris, Florence and Venice; her letters home are full of expressions of wonder at the sights and treasures: [...] "I had no idea I was so fond of pictures... <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> had a room of my own I {{would make it a}} regular picture gallery".|$|E
500|$|Pauline was grief-stricken {{and later}} said [...] "My poor little boy. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> {{had been with}} him...I would have nursed him as I nursed his father". She came to blame Borghese for his {{decision}} to send Dermide to Frascati and called him [...] "the butcher of my son", believing that, {{had it not been}} for her husband, her son [...] "would still be alive". Leclerc's parents accused Pauline of having neglected Dermide, leaving him to die under the care of servants, when she could have left him in France, to live with them. Nonetheless, Pauline had her son buried at the Château de Montgobert, next to General Leclerc. Dermide's inheritance reverted to his father's family and, in spite of her wishes to be buried beside her son and first husband at Montgobert, Pauline was buried at the Saint Mary Major Basilica in Rome upon her death in 1825.|$|E

500|$|A mutant, {{who is one}} of Xavier's earlier {{students}} and the leader of the X-Men in Cyclops' absence. Storm is a woman with the ability to manipulate the weather. [...] Berry had stated during interviews for X2 that she would not return unless the character had a significant presence comparable to the comic book version, leading to a larger role in The Last Stands script. Berry declared that her ethnicity made the actress identify with the cure plot: [...] "When I was a child, I felt that <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> could change myself, my life would be better. As I've gotten older, I've come to terms with what utter nonsense that is." [...] The character was given a more modern haircut, and costume designer Judianna Makovsky opted to give Storm more black clothes, a color she only wore in the leather costume for previous films, to make her [...] "tougher and sexier".|$|E

According to the actress, her father (Mohammed Kaif) is a British {{businessman}} of Kashmiri descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker. She has seven siblings: three elder sisters (Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha), three younger sisters (Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel) and an elder brother, Michael. Isabelle Kaif is also a model and actress. Kaif's parents divorced {{when she was a}} child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up, and they were raised by their mother. On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: [...] "When I see friends who have wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> had that. But instead of complaining, I should be grateful for all the other things I have". In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express, she said she was not in touch with her father.|$|E

She became withdrawn, writing that perhaps the other women considered her stupid, shy or both: [...] "Do they really look on me as such a dull thing, I wonder? But I am what I am.... too has often remarked that she thought I {{was not the kind}} of person with whom one could ever relax.... I am perversely stand-offish; <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> can avoid putting off those for whom I have genuine respect." [...] Keene speculates that as a writer who required solitude Murasaki's loneliness may have been [...] "the loneliness of the artist who craves companionship but also rejects it". He points out she had [...] "exceptional powers of discernment" [...] and probably alienated the other women, about 15 or 16 of whom she describes in her diary. Although she adds praise for each woman, her criticism is more memorable because she saw through and described their flaws.|$|E
