40|$|The pace of {{business}} dynamism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U. S. has declined over recent decades. <b>The</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> business dynamism is evident <b>in</b> a pronounced <b>declining</b> trend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pace of both gross job creation and gross job destruction. An {{important component of}} these declining trends has been <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> firm startup rate. <b>The</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> startup rate has yielded a significant <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> share of employment accounted for by young firms – this share has declined by almost 30 {{percent over the last}} 30 years. Young firms exhibit enormous volatility – many fail, but amongst those that survive are very fast growing firms that contribute substantially to job creation. We find that the changing firm age distribution accounts for a substantial fraction of <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overall pace {{of business}} dynamism, but we find that other compositional changes work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction. <b>The</b> well-known shift <b>in</b> economic activity away from manufacturing to service and retail industries is a shift toward sectors that historically exhibited a higher pace of business dynamism. Consideration of different patterns by sector are important not just for compositional reasons but because of large differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> within-sector trend <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> business dynamics across sectors. The retail and service sectors not only have exhibited <b>the</b> largest increases <b>in</b> employment shares but are also sectors with especially large <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pace of business dynamics. These two sectors have also experienced very large <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> share of activity accounted for by young firms – and as such, the shifting age composition accounts for a very large share of <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> dynamism <b>in</b> these sectors. It has apparently become less advantageous to be a young entrepreneurial firm in retail and services, and this has contributed significantly to <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pace of business dynamism in these sectors...|$|R
