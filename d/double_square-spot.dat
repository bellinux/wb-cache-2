50|$|The <b>double</b> <b>square-spot</b> (Xestia triangulum) is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. It is {{distributed}} through most of Europe except Portugal, the Mediterranean islands and northernmost Fennoscandia. In the East, the species ranges East across the Palearctic to Siberia and in the South-East to the Black Sea and in Iran. It rises to a height of about 2000 metres in the Alps.|$|E
50|$|The foliage is {{sometimes}} eaten by the larvae of Lepidoptera, including emperor moth, willow beauty, white-pinion spotted, common emerald, November moth, pale November moth, mottled pug, green pug, brimstone moth, feathered thorn, brown-tail, yellow-tail, short-cloaked moth, lesser yellow underwing, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, <b>double</b> <b>square-spot,</b> black and brown hairstreaks, hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella) and the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella. Dead blackthorn wood provides {{food for the}} caterpillars of the concealer moth Esperia oliviella.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} known as X. rhomboidea up to 1997. Since the taxonomic {{revision}} by Hacker in 1998, the name Xestia stigmatica is in use and was used by Fibiger & Skuhle in 2004 {{as well as on}} Fauna Europaea. The reason for the change is that Phalaena Noctua rhomboidea as described by Esper in 1790 is actually the <b>Double</b> <b>Square-spot</b> (X. triangulum), but Esper's name had been misapplied to the Square-spotted Clay.|$|E
