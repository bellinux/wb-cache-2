40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} nonresponse bias in a two-phase epidemiologic {{study of}} eating-disordered behavior. Method Self-report questionnaires <b>were</b> delivered <b>to</b> a community sample of women aged 18 - 45 {{drawn from the}} electoral roll. Follow-up <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> completed with a subgroup of respondents. Eating disorder psychopathology, general physical and mental health, and sociodemographic characteristics were compared among early (n = 259) and late (n = 71) respondents at {{the first phase of}} the study and among individuals with whom <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> completed (n = 208) and individuals <b>declining</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> (n = 63) at the second phase. Results With respect to levels of eating disorder psychopathology, and on all other measures, individuals who responded at {{the first phase of the}} study only after repeated reminders did not differ from those who responded to the initial mailout, and individuals who <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> did not differ from individuals with whom <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> completed. Conclusions Nonresponse bias among individuals <b>declining</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interviewed</b> <b>is</b> unlikely <b>to</b> pose a problem in two-phase epidemiologic studies of eating disorders. Further research <b>is</b> needed <b>to</b> examine the characteristics of nonrespondents at the first phase of such studies. ...|$|R
