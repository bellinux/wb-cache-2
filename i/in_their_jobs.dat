5|$|The {{majority}} form of opposition, however, was passive resistance. Small patriotic badges, {{depicting the}} royal family or national colours, were extremely popular. When these symbols were banned, new ones, such as ivy leaves, were worn with similar meaning. Workers in strategic industries deliberately underperformed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> {{as a form of}} resistance. The celebration of nationalist public holidays, like 21 July (National Day), which were officially banned by the Germans, were also often accompanied by protests and demonstrations. One of the most notable acts of passive resistance was the Judges' Strike of 1918, which managed to gain concessions from the German occupiers under considerable public pressure.|$|E

From February 1963, Banda received monthly reports from the police Special Branch, which he did not share with his cabinet colleagues. A number of these reports were critical of certain specific activities of Chipembere and Chiume.|$|E
25|$|Factors such {{as nature}} {{of work and}} lack of {{influence}} within their jobs leads some theorists {{to the conclusion that}} most Americans are working class. They have data that shows the majority of workers are not paid to share their ideas. These workers are closely supervised and do not enjoy independence <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> Also, they are not paid to think. For example: The median annual earnings of salaried dentists were $136,960 in May 2006, indicating a high degree of scarcity for qualified personnel. The opinions and thoughts of dentists, much like those of other professionals, are sought after by their organizations and clients. The dentist creates a diagnosis, consults the patient, and conceptualizes a treatment. In 2009, Dental assistants made roughly $14.40 an hour, about $32,000 annually. Unlike dentists, dental assistants do not have much influence over the treatment of patients. They carry out routine procedures and follow the dentists' instructions. Here we see that a dental assistant being classified as working class. Similar relationships can be observed in other occupations.|$|E

500|$|Hitler's {{accession}} to power {{led to the}} passage of a series of antisemitic laws banning Jews from the civil service. Although Hess was a Protestant Christian, the laws defined him as a [...] "full-blooded Jew" [...] as he had four Jewish grandparents. In April 1933, a [...] "Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service" [...] was passed banning many Jews from public service. Hess survived this first purge of Jews owing to the [...] "front-line fighters' privilege" [...] (Frontkämpferprivileg) he was able to invoke as a consequence of his war service. The Frontkämpferprivileg was instituted after Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg protested to Hitler that Jewish war veterans were being dismissed from state employment.

500|$|According to author John Tschohl, the tediousness of {{the phrase}} is {{exemplified}} by employees uttering the words so faintly as to be barely audible. The phrase is occasionally used in an ironic manner when others have been disrespectful or have negatively impacted the speaker. In Detroit, a supermarket started a program to have its cashiers tell every customer to [...] "have a nice day" [...] after completing their transactions. After conducting surveys, they realized {{that more than half}} of the customers were unaware of whether the clerk had said the phrase. In addition, a number of customers commented that they despised being told to [...] "have a nice day". In a 2006 study, researchers at Frankfurt University discovered that people who must smile and say [...] "have a nice day" [...] <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> are more prone to illness. Flight attendants, waiters, and call center operators, as well as others who are forced to act cheerfully, are more likely to become depressed. This can lead to decreased immune system function.|$|E
500|$|Morrissey {{returned}} to a weekly television role {{at the end of}} 2010 playing police detective Tom Thorne in Thorne, a six-part television series for Sky1 that was adapted from Mark Billingham's novels Sleepyhead and Scaredy Cat. After reading Lifeless during his time filming The Water Horse in New Zealand, Morrissey searched the Internet for more information. He found an interview in which Billingham stated his preference for Morrissey to play Thorne should a screen adaptation ever be made. When he {{returned to}} England, Morrissey arranged a meeting with Billingham and the two began developing the TV series. Morrissey shadowed officers in the Metropolitan Police's murder unit during their duties to learn about their jobs. He discovered that the officers felt undervalued <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs,</b> and he incorporated these feelings into the series. Sky first broadcast the series on 10 October. Morrissey received approval for the role; Andrea Mullaney wrote in The Scotsman, [...] "Morrissey is never less than watchable and he brings a brooding presence to the role of Thorne." [...] and Adam Sweeting for The Arts Desk called him [...] "authentic as the phlegmatic, low-key Thorne." ...|$|E
40|$|Using British {{longitudinal}} data, {{we investigate}} whether individuals enjoy a permanent boost <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction by becoming self-employed. We track individuals {{before and after}} transitions from work to self-employment and record changes <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> and domain satisfaction scores. We find that job satisfaction follows a rising trajectory immediately upon transition into self-employment and a declining trajectory in subsequent years, as expectations fail to materialize and the novelty of the new venture wanes down. Thus, our findings confirm that job satisfaction gains are not necessarily permanent, suggesting that self-employment {{is not always a}} panacea for job satisfaction...|$|R

500|$|The Hungarian {{authorities}} established {{concentration camps}} for Serbs {{from which they}} were eventually expelled to the German-occupied territory of Serbia. As part of the [...] "systematic magyarisation" [...] of these territories, Hungarian political parties and patriotic organisations were encouraged to be active in Bačka and Baranja, which resulted in discrimination against [...] "less-desirable elements" [...] of the population such as Serbs, Croats and Jews. Discrimination extended to education and communication, where Hungarian and German were the only languages permitted in almost all secondary schools, and books, newspapers and periodicals in the Serbo-Croat language were virtually banned. Well-educated Serbs and Croats were precluded from undertaking work commensurate with their education. Despite this, Serbs and Croats that {{had lived in the}} territories prior to 1918 retained their citizenship rights as Hungarians, and some lower-level non-Hungarian public employees were retained <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> One former Serb senator and one former Croat parliamentary deputy sat in the Hungarian Parliament. In Prekmurje, the Hungarian authorities were more permissive, making no attempt to deport Slovenes in large numbers, and allowing the Slovene language to be used in public. Likewise, the Hungarians curried favour with the Bunjevci minority in order to persuade them that they were neither Serbs nor Croats, nor even Slavs at all: they were [...] "Hungarians of Bunyevac mother-tongue".|$|E

[...] This will lead to low motivation and, consequently, poor performance. [...] High CSE individuals, on the other hand, will be highly motivated to complete challenging tasks because they believe {{they have the ability}} and control to complete the tasks successfully.
