This paper {{presents}} a review {{on the application}} of process sampling {{with respect to the}} geothermal power generation industry. Specifically, using an <b>isokinetic</b> <b>probe</b> to take a representative sample of geothermal steam for steam quality and steam purity analysis. During the geothermal energy production process, naturally occurring non-condensable gases (NCG) and geochemical species are present in the geothermal steam flow. NCG poses several problems with respect to power generation, process engineering, and energy economics. Naturally occurring chemical species, for example chloride ions, entrained in geothermal steam is a source of corrosion in turbines and power plants. NCG interferes with power generation as well. In order to correct for accurate steam enthalpy, the amount of NCG present in the sample must be analyzed and quantified in order to make accurate predictions about power generation and downstream corrosion.

40|$|An {{aim of this}} {{experimental}} research work was to achieve more detailed information about the combustion process in pulverized coal boilers. An O 2 analyser was developed and manufactured for the measurement of O 2 volumetric concentration directly in the combustion chamber. The volumetric concentration of O 2 in the combustion chamber is important information about the burn out ratio, quality of combustion and the space distribution of the flame. The uniformity of the flame or the even distribution of the combustion parameters could be a possible way how to move to satisfy new emission limits. Measured parameters of the combustion process {{could be used for}} the control system of the boiler. The O 2 analyser was manufactured for the permanent measurement with acceptable results. The measurement of the air excess ratio in the combustion chamber shows that for the left and right side of the combustion chamber could be highly non-uniform. For correct interpretation of the air excess ratio measured in the combustion chamber is necessary to know local amount of the unburnedcarbon in the position of the measurement. Therefore a new extraction line with an <b>isokinetic</b> <b>probe</b> was installed in the boiler for an extraction of the particles from the combustion chamber.

To highlight effects of interphase transport rates and particle/turbulence interactions, effects of the particles were analyzed as follows: (1) locally homogeneous flow (LHF) analysis, where interphase transport rates {{are assumed to be}} infinitely fast; (2) deterministic separated flow (DSF) analysis, where finite interphase transport rates are considered but particle/turbulence interactions are ignored; and (3) stochastic separated flow (SSF) analysis, where both effects are considered using random-walk computations...|$|R
40|$|A cold {{model of}} a {{circulating}} fluidized bed combustor having a 0. 120 m i. d. and 5. 75 m high riser, was operated by splitting the total gas flow rate in a primary air stream fed through the bottom distributor and a secondary air stream laterally injected at a fixed level along the riser. Two different feeding devices were used: in one case the injection of secondary air stream occurred over the whole circumference of the riser through a slot; in the other the injection occurred through four opposite ports. Solids used were 89 mu m Ballotini. Overall superficial gas velocity was fixed at 6 m/s. Solids mass flux was alternatively equal to 35 and 55 kg/(s m(2)). The ratio between secondary and primary air flow rates was kept at a value of 1. An <b>isokinetic</b> <b>probe</b> {{was used to measure}} radial profiles of upward and downward solids mass fluxes and those of tracer gas concentration. A stream of CO 2 was mixed with the secondary air stream before the injection and used as tracer gas. For each set of operating conditions, axial profile of voidage and radial profiles of solids mass flux and CO 2 concentration were measured along the riser. Results confirm that lateral air stream remarkably affects the hydrodynamics in the regions below and above the gas inlet. They also show that the mechanism of interaction between the secondary air stream and the gas-solids suspension rising from the primary zone completely changed when the injection device was changed, Solids and tracer gas distribution along the riser were noticeably different...|$|E
40|$|During August 2015, NASA's DC- 8 {{research}} {{aircraft was}} flown into High Ice Water Content (HIWC) events {{as part of}} a three-week campaign to collect airborne radar data and to obtain measurements from microphysical probes. Goals for this flight campaign included improved characterization of HIWC events, especially from an airborne radar perspective. This paper focuses on one of the flight days, in which a coastal mesoscale convective system (MCS) was investigated for HIWC conditions. The system appears to have been maintained by bands of convection flowing in from the Gulf of Mexico. These convective bands were capped by a large cloud canopy, which masks the underlying structure if viewed from an infrared sensing satellite. The DC- 8 was equipped with an <b>IsoKinetic</b> <b>Probe</b> that measured ice concentrations of up to 2. 3 g m(exp - 3) within the cloud canopy of this system. Sustained measurements of ice crystals with concentrations exceeding 1 g m(exp - 3) were encountered for up to ten minutes of flight time. Airborne Radar reflectivity factors were found to be weak within these regions of high ice water concentrations, suggesting that Radar detection of HIWC would be a challenging endeavor. This case is then investigated using a three-dimensional numerical cloud model. Profiles of ice water concentrations and radar reflectivity factor demonstrate similar magnitudes and scales between the flight measurements and model simulation. Also discussed are recent modifications to the numerical model's ice-microphysics that are based on measurements during the flight campaign. The numerical model and its updated ice-microphysics are further validated with a simulation of a well-known case of a supercell hailstorm measured during the Cooperative Convective Precipitation Experiment.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work {{relating to}} the reflood phase of a Large Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LB-LOCA) in Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR). Three related types of experiment have been carried in this context, namely studies of particle motion in an annulus geometry simulating drop motion in a ballooned fuel element, studies of single phase flow in a 3 × 3 tube bundle simulating a ballooned fuel element and studies of reflooding of a hot tube {{in which it was}} possible to photograph the region above the rewetting front using axial view photography. In the particle tracking studies, Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) was used to determine typical particle tracks in an annulus test section in which the inner surface was ballooned to simulate the clad ballooning likely to occur during the reflood phase of an LB-LOCA. Excellent agreement was obtained between the measured particle tracks and ones calculated using the STAR-CD CFD code. The second set of experiments focussed on investigating the effect of pin ballooning on the vapour flow. An idealised, simulated PWR bundle containing a 3 × 3 rod arrangement with a central ballooned pin was designed and constructed and, using a novel <b>isokinetic</b> <b>probe</b> sampling technique, the axial deviation in mass flow of an outer sub-channel was measured. Again, good agreement was obtained between the flows measured and those calculated from the STAR-CD code. To further elucidate the rewetting process itself and the behaviour of the associated two-phase flow, an axial-viewing reflood (AVR) rig has been designed and constructed. Within this facility, experiments have been carried out to examine the thermal-hydraulic effects occurring during bottom-up reflooding of a single hot tube. A high-speed high-temperature axial viewing technique has been developed and applied to observe the quench front, and any precursory droplet production, deposition and entrainment ahead of the propagating quench front.

The intended operational range includes standard day atmospheric conditions up to 40, 000 -ft.

Initial results indicate that the Mach number ratio of the aerosol sample and dilution streams in the mixing region is an important factor for successful operation. Flow rate through the probe tip was found to be highly sensitive to the static pressure at the probe exit. Particle losses through the system were estimated to be on the order of 50 % with minimal change in the overall particle size distribution apparent.

40|$|The present {{research}} {{is motivated by}} the need to understand droplet entrainment and dispersion phenomena in the postulated Direct Containment Heating (DCH) scenario in severe nuclear reactor accidents. It consists of three closely related subjects, instrumentation development, accident simulation experiments and analytical modeling. ^ A novel system for droplet size measurement is developed for the experimental investigation of entrained droplets in DCH. It consists of an <b>isokinetic</b> <b>probe,</b> a droplet collection mechanism, an image processing unit and a presently developed software. Some problems associated with the system are studied and a simple criterion for minimizing measurement distortion is obtained. The present system is suitable for measurements of both water and liquid metal droplets. ^ Simulated DCH experiments are conducted in a 1 / 10 scaled test facility, using water or woods metal to simulate molten core materials (corium) and air to simulate steam. The physical processes of liquid entrainment and dispersion are observed by flow visualization. Size distribution and mass flux of entrained droplets are measured by the present droplet size measurement system. A mechanistic model for liquid (corium) dispersion into the reactor containment is developed based on mechanisms observed from flow visualization. The model compares satisfactorily with experimental results from both Purdue separate effects test and counterpart integral effects tests. ^ Entrance and channel size effects on droplet size distribution are studied in view of the discrepancy between DCH data and previous data from others. A combined model for droplet deposition, covering both trajectory dependent deposition and deposition due to gas turbulent eddies, is developed to analyze the change of droplet size distribution along the flow channel. The analysis shows the existence of two different regions, the entrance and quasi-equilibrium regions. Mean droplet sizes in the two regions are significantly different and are strongly influenced by the channel size. The Kotaoka-Ishii correlation is extended to predict droplet size at the time of entrainment, and the extended correlation and the combined deposition model form a unified model for droplet size distribution in the entire annular flow region. The unified model compares well with both DCH and previous droplet size data, and it is also consistent with the Kotaoka-Ishii correlation in the quasi-equilibrium region. ...|$|E

The approach is to calculate from each 5  s mean PSD and flight-level reflectivity the variability of all possible solutions of m(D) relationships fulfilling the condition that the simulated radar reflectivity factor (T-matrix method) matches the measured radar reflectivity factor. For the reflectivity simulations, ice crystals were approximated as oblate spheroids, without using a priori assumptions on the mass–size relationship of ice crystals. The CWC calculations demonstrate that individual CWC values {{are in the range}} ± 32  % of the retrieved average CWC value over all CWC solutions for the chosen 5  s time intervals. In addition, during the airborne field campaign performed out of Darwin in 2014, as part of the international High Altitude Ice Crystals/High Ice Water Content (HAIC/HIWC) projects, CWCs were measured independently with the new IKP- 2 (<b>isokinetic</b> evaporator <b>probe)</b> instrument along with simultaneous particle imagery and radar reflectivity. Retrieved CWCs from the T-matrix radar reflectivity simulations are on average 16  % higher than the direct CWC IKP measurements. The differences between the CWC IKP and averaged retrieved CWCs are found to be primarily a function of the total number concentration of ice crystals. Consequently, a correction term is applied (as a function of total number concentration) that significantly improves the retrieved CWC. After correction, the retrieved CWCs have a median relative error with respect to measured values of only − 1  %. Uncertainties in the measurements of total concentration of hydrometeors are investigated in order to calculate their contribution to the relative error of calculated CWC with respect to measured CWC IKP. It is shown that an overestimation of the concentration by about + 50  % increases the relative errors of retrieved CWCs by only + 29  %, while possible shattering, which impacts only the concentration of small hydrometeors, increases the relative error by about + 4  %. Moreover, all cloud events with encountered graupel particles were studied and compared to events without observed graupel particles.

Experiments are important as basis for development of 1 D flow models used for design of multiphase transport systems. The experiments are either used as direct closure relation or for model validation. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of three-phase flow data on droplet entrainment. This thesis is focused on two main topics: establish relevant experimental data of the droplet flux profiles, pressure gradient and flow characteristics of three-phase stratified and annular flows and to develop instrumentation suitable for three phase flow measurements. Experiments in three phase flows at high gas densities were conducted to obtain the magnitude and distribution of the droplet field flux and the effect of the water as a second liquid phase. This was studied by sampling the droplets using an <b>isokinetic</b> sampling <b>probe.</b> An automated probe system was designed and implemented successfully to reach this goal. The probe system is capable to conduct simultaneous measurements of the local droplet flux and gas velocity. Oil and water distribution inside the liquid layer in stratified-annular horizontal flow was studied using a two-energy traversing gamma densitometer and visual observations, using high speed video recordings of the flow. The experiments were performed at the Medium scale loop at SINTEF Multiphase Flow Laboratory using a high density gas at medium pressure conditions, oil and water. Based on the experimental results, an assessment of the effect of droplet flux distribution over the pipe cross section on the entrainment fraction calculation is discussed. Additionally, the current state of predicting models for liquid droplet concentration profiles is reviewed and new empirical correlations for the droplet concentration at the interface and the concentration decay are proposed. The effect on the pressure gradient changes due to liquid film at the wall, caused by droplet wetting, was studied on a second experimental setup. The setup was built at the NTNU Multiphase Flow Laboratory and consists of a vertical pipe to promote film symmetry. Twophase flow experiments using water and air and a viscous oil and air at atmospheric pressure were carried out. The results were compared with predictions of commercial flow simulators.
