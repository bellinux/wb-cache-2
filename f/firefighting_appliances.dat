50|$|The {{sourcing}} {{of equipment}} for firefighters {{to undertake the}} EMR role was particularly challenging. Available ambulance and off-the-shelf first aid and oxygen resuscitation kits {{were found to be}} unsuitable for firefighter requirements, leading to the MFB EMS Department developing their own purpose-designed and built kits.

5000|$|Private airport fire {{services}} in the UK protect all categories of airports and aerodromes. They are usually referred to as Rescue and Firefighting Services. One of the biggest aviation fire services is operated by BAA. [...] Non-BAA airports operate their own fire services to comply with legislation which states that airports must be provided with RFFS. One such example is London City Airport; its website describes the principal objective of an airport fire and rescue service: [...] "as to save lives {{in the event of}} an aircraft accident or incident". The number and type of <b>firefighting</b> <b>appliances</b> based at an airport will be determined by the airport's category. Airports in the UK are categorised from 1 to 10. A category 10 airport caters for the biggest aircraft; the standards are determined by the Civil Aviation Authority.|$|E
50|$|The Chief Officer/First mate (often {{called the}} Chief mate in the United States) {{is the head}} of the deck {{department}} on a merchant vessel, second-in-command after the ship's Master. The Chief mate's primary responsibilities are the vessel's cargo operations, its stability, and supervising the deck crew. The mate is responsible for the safety and security of the ship, as well as the welfare of the crew on board. The chief mate typically stands the 4-8 navigation watch as OICNW (officer in-charge of the navigational watch), directing the bridge team. Some crews have additional Third mates, which allow the Chief mate to not stand navigational watch, and focus more on cargo and deck operations. Additional duties include maintenance of the ship's hull, cargo gears, accommodations, life saving appliances and <b>firefighting</b> <b>appliances.</b> The chief mate also trains the crew and cadets on various aspects like safety, firefighting, search and rescue, and various other contingencies. The chief officer assumes command of the whole ship in the absence or incapacitation of the master.|$|E
50|$|On 17 January, a fire ignited in bushland in the Donnelly Creek Rd. area, near Aberfeldy. As {{the fire}} {{spread to the}} east, 61 {{children}} and 15 adults were evacuated from the Licola Wilderness Village, while 10 residents and about 30 firefighters remained in Licola. Unusually for a fire in Australia, a significant spread occurred at night and by the following day the fire had covered 48000 ha, with spot fires starting to the south-east and impacting the communities of Coongulla, Glenmaggie, Heyfield, Newry and Seaton, causing destruction. On 18 January, it was announced {{the body of a}} man had been found in a burnt out vehicle in Seaton. The fire was the largest in the state since the Black Saturday fires of 2009 and required significant commitment from firefighting authorities to control; 760 firefighting personnel from the CFA and DSE in 180 <b>firefighting</b> <b>appliances</b> and 23 bulldozers, supported by 13 firefighting aircraft, attended to the blaze over its 43-day duration. The fire burned 87000 ha of forest, scrub and grassland—much within the Baw Baw National Park—and impacted upon the communities of Coongulla, Dawson, Glenmaggie, Heyfield, Licola, Newry and Seaton; 21 houses, 17 vehicles, a number of sheds and caravans were destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} first impacted {{with the}} underside of its rear fuselage and skidded about 800 m along runway 12L with its landing gear partly retracted as it rotated to the right about 120 degrees. As the aircraft skidded down the runway, the number 2 (starboard) engine detached and slid along the wing's leading edge toward the wingtip. <b>Firefighting</b> <b>appliances</b> were at the aircraft less than 90 seconds after it came to rest (which was 33 seconds after the initial impact) and started to fight fires at several locations as all 300 passengers and crew were safely evacuated. Video from inside the aircraft, taken on passengers' cellphone cameras, showed the passengers failing to evacuate, instead giving priority to carry-on luggage, resulting in an overly long evacuation and heavy criticism. [...] Nine minutes after the aircraft came to a stop, with only the aircraft captain and the senior flight attendant still on board (checking for any remaining passengers), {{there was a large}} explosion. The explosion, of the aircraft's center fuel tank, resulted in the death of a firefighter, a Ras al-Khaimah resident named Jasim Issa Mohammed Hasan. Twenty-four of the aircraft's occupants were injured [...] - [...] including the captain and the senior flight attendant, who evacuated after the explosion; the senior flight attendant was the only person among the passengers and crew seriously injured, suffering from smoke inhalation. In addition, eight firefighters and a policeman were injured, several of the firefighters suffering from heat stroke. The explosion resulted in the fire spreading to the aircraft's cabin; it took firefighters 16 hours to bring the fire under control. The airport was closed during and following the accident, which resulted in many diverted flights.|$|E
