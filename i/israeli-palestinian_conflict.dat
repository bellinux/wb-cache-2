5|$|For its {{coverage}} of the <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> <b>conflict,</b> some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil) have insisted that it is pro-Israel. The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> <b>conflict</b> that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.|$|E

5|$|According to {{journalist}} , Enderlin's {{coverage of}} the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> <b>conflict</b> was respected by other journalists but was regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Turkey's increasing {{involvement in}} the Israeli-Syrian and <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> <b>conflicts</b> as a third party in the last decade. The paper first discusses the underlying reasons and motivations behind the change in Turkish foreign policy. Inthissectionwe answer the following question: While the traditional Turkish policy in the Middle East was non- intervention, what factors contributed to this recent change? We discuss these as systemic factors and domestic factors. In the second section of the paper we summarize the theoretical literature on third party intervention and mediation especially focusing on strategies, modes, activities, and tactics used. This section lays the background for the following section which classifies the various Turkish third party strategies and activities in the Israeli-Syrian and <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> <b>conflicts</b> so far. In the final section {{we focus on the}} challenges to this new Turkish role from Turkish, Israeli, and Arab perspectives. We also discuss the crises between Israel and Turkey in the last year and how they constitute a barrier to Turkey acting in an effective third party role. © 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} between political influences of Islamic fundamentalist parties and the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The author selects four salient actors, based on five characteristics of contemporary Islamic fundamentalist groups: the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, the Palestinian Hamas, the Lebanese Hezbollah, and the Iranian conservatives. With evidences of intertwined supports among them, the author analyzes the cooperative bloc between a state and non-state groups. After Iranian conservatives came to power, Iran's political supports enhanced influences of Hezbollah and Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and then helped Hamas seize power finally. Their radical foreign policies intend to end Israeli occupation in the Palestinian territories. The theoretical model generates two predictions about strategies of the bloc. First, high political influence in each government is expected to worsen the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Second, due to Israel's strong military power, the expected strategy of the bloc is a symbolic war that more rhetoric and less Israeli casualties. Using cross-tabulation model, the author finds that the attack numbers are alone increased along with the high political influences, during the given period between 2000 and 2009. Their strong political power and secure cooperative bloc impede democratizing and promoting peace in the Middle East. Thesi...|$|R

5|$|The {{declaration}} {{had many}} long-lasting consequences. It greatly increased {{popular support for}} Zionism, {{and led to the}} creation of Mandatory Palestine, which later became Israel and the Palestinian territories. As a result it is considered to have caused the ongoing <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> <b>conflict,</b> often described as the world's most intractable conflict. Controversy remains over a number of areas, such as whether the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to the Sharif of Mecca in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence.|$|E
5|$|From 1977 until 1991, Said was an {{independent}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council (PNC). In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to the <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> <b>conflict</b> (1948), and voted {{for the establishment of}} the State of Palestine {{at a meeting of the}} PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991.|$|E
40|$|Focusing on {{the period}} {{between the first and}} second Intifada, the paper aims to analyse the {{relationship}} between politics and religion within the Israeli-Palestinian context, focusing on the participation and engagement of Christian communities, their ecclesiastical institutions and leaderships within the “Holy Land”, with particular concentration on the role of Michel Sabbah, and in relation to the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Along with other Palestinian Christian theologians, Michel Sabbah concentrated on developing new meanings and understandings of the message of the Bible, contextualizing its significance within contemporary local political fields and therefore promoting a new role for the local Christians and a new political consciousness. This inevitably introduced a new understanding of the notion of Palestinian nation and the struggle for Palestinian independence. This is testimony to the possibility of reappraising the relationship between religion, politics and territory from the minority perspective and to overcome this boundary, that deserves to be assessed and researched...|$|R
40|$|After {{the cold}} war, {{environmental}} conflicts {{have become a}} predominant issue for analysis {{as a function of}} state security, negotiation, conflict resolution and preventive diplomacy. Conflicts over water are {{perhaps one of the most}} dominant issues in the environment-security dialectic. Specifically, water conflicts in the Middle East are of very serious concern given the aridity of the region, population growth, its relative low development, and the historical protracted conflict that has plagued the region. While the paper discusses issues relevant for global water conflicts, it focuses on the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> water <b>conflict</b> (given its centrality to the regional conflict). It considers the historical claims, international legal claims and negotiating positions of the parties. It also makes references to the water negotiations that took place during the 2000 Camp David talks. The paper then shows how environmental preventive diplomacy may be applied to the water conflict in the Middle East by referring to several related guidelines including theories of international relations, conflict resolution and international law and demonstrates their relevance to preventive diplomacy and the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> water <b>conflict.</b> preventive diplomacy; <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> water conflict; security; international relations theory; conflict resolution theory; international water law; up-stream and down-stream positions; joint management institutions. ...|$|R
40|$|This volume {{analyzes}} {{the conduct of}} the Israel Defence Forces' (IDF) counter-insurgency operations during the two major Palestinian uprisings (1987 - 1993 and 2000 - 2005) in the Territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It employs primary and secondary resources to produce a comprehensive analysis on whether or not the IDF has been able to adapt its conventional conduct of warfare to the realities of the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> low-intensity <b>conflict</b> and achieve any sort of victory over the Palestinian insurgents. Sergio Catignani provides new insights into how conventional armies struggle with contemporary insurgency by looking in particular at the strategic, operational, tactical and ethical dilemmas of the IDF over the last two decades. By examining {{the way in which the}} IDF and the Israeli security doctrine were formed and developed over time, he explores the extent to which Israeli security assumptions, civil-military relations, the organizational culture, command and control structure, and conduct of the IDF have affected its adaptation to the contemporary <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> low-intensity <b>conflict.</b> Israeli Counter-Insurgency and the Intifadas will be of much interest to students of low-intensity conflict and counter-insurgency, the Israeli army, the Middle Eastern conflict and strategic studies in general...|$|R

5|$|The play is {{sometimes}} given a historical setting, enabling audiences {{to reflect on}} the underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations have been set {{in the midst of the}} <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> <b>conflict,</b> in the apartheid era in South Africa, and in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt. Similarly, Peter Ustinov's 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, is set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War. A mock-Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio, and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris's love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Shakespeare's R, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening. A recent comedic musical adaptation was The Second City's The Second City's Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet, set in modern times.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> <b>conflict.</b> In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E
40|$|The {{links between}} {{environmental}} degradation, renewable resource scarcity, and conflict are still poorly understood. One {{reason for this}} is the positivist–rationalist bias which is characteristic of the mainstream literature on socio-environment conflicts but has largely remained unaddressed so far. Many studies are therefore unable to utilize insights from environmental sociology, constructivist conflict research, and political ecology. Drawing on this literature and discourse theory, the article develops a constructivist understanding of socio-environmental conflicts. The proposed framework highlights the relevance of discursively constructed identities, situation assessments, and interests for understanding the dynamics of such conflicts. The plausibility of the framework across different contexts is demonstrated by a discussion of the <b>Israeli–Palestinian</b> water <b>conflict</b> and forest conflicts in northern Thailand...|$|R
50|$|The {{theoretical}} {{debates that}} led to the splits in Matzpen {{had to do with the}} conceptualization of the relations between class struggle and nationalism in the struggle for socialism. Avangard regarded Israel as a normal capitalist society in which the working class was the primary revolutionary agent. Hence, it saw its goal as the mobilization of that class to create an Israeli socialist republic. It regarded Matzpen's focus on the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> national <b>conflict</b> and on the colonial origins of Israeli society as a distraction from the class struggle. Ma'avak, in contrast, saw Matzpen as not emphasizing enough the colonial character of Israeli society. It saw its goal as that of facilitating the Palestinian national liberation struggle as a necessary step towards socialism. In response to both groups, Matzpen re-asserted its combination of support for national and social struggles.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the significance of}} a micro-level approach to the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> water <b>conflict.</b> By rethinking scale of analysis and examining local insecurities, Palestinian experiences reveal how water conflict plays out in latent and discursive ways. In a step-by-step method, I detail the processes and outcomes of the water struggle in the West Bank. First, I show how technical challenges ((i) poor water supply, (ii) antiquated water infrastructure, (iii) failed institutions) are shaped by political imperatives. Second, I show how Palestinians have responded to local water sector challenges: (iv) nonpayment to the Palestinian Water Authority for their water supply, (v) increasing rural to urban migration by Palestinian farmers. As a result, Palestinian society is stuck in cycles of crisis that make the conditions increasingly ungovernable. While Palestinians are stuck in a mode of ungovernability, {{their position in the}} peace process with Israel is undermined...|$|R

50|$|The Palestinian {{insurgency}} in South Lebanon was a conflict initiated by Palestinian militants based in South Lebanon upon Israel since 1968, which {{evolved into the}} wider Lebanese Civil War in 1975 and lasted until the expulsion of the Palestinian Liberation Organization from Lebanon in the 1982 Lebanon War. Though the PFLP and some other Palestinian factions continued a low-level military activities against Israel from Lebanese soil, after 1982, the conflict is considered to have shifted from <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> to Israel-Hezbollah <b>conflict.</b> The South Lebanon insurgency, which peaked through the 1970s, claimed hundreds of Israeli and Palestinian military and civilian lives, and is considered among the key elements to starting the Lebanese Civil War.|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{presentation}} of family photographs in reports on terror attacks in the leading Israeli dailies since the first intifada of 1987. How should the Israeli media cover terror attacks carried out against the Israeli population and within the environment of its daily life? What kind of images should it circulate? How explicit should these be? Such questions have concerned a variety of professional members of the Israeli society since the mid 1990 s. Having realised that a too explicit coverage of attacks might damage {{the morale of the}} Israelis, Israeli dailies virtually agreed in 1997 to refrain from publishing explicit photographs of corpses, expressions of panic, hysteria, grief and anxiety. Instead, the Israeli media turned to what eventually became the only valid, indisputable means to represent the dead victims: their family photographs. These pictures, however, refer to a different space, time, and occasion; they draw attention to more pleasurable moments and biographical highlights, whereas the nature of the reported event and the report itself inevitably focuses on violence and death. The aim {{of this article is to}} trace the sociological implications involved in the participation of such images in the narrative of the ongoing <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> political <b>conflict...</b>|$|R

40|$|Philosophizing {{is at risk}} in {{the face}} of dogmatism, either {{political}} or religious. In political and/or religious circumstances where freedom of expression is curtailed, the risk of critical and discursive philosophizing (pursued both analytically and synthetically) is extremely far above the ground. As a case in point, getting into a balanced critical and appreciative philosophical deliberation (reflection and discourse) on the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> political <b>conflicts</b> and controversies right inside Israel with politically fired-up Israelis both intellectual and non-intellectual alike is a risky engagement. What is specifically tolerable in such a particular context is ¨imbalanced philosophizing¨ (which is an oxymoron) wherein one is only allowed to DISCURSIVELY APPRECIATE the merits of just one side of the political divide over the other and never to be critical of the downsides discovered on the same side. Of course, the other philosophical operation of REFLECTIVE CRITICISM doesn´t get apparent, much less obvious, in such condition as it is forbidden to see the light of day. The risk lies in an open defiance of the restriction and could even be {{a matter of life and}} death. Similar to this was the situation in the erstwhile Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites during the so-called Cold War era. Discursive criticism even within the strict purview of philosophical analysis and synthesis of certain political principles and theories operative within the system was a proscribed exercise whose violation could put involved individuals in a gulag, a mental asylum or at worst before a firing squad...|$|R
40|$|Guy Delisle’s Jerusalem: Chronicles {{from the}} Holy City (2011) is a nonfictional graphic novel which narrates the {{experiences}} during {{a year that}} the Canadian artist and his family spent living far from home, in the occasionally dangerous and perilous city of the ancient Middle East. Part humorous memoir filled with “the logistics of everyday life,” part an inquisitive and sharp-eyed travelogue, Jerusalem is interspersed with enthralling lessons {{on the history of}} the region, together with vignettes of brief strips of Delisle’s encounters with expatriates and locals, with Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities in and around the city, with Bedouins, Israeli and Palestinians. Since the comic strip is considered amongst the privileged genres able to disseminate stereotypes, Jerusalem tackles cultural as well as physical barriers, delimiting between domestic and foreign space, while revealing the historical context of the <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> present <b>conflict.</b> Using this idea as a point of departure, I employ an imagological method of interpretation to address cross-cultural confusions in analysing the cartoonist’s travelogue as discourse of representation and ways of understanding cultural transmission, paying attention to the genre’s convention, where Delisle’s drawing style fits nicely the narrative techniques employed. Through an imagological perspective, I will also pay attention to the interaction between cultures and the dynamics between the images which characterise the Other (the nationalities represented or the spected) and those which characterise - not without a sense of irony - his own identity (self-portraits or auto-images). I shall take into account throughout my analysis that the source of this graphic memoir is inevitably a subjective one: even though Delisle professes an unbiased mind-set from the very beginning, the comic is at times coloured by his secular views. Delisle’s book is a dark, yet gentle comedy, and his wife’s job at the Doctors Without Borders paired with his personal experiences are paradoxically a gentle reminder that “There’ll always be borders. ” In sum, the comic medium brings a sense of novelty to the imagological and hermeneutic conception of the interpretation of cultural and national stereotypes and/or otherness in artistic and literary works...|$|R

In particular, the land currently called 2 ̆ 2 Israel 2 ̆ 2 has been through the hands of many dynasties and has long been the center of religious development and identity. Despite turmoil and failed attempts at achieving peace, there is no excuse for complacency in resolving this intolerable <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> divide.

This article explores various fundamentals of negotiation and settlement with the hopes of spurring ideas, and furthering an interest in how this great conflict might finally be resolved. Recognizing most topics and single events mentioned {{in the history of the}} Middle East conflict have been the sole focus of entire books, or even volumes of books, their depth of treatment in this article is intentionally shallow. The first objective is to obtain a good sense of where we are today regarding the Middle East and the position of the parties without regard to the equities involved.

After surveying this background, the principles of negotiation will be explored as well as suggestions on how the parties might pave the road to peace...|$|R
