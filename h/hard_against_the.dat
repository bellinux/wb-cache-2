5|$|On June 6, 1944, and afterward, {{most of the}} American {{airborne}} landings in Normandy {{were flown}} into areas that were not studded with Rommelspargel. Some flights, however, came up <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> defense. Accompanying the 82nd Airborne Division, Tito Moruza landed on D-Day with orders to don civilian clothing and make his way to Paris to seize Gestapo papers. His glider hit a wooden pole defense which tore into the three soldiers sitting next to him, mortally wounding them. More casualties were inflicted during delivery of glider infantry reinforcements when some 16–18 gliders landed {{in a field of}} Rommelspargel and the troops that crawled from the wrecked gliders were immediately targeted by German small arms fire. Of 250 troops landing, some 50–60 survived.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the war, Fort Bayard came under attack only once. During the Battle of Fort Stevens in July 1864, Confederate general Jubal Early {{launched}} a 25,000-man raid into Maryland with the hope of drawing off some of General Ulysses S. Grant's troops, who were pressing <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Army of Northern Virginia in the Siege of Petersburg. The raid hoped to attack Washington, thereby distracting Grant and potentially allowing the Confederate forces time to rest and regroup. On the morning of July 11, Confederate cavalry and infantry under the command of Brigadier General John McCausland advanced towards Washington with the goal of capturing Fort Reno, which defended the village of Tenleytown. Though they drove back the skirmish line in front of Fort Bayard, the Confederate cavalry were met with a heavy barrage of cannon fire from Bayard and its supporting forts. Discouraged by the resistance, McCausland's brigade moved to join up with the rest of Early's force, which was grouping for an assault on Fort Stevens.|$|E
5|$|The French {{fell back}} c. 3km and {{attempted}} to regroup to hold the village of San Giuliano. With the French outnumbered and driven from their best defensive position, the battle {{was as good as}} won by the Austrians. Melas, who was slightly wounded, and 71, handed over command to his chief-of-staff, General Anton von Zach, and Kaim. The Austrian centre formed into a massive pursuit column in order to chase the French off the battlefield, with the advance guard commanded by GM Franz Xaver Saint-Julien. The column formed up around Spinetta, southeast of Marengo, and advanced down the New Road. However, delays in the flanks led to the Austrian army forming a crescent shape with a thinly stretched central sector. On the Austrian right wing, O'Reilly wasted time hunting down a 300-man French detachment led by Achille Dampierre (which was finally captured) and moved southeast. This took his troops out of supporting distance from the Austrian main body. On the Austrian left, Ott hesitated to press <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> French because GdB Jean Rivaud's small brigade of French cavalry hovered to the north.|$|E

Some other emerging market currencies fell, including the Brazilian real, which lost 0.8 percent, and the Indonesian rupiah, which dropped 0.6 percent.|$|R

25|$|The plan {{involved}} {{using the}} series of fortifications built after 1790 as staging grounds for the Russian advances into Finland. In southern Finland, armies were to isolate the fortifications and first {{take control of the}} whole of southern Finland before advancing further to the north. Forces in Savolax were to press <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Swedes and reach the Gulf of Bothnia towards Uleåborg and Vasa to cut off the retreat of {{the main body of the}} Swedish army.|$|E

This was a publicly funded healthcare system, which offered treatment free of charge for all {{at the point of}} use. Reflecting pent-up demand that had long existed for medical services, the NHS treated some 8½million dental patients and dispensed more than 5million pairs of spectacles during its first year of operation.|$|E

25|$|On 31 July 1817 Morillo {{launched}} the assault, which began at eight thirty in the morning. The struggle was fierce, with the Spanish pressing <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> defensive front. In his later {{report on the}} battle, Morillo paid tribute to the stubborn courage of the republicans, who repelled repeated cavalry charges. During {{the course of the}} fighting, many unarmed men and women from the town joined the defenders, taking up the arms of those who had been killed or wounded. General Esteban Gómez himself was hit by bullets several times, and his horse was killed under him.|$|E
25|$|The {{murder of}} Severus Alexander by his {{soldiers}} {{and its aftermath}} which resulted in disturbances in Rome, motivated Ardashir to attack Rome again. In about the years 237-238, Ardashir took Nusaybin and Harran and attacked the city Dura; then he marched toward Hatra, which was a commercial city {{and the center of}} the traffic of commercial caravans. Hatra stood <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Persian siege and did not fall until April or September 240; it seems that Hatra was chosen as a point for pushing and operation against Roman Mesopotamia. The fall of Hatra might have been the cause of Gordian III's wars with Persia.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the statute}} was badly worded: to {{circumnavigate}} the laws, the salesmen simply fixed posts into the ground, creating market stalls similar in design to their modern counterparts. The stalls were covered for use and left uncovered in situ {{when not in}} use, thus both abiding by the law and designating a permanent venue for their sales. The people using these facilities fought <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> power of the richer businessmen and successfully defended {{the right of the}} marketeers to operate alongside them. The location of the Market Place remains virtually unchanged to this day and still houses a bustling market on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.|$|E

25|$|On France's {{northeast}} frontier in March 1794 the Army of the North fielded 126,035 {{troops or}} 194,930 {{if all the}} garrisons were added. The subordinate Army of the Ardennes numbered only 6,757 soldiers ready for action but 32,773 men when all its garrisons were counted. The combined total was 227,703 men, far too large a number for any one general to manage at that time. Against these, the Coalition fielded 150,000 troops to defend the Austrian Netherlands and the Dutch Republic and 20,000 more to hold Luxembourg. The Coalition plan was to press <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> French defenses and perhaps open the way to Paris.|$|E
25|$|Peace with England and France {{implied that}} Spain could focus her {{energies}} on restoring her rule to the Dutch provinces. The Dutch, led by Maurice of Nassau, {{the son of}} William the Silent had succeeded in taking a number of border cities since 1590, including the fortress of Breda. Following the peace with England, the new Spanish commander Ambrosio Spinola pressed <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Dutch. Spinola, a general of abilities to match Maurice, was prevented from conquering the Netherlands only by Spain's renewed bankruptcy in 1607. Fortunately, Spanish forces had regained enough of the military initiative to convince a politically divided United Provinces to sign a truce in 1609.|$|E
25|$|During mating, males {{make use}} of their spurs to arouse the female. They aggressively press their cloacal regions <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> female body, while {{continuously}} scratching her with their spurs. This can produce a scratching sound. Mating approaches its climax when the stimulus of the males' spurs induces the female snake to raise her cloacal region, allowing the cloacae of the two snakes to move together. The male then coils his tail, surrounding the female and they copulate. The strongest and largest male is often the victor. However, females are physically much larger and stronger and may decide to choose from among the males. Courtship and mating occur almost exclusively in water.|$|E

50|$|The {{pinpoint}} serve provides better velocity, {{since the}} feet {{come together as}} a single unit, allowing them to push <b>harder</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ground and gain more leg power. However, {{the center of gravity}} moves more than in the platform stance, so the player must have good body control in order to contact the ball consistently. Players will sacrifice some power with the platform serve, but their balance will be better so they should be more consistent. It's still possible to produce good power with the platform serve—some big servers, such as Milos Raonic and Roger Federer, use a variation of a platform stance.|$|R

25|$|In that 1991 season, {{despite a}} losing {{record in the}} regular season, the North Stars {{embarked}} on a Cinderella run to the Stanley Cup Finals. They knocked off the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues (the top two teams in the NHL during the regular season) in six games each and the defending Stanley Cup Champion Edmonton Oilers in five games, {{making it to the}} finals {{for the second time in}} franchise history. The team fought <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> eventual champion Pittsburgh Penguins, led by Mario Lemieux. They won two out of the first three contests before being obliterated 8-0 in Game 6 of the best-of-seven series. It was the most one-sided defeat in a deciding game of the Stanley Cup Finals since the original Ottawa Senators defeated the Dawson City Nuggets 23-2 in 1905.|$|E
25|$|As Secretary of State for Employment, she {{was also}} {{appointed}} First Secretary of State by Wilson, bringing her firmly {{into the heart of}} government. She was never far from controversy which reached a fever pitch when the trade unions rebelled against her proposals to reduce their powers in her 1969 white paper, 'In Place of Strife'. This also involved a major cabinet split, with threatened resignations, hot tempers and her future nemesis James Callaghan breaking ranks to publicly try to undermine the bill. The whole episode alienated her from many of her friends on the left, with the Tribune newspaper railing very <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bill, which they held to be attacking the workers without attacking the bosses. The split is often said to be partly responsible for Labour's defeat at the 1970 general election. The eventual deal with the unions dropped most of the contentious clauses.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{assigned}} to a makeshift infantry unit to carry out garrison duties, in early May the regiment was re-equipped with captured Italian and French pieces including 75mm and 100mm guns, the regiment was assigned a coastal defence role and moved to Georgiopolis, on the south-east coast of Suda Bay, where the men set to work digging-in in the hills overlooking the beach. When the fighting broke out following the arrival of German parachute troops on 20 May, the regiment was transported to Maleme airfield. Another battery was detached to Retimo and in these places the regiment fought with its guns {{in support of the}} 19th Infantry Brigade, while around Meg Khorafia some of the regiment's personnel were thrown into the line as infantry. Around Galatas, as the Germans pressed <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Australian and New Zealand defences, the regiment found itself holding the line as the infantry fell back, and as the guns fired over open sights, the gunners defended themselves with small arms.|$|E

25|$|For the Turks, {{it was the}} {{beginning}} of a new era of power. Despite further invasions and attacks by Crusaders from the west and the Mongols and Turkic tribes from the east, the Turks slowly emerged as a superpower under the Ottomans. The rise of the Ottomans was parallel to the fall of the Sultanate of Rum and the carving up of the Byzantine Empire. The power vacuum left in Anatolia was easily exploited by one of the Sultanate's nobles, Osman I. Matters were made worse for the Byzantine Empire due to the Latin presence in the Peloponnese and the rising power of the Bulgarians who continued to press <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> borders of Byzantium. In time, the Byzantines would be forced to call on the aid of the Ottomans to head to the European mainland and fight the Bulgarians, giving the Ottoman Turks a firm grip on Europe. The close proximity of Osman's Beylik ensured that confrontation between the Byzantines and the Ottomans would be inevitable. The Byzantines were a match for the Ottomans but events west of Constantinople coupled with civil war and incompetent leadership left the Byzantines reeling from one siege after another until Constantinople fell in 1453.|$|E
25|$|During World War I the Assyrian Genocide {{took place}} within the Ottoman Empire, which {{decimated}} the Nochiyaye, {{along with all the}} other Assyrian Tribes of the Hakkari mountains. In 1915 The Assyrians of the Hakkari mountains, under the rule of Patriarch Shimun XXI Benyamin, joined the Allied side of the war due to being promised independence and aid by the British, because the Turks were at the time massacring other ethnic Assyrians(particularly Chaldean and Syriac Catholics) in Bitlis and Diyarbakir, and because the Turks executed his brother who was studying in Istanbul in April of that year. Therefore, The Patriarch declared war against the Ottoman Empire and rallied his people alongside the British, Russians, and Armenians, in what was known as the Caucasus Campaign. The Assyrians of the Hakkari Mountains fought <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Turks for three years, but were eventually forced to flee the region, as their allies abandoned them, with the Russians leaving due to the Russian Revolution, and the Armenians being too overwhelmed to give aid, while The British decided not to give them any aid, and in doing so betrayed them. Therefore, The Assyrians had to leave because they were surrounded by hostile Muslim Turks and Kurds and had no means to continuously fight against them as they were too severely outmanned and outgunned without Allied support. So in 1918, all the Assyrians of the Hakkari mountains fled to Iran to catch British train lines which would take them to Iraq, and they never returned again.|$|E
25|$|He {{ordered his}} troopers to {{dismount}} and deploy in a skirmish line, according to standard army doctrine. In this formation, every fourth trooper held the horses for the troopers in firing position, with {{five to ten}} yards separating each trooper, officers to their rear and troopers with horses behind the officers. This formation reduced Reno's firepower by 25 percent. As Reno's men fired into the village and killed, by some accounts, several wives and children of the Sioux leader, Chief Gall (in Lakota, Phizí), mounted warriors began streaming out to meet the attack. With Reno's men anchored on their right by the impassable tree line and bend in the river, the Indians rode <b>hard</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> exposed left end of Reno's line. After about 20 minutes of long-distance firing, Reno had taken only one casualty, but the odds against him had risen (Reno estimated five to one) and Custer had not reinforced him. Trooper Billy Jackson reported that by then, the Indians had begun massing in the open area shielded by a small hill {{to the left of}} Reno's line and {{to the right of the}} Indian village. From this position the Indians mounted an attack of more than 500 warriors against the left and rear of Reno's line, turning Reno's exposed left flank. They forced a hasty withdrawal into the timber along the bend in the river. Here the Indians pinned Reno and his men down and set fire to the brush to try to drive the soldiers out of their position.|$|E

However, Han Tuozhou disregarded Xin's sincere advice for effective military moves, and he removed Xin from his team the next year, accusing Xin of being lubricious, avaricious, and many other non-existent faults. The crucial moment came in 1207 when the Jin defiantly asked for Han Tuozhou's head for a peace treaty. It was then that Han realized that he needed Xin again. Xin did not hesitate in responding to Han's call for help; unfortunately, he died of old age soon afterwards.|$|R
