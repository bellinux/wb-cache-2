60|$|This, I say, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} to note <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> what they <b>knew</b> at half-past seven. Of course as each hour went past they learned more and more.

This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under visible light.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Maya merchants, {{although}} they are depicted on Maya ceramics in elaborate noble dress. From this, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> at least some traders {{were members of the}} elite. During the Contact period, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Maya nobility took part in long distance trading expeditions. The majority of traders were middle class, but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than the prestigious long distance trading that was the preserve of the elite. The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the underworld; the patron deities of merchants were two underworld gods carrying backpacks. When merchants travelled, they painted themselves black, like their patron gods, and went heavily armed.|$|E

5|$|A {{particularly}} rare feature {{found on}} Motul de San José ceramics {{is the so-called}} X-ray style, showing a figure wearing a mask but also portraying his face underneath it. All the other representations using this rare style are depicted on Late Classic sculptures at sites with which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Motul de San José had contact at this time, including Dos Pilas, Machaquila, Tikal and Yaxchilan.

5|$|According to Sharon, {{there is}} no mention of Deir Ghassaneh or Beit Rima in early Arabic sources, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Deir Ghassaneh was inhabited during the Mamluk period due to the many houses there that have preserved elements of Mamluk architecture. Specific examples include the use of the ablaq technique of alternating stones of different colors, particularly red and white, that decorate the facades and gates of some houses.|$|E
5|$|As Petty gets {{further into}} his investigation, Rost's answers become more evasive. Petty {{suspects}} that Eric actually kills women for his snuff films, a suspicion further exacerbated when Rost {{says that he}} will relay Petty's contact information to the women instead of giving their contact information to Petty. It is not clear at the film's end whether Rost's films are actual snuff in the fictional subplot's context.

Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis, Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E
