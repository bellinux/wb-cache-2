We assume that our only observation of the diffusion process is a set of time series, one for each node of the network, which exhibit changepoints when an infection occurs. After formulating a model to describe the contagion, and selecting appropriate prior distributions, we seek to find the set of model parameters that best explains our observations.

40|$|Modelling Fluctuating Populations, {{originally}} published in 1982, is a classic textbook because primarily, this book takes a distinctive approach to population dynamics, by emphasizing from the earliest chapters that all populations fluctuate continuously. Traditional themes in theoretical ecology such as equilibrium and population stability are linked to analyses of the response of a population to environmental fluctuations and to extinction probabilities. Thus, the book's approach confronts head-on one common criticism of simple ecological models - the mismatch between the mathematical mechanisms studied and the questions of top ecological concern. Secondly, the book demonstrates the power of techniques based on linear mathematics. It has become fashionable to emphasize the <b>importance</b> of nonlinearity <b>in</b> ecological models, {{and there are some}} situations, notably those involving competition in fluctuating environments, where fundamentally nonlinear phenomena are critical to ecological understanding. But the <b>importance</b> <b>in</b> the <b>real</b> <b>world</b> of other nonlinear phenomena that attract much excitement among theorists, such as deterministic chaos, is much more doubtful. Many properties of fluctuations in nonlinear systems are well described by mathematical approaches that use linear equations to describe dynamics in the vicinity of an equilibrium state. The book gives a thorough introduction to these approaches, with particular focus on methods that exploit Fourier analysis. Thirdly, chapters 6 and 7 of the book take an unconventional approach to the formulation and analysis of stochastic population models. The starting point is a rigorous treatment of "demographic stochasticity", the randomness that occurs because population change is caused by a sequence of individual births and deaths. We introduce the concept of "white noise" in a manner appropriate for ecologists, develop powerful approximate methods for predicting the intensity of fluctuating populations, and offer a systematic approach to modeling the probability of extinction. " "However, Modelling Fluctuating Populations is exceptional in more than one way and provided me with an unexpected pleasure; I enjoyed almost all of the book and found every chapter valuable.

40|$|The {{probabilistic}} traveling salesman problem {{concerns the}} best way to visit a set of customers located in some metric space, where each customer requires a visit only with some known probability. A solution to this problem is an a priori tour which visits all customers, and the objective is to minimize the expected length of the a priori tour over all customer subsets, assuming that customers in any given subset must be visited in the same order as they appear in the a priori tour. This problem belongs to the class of stochastic vehicle routing problems, a class which has received increasing attention in recent years, and which is of major <b>importance</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> applications. Several heuristics have been proposed and tested for the probabilistic traveling salesman problem, many of which are a straightforward adaptation of heuristics for the classical traveling salesman problem. In particular, two local search algorithms (2 -p-opt and 1 -shift) were introduced by Bertsimas. In a previous report we have shown that the expressions for the cost evaluation of 2 -p-opt and 1 -shift moves, as proposed by Bertsimas, are not correct. In this paper we derive the correct versions of these expressions, and we show that the local search algorithms based on these expressions perform significantly better than those exploiting the incorrect expressions. © 2003 Elsevier B.

A technical ambient assistive living solution, consisting of a set of sensors and devices controlled by a software platform, was deployed in the collaborating nursing home. The trial was preceded by a pre-deployment period to organise several observation sessions with dementia patients and focus group discussions with professional caregivers. A process of ground truth and system's log data gathering was also planned prior to the trial and a system performance evaluation was realised during the deployment period with the help of caregivers. An ethical approval was obtained prior to real life deployment of our solution. [Results] Patients' observations and discussions allowed us to gather a set of requirements that a system for elders with mild-dementia should fulfil. In fact, our deployment has exposed more concrete require- ments and problems that need to be addressed, and which cannot be identified in laboratory testing. Issues that were neither forecasted during the design phase nor during the laboratory testing surfaced during deployment, thus affecting the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Results of the sys- tem performance evaluation show the evolution of system precision and uptime over the deployment phases, while data analysis demonstrates the ability to provide early detection of the degradation of patients' conditions. A qualitative feedback was collected from caregivers and doctors and a set of lessons learned emerged from this deployment experience. [Conclusion] Lessons learned from this study were very useful for our research work and can serve as inspira- tion for developers and providers of assistive living services. They confirmed the importance of real deployment to evaluate assistive solutions especially with the involvement of professional caregivers. They also asserted the need for larger deployments.

A technical ambient assistive living solution, consisting of a set of sensors and devices controlled by a software platform, was deployed in the collaborating nursing home. The trial was preceded by a pre-deployment period to organise several observation sessions with dementia patients and focus group discussions with professional caregivers. A process of ground truth and system's log data gathering was also planned prior to the trial and a system performance evaluation was realised during the deployment period with the help of caregivers. An ethical approval was obtained prior to real life deployment of our solution. Results: Patients' observations and discussions allowed us to gather a set of requirements that a system for elders with mild-dementia should fulﬁl. In fact, our deployment has exposed more concrete requirements and problems that need to be addressed, and which cannot be identiﬁed in laboratory testing. Issues that were neither forecasted during the design phase nor during the laboratory testing surfaced during deployment, thus affecting the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Results of the system performance evaluation show the evolution of system precision and uptime over the deployment phases, while data analysis demonstrates the ability to provide early detection of the degradation of patients' conditions. A qualitative feedback was collected from caregivers and doctors and a set of lessons learned emerged from this deployment experience. Conclusion: Lessons learned from this study were very useful for our research work and can serve as inspiration for developers and providers of assistive living services. They conﬁrmed the importance of real deployment to evaluate assistive solutions especially with the involvement of professional caregivers. They also asserted the need for larger deployments. Larger deployments will allow to conduct surveys on assistive solutions social and health impact, even though they are time and manpower consuming during their ﬁrst phases...|$|R
40|$|Time series {{modeling}} and forecasting are of vital <b>importance</b> <b>in</b> many <b>real</b> <b>world</b> applications. Recently nonlinear time series models have gained much attention, {{due to the}} fact that linear time series models faced various limitations in many empirical applications. In this thesis, a large variety of standard and extended linear and nonlinear time series models is considered in order to compare their out-of-sample forecasting performance. We examined the out-of-sample forecast accuracy of linear Autoregressive (AR), Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR), Autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACD), Threshold Autoregressive (TAR), Self-Exciting Threshold Autoregressive (SETAR), Logistic Smooth Transition Autoregressive (LSTAR), Additive Autoregressive (AAR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models and also the extended Heterogeneous Threshold Autoregressive (HTAR) or Heterogeneous Self-Exciting Threshold Autoregressive (HSETAR) model for financial, economic and seismic time series. We also extended the previous studies by using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Threshold Vector Autoregressive (TVAR) models and compared their forecasting accuracy with linear models for the above mentioned time series. Unlike previous studies that typically consider the threshold models specifications by using internal threshold variable, we specified the threshold models with external transition variables and compared their out-of-sample forecasting performance with the linear benchmark HAR and AR models by using the financial, economic and seismic time series. According to our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind that extends the usage of linear and nonlinear time series models in the field of seismology by utilizing the seismic data from the Hindu Kush region of Pakistan. The question addressed in this study is whether nonlinear models produce 1 through 4 step-ahead forecasts that improve upon linear models. The answer is that linear model mostly yields more accurate forecasts than nonlinear ones for financial, economic and seismic time series. Furthermore, while {{modeling and}} forecasting the financial (DJIA, FTSE 100, DAX and Nikkei), economic (the USA GDP growth rate) and seismic (earthquake magnitudes, consecutive elapsed times and consecutive distances between earthquakes occurred in the Hindu Kush region of Pakistan) time series, it appears that using various external threshold variables in threshold models improve their out-of-sample forecasting performance. The results of this study suggest that constructing the nonlinear models with external threshold variables has a positive effect on their forecasting accuracy. Similarly for seismic time series, in some cases, TVAR and VAR models provide improved forecasts over benchmark linear AR model. The findings of this study could somehow bridge the analytical gap between statistics and seismology through the potential use of linear and nonlinear time series models. Secondly, we extended the linear Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) model in a nonlinear framework, namely Heterogeneous Threshold Autoregressive (HTAR) model, to model and forecast a time series that contains simultaneously nonlinear and long-range dependence phenomena. The model has successfully been applied to financial data (DJIA, FTSE 100, DAX and Nikkei) and the results show that HTAR model has improved 1 -step-ahead forecasting performance than linear HAR model by utilizing the financial data of DJIA. For DJIA, the combination of the forecasts from HTAR and linear HAR models are improved over those obtained from the benchmark HAR model. Furthermore, we conducted a simulated study to assess the performance of HAR and HSETAR models in the presence of spurious long-memory type phenomena contains by a time series. The main purpose of this study is to answer the question, for a time series, whether the HAR and HSETAR models have an ability to detect spurious long-memory type phenomena. The simulation results show that HAR model is completely unable to discriminate between true and spurious long-memory type phenomena. However the extended HSETAR model is capable of detecting spurious long-memory type phenomena. This study provides an evidence that it is better to use HSETAR model, when it is suspected that the underlying time series contains some spurious long-memory type phenomena. To sum up, this thesis is a vital tool for researchers who have to choose the best forecasting model from a large variety of models discussed in this thesis for modeling and forecasting the economic, financial, and mainly seismic time series...|$|R
