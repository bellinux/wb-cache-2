40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} (TENS) in stimulating salivary flow in post-radiated oral cancer patients, and to compare the salivary flow rate between unstimulated saliva and saliva stimulated with TENS in post-radiated oral cancer patients. Materials and Methods: In 30 patients who underwent radiotherapy for oral cancer, unstimulated saliva was collected every minute for 5 min in a <b>graduated</b> <b>test</b> <b>tube.</b> The TENS unit was activated and stimulated saliva was collected for 5 min in a separate <b>graduated</b> <b>test</b> <b>tube,</b> and the flow rate was compared with the unstimulated salivary flow rate. Results: A statistically significant improvement was seen in saliva production during stimulation (P < 0. 001). In addition, statistically significant increase in TENS stimulated saliva was observed in patients aged ≥ 50 years compared to that in patients aged < 50 years (P < 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} salivary flow rate between the two genders in both stimulated and unstimulated conditions, however, statistically significant increase in salivary flow rate was observed in males under stimulated condition (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: TENS was highly effective in stimulating the whole salivary flow rate in post-radiated oral cancer patients. It is an effective supportive treatment modality in xerostomia patients caused by radiotherapy in oral cancer patients...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} feeding {{patterns and}} ontogenetic variations in a non-native fish species (Plagioscion squamosissimus) {{in an isolated}} lake in the Upper Paraná River floodplain. Quarterly samplings were performed from April 2005 to February 2006 using plankton nets to capture larvae, seining nets for juveniles, and gill nets and trammel for adults. Stomach contents (n = 378) were examined according to the volumetric method in which the volume of each food item was estimated using <b>graduated</b> <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> or a glass counting plate. During early development (larval stage), P. squamosissimus consumed mainly Cladocera and Copepoda. Juveniles showed a more diverse diet, including shrimp (Macrobrachium amazonicum), fish, aquatic insects (Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Chironomidae and pupae of Diptera) and plants. It was notable the high proportion of cannibalism (23. 3 %) in this stage. Adults consumed predominantly shrimp and fish. The use of food resources varied significantly between development stages (ANOSIM; r = 0. 458; p< 0. 005), showing changes in food preferences during ontogeny. The Similarity Percentage Analysis (SIMPER) indicated that Cladocera and Copepoda {{were responsible for the}} differences observed between the larval stages of pre-flexion, flexion and post-flexion. M. amazonicum and Chironomidae were responsible for the differences between juvenile and larval stages, while M. amazonicum and other fishes caused the differences between adults and other ontogenetic stages. These results are confirmed by the relationship between standard length and developmental periods (ANCOVA; r 2 = 0. 94; p< 0. 0001). In general, there were low values of trophic niche breadth. The essentially carnivorous habit from the early stages of P. squamosissimus and the predominant use of M. amazonicum by adults have important roles in feeding patterns of the species, suggesting a major contribution to its success and establishment, especially in lentic environments...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 18 hybrid strain Martini male rabbits were {{randomly}} {{divided into three}} experimental groups. The animals {{in the first and}} second groups drank water with 0. 1 and 0. 5 g/l of lycopene addition (B and C groups, respectively), while water without any supplement was administered to the control group rabbits (A group) for 8 weeks. Semen was collected from 18 bucks (6 animals/group) for 5 consecutive weeks. Ejaculate volume was determined by <b>graduated</b> <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> and sperm concentration was calculated by Neubauer chamber. Sperm motility was evaluated subjectively by a phase contrast microscope and forward progressive motility (FPM) scored 1 ÷ 4 (low-high). Sperm viability was assessed by nigrosin/eosin (N/E) staining procedure. At the end of the semen evaluation period, 20 females per group were inseminated on day 11 post partum with a pool of semen collected from each experimental group. Data showed that the highest level of lycopene (C group) resulted in a significantly greater volume of ejaculate and total number of sperm than in the control group (0. 98 vs. 0. 78 ml and 364 vs. 227, P 0. 05). This study shows the positive effects of lycopene supplementation on semen production and refrigerated semen characteristics. Lycopene supplementation of drinking water could have interesting applications in field conditions, although further research into the role of this antioxidant in animal production is needed. </p...|$|E

40|$|Context: Xerostomia is {{a common}} sequel in {{patients}} undergoing irradiation of malignant tumors {{of the head and}} neck. Palliative treatments of xerostomia like topical agents such as ice-chips, saliva substitutes, systemic sialogogues like pilocarpine and cevimeline work well for some patients. Electrostimulation was studied in the past and showed moderate promise but never became part of the mainstream therapy for better management of xerostomia patients. Aims: The aim of the following study is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit in stimulating the whole salivary flow rate in radiation induced xerostomia patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 subjects were included in the study. The study group consisted of 30 individuals and was divided into Group S 1 (n = 20), which was further subdivided into Group S 1 A (n = 10) subjects complaining of dry mouth who were undergoing head and neck radiotherapy with TENS stimulation during the commencement of radiotherapy, on the 3 rd, 6 th week and after a month of completion of radiotherapy and Group S 1 B (n = 10) with TENS stimulation daily during the full course of radiotherapy and Group S 2 (n = 10) subjects complaining of dry mouth who had undergone head and neck radiotherapy that ended 1 month prior to their entry into the study. The control group (n = 10) consisted of healthy individuals not complaining of dry mouth and who have not undergone head and neck radiotherapy. Whole saliva was collected without stimulation for 10 min and after electrostimulation with TENS unit for additional 10 min in a <b>graduated</b> <b>test</b> <b>tube.</b> The results were statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis′s test. Results: The data analysis revealed that control and S 1 B group showed increased salivary flow rate after stimulation by TENS therapy compared with the unstimulated salivary flow, whereas in S 1 A and S 2 group it was found to be statistically non-significant. Conclusion: The present study gave us an insight about the effectiveness of TENS therapy in stimulating salivary flow in healthy subjects and it is very effective when used in conjunction with radiation therapy by reducing the side-effects of radiation therapy. Hence, TENS therapy can be used as an adjunctive method for the treatment of xerostomia along with other treatment modalities...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} an algorithm for designing the equilibrium base-pairing properties of a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> of interacting nucleic acid strands. A target <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> is specified {{as a set}} of desired “on-target” complexes, each with a target secondary structure and target concentration, and a set of undesired “off-target” complexes, each with vanishing target concentration. Sequence design is performed by optimizing the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect, corresponding to the concentration of incorrectly paired nucleotides at equilibrium evaluated over the ensemble of the <b>test</b> <b>tube.</b> To reduce the computational cost of accepting or rejecting mutations to a random initial sequence, the structural ensemble of each on-target complex is hierarchically decomposed into a tree of conditional subensembles, yielding a forest of decomposition trees. Candidate sequences are evaluated efficiently at the leaf level of the decomposition forest by estimating the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect from conditional physical properties calculated over the leaf subensembles. As optimized subsequences are merged toward the root level of the forest, any emergent defects are eliminated via ensemble redecomposition and sequence reoptimization. After successfully merging subsequences to the root level, the exact <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect is calculated for the first time, explicitly checking for the effect of the previously neglected off-target complexes. Any off-target complexes that form at appreciable concentration are hierarchically decomposed, added to the decomposition forest, and actively destabilized during subsequent forest reoptimization. For target <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> representative of design challenges in the molecular programming and synthetic biology communities, our <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> design algorithm typically succeeds in achieving a normalized <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect ≤ 1 % at a design cost within an order of magnitude of the cost of <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> analysis...|$|R
