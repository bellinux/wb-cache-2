5|$|Joseph Hopper {{was a local}} {{councillor}} and Methodist preacher {{who lived}} in Windy Nook and was {{the creator of the}} 'aged mineworkers home scheme' in 1898 which provided housing for miners who had retired and were no longer eligible for tenure by <b>dint</b> <b>of</b> their employment. The organisation he created, the , is today a registered charity which owns around 1,500 properties and had a turnover in 2012 of over six million pounds. A celebration of Hopper's work was produced after his death by John Oxberry, who was himself born in Windy Nook, in 1924. Oxberry, born in 1857, was a renowned local historian who traveled to New Zealand but returned to publish various texts, including Windy Nook Village; its inhabitants and their Co-operative store, and served a variety of roles on Gateshead Council with sufficient distinction that he was made a Freeman of Gateshead in 1937. Oxberry died three years later.|$|E
5|$|The former Exchange Building, {{from which}} The Exchange takes its name, was an {{impressive}} structure, designed by William Mason as a Post Office and later {{occupied by the}} University of Otago and the Otago Museum. Next to this was the 1863 Customhouse building, and outside the two was an open space known as Customhouse Square. The Exchange building was pulled down in 1969, and it was largely the destruction of this building that led to changes in attitudes by Dunedinites regarding the change of their cityscape. Since this time, changes to the city's old buildings have been met with vociferous protests. The Customhouse building is also long since gone. Today, {{the site of the}} buildings is the location of Dunedin's biggest office block, John Wickliffe House, and the nearby John Wickliffe Plaza. Both are named for the John Wickliffe, the first of the two ships which brought the Otago Association's settlers to Dunedin (a nearby building, Philip Laing House, is named for the other of these two ships). Despite this, the area is the site of several prominent Victorian buildings, notably former bank buildings at the northern end of the area. Other imposing buildings in the area include the Chief Post Office building, the proposed site of a hotel, and - one block to the east - Consultancy House, a seven-storey 1908 building regarded (by <b>dint</b> <b>of</b> its construction methods) as Dunedin's first skyscraper. John Wickliffe Plaza is also the site of one of Dunedin's more notable public monuments, dedicated to city founder Captain William Cargill. This monument, designed by Charles Robert Swyer and built in 1863-4, was originally sited in the Octagon, but was moved to the Exchange in 1872.|$|E

Australia did have strength in depth, Keith Miller (36.97), Alan Davidson (24.59), Ron Archer (24.58), Richie Benaud (24.45) and Ray Lindwall (21.15) were all-rounders of Test class, but lacked the skills to master high class pace and only Lindwall (64 not out at Brisbane) made fifty.

25|$|Professor Ebenezer Graham is a {{professor}} of Oriental languages, sent as an envoy to the Ottoman Empire navy on HMS Worcester in The Ionian Mission. He is stereotypical Scotsman: dour, humorless, and speaking with a broad Scots burr. He is also an inept secret agent, working for a branch of British intelligence service that is in conflict with Maturin's branch. Landing on the French coast on a secret mission, he literally shoots himself in the foot by accident, so that Maturin, on a secret mission of his own aborted by Graham's presence, takes Graham as his prize and puts him to work for the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. Graham gains crucial information in The Ionian Mission by <b>dint</b> <b>of</b> his long connections with the Turks, and remains with Maturin on Malta in Treason's Harbour, describing one of the French spies on the island, Lesueur, becoming useful with more than his language skills. Graham does not enjoy Maturin's dry humor and nor Aubrey's high spirits and humor before battle, but comes to enjoy Maturin's company. When the new Commander-in-Chief arrives with his own Turkish consultant, Graham is sent home on short notice.|$|E

Moreover, Jaws whet corporate appetites for big profits quickly, which is to say, studios wanted every film to be Jaws." [...] Scholar Thomas Schatz writes that it [...] "recalibrated the profit potential of the Hollywood hit, and redefined its status as a marketable commodity and cultural phenomenon as well. The film brought an emphatic end to Hollywood's five-year recession, while ushering in an era of high-cost, high-tech, high-speed thrillers." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{for much}} of his career he made his living as a church organist, Fauré greatly {{preferred}} the piano. He never underestimated the challenges in composing for the instrument; he wrote, [...] "In piano music there's no room for padding – one has to pay cash and make it consistently interesting. It's perhaps the most difficult genre of all." [...] Although his publishers insisted on descriptive titles, Fauré said that his own preference would be for utilitarian labels such as [...] "Piano piece No X". His works for the piano are marked by a classical French lucidity; he was unimpressed by pianistic display, commenting of keyboard virtuosi, [...] "the greater they are, the worse they play me." [...] Even a virtuoso such as Franz Liszt said that he found Fauré's music hard to play: at his first attempt he said to Fauré, [...] "I've run out of fingers". [...] Fauré's years as an organist influenced the way he laid out his keyboard works, often using arpeggiated figures, with themes distributed between the two hands, requiring fingerings more natural for organists than pianists. This tendency may have been even stronger because Fauré was ambidextrous, and he was not always inclined to follow the convention that the melody is in the right hand and the accompaniment in the left. His old friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns wrote to him in 1917, [...] "Ah! if there is a god for the left hand, I should very much like to know him and make him an offering when I am disposed to play your music; the 2nd Valse-Caprice is terrible in this respect; I have however managed to {{get to the end of}} it by <b>dint</b> <b>of</b> absolute determination." ...|$|E
