It concluded by explaining how disease prevention campaigns often target direct sex workers, such as those who work in a brothel, and neglect the women in other areas of sex work who are also at risk of contracting STIs. Thus, advocates of the legalization/decriminalization of prostitution believe policies need to be designed to target any sex worker who may be in a vulnerable position.|$|R

The authors analyze the potential curvilinear (nonlinear) relationship between temporary contracts and organizational outcomes and examine how the proportion of <b>indirect</b> temporary <b>workers</b> – hired through Temporary Help Agencies (THAs) – influences this relationship {{in a sample of}} 1597 Spanish manufacturing firms. The analysis finds a negative linear relationship between temporary contracts and labor productivity and a predominantly positive concave downward curve between temporary contracts and gross operating margin. This curvilinear relationship is especially stronger when the proportion of indirect temporary contracts is low, and it is found that the use of temporary contracts has a positive effect on gross operating margin, but this effect becomes negative with overuse. This empirical evidence partially questions the dominant linear view that has been established {{over the past few decades}} in the labor flexibility literature at an organizational level.

The cultural context is also important because it influences the communications among movement participants and the movement activists 2 ̆ 7 chances to recruit new members. The success of movement mobilization depends on the communication process that constitutes the foundation of any organizing efforts. In fact, to a large extent, the process of mobilization is a process of communication. ^ Moving beyond the dominant social movement theories I contend that political opportunities and resources alone cannot account for the emergence of a movement. KOR intellectuals 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 cognitive liberation 2 ̆ 2 (McAdam) was a combination of psychological states rooted in the nation 2 ̆ 7 s political culture, of a strategic insight that workers were indispensable for the movement 2 ̆ 7 s success, and of responses to competitive pressures. KOR had to overcome various cultural barriers to move beyond its own willingness to act (the first tier of movement mobilization) and mobilize followers and allies (the second tier). The group succeeded because it framed its goals in terms that emphasized the areas of agreement and common concern for intellectuals and workers, and did so more effectively than a rival organization. An oppositional coalition emerged and a reciprocal learning process developed between KOR and worker activists.

This thesis examines hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale region using an E 3 analysis; looking at the energy potential of the natural gas in the basin, the economics of shale gas extraction, and the environmental impact from a wildlife perspective. The thesis also examines the federal, regional, and state policies and regulations that apply to the industry. The Marcellus Shale has the most technically recoverable gas of any basin in the United States at 141 trillion cubic feet. Based on current U. S. consumption, the Marcellus could provide all the natural gas used in the country for 5. 5 years. Income from natural gas development comes primarily from jobs (direct such as gas <b>workers,</b> <b>indirect</b> such as equipment suppliers, and induced jobs which are created when direct workers spend their earnings in a community) and taxes and fees. From a wildlife perspective, environmental effects are primarily on habitat. Terrestrial habitat effects are primarily due to landscape fragmentation from clearing of land for well pad development, which removes mature forest and creates edge habitat. An increase in forest edges is associated with an increase in nest predation and brood parasitism, which could put edge-nesting songbird species at risk. Aquatic habitat effects are less well understood. Hydraulic fracturing requires up to 19 mil l of water per well fracture and in the Marcellus Shale region, most of that comes from surface water sources. Removal of water from surface water sources can increase sedimentation, alter the temperature, and change the chemistry of the water, resulting in changes in the biodiversity of the water source. Federal oversight of natural gas production is managed through a variety of regulations, primarily the National Environmental Protection Act, the Clean Water Act (although hydraulic fracturing was exempted from the erosion control provisions via the Energy Policy Act of 2005), the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Mineral Leasing Act, the Natural Gas Act, and several others. The Susquehanna River Basin Commission and the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) regulate water usage in their respective watersheds, although the DRBC has yet to finalize the regulations for water usage for hydraulic fracturing in the Delaware River Basin. Each of the states in the region regulate the industry in different ways. Given that hydraulic fracturing will continue, further research is needed on habitat impacts, especially on aquatic habitats. Best Management Practices need to be agreed upon by stakeholders (industry, regulators, non-governmental organizations). Federal regulation is required to force operators to consistently disclose the chemicals used in the fracturing fluid and to mandate erosion/sediment control. An Ohio River Basin Commission needs to be chartered to manage water use in the Ohio River Basin, {{as it is in the}} Susquehanna and Delaware River basins. States need to actively manage reclamation activities to ensure native plantings. University of Delaware, Center for Energy and Environmental PolicyM. S...|$|R

Belgium. - In 1848 in Belgium the Commission on Labour proposed legislation to limit, as in France, the hours of labour for adults, but this proposal was never passed. Belgian regulation of labour in industry remains essentially, in harmony with its earliest beginnings in 1863 and onwards, a series of specialized provisions to meet particular risks of individual trades, and did not, until 1889, give any adherence to a common principle of limitation of hours and times of labour for [...] " [...] protected [...] " [...] persons. This was in the law of 13 December 1889, which applies to mines, quarries, factories, workshops classed as unhealthy, wharves and docks, transports. As in France, industrial establishments having a charitable or philanthropic or educational character are included. The persons protected are girls and women under 21 years, and boys under 16; and women over 21 only find a place in the law through the prohibition of their employment within four weeks after childbirth. As the hours of labour of adult women remain ordinarily unlimited by law, so are the hours of boys from 16 to 21. The law of Sunday rest dated 17 July 1905, however, applies to labour generally in all industrial and commercial undertakings except transport and fisheries, with certain regulated exceptions for (a) cases of breakdown or urgency due to force majeure, (b) certain repairs and cleaning, (c) [...] perishable materials, (d) retail food supply. Young workers are excluded from the exceptions. The absolute prohibitions of employment are: for children under 12 years in any industry, manufacturing or mining or transport, and for women and girls under 21 years below the surface in working of mines. Boys under. 16 years and women and girls under 21 years may in general not be employed before 5 A.M. or after 9 P.M., and one day in the seven is to be set apart for rest from employment; to these rules exception may be made either by royal decree for classes or groups of processes, or by local authorities in exceptional cases. The exceptions may be applied, generally, only to workers over 14 years, but in mines, by royal decree, boys over 12 years may be employed from 4 A.M. The law of 1889 fixes only a maximum of 12 hours of effective work, to be interrupted by pauses for rest of not less than 12 hours, empowering the king by decree to formulate more precise limits suited to the special circumstances of individual industries. Royal decrees have accordingly laid down the conditions for many groups, including textile trades, manufacture of paper, pottery, glass, clothing, mines, quarries, engineering and printing works. In some the daily limit is 10 hours, but in more 102 or I I hours. In a few exceptionally unhealthy trades, such as the manufacture of lucifer matches, vulcanization of india-rubber by means of carbcn bi-sulphide, the age of exclusion from employment has been raised, and in the last-named process hours have been reduced to 5, broken into two spells of 21. hours each.|$|R
