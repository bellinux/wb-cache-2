40|$|Abstract. The {{corrosion}} {{behaviors of}} {{304 stainless steel}} (304 SS) which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> and 304 SS which <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> in two different solutions were investigated using polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The results show that 304 SS which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> and 304 SS which <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>have</b> the similar corrosion voltage in two different solutions. However, the corrosion velocity of 304 SS which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> more than 304 SS which <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> both in the two solutions and the corrosion behaviors of two 304 SS in the water solution are better than in the water which has little oil...|$|R

5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.|$|E

The relief force was unable to advance on the ridge, and when more German forces arrived between 11:00 and 13:00 the trapped squadron surrendered.

Thousands of refugees had crowded into the town to escape the Serb advance. Following the Serb takeover of Srebrenica, an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically massacred by Serb forces between 11–15 July and another 25,000–30,000 were subjected to ethnic cleansing. It was the largest act of mass murder in Europe since World War II.|$|E

The trial verdict was given on 16 December 1997, clearing all six defendants of manslaughter charges. The cause of Senna's accident was established by the court as the steering column breaking. The column <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> and welded back together at Senna's request in order for him to be more comfortable in the car.|$|E

5|$|Padayappas initial {{final cut}} lasted for 22 reels, which was {{considered}} too lengthy. Rather than cut the film, Rajinikanth suggested to Ravikumar to allot two intervals for the film. Ravikumar was wary of this idea, {{and went to}} actor Kamal Haasan for advice, since the initial final cut of Haasan's Nayakan (1987) was also 22 reels. Using his prior experience on trimming Nayakan, Haasan was able to cut Padayappa down to 16 reels. When Kumudams reporter Kannan asked Rajinikanth to release the scenes which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> as Padayappas sequel, Rajinikanth immediately spoke to Ravikumar about the possibility, but was informed that those reels had been destroyed.|$|E
