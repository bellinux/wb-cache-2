5000|$|The testing, {{which had}} mixed results, {{presented}} {{its own set}} of problems. In 1987 the Navy and Air Force conducted 70+ tests, results which were unfairly characterized as [...] "very inconsistent" [...] by to the GAO. Following a test suspension and subsequent significant design improvements, vastly better weapons function and reliability results were achieved. Problems the Navy encountered with the BIGEYE included excessive pressure build-up, questions about the lethality of the chemical mixture resulting from variable mix times, and overall reliability concerns. Scientists debated the efficacy of the binary weapons program, especially since the BIGEYE had only been tested using simulants, despite the fact that extensive and highly representative kinetic and kinematic simulant tests were performed. This again confirmed GAO's lack of scientific/engineering understanding of the weapon concept/deployment strategy. Unfortunately, GAO's less than informed report led to speculation that binary weapons might be inferior to those of the unitary weapons they were intended to replace despite their inherent safety for US military personnel. The GAO repeatedly backed these assertions without engineering substantiation, maintaining that the BIGEYE was not adequately tested and that it had <b>encountered</b> <b>major</b> technical issues. While the program did <b>encounter</b> <b>major</b> technical issues, the Navy with its USAF and USA partners successfully resolved all of the legitimate engineering issues and developed highly effective mission profiles for the weapon.|$|R
