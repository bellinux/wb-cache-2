The present diesel engines such as fuel direct injection, the pressures can be increased about 100  200 Mpa bar in fuel pump injection system. The experimental investigated effects of fuel injection pressure on engine performance. Experiments have been performed on a diesel engine with four-cylinder, two-stroke, direct injection. Engine performance values such as indicated pressure, <b>indicated</b> <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> shaft horse power, brake horse power, break mean effective pressure and fuel consumption have been investigated both of variation engine speeds - fixed load and fixed engine speed  variation loads by changing the fuel injection pressure from 180 to 220 bar. According to the results, the best performance of the pressure injection has been obtained at 220 bar, specific fuel consumption has been obtained at 200 bar for fixed load  variation speeds and at 180 bar for variation loads  fixed speed. The results of the experiment have given as graphics in this paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{indicator}} {{diagram of the}} Diesel engine is a valuable source of information, delivering many important data. In order to obtain from it the <b>indicated</b> <b>horse</b> <b>power,</b> the exact position of the top dead centre is needed. Using a measuring system containing a piezoelectric sensor, a charge amplifier and a fast data aquisition system, {{it is possible to}} store, analyze and process many successive thermodynamic cycles for each cylinder {{in such a way as}} to obtain the exact position of the top dead centre without using any additional signal from, or any mark on the flywheel. For that purpose, the experimental compression part of many successive cycles is compaired continuously to a simulation compression model containing varying parameter values determined by the measured cycle itself. After the experimental and the simulation compression curves fit each other, the top dead centre can be determined. Different known heat transfer models of the compression have been used and tested, and a new method, using stepwise chaning parameters along the compression is proposed. The method has been tested for different Diesel engines running at speeds between 100 and 2500 r. p. m. with a very good success. The results given concern three types of Diesel Engines i. e. one MAN W 4 V 17, 5 / 22 A DG, 140 BHP, 1000 r. p. m. coupled to a Zoellner hydraulic brake, a ship's Diesel SULZER 5 RND 68, 7500 BHP, 137 r. p. m. measured on sea trials and two stationary FIAT GMT A 420. 8, 55000 BHP, 500 r. p. m., coupled to a synchronous electric generator. © 1987 VDI Verlag GmbH...|$|E

Introduction: The following tests were made on the {{compressed air}} plant in the Engineering Laboratory of the Kansas State Agricultural College. The plant is equipped as follows: a vertical engine the make and rated horse power of which are unknown, belted, through a main shaft, to a double acting, horizontal, piston compressor manufactured by the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill company, and rated at from 8 to 13 horse power depending on the revolution, piston compressor manufactured by the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill Company, and rated at from 8 to 13 horse power depending on the revolutions per minute and the receiver pressure. A Westinghouse engine with two 6 x 8 single acting cylinders {{was connected to the}} air receiver and used as an air motor. The object of the tests was to determine 1 st the efficiency of the plant, or the ratio of the developed brake horse power of the motor to the <b>indicated</b> <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> of the engine; 2 nd the efficiency between the engine and compressor cylinders, and between the compressor cylinder and the brake on the motor; 2 rd the horse power lost in heating the air and the cooling water. A series of three tests was conducted, the duration of each of which was one hour. Indicator cards were taken on the engine and compressor every five minutes throughout the test; as there was no means of taking cards on the air motor, a rope brake was constructed and used instead. Every five minutes, {{at the same time that}} the indicator cards instead. Every five minutes, at the same time that the indicator cards were taken, the speeds of the engine compressor and motor were noted, and at the same time, the initial and final temperatures of the air and cooling water, and the readings of the scale of the rope brake on the motor were taken. All water which passed through the water jacket of the compressor was carefully weighed and recorder, so that the total weight of water which passed through the jacket during the test was known...|$|E

50|$|The {{need for}} more power comes from {{necessity}} and desire when driving in steep sand dunes. This has driven sandrail engine builders to add performance features to engines such as the stock (24 to 50 <b>horse</b> <b>power)</b> Volkswagen engine. These include: larger pistons, turbochargers, dual racing carburetors, fuel injection, and high performance cylinder heads. Some performance engines can run on premium unleaded gasoline. However, many high performance engines must use racing fuel or fuel additives. A high performance sandrail Volkswagen engine can produce well into the 170-200+ <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> range and as high as 700 <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> with methanol fuel.|$|R
