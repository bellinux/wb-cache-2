500|$|Foster {{signed for}} League Two side Rotherham United on 20 June 2011. He signed a one-year {{contract}} with the club, with an option of a second year. Foster made his debut for the club in a 3–0 home victory against Gillingham on 27 August 2011, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute with Rotherham already holding a three-goal advantage. After making no further first-team appearances the following month, Foster was made available for loan by manager Andy Scott. Scott stated Foster lacked both desire and fitness since signing for the club — [...] "If {{you want to be}} match <b>fit,</b> <b>you</b> get yourself match <b>fit.</b> <b>You</b> can work in training, you can stay behind, you have days off, you can get yourself fit. Luke has not been in the side and that tells you everything you need to know". However, no loan move materialised, and Foster made his second appearance for Rotherham in a 3–3 away draw at Morecambe on 25 October 2011. He appeared as a 27th-minute substitute in the club's following match four days later, a 1–1 draw against Northampton Town, and subsequently made his first start in a 2–0 home victory over Aldershot Town on 5 November — Rotherham's first win in 10 matches. In December 2011, Rotherham manager Andy Scott revealed that Foster would miss the rest of the 2011–12 season {{as a result of a}} cruciate ligament damage sustained in a match against Hereford United on 10 December 2011. He was released by Rotherham in May 2012, having made six appearances for the club.|$|E
500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] {{was written}} by American {{recording}} artist Chris Brown and his team which included Brian Kennedy, Rob. A and Andre Merritt, {{better known as the}} Graffiti Artizts. The track was originally considered {{to be part of the}} re-release edition of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, he took preference to another song, [...] "Forever", which later became the lead single from his re-released album, titled Exclusive: The Forever Edition (2008). He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and instead forwarded the song to Rihanna. When writing the song, he was inspired [...] "to go totally left and kind of weird". Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally <b>fit</b> <b>you,</b> but it might be an idea you have." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] is an uptempo electropop song. According to BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine, it is {{reminiscent}} of Rihanna's 2007 single [...] "Don't Stop the Music". McAlpine {{also noted that the}} song has a [...] "frosty-rave" [...] chorus accompanied with Rihanna's [...] "icy" [...] vocals. It was written by Brian Kennedy Seals, Chris Brown, Robert Allen and Andre Merritt for the re-release of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, Brown took preference to another track, [...] "Forever", which would later be released as the first single from the re-release. He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and gave it to Rihanna. Kennedy produced [...] "Disturbia", while Makeba Riddick produced Rihanna's vocals. The song was recorded by Andrew Vastola at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. It was mixed by Phil Tan at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. Additional engineering was provided by Josh Houghkirk, with assistance from Carlos Oyanedel. Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings about giving [...] "Disturbia" [...] to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally <b>fit</b> <b>you,</b> but it might be an idea you have".|$|E

2500|$|O.J. Simpson's {{trial was}} famous for the quote [...] "if it doesn't <b>fit,</b> <b>you</b> must acquit" [...] {{regarding}} a bloody glove presented as evidence. Simpson wore gloves during the trial. The glove presented as evidence shrank from the blood, according to some analysis.|$|E
2500|$|On June 15, 1995, defense {{attorney}} Johnnie Cochran goaded assistant prosecutor Christopher Darden into asking Simpson {{to put on}} the leather glove that was found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The prosecution had earlier decided against asking Simpson to try on the gloves because (according to prosecutors) the glove had been soaked in blood from Simpson, Brown and Goldman, and frozen and unfrozen several times. The leather glove seemed too tight for Simpson to put on easily, especially over the sanitary gloves he wore underneath. Uelmen came up with and Cochran repeated a quip he had used several times in relation to other points in his closing arguments, [...] "If it doesn't <b>fit,</b> <b>you</b> must acquit". On June 22, 1995, Darden told Judge Lance Ito of his concerns that Simpson [...] "has arthritis and we looked at the medication he takes and some of it is anti-inflammatory and we are told he has not taken the stuff for a day and it caused swelling in the joints and inflammation in his hands". The prosecution also stated their belief that the glove shrank from having been soaked in blood and later testing. The prosecution presented a photo during the trial of Simpson earlier wearing the same type of glove that was found at the crime scene.|$|E
2500|$|After four days, , Talking God, and , Water Sprinkler, returned. [...] The twins {{had already}} grown into big boys.

[...] They agreed to race around the mountain. [...] The boys ran fast, and the two Holy People ran slower. [...] But soon the boys became tired and the Holy People came up behind them and began taunting them and {{whipping}} them with switches of mountain mahogany. [...] As they approached home, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran past them and won the race. [...] "We will return in four days to race again," [...] they said, and departed. [...] In the evening, the boys were sore and tired. , the Wind came to them and said, [...] "Practice each day and grow stronger." [...] In four days, Talking God and Water Sprinkler returned, and the four raced again around the mountain. [...] It was a faster pace, but just as before, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran just behind the twins and whipped them with switches. [...] Again the Holy People said they would return in four days to race again. [...] And again in the evening [...] came and encouraged them and urged them to train. [...] Each day the boys trained, and in the third race, Talking God and Water Sprinkler no longer whipped the twins, but had to run their strongest to win the race at the end. [...] Four days later they returned to race a final time. [...] Again, the boys started very fast, but this time they did not tire and slow their pace. [...] They led the whole way and won the race. [...] "Well done, ," [...] said Talking God and Water Sprinkler. [...] "You have grown into what we wanted you to become. Now you can serve well those who have nurtured you." ...|$|E
