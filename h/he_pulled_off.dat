5|$|Huggins handled 19 fielding chances, 11 putouts {{and nine}} assists, without {{committing}} {{an error in}} a game with the Saints in 1902; the previous Major League Baseball (MLB) record being 18, set by Fred Dunlap in 1882. In 1903, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> the first delayed steal in recorded baseball history.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{began to}} pull away from Häkkinen. de la Rosa ran into the rear of Alesi at Wurth corner on lap two causing Alesi to retire, with de la Rosa {{sustaining}} a broken front wing and retired after going off at Campsa corner. Further back, Irvine passed Verstappen for twelfth position. The positions at the front were the same for the next sixteen laps with the gap between Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen fluctated from 1.6 seconds to 3.4 seconds while Coulthard and Barrichello battled Ralf Schumacher for third position. Button became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 18 and rejoined in front of Mazzacane. Villeneuve made his pit stop on the 21st lap, which promoted Frentzen into the points-scoring positions. After rejoining the circuit, his car caught fire and <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> {{to the side of the}} track at the exit of Seat corner. Trulli's pit stop, which dropped him to 17th, proved problematic: he stalled his engine which required his mechanics to restart it. Ralf Schumacher made a pit stop one lap later and re-emerged in fifth. On lap 24, Michael Schumacher made his pit stop. As he accelerated from his pit box, his rear wheel hit the Ferrari refuller Nigel Stepney who was dragged before being knocked over. Stepney was taken to the circuit's medical center for observation and he was replaced by reserve refuller Andrea Vacari. Coulthard made a pit stop on the same lap and experienced problems with leaving his pit box because he selected second gear and re-emerged behind Ralf Schumacher.|$|E
25|$|In 1928 <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> a major {{upset by}} {{knocking}} out highly regarded Tuffy Griffiths. The following year {{he earned a}} chance {{to fight for the}} title, but he narrowly lost to Tommy Loughran in a 15-round decision. Braddock was greatly depressed by the loss and badly fractured his right hand in several places in the process. His career suffered as a result, as did his disposition.|$|E

25|$|Trueman {{played in}} all five Tests against New Zealand in 1958, taking 15 wickets {{in the series}} {{at an average of}} 17.06. This was a wet summer and most of the bowling in the series was done by spinners, but Trueman still managed 5–31 in the first Test at Edgbaston. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> a {{remarkable}} anticipatory catch in the Lord's Test when he stepped forward from his short leg position to catch the ball off a defensive stroke with his hand on the batsman's boot. In the Final Test at the Oval, he made the highest score of his whole Test career with 39 not out in twenty minutes, including three sixes off Alex Moir.|$|E
25|$|Pironi was 15 laps {{from the}} end, {{when he noticed}} a front wheel wobble on his Ligier. He slowed the car to approx 50km/h (30mph) before the wheel came off, and <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> the track {{at the end of}} the start/finish {{straight}} to retire, giving Jones the lead. Jones continued to keep a fairly constant distance between himself and second placed Jochen Mass to win the race, with Elio de Angelis, the only other car to be on the lead lap, finishing third. Jean-Pierre Jarier and Emerson Fittipaldi finished in fourth and fifth place respectively, both one lap down. Sixth placed Patrick Gaillard was the last driver to be classified as finishing the race, five laps down after his earlier collision with John Watson's car.|$|E
25|$|Although the Angels stormed to {{a record}} of 18–9 {{in the month of}} June, the team never quite {{recovered}} from the loss of Morales, as they posted three consecutive sub-.500 months from July to September. However, the team did not back down without a fight. On July 22, the team acquired third baseman Alberto Callaspo from the Kansas City Royals in exchange for Sean O'Sullivan and a pitching prospect. Although this move received mild criticism, general manager Tony Reagins certainly silenced the critics three days later, on July 25; it was on that day that <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> a trade with the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Angels acquired ace starting pitcher Dan Haren in exchange for pitchers Joe Saunders and Rafael Rodríguez, and prospects Patrick Corbin and Tyler Skaggs; it is notable that all four pitchers the Angels sent in return are left-handed pitchers.|$|E

25|$|He {{managed to}} escape from the Verviers prison on 4 July 1979. Although Ražnatović was apprehended in the Netherlands on 24 October 1979, the few months he was free were enough for at least two more armed robberies in Sweden and three more in the Netherlands. Serving a seven-year {{sentence}} at a prison in Amsterdam, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> another escape on 8 May 1981 after someone slipped him a gun. Wasting no time, more robberies followed, this time in Germany, where after less than a month of freedom he was arrested in Frankfurt on 5 June 1981 following a jewellery store stickup. In the ensuing shootout with police he was lightly wounded, resulting in his placement in the prison hospital ward, where looser security allowed him to escape again only four days later, on 9 June, supposedly by jumping from the window, beating up the first bystander and stealing his clothing before disappearing.|$|E
25|$|The rest of 1989 was characterised by gearbox {{and various}} other problems, {{including}} a disqualification at the Canadian Grand Prix and a black-flagged incident at the Portuguese Grand Prix for reversing in the pit lane, {{which resulted in a}} ban for the next race in Spain. However, Mansell finished fourth in the Championship {{with the help of a}} memorable second win for Ferrari at the tight and twisty Hungaroring for the Hungarian Grand Prix. Early in practice Mansell had seen that trying to qualify the car high on the grid was a pointless exercise and he decided instead to concentrate on a good race set-up. After qualifying 12th (0.681s behind teammate Gerhard Berger in sixth and 2.225s behind pole man Riccardo Patrese in his Williams-Renault) and not even being considered a chance for the race, he charged his way through the field until <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> a sensational passing manoeuvre on the McLaren-Honda of World Champion Ayrton Senna on lap 58 to take a lead he would not lose.|$|E
500|$|While he {{was still}} on bail on 16 February 1990, during his third {{interview}} with police, Webster admitted to killing Leigh. In the interview transcript, Webster initially denied killing Leigh, then [...] "without being asked a further question" [...] he stated, [...] "Well, I did it. But I just can't believe ... it happened. It's just unbelievable." [...] Webster went on to state that he saw Leigh while {{he was looking for}} his stash of beers. According to Webster, they walked to the saltbushes together, where <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> her clothes and stuck a finger in her vagina. Webster stated he lost his temper when Leigh rebuffed him, choking her for a while before killing her with a rock, specifically saying he killed Leigh because he [...] "thought she would squeal on [...] for trying to rape her". After spending the weekend in a police cell, Webster appeared in court on 19 February where he was refused bail. On 21 March, while in custody, Webster was convicted and fined $250 for offensive behaviour in the 28 January assault. On 17 July Shearman was given a 12-month good behaviour bond for the 31 January assault; the judge did not record a conviction, taking into consideration that he had been provoked into attacking Wilson.|$|E

50|$|Finally {{realizing that}} she is not paying enough {{attention}} to her only client, Kallen agrees to sell Shaw's contract to LaRocca on the condition that he be given a championship fight. LaRocca agrees, setting Shaw up for a shot at the title before he could be ready. Kallen arrives at the fight and stands in Shaw's corner as <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> an upset and wins the championship.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic {{spoke of}} the song {{in a review of}} the Love Tracks album, stating [...] "McLean only {{contributes}} a handful of original songs - the rest are fairly standard Nashville filler, although <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> the everyman stomper [...] "Love in My Heart" [...] convincingly, and [...] "Can't Blame the Train" [...] rollicks along with some verve. Both tracks made the Top 100 country chart." ...|$|R

2500|$|In talmudic legend, Rav Adda's piety was purportedly {{so highly}} valued by heaven that no favor asked by him was ever refused. In times of drought, for example, when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> just one shoe (preparatory to {{offering}} prayer), {{an abundance of}} rain descended; but if <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> the other, the world was flooded. (Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 67a.) Even his teacher, Rav, realized Adda's protective influence. On one occasion when he and Samuel, accompanied by Adda, came to a tottering ruin, and Samuel proposed to avoid it by taking a circuitous route, Rav observed that just then there was no occasion for fear, since Rav Adda, whose merits were very great, was with them; consequently no accident would befall them. Samuel's great colleague Rav Huna also believed in and availed himself of Rav Adda's supposed miraculous influence with heaven. Rav Huna {{had a lot of}} wine stored in a building that threatened to collapse. He was anxious to save his property, but there was danger of accident to the laborers. Therefore, he invited Rav Adda into the building, and there engaged him in legal discussions until the task of removing its contents was safely accomplished; hardly had the rabbis vacated the premises when the tottering walls fell. (Babylonian Talmud Taanit 20b.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1951, McCall was {{personally}} transporting Shepherd and Irvin from Raiford to Tavares for the retrial. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> {{to a country}} road, claiming tire trouble. He swore in a deposition that Shepherd and Irvin attacked him in an escape attempt, and that he shot them both in self-defense. The prisoners were handcuffed together during the entire incident. Shepherd was killed on the spot, and McCall shot Irvin three times, but he survived. During the incident Deputy James Yates also arrived and, according to Irvin, shot him again while he was wounded[...]|$|E
50|$|During his {{elaborate}} heists, he {{concentrates on}} the showmanship {{as much as the}} crime itself. <b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> a daring art theft, stealing several priceless paintings from Dublin's best art gallery, giving the authorities the slip. The Gardaí become more determined to catch him as time goes on, in particular Noel Quigley, an officer whose ambition to catch Lynch becomes an obsession. His actions also gain the ire of the IRA.|$|R

2500|$|Walter Bonatti {{called his}} {{climbing}} philosophy [...] "The pursuit with the extremely hard". <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> a fantastic number of audacious ascents plus more remarkably survived some horrific climbs that killed {{some of his}} associates. The underlying idea of his approach was to accept to climb the mountain hard as it is, with fair means and in the simplest and most aesthetic way possible. In an interview left to John Crace of The Guardian on 30 June 2010 he said: Modern equipment is so technically advanced you can climb anything if you put your mind to it. The impossible {{has been removed from}} the equation.|$|E
2500|$|The 1970 Florida Gators {{featured}} All-American {{defensive end}} Jack Youngblood, and <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> {{one of the}} most remarkable plays in Florida football history. [...] With Bulldogs leading 17–10 and in possession of the ball at the Gators' two-yard line, Youngblood stood up Georgia back Ricky Lake short of the goal, forced a fumble and fell on the football. [...] "They ran a lead play to my side, and I cut it off", Youngblood said. [...] "I'm standing there holding the ballcarrier and I take the ball away from him, and gave it back to our offense." [...] Gators quarterback John Reaves and wide receiver Carlos Alvarez then connected for two touchdown passes in the final 5:13 to rally the Florida Gators to a 24–17 victory.|$|E
2500|$|Cosby was in Los Angeles in January 1997, {{while on}} winter break from his classes at Columbia University.

He called a friend, Stephanie Crane, who drove to meet him; she parked behind him to light the area with her headlights while Cosby changed the tire. She later testified that a man came to her window and told her, [...] "Open the door or I'll kill you." [...] Frightened, Crane drove away but after approximately [...] turned her car around and came back. She saw a man running away and found Cosby lying on the ground {{in a pool of blood}} next to the driver's side of his dark green Mercedes-Benz. He had been shot in the head. It appeared robbery was a motive, but Cosby was still wearing a Rolex watch and had three $20 bills in his pocket.|$|E
