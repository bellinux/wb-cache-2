5|$|Cyanogenic glycosides {{are stored}} in {{inactive}} forms in plant vacuoles. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant and break cell membranes allowing the glycosides to come <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> enzymes in the cytoplasm releasing hydrogen cyanide which blocks cellular respiration. Glucosinolates are activated {{in much the same}} way as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause gastroenteritis, salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth. Benzoxazinoids, secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses (Poaceae), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant vacuole. Upon tissue disruption they get <b>into</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones. Whereas some benzoxazinoids are constitutively present, others are only synthesised following herbivore infestation, and thus, considered inducible plant defenses against herbivory.|$|E
