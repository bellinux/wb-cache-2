Acquiring such knowledge is fundamental for improving the quality of sub-national data available to local or regional destination management organizations and tourism stakeholders, thus gaining a better positioning for the <b>destination</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> Hence, the project’s scope embodies the development of a measurement, analysis, modelling, and flows of visitors control system, as well as, the execution of an empiric study within the previously mentioned urban destinations...|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{and marine}} environments {{are among the}} most popular areas for outdoor {{recreation}} and tourism. Coastal areas have also been identified as the most vulnerable to climate change, for example as a result of extreme events and sea-level rise. It will be increasingly important for coastal tourism destination managers to understand their vulnerability to climatic changes and to devise appropriate adaptation. This paper presents a five-step vulnerability assessment methodology for tourism in coastal areas. The five steps include (1) system analysis, (2) identification of activity and hazard sub-systems, (3) vulnerability assessments for the different sub-systems at risk, (4) integration for the <b>destination</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> and scenario analysis and (5) communication. The framework is illustrated by an example of how it might be applied to Fiji. The paper concludes that a consistent methodology, like the one proposed, will facilitate vulnerability assessments in a range of coastal destinations, allow comparison to be made of vulnerabilities across different situations, provide a basis for more research into specific adaptation measures and assist destinations to develop a more sustainable tourism industry.

40|$|Abstract ch. 5 - The European Tourism Industry, {{particularly}} the Italian one, is substantially {{made up of}} small and medium firms. In the spirit of enhancing the knowledge and stimulating the debate on tourism innovation, this paper considers the role of small and medium firms (SMEs) and their use of Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) as their main interest of research. In the last twenty years, the amount of studies regarding SMEs working in the tourist industry has enormously increased, bringing in this field of research high levels of interdisciplinary approaches, in order to evaluate adequately also the role of other economic and social factors. For example, when referring to small businesses involved in the tourist industry, {{we are in a}} certain way thinking about tourist <b>destinations</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> by taking into account the policies and the processes related to the local development and the identity of a country. This paper will place a special focus on how much small tourist firms use ICT for their economic activities, as the use of ICT {{is one of the main}} research strands in the field of economic and management innovation. This paper will investigate how the implementation of ICT is able to support the promotion of small tourism businesses. Moreover, it will take into account the level of experience and the skills of the economic agents involved in the research and using the web. A case study of a local tourist destination will be presented based on a qualified dataset showing, and also <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result, a map of the ICT’s implementation. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Local authorities, {{particularly}} coastal municipalities {{are gradually}} incorporating sustainability {{as one of}} the core values to drive the tourism industry forward, in an attempt to be more responsive to current market, environmental and community requirements. Central to this process are the adoption of voluntary initiatives such as environmental guidelines and certification schemes that encourage commitment to change. The Blue Flag Programme, run by the independent non-profit organization Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE), brings a reliable guarantee to tourists regarding the environmental quality of beaches and marinas. Therefore, it serves to encourage local authorities and other tourism stakeholders to constantly enhance the environmental quality of their <b>destinations</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> The Blue Flag works towards sustainable development through strict criteria dealing with water quality, environmental education and information, environmental management, safety and other services at the beach. This study presents the results of work undertaken for a pilot project contracted by ENEA and the University of Bologna, under the patronage of the Foundation for Environmental Education, which had the central aim of conducting research on the role that the Blue Flag award can play, working together with local authorities to build a common conscience, and providing guidance towards sustainable tourism development. The research was performed through a questionnaire, which was sent to all the Blue Flag awarded municipalities across Italy. In future, this method could be extended to all the Blue Flag beaches/marinas around the world.

40|$|In an {{increasingly}} competitive market, {{the issue of}} quality has grown in significance for tourism businesses and destinations alike. This has been influenced {{by a number of}} factors, such as the expansion of consumer rights and the alleged emergence ‘new’, quality conscious tourists.

However, little or no {{attention has been paid to}} the role of tourism industry employees, particularly those in hotels, in the success of quality management programmes. The purpose of this paper is to address this omission.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study on}} {{consumer}} behaviour is popular among all industries, {{and there is}} no exception for the tourism industry. Actually, a comprehensive understanding of tourist behaviours enables the destination marketers and tour operators to exert effective influences on the customers’ pre-purchase, purchase and post-purchase phases,and further promote the <b>destination</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> Chinese outbound tourism industry has a great potential to develop, and grasping this origin market has a great significance for every destination. As the case of UK, it was a relatively new destination for Chinese leisure tourists, and few researches have been conducted on this area. Accordingly, detailed literature reviews on the Chinese outbound tourism market, as well as empirical studies on their behavioural characteristics are thought to be useful for overseas destinations, especially the UK. With a purpose to explore the potential of Chinese outbound travel market, as well as identify their behavioural characteristics in UK, this research utilised both secondary and primary data, and quantitative and qualitative researches are employed together. From a practical perspective, this research contributes overseas destinations in understanding, targeting and marketing the Chinese outbound tourism market. It is hoped that after this research, the value of this market will be noted by destinations, and more effective marketing strategies as well as suitable services will be presented...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable tourism {{development}} is widely accepted <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alternative approach to {{tourism development}} in many countries. However, the sustainable tourism development concept remains problematic, in both definitional and operational terms, attributable {{in part to}} a lack of effective channels for diffusion and communication of the concept to destination stakeholders. As such, this thesis aims to identify, understand, and describe effective communication mechanisms for the dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept, with the aim of facilitating a more effective implementation of it. To achieve this, three important issues are addressed. Firstly, identification of destination stakeholders’ understanding of the sustainable tourism development concept; secondly, determination of the communication channels for diffusing the sustainable tourism development concept; and thirdly, identification of the key actors of the social system for transferring information about sustainable tourism development. In exploring these issues, the thesis is underpinned by diffusion of innovations theory, which constitutes an explanatory framework for considering the findings of 55 in-depth interviews with key tourism stakeholders on Kret Island, Thailand. The findings reveal that sustainable tourism development is considered important for tourism development in the destination; however, the implementation of such principles remains problematic as the term is complex and there is no common understanding of its implementation. In terms of the dimensions of sustainable tourism development, while economic, environmental and socio-cultural as the triple-bottom line aspects are still embedded in the concept, there are four additional dimensions of sustainable tourism development found in Kret Island, Thailand; these are the community integration, education, tourist satisfaction, and regulations dimensions. The findings further reveal that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept occurs through interpersonal as well as media communication, and that while these two types of communication have differing roles to play in disseminating information, there is synergy between them. Key actors in relevant social systems which facilitate dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept to destination stakeholders are change agents; members of social networks and opinion leaders. Each actor has both differing roles and attributes when it comes to transferring information. The findings of this research provide a contribution to knowledge by highlighting that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept is related to aspects and qualities of the concept itself, the communication channels employed in its diffusion, both interpersonal and media, and the relative time of diffusion and adoption within the social system. It also offer some guidelines according to the characteristics of the people involved, the social systems involved and communications channels used for the key stakeholders on the island to develop appropriate communication channels in order to diffuse tourism information regarding sustainable tourism development to other destination stakeholders. Both the contributions and implications of this research have the potential to contribute to better dissemination of information regarding sustainable tourism development to <b>destination</b> stakeholders <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole...</b>|$|R
40|$|Weather {{conditions}} that influence natural resource-based tourist destinations {{are likely to}} be affected by climate change, but our understanding of how businesses and destinations manage for present and future conditions is limited. In this study we report on the relationships between weather and tourism activities in the Queenstown-Lake Wanaka region, South Island, New Zealand. Key stakeholder interviews and a workshop form the empirical basis of this paper. Coping range application ideas derived from ecological management literature are used to develop a framework to understand and inform thinking and strategies around how tourism businesses and destinations are currently responding to the weather and perhaps could in future respond to climate change. Results show that within a destination individual businesses have widely varying relationships with the weather, with each type of activity operating within its own coping range to particular environmental gradients, for example temperature. Coping, which can be observed outside the 'ideal' range of a particular environmental gradient, requires business adjustments so as to cope with increasingly marginal conditions, up to a Critical Stop Point - the ultimate threshold. The data suggest that increased need for adjustments impacts on business viability, and more planned adaptation measures would be necessary to increase viability under increasingly detrimental climatic conditions. Discussion at a destination level workshop indicates that at and beyond thresholds, keystone industry and destination level strategic adaptation planning is required to ensure the viability of the <b>destination</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{changing}} environment the leisure tourist offer of each holder of tourist offer {{and in the}} <b>destination</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> is a critical component in achieving the proper competitive advantage over other carriers and destinations. In recent years, it become increasingly evident that the requirements of travel consumers are increasingly larger and more diverse. In the market of tourist demand there is increasingly growing demand of tourists for specific types of tourism. For a country or destination to be attractive to modern tourists, the development of high quality accommodation, {{a wide range of}} entertainment content and superior service, arises. This paper elaborates the results of a survey on the situation with leisure tourist offer in Ohrid tourist area and performs an analysis of the same. Analysis show that the tourists during their stay in Ohrid are generally satisfied with the leisure offer. But, there is different degree of satisfaction with different types of leisure offer. Based on the analysis in this work are given appropriate conclusions and recommendations to improve the situation with this offer in the Ohrid tourist area. In this connection should be borne in mind that tourism offer should not be static but a dynamic category that constantly need to adapt to increasingly newer and newer demands, desires and needs that occur {{on the side of the}} tourist demand. It is important for tourism offer to adapt to the requirements of leisure demand as a complex (integral) supply of resort or destination. On the degree of the adaptability of tourist offer to specific characteristics of the demand will depend the survival on the tourism market in terms of changing environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} tourism from a {{consumer}} perspective {{occurs when the}} tourist interacts with people, objects, and surroundings before, during and after an experience. However these encounters are not only important for the tourist's value of the experience but it also creates value for the service provider, other tourists, local residents and the <b>destination</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> The value occurs in the co-creation, {{and an understanding of}} this co-creation of value is a key issue in order to develop theory on tourism experiences. The paper presents an example of how a conceptual grid proposed by Eide and Mossberg (2013) can be used to understand co-creation of value in tourism by referring to a case of destination development in Dunga beach, Kisumu, Kenya. The purpose is to understand different degrees of co-creation in tourism offerings and to give implications for how the grid {{can be used as a}} base for developing co-created experiences. The main implications are that the grid visualises the performance of tourism offerings in both a holistic and particular way. By these visualisations it is possible to study and analyse the present state of the tourist offerings as well as to elaborate on movements in the grid to enhance idea generation, which may result in new or improved co-created experiences. Using different types of interactions in the grids reveals for example that the roles of the guides are closely related to and differ depending on the degree of co-creation. In a fully co-created experience, the guides' roles are not only facilitators but as friends on an equal level of knowledge and performance. It also exposes that tourists' interactions with residents are important for mutual understanding, not least in developing countries such as Kenya, where it is seen as important to include local residents in tourism development, from planning to implementation...|$|E

40|$|The {{approach}} to tourism of the European Council has been leaning towards a cultural heritage boost and promotion {{for the last}} few years. Italy is very rich in cultural heritage and both private and public stakeholders are carrying out new and fitted policies in order to develop sustainable tourism through new tourist segments. The Valle del Serchio is a rural area that is facing important changes, such as agricultural multi-functionality and the need to attract more tourists by transforming its resources into points of strength and by diverting the consistent flow of people coming from the nearby popular Versilia coast. This area deserves to become a tourist <b>destination</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> that can fulfil the new trend of experience based tourism: a task that could be achieved by identifying and creating itineraries able to highlight the local peculiarities and involve the tourist by choosing his/her own interests. The aim is to increase the value of nature, agriculture, food and wine and cultural heritage, following the pillars established by the European project NECSTouR regarding sustainability and competitiveness; project tools that can enhance tourist performance and territorial governance. In this way, heritage tourism can drive the flows out of the typical holiday season and stimulate both the innovation and diversification of the supply. This change must be supported by a qualification of the operators {{and the creation of a}} group of local certified businesses improving the system of tourist hospitality and, thereby, its competitiveness.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{the concept of}} destination management with a particular focus on the management of a local destination. It concentrates on seeking to understand what constitutes the general concept of destination management, exploring management practices, and clarifying the overall management of the local destination. In the absence of previous literature, a conceptual framework is developed from the bodies of literature in tourism, management, inter-organizational relationships, and integrated coastal management. This framework illustrates aspects, issues, and dimensions {{that are relevant to}} destination management and provides a structure for the analysis of destination management in Pattaya, Thailand. Given the exploratory nature of the study, a multi-phase case study is used. A mix of holistic and embedded cases is used to obtain broad and in-depth data relevant to the concept and practice of destination management. Pattaya, as one of the major coastal resorts in Thailand, is selected as the case study as tourism has been developed there for several decades and its diverse problems provide a range of management challenges. Its major tourism attractions - beaches, nightlife, Pattaya Music Festival - are examined as embedded cases. In addition to secondary data, semi-structured interviews and observation are used to collect primary data. The broad concept of destination management is developed first and then used as a basis to examine {{the nature and extent of}} destination management in Pattaya. The conceptual framework provides a structure to analyze the individual embedded cases and to compare commonalities and differences between their management processes and structures and their implications for the practice of destination management. The research reveals that there is a relationship between the practitioners' perspectives on a tourism destination and on destination management, and that there is a relationship between their initial perspectives on destination management and their management practices that occur at the destination. Destination management is defined as "the collaboration of relevant agencies responsible for providing multiple tourism products at the destination in a way to achieve common goals or destination goals. " The research also highlights that destination management requires the integration of management agencies, of management purposes, and of management activities at the destination scale. In Pattaya, varying levels of integration occur and relevant agencies are commonly involved with managing aspects of tourism rather than the <b>destination</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> The embedded cases reveal that two main forms of management occur in Pattaya: daily operations and project management. Daily management is practised by single agencies to achieve individual organizational goals and is evident in most aspects of beach management and the management of dispersed nightlife activities. Project-based management involves the pursuit of project goals and is carried out by committees, for example, Walking Street Committee and the Pattaya Music Festival Committees. A lack of common goals and low levels of integration are factors which lead to an absence of destination management. The formulation of destination goals and a scaled-up project management structure is suggested as one means of fostering destination management...|$|E
40|$|The {{conservation}} {{of natural resources}} and wild species is often a "wicked" problem, with multiple interacting elements, non-linear relationships between elements, constant irreversible change, a lack of controls, and no clear resolution. These characteristics necessitate interdisciplinary approaches to generate acceptable solutions, drawing on several traditional disciplines and local knowledge. I used an interdisciplinary approach to study the interface between Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevisrostris) and impoverished human communities that share common space and resources at Chilika Lagoon, India. Chilika, a brackish water lagoon located in the state of Odisha on the east coast of India, spans an area of between 906 and 1, 165 km², depending on the season. The lagoon has been a Ramsar site since 1982, because of its high avifaunal and fish diversity. Its high productivity supports fishing communities living in approximately 150 villages around the lagoon. The lagoon also supports a population of resident Irrawaddy dolphins, which is likely Critically Endangered and declining. This study was conducted in the Outer Channel of the lagoon, which corresponds to the area of highest dolphin density and is used by a large number of both fishers and dolphin-watching tourist operators. The specific aims of my thesis were to investigate: a. The nature and drivers of fisher attitudes and perceptions towards Irrawaddy dolphins; b. The fine-scale behavioural adaptations of the dolphins to fishing gear, and hence to the presence of fishers; c. The social sustainability of the dolphin-watching tourism industry; d. The value of the dolphin-watching tourism industry using economic substitution, {{and the extent to which}} local and regional stakeholders depend on dolphin-watching tourism in the lagoon. I investigated the attitudes and perceptions of fishers towards the dolphins and the drivers of these perceptions. I surveyed fishers across 30 fishing communities located around the study area. To validate the drivers of fisher perceptions, I: (1) observed dolphin foraging behaviour at "stake nets", and (2) compared catch per unit effort (CPUE) and catch income of fishers from stake nets in the presence and absence of foraging dolphins. I found that the fishers' attitudes were mostly positive towards dolphins, and that most fishers, particularly traditional fishers believed that dolphins augmented their fish catch. Foraging dolphins were observed spending about half their time at stake nets. Although foraging dolphins were not associated with a higher overall fish catch at stake nets, they were associated with a significantly higher catch income and CPUE of mullet (Liza sp.), a locally preferred food fish species. These results indicate that positive perceptions of fishers towards dolphins were likely because fishers associated the dolphins with higher fish catches and income. To further understand the adaptations of the dolphins to the presence of fishers, I studied the fine-scale behaviour of dolphins at "stake nets"; the most commonly used fishing gear within my study area. I conducted boat-based surveys of dolphin behaviour both at stake nets and in open waters. I found that dolphin mothers with offspring and lone immature individuals barrierforaged at stake nets most frequently, showing evidence that critical dolphin life stages are likely to be reliant on nets and hence fishers. Stake nets date back about 25 years, indicating that the dolphins of Chilika exhibit behavioural plasticity, and have learned to exploit these nets within one generation. I used tourist visitation numbers, satisfaction, preferences, perceptions and tourist specialisation as indicators of the social sustainability of dolphin-watching tourism at Chilika. My approach included participant observation, a survey instrument to ascertain information from dolphinwatching tourists conducted on tourists and secondary data on tourist visitation numbers. My results suggest that dolphin-watching tourism at Chilika Lagoon is socially unsustainable. The rate in increase of tourists in the study site is beginning to decline. Tourists are mostly novices and were dissatisfied with their dolphin-watching experience. Satisfaction levels were positively influenced by boat-driver encounter management and the number of dolphins sighted. Tourist preferences and perceptions pointed out useful insights, but also reflected the demands of a novice tourist demographic. Participant observation and tourist perceptions highlighted the important issues in the way in which the industry is conducted and managed. To understand the value of the dolphin-watching industry at Chilika, and the extent to which local and regional stakeholders depended on the industry, I used economic substitution between dolphin-watching tourism and neighbouring tourist attractions in the destination of Odisha. The valuation of wildlife tourism is often used to justify wildlife conservation through the potential of such tourism to support human livelihoods. This value is crucially dependent on the degree to which a target species can be economically "substituted" by other local attractions, so that tourist expenditures that are "attributable" to the target species can be established. Previous wildlife tourism evaluations have not considered the effect of economic substitution across multiple spatially connected tourist attractions within a destination region, and their resultant impact on the accurate economic value of the industry. I addressed this gap by estimating economic substitution between dolphin-watching tourism at Chilika and other tourist attractions in a destination. Using surveys and government visitation numbers, I found that dolphinwatching at Chilika Lagoon was "partially substituted" by neighbouring attractions in the destination of Odisha (India). The total number of days attributable to dolphin-watching was 0. 34 locally, - 0. 13 at neighbouring sites, and 0. 21 in the <b>destination</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> Hence the total expenditure attributable to dolphin-watching was approximately US 1. 4 million locally, US- 0. 4 million at neighbouring sites and US 1 million in the <b>destination</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> If dolphins are extirpated, local stakeholders and the destination stand to lose, but neighbouring tourism stakeholders are likely to gain. Understanding local and destination-level substitution of wildlife tourism is necessary to estimate, (1) the true value of wildlife tourism and (2) which stakeholders to target through management interventions. This multidisciplinary approach enabled me to focus on the interface between Irrawaddy dolphins and human communities at Chilika Lagoon, and gain a better understanding of how to inform the conservation and management of the dolphins in a seascape dominated by humans. My thesis has led to the following conservation recommendations: a. Efforts to conserve the Irrawaddy dolphins should, where possible, use positive local perceptions and cultural values to build a constituency for conservation. b. Critical life stages of Irrawaddy dolphins are likely reliant on barrier-foraging at stake nets and hence on fishers. Excluding fishers from Chilika or banning the stake net fishery may have negative consequences for the dolphins. c. Dolphin-watching tourism at Chilika Lagoon is socially unsustainable. A social-ecological approach to management that integrates dolphin-watching tourism and dolphin conservation should be a priority. d. Dolphin-watching tourism is an important industry for local and regional livelihoods, and can be used to justify wildlife conservation to managers and policy makers. The local and regional value of dolphin-watching tourism using economic substitution can potentially be used in conservation planning. Taken together, the findings of my thesis can be used to identify areas of conservation opportunity both for Irrawaddy dolphins at Chilika and for wildlife management in human dominated landscapes more generically...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} an ongoing debate {{regarding}} the r. elationship between spa tourism and health tourism among industry professionals and researchers from various disciplines. In general, spa tourism is viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sub-segment of the broader category of 'health tourism'. Health tourism {{on a global scale}} is widely viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> broad segment of the tourism industry. Given the growing interest worldwide in spas, the outlook for spa tourism is very promising; there is considerable scope for future research in the spa industry as shown by the dearth of the literature available. However, {{there is a sense of}} uncertainty regarding the classification of this segment that makes forecasting problematic. The literature findings were drawn together to identify key issues in order to establish a platform for the primary research data collection. As a consequence of examining the literature review, key issues were identified relating to the nature and significance of spa tourism (aim 1) : such as the debate surrounding the classification of spas, and ultimately the definition of spas; the significance of spas to health tourism and to tourism <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> in particular the significance of spas in an ever increasingly health-conscious society. Issues relating to the characteristics of spa goers were identified (aim 2), which are examined within the destination choice process (aim 3) : such as reasons behind the visit to a spa; factors affecting the choice of one spa destination over another; and the spa holiday experience and feedbacks. In collecting the primary data, a qualitative study was conducted, with the aim to clarify and investigate the apparent gaps and key issues in the literature. This was undertaken to provide a greater level of insight into the field of spa tourism and to answer the research aims. This required developing a framework that was divided into three dimensions based on the key issues raised in the literature, and in relation to the destination facility choice process. This PhD study demonstrated how these three dimensions were used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> guide for the questions asked in the research interviews. These dimensions helped to provide a structured analysis of the results and established the initial platfonn for the classification of spa goers (aim 4). Spa goers' needs, beliefs, behaviours, what makes them participate in <b>a</b> spa-related tourism, <b>as</b> well as spa managers' and experts' perceptions were established. Semi-structured interviews were the most appropriate primary research tools, as the opportunity for tourists and managers to put forward their perspective were available. Given the relatively small number of interviews, the non-use of computer programs were quite justifiable; especially when adopting an interpretive approach and the desire to have the flexibility of human understanding and explanation of the material. To aid the data analysis, coding was used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> appropriate analytical tool that resulted in developing 10 types of spa goers based on the three dimensional framework. The emergence of these types offered further insight into whether they could be simplified into more broad types of spa goers by combining their shared interests. The results were further funnelled and a 4 type broad typology of spa goers was constructed. The findings of the rescarch~were consistent with many of the issucs raised in the literature review findings. This research study has added a ~iunificant amount of new infom 1 ation to contribute to the e:<i~ting knowl~dge base. Tl~e broad typology offcrs significant advancements from eXlstmg typologies in the field. Its significance lies in its consideration of the spa <b>destination</b> choice process <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> rather than <b>a</b> heavy emphasis being placed merely on the reasons people visit spas, which has dominated many of the previous spa typologies. During the qualitative research crucial issues emerged in relation to the spa destination choice process, the importance of understanding spa goers' cultural backgrounds and traditions proved to be of ureat significange. Some of the infonnants expressed the need for particular facilities''and treatments to be available to them, so that the specific needs of their cultural backgrounds could be met. It is important for spas to be aware of this cultural diversity in an ever increasing globalisation of the world, if they are to retain market strength, and increase their customer base. The current study made a contribution towards fillipg the gaps in existing spa tourism literature. It has added valuable infonnation to that which we already know, and allows for an evaluation to be made of the overall process. Any issues which proved to be outside the scope of this study. would eventually provide insight into some potential avenues future research could take. There is considerable scope for future research in the spa industry as shown by the dearth of the literature available. Further research should be encouraged into the specific needs of different types of spa goers. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
