Contrasting the city's high-tech facilities and fashionable neighborhoods with its sprawling slums and their struggling inhabitants, the program outlines the relationship between foreign investment and the worldwide need for cheap labor, which Mexico and its indigenous peoples readily supply. Glimpses into a tech-savvy youth culture and the persistent Zapatista movement reinforce the capital's nickname: City of Contrasts. (26 minutes...|$|R

40|$|A whistle-blowers {{account of}} the chaos that is urban {{development}} Slumming India is a chronicle of our times, offering {{a glimpse into the}} story of the slumming of our cities. The author explores the fundamental question of <b>how,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> largest democracy, a large and growing section of the urban population is less equal and not faring well. Written with rare honesty by one who has been part of The System, the book dwells on the underlying processes through which so many urbanites have been marginalized as slum-walas, forced to live on pavements or in jhuggi clusters, and how a small number of urban development-walas are letting our cities slowly die...|$|R

Our results suggest that the dominant landed elite tends to be unresponsive to the underlying poverty rate while the capitalist elite respond to the poverty rate by increasing the share of education spending. After controlling for all other factors, presence of the minority elite has a limited impact, if at all. Results are robust to alternative specifications...|$|R

50|$|In this context, New Realism {{presents}} itself {{primarily as a}} negative realism: the resistance that <b>the</b> outside <b>world</b> opposes to our conceptual schemes should {{not be seen as}} a failure, but as a resource - a proof of the existence of an independent world. If this is the case, however, this negative realism turns into a positive realism: in resisting us reality does not merely set a limit we cannot trespass, but it also offers opportunities and resources. This explains <b>how,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>world,</b> different life-forms can interact <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same environment without sharing any conceptual scheme and <b>how,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> social <b>world,</b> human intentions and behaviors are made possible by a reality that is first given, and that only at a later time may be interpreted and, if necessary, transformed. Now that the season of postmodernism has died out, New Realism expresses the widespread need for renewal in extra-disciplinary areas such as architecture, literature, pedagogy and medicine.|$|R

50|$|For new realism, the {{assumption}} that science is not systematically the ultimate measure of truth and reality {{does not mean that}} we should abandon the notions of reality, truth or objectivity, as was posited by much twentieth century philosophy. Rather, it means that philosophy, as well as jurisprudence, linguistics or history, has something important and true to say about <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>In</b> this context, new realism presents itself primarily as a negative realism: the resistance that <b>the</b> outside <b>world</b> opposes to our conceptual schemes should not be seen as a failure, but as a resource - a proof of the existence of an independent world.
