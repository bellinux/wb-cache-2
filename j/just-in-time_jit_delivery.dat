30|$|Freight is {{directed}} to receivers, who could be commercial activities or end consumers. Regarding freight directed to commercial activities, its transport depends on the production system. The increasing value of delivered products requires rapid transportation because companies want to reduce the interest costs bound up in store and inventories. There {{is the need to}} reduce store costs since store areas in urban centers are expensive. This leads to the <b>Just-In-Time</b> (<b>JIT)</b> <b>delivery</b> principle, which involves more frequent delivery of materials at the right time and at the right place in the production process.|$|E
40|$|Flexible Assembly Systems (FASs) are {{normally}} {{associated with the}} automatic, or robotic, assembly of products, supported by automated material handling systems. However, manual assembly operations are still prevalent within many industries, where the complexity and variety of products prohibit the development of suitable automated assembly equipment. This article presents a generic model for incorporating flexibility into the design and control of assembly operations concerned with high variety/low volume manufacture, drawing on the principles for Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) and <b>Just-in-Time</b> (<b>JIT)</b> <b>delivery.</b> It is based on work being undertaken in an electronics company where the assembly operations have been overhauled and restructured {{in response to a}} need for greater flexibility, shorter cycle times and reduced inventory levels. The principles employed are in themselves not original. However, the way they have been combined and tailored has created a total manufacturing control system which represents a new concept for responding to demands placed on market driven firms operating in an uncertain environment...|$|E
40|$|Although {{construction}} waste occurs during the actual construction activities, {{there is an}} understanding that it is caused by activities and actions at design, materials procurement and construction stages of project delivery processes. This study investigates the material procurement and logistics measures for mitigating waste generated by construction activities. In a bid to explore the phenomenon {{from the perspectives of}} experts from the construction industry, this study used a combination of descriptive interpretive research and survey approach as its methodological framework. The study suggests that four features characterised waste efficient logistic and procurement process. These include suppliers' commitment to low waste measures, low waste purchase management, effective materials delivery management and waste efficient Bill of Quantity. In addition, the key requisite strategies for mitigating {{construction waste}} through materials procurement include commitment to take back scheme, procurement of waste efficient materials/technology and use of minimal packaging. The use of <b>Just-in-Time</b> (<b>JIT)</b> <b>delivery</b> system and prevention of over ordering are also important for mitigating waste through materials procurement processes. These implies that while the key measures are critical success factors for reducing waste through procurement process, the four established features are required of all procurement process. Measures through which the procurement process could enhance waste efficiency are further highlighted and discussed in the paper. Findings of this study could assist in understanding a set of measures that should be taken during materials procurement process, thereby corroborating waste management practices at design and construction stages of project delivery process...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the situation of}} a supplier plant whose customer plants desire <b>just-in-time</b> (<b>JIT)</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Randomness in both the production and demand processes make satisfying every demand that might occur in true JIT fashion impossible. Therefore, supplier plants typically negotiate bounds on JIT contracts with their customers. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} use of "quotas" or "target inventory levels" as a mechanism for establishing such bounds. That is, the supplier firm is responsible for meeting periodic demands up to the quota, but not beyond. In this paper, we {{consider the}} problem of setting an appropriate quota {{from the perspective of the}} supplier plant and interpret our results in the context of the negotiation process between the supplier and its customers. Under the assumption that "safety capacity" (i. e., overtime or a vendoring option) is available, we develop two models that address this problem. The first model assumes that quota shortfalls cannot be carried over to the next regular time production period and are made up with overtime/vendoring, which incurs fixed plus variable costs. The second model assumes that shortages can be backlogged to the next regular time production period at a cost. We use numerical examples to demonstrate how the models we developed were used by a clutch supplier to a large auto manufacturer to negotiate its JIT contracts. pull systems, just-in-time, production control, supply chain management...|$|R
50|$|Urban freight {{distribution}} {{also involves}} transportation from freight generating facilities such as seaports, airports, railyards, manufacturing facilities, and warehouse/distribution centers, {{many of which}} are located in urban areas and utilize an urban region's roadway and railway network to transport goods. In addition, many companies today use sophisticated computerized logistics systems to manage their supply chains and employ <b>just-in-time</b> (<b>JIT)</b> manufacturing and <b>delivery</b> to minimize inventory and expenses. While JIT can significantly reduce production costs, it also requires efficient and reliable transportation systems, both within and between urban regions, to be effective.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the rationale and the fundamental elements and algorithms of a reliability engineering methodology, and discusses {{its application to}} the design of a large, multi-cell and heterogeneous production system with <b>just-in-time</b> (<b>JIT)</b> <b>deliveries.</b> The failure analysis and the non-reliability costs assessment of such systems is a complex task. In order to cope with such complexity, a two level hierarchical modelling and evaluation framework was developed. According to this framework, the internal behaviour of each manufacturing cell and the overall flow of materials are described, respectively, by local and global models. Local models are firstly obtained from the failure and repair processes of the manufacturing equipment. Then, these models are combined with the failure propagation delays introduced by the work-in-process buffers in order to obtain the system level model. The second part of the paper addresses several design issues of the production system that directly impact the reliability of the deliveries, such as the layout of the plant, the redundancy of the manufacturing equipment and the capacity of the work-in-process buffers. A distinctive feature of the reliability evaluation algorithm resides on the ability to deal with reliability models containing stochastic processes with generalized distributions. This fundamental requirement {{comes from the fact that}} repair and failure propagation processes typically present hyper-exponential distributions, e. g., lognormal distributions, that can’t be assessed using the conventional reliability techniques. The paper will also explain how the behavioural and structural characteristics of JIT production systems were explored in order to implement effective evaluation algorithms that fit the requirements of this class of systems...|$|R
40|$|Today‘s {{customers}} expect zero defects with <b>just-in-time</b> (<b>JIT)</b> <b>delivery</b> {{from their}} suppliers, for the specified quantities, {{as a matter}} of standard practice. More importantly, customers expect companies to help them know what they need in terms of quantities and quality now, and for the future. No other change process adds long-term value as quickly as zero defects. Companies failing to embrace this quality culture face difficult challenges. To achieve this level of performance requires tremendous focus in an organisation and throughout its supply base. Business models around the world are changing dramatically from the "Source Local" to the "Source Anywhere and Build Anywhere" model (Cummins, 2008 : 19). Companies have shifted away from a hierarchical, one-dimensional, supply chain entity to a fragmented network in favor of strategic partnerships with external entities. Many businesses facing such models are experiencing challenges and, if not managed correctly, can find themselves struggling to compete in this new landscape. Thus, when price concessions are so stringent, quality has to suffer. To reduce costs, suppliers are forced to seek less expensive ways to produce parts and components. Does this mean the use of different, less expensive materials? Does this mean less skilled labor? Does this mean production shortcuts? Or does this mean that suppliers just bite the bullet and pay the price? Once all the costs have been extracted from the supply chain, the only thing left to suffer is quality. The underlying objective of this research is to investigate the impact of delivery performance for a selected part at General Motors South Africa. In order to develop a research strategy to deal with, and solve, the main problem, the following research questions have been identified: a) What can be learned from literature about the impact of quality costs? b) Why is this specific part a suitable candidate for a cost investigation? c) What are the processes involved if a defect occurs? d) How can the cost be estimated? e) What effect does poor supplier quality have on productivity? This dissertation aims to investigate the problems and challenges General Motors South Africa are facing pertaining to the delivery performance of a selected part. The dissertation will also strive to highlight the impact of poor supplier quality on productivity and the related cost implications. Conclusions and recommendations will furthermore be outlined...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the concept of lean supply chain, and develop a list of performance measures for manufacturing small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in the automotive industry. A total number of 28 performance measures were identified to represent the leanness of supply chain. Data were collected from 133 supply chain practitioners working at manufacturing SMEs in Iran's automotive industry. Lean supply chain performance was divided into four components (attributes), i. e. waste elimination, continuous improvement, <b>just-in-time</b> (<b>JIT),</b> and flexibility. <b>Delivery</b> & reliability (D&R) was selected as a representative for JIT. Flexibility was directly connected to the measures without any division.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} that new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been {{changing the way}} by which firms conduct their businesses. Examples are the application of enterprise resources planning (ERP) and business process reengineering (BPR) {{to increase the efficiency}} of internal resources management, adoption of Business-to-Business e-commerce (B 2 B e-com) to integrate supply chain, and invention of new marketing channels such as Business-to-Customer (B 2 C) e-com. These new ways of conducting businesses are believed to help firms to reduce transaction costs and increase productivity. As a result, new ICTs have {{played an important role in}} recent growth of many small firms into multi-functional and multi-product corporations and in their spatial expansion towards internationalization as well. This paper takes Haier in China as a case to study the role of new ICTs in the growth of firms and reveal how the new technologies have facilitated the expansion of Haier into a transnational corporation (TNC) by examining the internationalization process of the firm in relation to its adoption of new ICTs in the period from 1990 to 2002. The study reveals that the adoption of new ICTs has helped Haier to integrate its functional units located in dozens of places across the world, which is essential to the internationalization of a firm, and to link closely together its worldwide suppliers and customers to achieve <b>just-in-time</b> (<b>JIT)</b> production and <b>delivery.</b> As such, the authors of the paper argue that, without the facilitation of new ICTs, Haier could not have developed into a TN...|$|R

During the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, the common answer of this question in western countries was to accept a small but allowable amount of poor quality in outgoing manufactured goods.

40|$|The 1990 's were {{a time of}} {{downsizing}} and consolidation {{for much of the}} defense aerospace industry. Many defense contractors sought to integrate lean manufacturing principles and techniques into their business, as a means of becoming more cost-competitive in bidding for a shrinking defense budget, and to enable moves into commercial product lines. UTC-Sikorsky Aircraft Company began a series of restructuring and re-engineering initiatives in the late 1990 's aimed at addressing these issues. This internship focused on cost reduction in Sikorsky's main product line - the UH- 60 Blackhawk helicopter. The final assembly line for the UH- 60 was subject to cost and schedule overruns, along with high inventory levels. The assembly line was also characterized by a high degree of variability, and a major source of variability was believed to be the lack of a defined and repeatable sequence for the installations that comprise final ass~mbly. The introduction of an optimized assembly sequence, and subsequent adoption for daily use by shop floor personnel, was expected to reduce variability and improve performance. The use of a sequence itself was expected to produce the following benefits: 1. Provide a significant improvement in the use of visual tools for line management. 2. Help capture valuable information about installations from workers, and then transfer this knowledge to management, planners, and new workers as personnel are rotated through the factory. 3. Enable significant inventory reduction through introduction of a <b>just-in-time</b> (<b>JIT)</b> material <b>delivery</b> methodology, by linking material delivery to the order in which it is consumed. Implementation was expected to aid in identifying the shortcomings and limitations of the systems that have prevented the use of a sequencing methodology in the past. More importantly, it would elevate the importance of addressing and solving these issues as a means to achieve company-wide goals for cost and inventory reduction. Through implementation of this sequence, key issues were identified: [...] JIT inventory levels are difficult to achieve in a large, complex aerospace assembly process, [...] The manufacturing system, along with systems and processes which support it, must be capable of supporting JIT prior to implementation (and may need to be redesigned to do so), and [...] Process re-engineering to support JIT is best accomplished through a combination of top-down and bottom-up change processes. by James Aaron Wolters, II.
