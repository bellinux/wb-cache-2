40|$|In recent years, <b>driver</b> <b>drowsiness</b> and {{distraction}} {{have been}} important factors in {{a large number of}} accidents because they reduce driver perception level and decision making capability, which negatively affect the ability to control the vehicle. One way to reduce these kinds of accidents would be through monitoring driver and driving behavior and alerting the driver when they are drowsy or in a distracted state. In addition, if it were possible to predict unsafe driving behavior in advance, this would also contribute to safe driving. In this paper, we will discuss various monitoring methods for driver and driving behavior as well as for predicting unsafe driving behaviors. In respect to measurement methods of <b>driver</b> <b>drowsiness,</b> we discussed visual and non-visual features of driver behavior, as well as driving performance behaviors related to vehicle-based features. Visual feature measurements such as eye related measurements, yawning detection, facial expression are discussed in detail. As for non-visual features, we explore various physiological signals and possible <b>drowsiness</b> <b>detection</b> methods that use these signals. As for vehicle-based features, we describe steering wheel movement and the standard deviation of lateral position. To detect driver distraction, we describe head pose and gaze direction methods. To predict unsafe driving behavior, we explain predicting methods based on facial expressions and car dynamics. Finally, we discuss several issues to be tackled for active driver safety systems.

40|$|The {{development}} of technologies for preventing drowsiness at the wheel is a major challenge {{in the field of}} accident avoidance systems. Preventing drowsiness during driving requires a method for accurately detecting a decline in driver alertness and a method for alerting and refreshing the driver. As a detection method, the authors have developed a system that uses image processing technology to analyse images of the road lane with a video camera integrated with steering wheel angle data collection from a car simulation system. The main contribution of this study is a novel algorithm for <b>drowsiness</b> <b>detection</b> and tracking, which is based on the incorporation of information from a road vision system and vehicle performance parameters. Refinement of the algorithm is more precisely detected the level of drowsiness by the implementation of a support vector machine classification for robust and accurate drowsiness warning system. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification technique diminished drowsiness level by using non intrusive systems, using standard equipment sensors, aim to reduce these road accidents caused by <b>drowsiness</b> <b>drivers.</b> This <b>detection</b> system provides a non-contact technique for judging various levels of driver alertness and facilitates early detection of a decline in alertness during driving.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) signal, which reflects the brain activities, is more directly related to drowsiness. Thus, many Brain-Machine-Interface (BMI) systems have been proposed to detect <b>driver</b> <b>drowsiness.</b> However, detecting <b>driver</b> <b>drowsiness</b> at its early stage poses a major practical hurdle when using existing BMI systems. This study proposes a context-aware BMI system aimed to detect <b>driver</b> <b>drowsiness</b> at its early stage by enriching the EEG data with the intensity of head-movements. The proposed system is carefully designed for low-power consumption with on-chip feature extraction and low energy Bluetooth connection. Also, the proposed system is implemented using JAVA programming language as a mobile application for on-line analysis.
