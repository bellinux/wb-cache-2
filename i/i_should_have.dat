5|$|These were {{difficulties}} {{which seemed}} rather {{to require the}} superior force of a Wycherley, or a Congreve, than of a raw and unexperienced pen; for I believe I may boast that none ever appeared so early upon the stage. However, such was the candour of the audience, the play was received with greater satisfaction than <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> promised myself from its merit, had it even preceded the Provoked Husband.|$|E
5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have,</b> I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{had four}} years {{more of your}} heart than I can ever <b>have</b> now. Then <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> wasted my time as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done--I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had so much longer happiness!" ...|$|R
25|$|Given {{the uneven}} {{relation}} of forces I am {{of the opinion}} that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to sacrifice myself sooner or later. I have closed out my private life and am determined to carry out the assignment given to me honourably, one way or another.|$|E
25|$|I fear both {{death and}} the act of dying that lies ahead of us. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> liked to finish my account of working for Arthur – a story which began when our paths {{happened}} to cross in 1949. However, I cannot live without Arthur, despite certain inner resources.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{liked to}} have been there if only to have got up and said, 'If Mr. G's Home Rule Bill had been passed 30 years ago could Ireland have been worse than now? Would it have not been better?' And then fallen dead like Lord Chatham.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} cannot help it, and I am wrong to taunt you. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> taunted you. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> only <b>have</b> said that I will not endure the {{suspicion}} either of a Christian or of a Jew." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> been happy, Beric, if she {{had died}} in the arena. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> always <b>have</b> had it before my eyes--I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> dreamt of it. But {{why do you say that}} until today you have been almost a slave? Why is it {{different}} today?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{enough of}} 'em {{to form a}} goodish {{overcoat}} a'most," [...] said the Slogger with a critical grin, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>'ave</b> thought 'em not sufficiently waterproof in wet weather." ...|$|R
25|$|My {{sister was}} slim and {{beautiful}} and friendly, and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E
25|$|To these Three Kings I mainly owe {{the happy}} Christmas seasons of my {{childhood}} and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> remained very grateful to them. Instead, I came to America and soon forgot all about them, for here at Christmas time one sees so many Santa Clauses scattered all over town. Then there is the big Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza, the elaborate toy windows on Fifth Avenue, the one-hundred-voice choir in Grand Central Station, the innumerable Christmas carols on radio and television—and all these things made me forget the three dear old Kings of my old childhood.|$|E
6000|$|... "But then <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be worse," [...] ses Bill. [...] "I want cheerful {{company when}} I’m like that. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> very likely come ’ome and ’arf kill you {{all in your}} beds. You don’t ’arf know what I’m like.

60|$|He kissed 'is dirty paw--which is {{more than}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>'ave</b> liked to 'ave done it if it 'ad been mine--and waved it, and the gal turned round and shook her 'ead at 'im.|$|R
500|$|As Altgens {{set up for}} {{a second}} {{photograph}} along Elm Street, he heard a sound that he recognized as gunfire, {{and saw that the}} President had been struck in the head. Altgens later wrote that his camera was focused and ready, [...] "but when JFK's head exploded, sending substance in my direction, I virtually became paralyzed.... Yet, many news people say <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> taken the picture anyway... <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> made the picture that I was set up to make. And I didn't do it." ...|$|E

500|$|Gingrich {{received}} deferments {{from the}} military {{during the years of}} the Vietnam War for being a student and a father. [...] In 1985, he stated, [...] "Given everything I believe in, a large part of me thinks <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> gone over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>'ave</b> such a thing, upon my word I don't. I've never 'ad a day's illness in my life. You've only {{got to look}} at me to know that." ...|$|R
6000|$|GLORIA. I {{have only}} this to say. You dragged {{me down to}} your level for a moment this afternoon. Do you think, if that had ever {{happened}} before, that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> been on my guard---that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> known what was coming, and known my own miserable weakness? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very much}} obliged to you, Mr. Wilson, but I {{would much rather}} not have had them. If the tiger hadn't been a man eater <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> minded, but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> worn as an {{ornament}} claws that had killed lots of people--women and children too." ...|$|R
500|$|In addition, I {{had fallen}} to some extent, not as much perhaps as did some other foreigners, for the [...] "agrarian reformer" [...] guff. [...] <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> known better than this, {{particularly}} since the Chinese Communists themselves never at any time made claim to being anything but revolutionaries – period.|$|E
500|$|Scurvy curs! {{they were}} my abhorrence; <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> liked {{nothing better than to}} have been the death of every one of them. In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent to it. He heard me very patiently; but when I had finished, shook his head, and told me, in confidence, that they were [...] "taboo".|$|E
500|$|... "If you bind {{me so that}} I am {{unable to}} release myself, then you will be {{standing}} by {{in such a way}} that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to wait a long time before I got any help from you. I am reluctant to have this band put on me. But rather than that you question my courage, let someone put his hand in my mouth as a pledge that this is done in good faith." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why didn't she {{advertise}} for me?" [...] said Mr. Davis, {{raising his}} voice. [...] "That's what I want to know. Advertisements is cheap enough; why didn't she advertise? <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>'ave</b> come at once if she'd {{said anything about}} money." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{did not see}} why {{he should}} shake it; it had not done {{anything}} to him. Besides, if it wanted shaking, I was the proper person to shake it. I felt much as <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>had</b> he started whacking my dog.|$|R
500|$|However, Test cricket {{had always}} been fought fiercely, and the {{ruthless}} Bradman {{was not about to}} change this. The Australian skipper repeatedly shut England out of the game with massive totals, relentlessly snuffing out any prospects of an opposition win rather than maximising the chances of an Australian victory with enterprising declarations. On reflection, Miller said [...] "It was inevitable that The Don and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> clashed. Our temperaments are so different." ...|$|E
500|$|Captain Sir Edward Hulse {{reported}} how {{the first}} interpreter he met from the German lines was from Suffolk {{where he had}} left his girlfriend and a 3.5hp motorcycle. Hulse went on to describe a sing-song which [...] "ended up with 'Auld lang syne' which we all, English, Scots, Irish, Prussians, Württenbergers, etc, joined in. It was absolutely astounding, and if I had seen it on a cinematograph film <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> sworn that it was faked!" ...|$|E
500|$|Love in Several Masques was [...] "neither {{a success}} nor a fiasco", and Fielding {{writes in the}} preface, [...] "the Play was {{received}} with greater Satisfaction than <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> promised myself from its Merit". The play was later quoted in The Beauties of Fielding {{more than any of}} Fielding's other plays, according to Thomas Lockwood, [...] "because for anthology reading purposes it supplied far more extractably witty bits than other Fielding plays more representative or still holding the stage." ...|$|E
