50|$|During May, Vestal went {{to general}} {{quarters}} 59 times as Japanese planes made suicide {{attacks on the}} ships engaged in the bitter Okinawa campaign. Experience proved that the best defense against the suiciders was a smoke or fog screen produced by all ships that blended into one gigantic mass of low-hanging clouds. For that purpose, Vestal had two boats equipped with <b>fog</b> <b>generators</b> and several barrels of oil. Besides the <b>fog</b> <b>generators,</b> smoke pots would be thrown over {{the bow of the}} ship to emit a dense, white, sickly-smelling smoke for about 15 minutes apiece. Besides the danger posed by suiciders, deck sentries kept a sharp lookout for any enemy who might attempt to swim out to the ships with mines or explosive charges.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{second year}} {{results from a}} multi-year research project that involves a systematic investigation of ship air wakes using an instrumented United States Naval Academy (USNA) YP (Patrol Craft, Training). The objective is to validate and improve Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools that will be useful in determining ship air wake impact on naval rotary wing vehicles. This project is funded by the Office of Naval Research and includes extensive coordination with Naval Air Systems Command. Currently, ship launch and recovery wind limits and envelopes for helicopters are primarily determined through at-sea in situ flight testing that is expensive and frequently difficult to schedule and complete. The time consuming and potentially risky flight testing is required, in part, because computational tools are not mature enough to adequately predict air flow and wake data {{in the lee of}} a ship with a complex superstructure. The top-side configuration of USNA YPs {{is similar to that of}} a destroyer or cruiser, and their size (length of 108 ft and above waterline height of 24 ft) allows for collection of air wake data that is in the same order of magnitude as that of modern naval warships, an important consideration in aerodynamic modeling. A dedicated YP has been modified to add a flight deck and hangar structure to produce an air wake similar to that on a modern destroyer. Three axis acoustic anemometers, <b>fog</b> <b>generators</b> and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) have been installed. Repeated testing on the modified YP is being conducted in the Chesapeake Bay...|$|R
50|$|A fog machine, <b>fog</b> <b>generator,</b> or smoke {{machine is}} {{a device that}} emits a dense vapor that appears similar to fog or smoke. This {{artificial}} fog is most commonly used in professional entertainment applications, but smaller, more affordable fog machines are becoming common for personal use. Fog machines {{can also be found}} in use in a variety of industrial, training, and some military applications. Typically, fog is created by vaporizing proprietary water and glycol-based or glycerin-based fluids or through the atomization of mineral oil. This fluid (often referred to colloquially as fog juice) vaporizes or atomizes inside the fog machine. Upon exiting the fog machine and mixing with cooler outside air the vapor condenses, resulting in a thick visible fog.|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} for quantifying population dynamics and food source value of insect fauna in areas subjected to fog oil smoke was developed. Our approach employed an environmentally controlled re-circulating wind tunnel {{outfitted with a}} high-heat vaporization and re-condensation <b>fog</b> oil <b>generator</b> that {{has been shown to}} produce aerosols of comparable chemistry and droplet-size distribution as those of field releases of the smoke. This method provides reproducible exposures of insects under realistic climatic and environmental conditions to fog oil aerosols that duplicate chemical and droplet-size characteristics of field releases of the smoke. The responses measured take into account reduction in food sources due to death and to changes in availability of relevant life stages of insects that form the prey base for the listed Threatened and Endangered Species. The influence of key environmental factors, wind speed and canopy structure on these responses were characterized. Data generated using this method was used to develop response functions related to particle size, concentration, wind speed, and canopy structure that will allow military personnel to assess and manage impacts to endangered species from fog oil smoke used in military training...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To detect an {{association}} between the sudden epidemic with respiratory symptoms, and fogging with dichlorovos in Jaipur town {{and to find out}} probable mechanism of causation of the epidemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this community based study of the epidemic, house to house survey of households selected using systematic random sampling was carried out. The incidence in the exposed and unexposed population, the relative risk and attributable risk were calculated. RESULTS: The incidence of cases was high (58. 9 &#x 0025;) in subjects present on roads at the time of fogging as compared to in those who were inside rooms of the houses (5. 4 &#x 0025;) and in those who were not in the locality at that time (1. 8 &#x 0025;) [Relative Risk (RR) = 32. 7 and Attributable Risk (AR) = 96. 9 &#x 0025;]. CONCLUSION: High RR and AR in the present epidemic indicate strong association between fogging and occurrence of symptoms. In absence of signs and symptoms of organophosphorus poisoning it suggests that this could have been due to an inappropriate solvent or defective functioning of <b>fog</b> <b>generator,</b> leading to generation of an unusual dark fog, that might have irritated eyes and respiratory tract of exposed residents...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An optical {{method to}} {{determine}} a speed of sound (or ultrasound) in water was described in this work. The measuring system composes of ultrasonic transducer, glass water bath, He-Ne laser source, lens, and screen. An ultrasound <b>fog</b> <b>generator</b> used for producing an ultrasound with a frequency f of 1. 74 MHz was immersed in DI water. It was fixed at one side of water bath. When the sound wave travels in water {{along the length of}} water bath, a standing wave is obtained from the interference of the incidence wave and the wave reflected from the opposite side of water bath. The node and antinode of the standing wave act as an opaque and transparent medium. As a He-Ne laser beam with a wavelength of 632. 8 nm travelled to a convex lens with a focal length of 5 cm and diverged through the sound field, an enlarged standing wave pattern was shown on a white screen. The wavelength of sound wave λ was obtained using geometry (similar triangle). Therefore, the speed of ultrasound in water was calculated by v = fλ. In this work, the water temperature was varied in a range of 15 - 39 °C. The results showed that the speed of sound increased with increasing the water temperature. The percentage error was below 2. 8. This proposed method can be used for demonstrating physics principles such as waves and optics for high school students and undergraduates...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a highly-detailed experimental {{characterization of the}} impulsively driven Rayleigh-Taylor instability, called the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. This instability is produced by flowing a diffuse, vertical curtain of heavy gas (SF{sub 6 }) into the test section of an air-filled horizontally oriented shock tube. The instability evolves {{after the passage of}} a Mach 1. 2 shock past the curtain, and the development of the curtain is visualized by seeding the SF{sub 6 } with small (d{approximately} 0. 5 and micro;m) glycol droplets using a modified theatrical <b>fog</b> <b>generator.</b> Because the event lasts only 1 ms and the initial conditions vary from test to test, rapid and complete data acquisition is required in order to characterize the initial and dynamic conditions for each experimental shot. Through the use of a custom-built pulsed Nd: YAG laser, we are able to image the flowfield at seven different times. We acquire a double-pulsed image of the flow {{with the use of a}} second pulsed Nd:YAG, which is used to determine the instantaneous velocity field using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). During a single experiment, high resolution images of the initial conditions and dynamic conditions are acquired using three CCD cameras. Issues of the fidelity of the flow seeding technique and the reliability of the PIV technique will be addressed. We have successfully provided interesting data through analysis of the images alone, and we are hoping that PIV information will be able to add further physical insight to the evolution of the RM instability and the transition to turbulence...|$|E

Increased flexibility in the declaration of objects is proposed {{in the form of the}} <b>FOG</b> (Flexible Object <b>Generator)</b> language, which is a superset of C++ implemented by a translator to C++. FOG generalises C++ syntax and supports compile-time meta-programming and reflection. The syntax generalisations provide the freedom for programmers to organise code to suit programming concerns and eliminate the need for duplication between interfaces and implementations. Further generalisations define composition policies for repeated declarations so that classes, arrays, enumerations and functions may all be extended. These composition policies support the weaving necessary for re-useable implementation of design patterns and for Aspect Oriented Programming. A declarative form of meta-programming is supported by derivation rules, which specify how a declaration specified in a base class is to be reinterpreted in derived classes. Automated generation of derived functionality is important for a number of design patterns. More general meta-programming is provided by elevating most run-time concepts to the meta-level, allowing conditional and iterated manipulation of declarations at compile-time. Compile-time execution enables subsequent run-time code to be optimised to suit application requirements. The use of meta-variables and meta-functions together with a well-disciplined lexical context for meta-programming and meta-level execution provide a complete replacement for the traditional C preprocessor functionality, satisfying Stroustrup's goal of making Cpp redundant [Stroustrup 97]. The new functionality is integrated with the language, fits within an Object-Oriented framework and provides adequate support for modern Software Engineering practices. The C++ grammar is known to pose a significant parsing challenge and to require context dependent type and template knowledge. This creates considerable difficulties when meta-programming occurs in unresolved contexts. A new approach to parsing C++ has therefore been developed that defers the use of type and template information. This approach leads to a simpler grammar implementation. An extended form of regular expression is presented and used to predict known ambiguities and then show that this simpler grammar covers the C++ grammar...|$|R
40|$|We {{live in an}} {{age where}} our society faces the great {{challenge}} of generating, storing and transporting energy in responsible ways that minimize impact to the environment. Significant effort has been spent to develop new technologies capable of (1) efficiently converting renewable energy into usable electricity, (2) storing energy into high performance energy storage devices, and (3) fabricating advanced energy conversion and storage devices using environmentally benign technologies. One of the approaches is to genetically engineer M 13 bacteriophage (M 13 virus) to display proteins with specific functionalities, which allow the synthesis and organization of hybrid materials in environmentally friendly manners. The primary goal of my Ph. D. thesis has been to develop M 13 virus-enabled processes for building the electrodes of advanced energy conversion and energy storage devices, including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), electrochemical capacitors, and perovskite hybrid solar cells (PSCs). In order to fabricate nanostructures for the DSC photoanodes, the M 13 viruses were crosslinked into a virus hydrogel {{that served as a}} multifunctional 3 D scaffold capable of binding gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to the virus proteins. The AuNP-virus hydrogel was encapsulated in titanium dioxide (TiO₂) to produce a plasmon-enhanced nanowire (NW) -based DSC photoanode that enabled a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8. 46 %. A theoretical model was developed that predicted the experimentally observed trends of plasmon-enhancement. Furthermore, to optimize the surface-to-volume ratio of the photoanodes to maximize PCE, a tunable fabrication process used individual free-floating M 13 virus as the template for TiO₂ NWs, and the assynthesized NWs were blended with sacrificial polymer to control the film porosity. The optimized semiconducting mesoporous networks were used as photoanodes in both DSCs and PSCs, and the effects of surface morphology on the photovoltaic properties was experimentally investigated. In order to construct the electrodes of electrochemical capacitors, M 13 viruses were genetically programmed to bind single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in a controlled fashion by aligning SWNTs {{along the length of the}} phage without aggregation. The SWNTs-virus complexes were used as the basis for the formation of crosslinked virus hydrogel scaffolds for the fabrication of porous 3 D polyaniline (PANI) nanostructures. The PANI-coated SWNT nanocomposites further improved the electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity of thin films. In addition, by using a <b>fog</b> <b>generator</b> to deliver the crosslinker solution, larger-area virusbased hydrogels were fabricated for versatile material coatings, including PANI, MnOx, Ni, and Ni-MnOx. Lastly, an environmentally-responsible process to fabricate efficient PSCs was developed that recycled lead content from discarded car batteries. Perovskite films, assembled using materials sourced from either recycled battery materials or high-purity commercial reagents, showed the same material characterizations and the identical photovoltaic performance, indicating the practical feasibility of recycling car batteries for lead-based PSCs. by Po-Yen Chen.
