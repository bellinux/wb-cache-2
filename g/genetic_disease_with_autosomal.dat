The {{condition is}} lethal for the fetus because of hypoxia and anemia. For the mother {{there is an}} increased risk of the severe forms of preeclampsia and its complications. The diagnosis can be suspected in presence of suggestive ultrasonographic anomalies, where both parents come from South-East Asia or China. Confirmation is based on the identification of the typical deletions or mutation of the alpha globin gene by molecular genetics. We report a rare clinical case of Bart's hydrops fetalis diagnosed because of fetal growth retardation, fetal cardiomegaly and increased size of placenta on the 26 weeks fetal echography. This case underscores the need to include the alpha thalassemias in medical and midwifery education in countries where they were almost inexistent a generation ago.

Recent studies {{demonstrated the}} importance of C 282 Y gene mutation in the aetiology of HH. Free iron accumulating in pancreas {{deteriorates insulin secretion and}} synthesis which can lead to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) in patients with HH. There has been no study determining the prevalence of haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations and HH in diabetic patients in Turkey. We planned this study in order to investigate the C 282 Y and H 63 D mutation that cause HH in T 2 DM. Material and Method: In this study, we included 185 patients with T 2 DM. Patients older than thirty-five years, not taking vitamin supplementation, iron preparates and/or oral contraceptives and those without any signs of active bleeding were included while patients with any infectious, systemic or immune disease were excluded from the study.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundBrugada {{syndrome}} is a <b>genetic</b> heart <b>disease</b> <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> dominant inheritance. Family screening commonly detects one parent responsible for {{transmission of the}} disease. AimsTo describe atypical transmission of Brugada syndrome. MethodsBetween 2001 and 2007, systematic screening, including an electrocardiogram, ajmaline challenge and DNA sequencing of the SCN 5 A gene, of the first-degree relatives of 62 probands with Brugada syndrome was performed (Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique). ResultsIn two families, both parents transmitted Brugada syndrome to their offspring. In the first family, the proband presented Brugada electrocardiogram features with ajmaline challenge and carried a new SCN 5 A mutation (p. V 1281 F). The mutation was also identified in the mother, who had a type 1 aspect on inferior leads with ajmaline. The proband's father presented a typical Brugada electrocardiogram pattern on lead V 2 with ajmaline and no SCN 5 A gene mutation. In the second family, the proband was a boy aged 2. 5 years who had been resuscitated from sudden cardiac death. Ajmaline challenge revealed a typical Brugada electrocardiogram pattern in both parents but with no mutation in the genes studied. ConclusionFamily studies should always be exhaustive and discovery of one parent with Brugada syndrome does not {{eliminate the need for}} screening of the other parent...|$|R

The theoretical part explains etiopathogenesis, clinical symptoms, diagnostic criteria, course of the disease, treatment, and disorder prognosis. Recklinghausens disease is neurofibromatosis type. It is a <b>genetic</b> heterogenous <b>disease</b> <b>with</b> <b>autosomal</b> dominant inheritance. It falls into a group of neurocutaneous syndromes, which are clinically manifested in common neurological and dermatological symptomatologies. Common clinical symptoms of Recklinghausens disease are café-au-lait macules, multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas, hyperpigmented patches, optic gliomas, or typical bone changes. The research part is based on a qualitative survey carried out by the method of questioning, and the technique of half-structured interviews. One interview involved mothers of a total of 10 children who had or were under suspicion of having Recklinghausens disease. The second interview involved three selected patients <b>with</b> Recklinghausens <b>disease.</b> The quality of life was assessed through SEIQoL method. The target of the thesis was to determine the social impact of the disease on a subject and his/her closest family. The survey showed that the impact is, when there is a person suffering from Recklinghausens disease, significant and utterly comparable with those observed in other chronic disorders. The disease may have, to a certain extent, a gradual negative impact on a patients self-respect and change the quality of his/her life. The outcome of SEIQoL assessment implies that respondents in both groups consider health {{to be the most important}} stimulus to live; and the degree of satisfaction in each subject has a close relation to his/her personal concept of quality of life...|$|R

40|$|Neuroferritinopathy {{is a rare}} <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> <b>with</b> a {{dominant}} <b>autosomal</b> transmission caused by mutations of the ferritin light chain gene (FTL). It belongs to Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation, a group of disorders where iron dysregulation is tightly associated with neurodegeneration. We studied the 498 - 499 InsTC mutation which causes the substitution of the last 9 amino acids and an elongation of extra 16 amino acids at the C-terminus of L-ferritin peptide. An analysis with cyclic voltammetry on the purified protein showed that this structural modification severely reduces {{the ability of the}} protein to store iron. In order to analyze the impact of the mutation in vivo, we generated mouse models for the some pathogenic human FTL gene in FVB and C 57 BL/ 6 J strains. Transgenic mice in the FVB background showed high accumulation of the mutated ferritin in brain where it correlated with increased iron deposition with age, as scored by magnetic resonance imaging. Notably, the accumulation of iron-ferritin bodies was accompanied by signs of oxidative damage. In the C 57 BL/ 6 background, both the expression of the mutant ferritin and the iron levels were lower than in the FVB strain. Nevertheless, also these mice showed oxidative alterations in the brain. Furthermore, post-natal hippocampal neurons obtained from these mice experienced a marked increased cell death in response to chronic iron overload and/or acute oxidative stress, in comparison to wild-type neurons. Ultrastructural analyses revealed an accumulation of lipofuscin granules associated with iron deposits, particularly enriched in the cerebellum and striatum of our transgenic mice. Finally, experimental subjects were tested throughout development and aging at 2 -, 8 - and 18 -months for behavioral phenotype. Rotarod test revealed a progressive impaired motor coordination building up with age, FTL mutant old mice showing a shorter latency to fall from the apparatus, according to higher accumulation of iron aggregates in the striatum. Our data show that our 498 - 499 InsTC mouse models recapitulate early pathological and clinical traits of the human neuroferritinopathy, thus providing a valuable model {{for the study of the}} disease. Finally, we propose a mechanistic model of lipofuscine formation that can account for the etiopathogenesis of human neuroferritinopath...|$|R
