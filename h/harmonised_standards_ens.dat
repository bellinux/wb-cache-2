The amount of stain removal is then translated into a washing performance index.The spin-drying efficiency class is based on the remaining moisture content (RMC), which is the mass of water divided by the dry mass of cotton fabrics. It is based on a weighted average of full-load and partial-load cycles.|$|R

50|$|In Europe, voice {{evacuation}} {{systems are}} normally a mandatory requirement for rail and air transport terminals, high-rise buildings, schools, hospitals, {{and other large}} facilities. Voice systems for emergency use date back {{at least as far}} as the second world war. Following the lead of companies like Avalon, Tannoy and Millbank Electronics etc., in the 1980s many other companies such as ASL, Application Solutions (Safety and Security) Ltd began producing voice-evacuation systems. In the 1990s, voice evacuation started to become the standard for large facilities, and is still growing in popularity. The use, design, operation and installation of Voice evacuation systems is governed in Europe by CENELEC European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization EN 60849 and in the UK by the British Standard BS 5839-Part 8, a system code of practice. This is joined by the European <b>harmonised</b> equipment <b>standards</b> family <b>EN</b> 54, and ISO 7240-16:2007.|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a selection of}} potential deployment and application scenarios for Cognitive Radio and Software Defined Radio. The chapter goes beyond a simple review of scenarios {{by focusing on the}} viewpoint of several key players in wireless communication research and applications: regulators, researchers from the engineering and economic/business community, industrial partners and companies, either directly or through their involvement in national and EU-funded European projects. In this framework, two key issues related to scenario definition are addressed: •	An analysis of players that determine the evolution of scenarios, including both technical and economic/business aspects; •	Study of approaches for classification of CR deployment scenarios, with the aim of identifying a set of elements that allow creating taxonomy capable of fit-ting existing and new scenarios relevant to CR and SDR. The chapter opens with an analysis of scenarios as proposed by ITU (Section 2. 1, authored by Mustonen and Matinmikko), followed by the vision of a wide set of EU projects on CR scenarios (Section 2. 2, by Matinmikko and Paavola). The im-pact of different regulatory and environmental conditions on application sce-narios is addressed in Section 2. 3, where Sridhar and Basaure provide a compari-son between feasible scenarios in India and Finland. Section 2. 4, by Mueck, Sri-kanteswara, Macdonald and El-Refaey, moves to the analysis of upcoming scenar-ios in Europe focusing on the concept of Licensed Shared Access as defined based on activities carried out in ETSI and CEPT. Next, the chapter moves to aspects related to planning and classification of scenar-ios. In section 2. 5 Medeisis and von der Emden propose a scenario plan-ning methodology aiming to support planning and classification of scenarios for Cogni-tive Radio and to help identify relevant business models. In Section 2. 6 Medeisis, Holland and De Nardis propose an approach to the definition of a taxonomy of CR application scenarios, aiming at fitting present and future applications in a coher-ent framework. Finally, Section 2. 7 by Cesar Gutierrez and Hamid Reza Karimi offers an example of very practical application scenario for deployment of White Space Devices in TV Bands as established by a <b>harmonised</b> European <b>standard</b> <b>EN</b> 301 598...|$|R

These include requirements for the design and construction of crafts such as boat design categories, craft identification, the owner’s manual, as well as integrity, structural and installation requirements.
