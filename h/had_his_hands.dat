Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia.

5|$|Coenwulf (also spelled Cenwulf, Kenulf, or Kenwulph) was King of Mercia from December 796 {{until his}} death in 821. He was a {{descendant}} of a sibling of King Penda, who had ruled Mercia {{in the middle of the}} 7th century. He succeeded Ecgfrith, the son of Offa; Ecgfrith only reigned for five months, and Coenwulf ascended to the throne in the same year that Offa died. In the early years of Coenwulf's reign he had to deal with a revolt in Kent, which had been under Offa's control. Eadberht Præn returned from exile in Francia to claim the Kentish throne, and Coenwulf was forced to wait for papal support before he could intervene. When Pope Leo agreed to anathematize Eadberht, Coenwulf invaded and retook the kingdom; Eadberht was taken prisoner, was blinded, and <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> cut off. Coenwulf also appears to have lost control of the kingdom of East Anglia during the early part of his reign, as an independent coinage appears under King Eadwald. Coenwulf's coinage reappears in 805, indicating that the kingdom was again under Mercian control. Several campaigns of Coenwulf's against the Welsh are recorded, but only one conflict with Northumbria, in 801, though it is likely that Coenwulf continued to support the opponents of the Northumbrian king Eardwulf.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1798 Sérurier {{temporarily}} {{commanded the}} divisions left in Italy where he <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> full {{trying to calm}} unpaid soldiers {{who were on the}} verge of mutiny. Bonaparte did not take him on the French campaign in Egypt and Syria because he was too old. Sometime after February 1798, he was ordered to the Army of England where he made his headquarters at Rennes. On 15 September he became Inspector General of the troops in the interior of France. On 5 November 1798 he transferred back to Italy to serve under Army of Italy commander Joubert. Sérurier was ordered by Joubert to occupy Livorno, but instructions soon changed to invade the Republic of Lucca. His cavalry entered Lucca on 22 December 1798 and extorted large sums of cash and clothing for the army's use. Sérurier's 6,000 infantry arrived at the city on 2 January 1799. After declaring that Lucca was a French-style republic on 25 January, he handed it over to Miollis on 5 February and returned to Mantua. At that time, the Army of Italy was led by Schérer who gave Sérurier command of the Tyrol Division with a paper strength of 8,328 men.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the upcoming twentieth anniversary of his reign on November 20, 303, Diocletian declared a general amnesty in a third edict. Any imprisoned clergyman could now be freed, {{so long as he}} agreed to make a sacrifice to the gods. Diocletian may have been searching for some good publicity with this legislation. He may also have sought to fracture the Christian community by publicizing the fact that its clergy had apostatized. The demand to sacrifice was unacceptable to many of the imprisoned, but wardens often managed to obtain at least nominal compliance. Some of the clergy sacrificed willingly; others did so on pain of torture. Wardens were eager to be rid of the clergy in their midst. Eusebius, in his Martyrs of Palestine, records the case of a clergy who, after being brought to an altar, <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> seized and made to complete a sacrificial offering. The clergyman was told that his act of sacrifice had been recognized and was summarily dismissed. Others were told they had sacrificed even when they had done nothing.|$|E
25|$|In this {{conflict}} intelligence {{played an important}} role on both sides. Hannibal mastered an intelligence service that enabled him to achieve outstanding victories.

25|$|Around {{this time}} {{someone close to}} Sverre wrote a speech against the bishops, En tale mot biskopene. In this work, the unknown author {{discussed}} the relationship between King and Church. By referring to well known theological works such as the Decretum Gratiani and the writings of Augustine of Hippo, the author attempted {{to prove that the}} excommunication of Sverre was unjust and thus not binding. The author also tried to defend the right of Sverre to appoint bishops. To support this view he had to interpret Norwegian law, since the Church had long considered this to be simony. By now Sverre <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> full with the church-supported Bagler rising, and the direct struggle with the church became a sideshow, at least for him personally.|$|E

25|$|The fight {{took place}} at MGM Grand Garden Arena. From round one, Mayweather tagged Ortiz repeatedly. Mayweather seemed in control through the first three rounds (judges scores: 30–27, 30–27, 29–28 for Mayweather), but in the fourth round, Ortiz found success, landing a few shots and {{stinging}} Mayweather before bulling him into the corner. Out of frustration, Ortiz rammed Mayweather {{in the face with}} an intentional headbutt. Referee, Joe Cortez, called timeout and docked Ortiz a point for the foul. As the fight resumed, Ortiz approached Mayweather {{in the center of the}} ring and tried to apologize and even hugged Mayweather. After apologizing, Ortiz <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> down, and Mayweather unloaded a left hook and a flush right hand to Ortiz's chin. Ortiz dropped and was unable to beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 were furious at the ruined fight.|$|E
25|$|Klitschko was {{scheduled}} to take on undefeated heavyweight contender Tyson Fury, the WBO mandatory challenger, on 24 October 2015 in an unprecedented 28th heavyweight world title appearance. On 25 September 2015, Klitschko postponed the fight, citing a calf injury. It was rescheduled for Saturday, 28 November 2015. Prior to the fight taking place on the night, there was much controversy, first starting with the gloves, {{then there was a}} complaint about the ring canvas. Klitchsko reportedly <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> wrapped without a representative of Fury, so had to do them again. Klitschko lost the fight by unanimous decision, with scores of 116–111, 115–112, and 115–112 all in favor of Fury. It was the first defeat Klitschko had suffered in over ten years and marked the end of the so-called 'Klitschko Era' referring to the time period where both Klitschko brothers (particularly Wladimir) dominated the division. Klitschko and Fury showed little offence during the 12 rounds, but Fury did enough to take the decision. Klitschko landed 52 of 231 punches thrown (23%) and Fury landed 86 of 371 thrown (23%).|$|E
25|$|For all the {{fighting}} and destruction, the Burmese gained only the lower Tenasserim coast. It is likely that even the retention of Tenasserim was possible only because the Siamese were immersed in their civil war. A more united Siam would have likely retaken at least the lower Tenasserim coast, if not the upper coast since almost all Burmese troops were deployed on the Chinese front throughout 1768 and 1769. (Recall that Ekkathat, widely {{considered to be an}} ineffective ruler, was able to retake the lower coast in 1761 while Naungdawgyi <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> full with multiple rebellions. A much more able leader like Taksin would certainly have retaken Tenasserim {{if it were not for}} the civil war.) But the Sino-Burmese war ended in December 1769 about six months before Taksin finished reunifying mainland Siam. Taksin chose not yet to renew the war with the Burmese, instead chose to focus on consolidating his gains in mainland Siam. (The Siamese would not launch an offensive war against the Burmese until 1787.) The territory of Tenasserim, with over 800 islands, which had been under Siamese rule for nearly five centuries, passed to the Burmese.|$|E

25|$|Canada {{had much}} to offer {{entrepreneurs}} and business risk takers. The population was increasing gradually, communications were advancing, and real estate was cheaper compared to that from across the river. Labour and materials also cost less in Canada {{than it did in}} the States. Walker looked into expanding over to Canada. Also with the expansion of America through the Great Western Railroad, trade opportunities opened up for businessmen like Walker. Walker ventured into Canada across the border from Detroit into what is currently known as Essex County. At this time, the population in this area was considerably smaller than that of Detroit merely consisting of small village settlements under the Township of Sandwich such as the villages of Windsor and Sandwich. Most of the land in this area was vast farm land. In 1856, he bought his first piece of land from the Labadie family through grandson Eugene Hall for £300. This transaction took place on December 22, 1856 using the British currency system that Canada was still employing at the time. A month later on January 24, 1857 he decided to acquire another 300 acres of land consisting of lots 95 and 96 for which he paid £750. Also on this day, he purchased yet another 104 acres for £250. The remainder of 1857 involved building on much of this land and Walker, still a resident of Detroit, often crossed the border to oversee the construction being done. His plan was to open a steam- powered flour mill, which didn’t exist in the area, and a distillery, in which he had very little serious competition. He also <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in the agricultural industry with owning cattle and hogs, as well as farming.|$|E
