40|$|In {{the growth}} literature, {{there is a}} {{nonlinear}} relationship between economic growth and government size, {{which is similar to}} an inverted U-shaped curve. This curve can be used to determine the optimum share of government expenditures. This paper, using threshold panel approach, attempts to investigate this nonlinear effect for 15 European countries, empirically. For the size of government, four measures are considered as follows: (i) total expenditures to gross domestic product, (ii) <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditures</b> to gross domestic product, (iii) current <b>expenditures</b> other than <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> to gross domestic product and (iv) government gross fixed capital formation to gross domestic product.

40|$|In the {{literature}} of new economic geography several authors have shown that a benevolent social planner would choose a different spatial distribution of economic activity than the one achieved through market forces. So far little {{has been done to}} evaluate the welfare effects of specific redistribution policies. This is the main contribution of the paper. We look at two policy schemes: location permits policy and a tax-subsidy policy {{in the context of the}} constructed capital model (due to Baldwin 1999). It is shown that with a tax on <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditures</b> and a capital subsidy there is more room for welfare improvement than under the location permits policy due to increased variety of goods. Nevertheless, relying on the numerical simulations, no situation is possible where the residents of both regions would gain from the policy.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an EM algorithm for {{the estimation}} of a consumer demand system involving variably aggregated data. The methodology {{is based on the}} observation that more highly aggregated data does in fact contain information on the finer subcategories. It is therefore possible, under certain simplifying assumptions, to derive the distribution of the unobserved fine-level expenditures conditional on the observed but more highly aggregated data. The expectation of the log-likelihood is then taken with respect to this conditional distribution. Under the assumption of multivariate normality both these steps can be performed analytically, resulting in an EM criterion that can be maximised iteratively at comparatively little cost. The technique is applied to an ABS dataset containing historical information relating to private <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditures</b> on up to 18 commodities.

Migration phenomenon and consumption of households are two important effects and parts of macroeconomic stability, first of all because they are mostly generated by the macroeconomic stability of a country, and second they are a part of it because involves both positive and negative consequences in the broad socio-economic context. Starting from the hypothesis that the main part of the Romanian migrants remittances are directed toward the consumption of the population, and that the remittances are positively correlated with the number of emigrants, the article examines the impact of private consumption on migration process and vice versa, capturing the transition period, the economic boom and the financial crisis, using panel data analysis over the period 1996 - 2011 for 26 European Union countries...|$|R

A discussion of the methodology used for calculating total household energy requirements for India using national level data on private <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditures,</b> and the calculated primary energy intensities of producing sectors that were presented in the last chapter, follows. After briefly introducing some of the terminology and the data sources used for the analysis, results relating to total, direct and indirect energy requirements per capita, and for total energy requirements of all households in India are presented. In Sect. 4. 4, the relative importance of the main drivers of the observed changes in household energy requirements over the study period are determined using a decomposition analysis for changes in both the total as well as in each of the major categories of indirect energy requirement.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the money demand function for five Southeast Asian countries, viz. Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach – The ARDL modeling approach is employed because of its ability to incorporate both I(0) and I(1) regressors. Findings – The results reveal that real M 2 aggregate, real expenditure components, exchange rate, and inflation rate are cointegrated for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. The statistical significance of real income components suggests the bias of using single real income variable in money demand (M 2 aggregate) specification of both short- and long-run. The CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests show that the estimated parameters are stable for the five Southeast Asian economies, except for Indonesia which is based on short-run specification. Practical implications – These findings are important for policy makers in formulating monetary policy. Originality/value – Besides conventional determinants of money demand such as exchange rate and interest rate variables, this study considers the major components of final <b>expenditure</b> (GDP) – <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditures</b> (private and government sectors), expenditures on investment goods, and exports as scale variables.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the original investigation by William Stanley Jevons, compensations of energy savings due to improved energy efficiency are mostly analyzed by providing energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. In support of a sustainable resource management, this paper analyzes so-called rebound effects based on resource use. Material flows and associated expenditures by households allow for calculating resource intensities and marginal propensities to consume. Marginal propensities to consume are estimated from data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) in order to account for indirect rebound effects for food, housing and mobility. Resource intensities are estimated in terms of total material requirements per household <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditures</b> along the Classification of Individual Consumption according to Purpose (COICOP). Eventually, rebound effects are indicated {{on the basis of}} published saving scenarios in resource and energy demand for Germany. In sum, compensations due to rebound effects are lowest for food while the highest compensations are induced for mobility. This is foremost the result of a relatively high resource intensity of food and a relatively low resource intensity in mobility. Findings are provided by giving various propensity scenarios in order to cope with income differences in Germany. The author concludes that policies on resource conservation need to reconsider rebound effects under the aspect of social heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} report illustrates the methodology adopted for {{the estimation of}} a monthly indicator of the euro area real gross domestic product. We carry out the disaggregation of the chain-linked quarterly value added from the output side for six branches of the NACE Rev. 1 - Level A 6 classification and from the expenditure side for the main GDP components. With the sole exception of the agricultural branch, for which we use univariate disaggregation methods, {{due to the lack}} of related monthly indicators, we adopt a parametric dynamic factor model formulated at the monthly level, taking the temporal aggregation constraint into account. The multivariate models are cast in the state space form and computational efficiency is achieved by implementing univariate filtering and smoothing procedures. The chained-linked total GDP at basic and market prices results from the contemporaneous aggregation of the disaggregated estimates for the six branches (GDP at basic prices), plus taxes less subsidies (at market prices), via a multistep procedure that exploits the additivity of the volume measures expressed at the prices of the previous year.
