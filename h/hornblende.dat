40|$|Summary. The typical <b>hornblendes</b> ofmetabasic {{rocks in}} the Willyama Complex change from bluish-green to deeply {{coloured}} brownish varieties with increase in metamorphic grade. Chemical analyses and optical properties of 23 representative <b>hornblendes</b> are interpreted as showing this colour change to reflect steady increase in titanium content of the <b>hornblendes</b> with increase in grade. High-grade horn-blendes also {{differ from those of}} lower grade in that tetrahedral uminium in the Z sites is balanced to an increased extent by alkalis entering the A site rather than by octahedral uminium entering the Y site. Comparison between theoretical nd measured ensities of Willyama <b>hornblendes</b> suggest that a calculation based on 23 oxygen anion provides closer approximations than a 24 (O, OH, F) calculation to their structural formulae.

In the range 680 - 850 °C, the crystalline assemblage on the QFM buffer is dominantly hornblende+plagioclase, ± ilmenite, magnetite, sphene, fayalitic olivine, and phlogopitic mica.

40|$|SUMMARY. Based {{on nearly}} I 5 oo {{published}} amphibole analyses the maximum possible A 1 vi in horn-blendes {{is shown to}} increase with increase of A 1 iV. New analyses of <b>hornblendes</b> from amphibole-corundum rocks, with and without anorthite, are given and after critical examination ofthe available data it is concluded that the maximum verified AlVi-rich calciferous amphibole that approaches the closest to hypothetical tschermakite comes from a kyanite-bearing aluminous high-pressure-crystallized schist from Lukmanier, Switzerland. Pure natural edenite or ferroedenite is unknown, but a new analysis of the nearest known natural edenite, from Mysore, India, agrees with the postulated view that extraordinarily low temperatures are needed for edenite-ferroedenite crystallization, much below that possible in magmas and only rarely achieved in metamorphic rocks containing amphiboles. The limit of the approach of igneous <b>hornblendes</b> to edenite-ferroedenite andtremolite-ferroactinolite is outlined.

40|$|The {{progressive}} metamorphism and {{origin of}} the amphibolites of the Lead-Deadwood area, S. Dakota, are considered in detail. Eighty specimens of amphibolite were collected along a belt 3 miles long extending across the entire garnet zone {{and part of the}} staurolite zone of the enclosing meta-sediments. These amphibolites were studied petrographically and from them thirty-four were used for modal analysis and chemical analyses for total iron (as Fe 2 O 3), CaO, TiO 2, K 2 O, MnO and trace elements. Twelve of the constituent <b>hornblendes</b> were analysed for all major and minor elements and trace elements. The other 22 constituent <b>hornblendes</b> were analysed for total iron (as Fe 2 O 3), CaO, TiO 2, K 2 O, MnO and trace elements. Seven of the constituent horn-blendes and six constituent plagioclases were used for optical determinations and x-ray diffractometric studies. On the basis of relict texture some of the amphibolites are concluded to be definitely ortho-amphibolites. Field relations of a few hornblende-bearing rocks suggest that they have meta-sedimentary origin. The {{origin of the}} remaining majority of the amphibolites is inconclusive. The metamorphism of the amphibolites is essentially iso-chemical throughout the range of conditions represented by the appearance of successively the garnet and the staurolite isophases in the enclosing meta-sediments. What fluctuations in composition are observed appear to be random in character, attributable to minor variations in original composition or to retrograde alteration. The compositions of the constituent <b>hornblendes</b> do not show any significant correlation with intensity of metamorphism and the average composition remains roughly constant throughout the sequence. The concentrations of the various components in the horn-blendes seem to be closely related to the concentrations of the same components in the corresponding amphibolites. The ratios of the concentrations of the various components between horn-blende and amphibolite do not show any significant trend with metamorphic rank and are reasonably constant over the range of metamorphic conditions represented here. The composition of the <b>hornblendes</b> is closely related to specific gravity and broadly related to dimensions of unit cells but there is no close correlation between composition and optics. Size of unit cells in <b>hornblendes</b> appear to be unrelated to metamorphic rank...|$|R
5|$|Licancabur has erupted {{primarily}} andesite, but basaltic andesite and dacite {{have also}} been found. The rocks are dark and grey-coloured. Basaltic andesite {{was found in the}} older lavas, and dacite in the more-recent ones. Although the rocks have a seriate texture, the groundmass is hyalopilitic. Phenocrysts include amphibole, clinopyroxene, <b>hornblende,</b> orthopyroxene, plagioclase and titanomagnetite; olivine is found in andesite, and biotite in dacites. Plagioclase is the most common. The amount of phenocrysts in Licancabur's rocks is smaller than that in other Central Volcanic Zone volcanoes, such as Lascar.|$|E
5|$|Petrographically, the {{composition}} of the cluster ranges from andesite to dacite with SiO2 ranging from 62.8% to 65.7%.

Plagioclase is the dominant component of the magma. Clinopyroxene+orthopyroxene+amphibole (<b>hornblende</b> and pargasite) or amphibole+biotite+minor amounts of pyroxene are subordinate components. Apatite, ilmenite, magnetite and zircon can also be found. There is evidence of magma mixing and mingling.|$|E

A feature south of Ember Ridge, unofficially known as Betty's Bump, comprises andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite and olivine. Dark brown volcanic glass composes the Betty's Bump andesite {{as much as}} 20%.

40|$|K-Ar dating on <b>hornblendes</b> and micas {{from the}} Tepla Domazlice zone {{revealed}} {{a pattern of}} dates which significantly deviates from the mid-Carboniferous to early Permian one that {{is found in the}} adjacent low-pressure metamorphic Moldanubian and Saxothuringian. Especially for the Marianske Lazne metabasic complex, confirming early Czech determinations, the dates resemble the early Devonian pattern determined for the Munchberg Gneiss Massif and the Erbendorf-Vohenstrau zone of northeastern Bavaria. This supports the idea that all three units are remnants of a huge' complex which suffered a metamorphic overprint under medium-pressure conditions, probably in the early Devonian. Strong rejuvenation is found {{in the southern part of}} the Tepla-Domazlice zone by which micas and even two <b>hornblendes</b> were reset to mid-Carboniferous ages. According to the geological setting, part of the apparently preDevonian dates may be explained by inherited argon from earlier metamorphic and magmatic events, e. g. the high-pressure metamorphism documented in eciogitic relics.

40|$|AbstractThe {{provenance}} of sand-sized ice-rafted debris (IRD) sourced from Greenland {{is currently}} difficult to determine. Such knowledge, {{if it could}} be ascertained {{with a high degree of}} certainty, could be applied to the Greenland-proximal marine records to improve both our understanding of modern-day spatial patterns of iceberg rafting and the past history of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). Recent studies have highlighted the utility of the Pb-isotope composition of individual sand-sized feldspars and the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of individual sand-sized <b>hornblendes</b> in this regard. However, before any such provenance toolkit can be applied to the palaeo-record, it is necessary first to determine whether this approach can be used to track the sources of known recent Greenland-proximal IRD deposition. To this end we present new records of the Pb-isotope composition and the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of individual sand-sized grains of feldspars and <b>hornblendes,</b> respectively, from modern Greenland glacifluvial and fjord sands and Holocene to modern Greenland-proximal marine sediments. These new data demonstrate that sand-sized feldspars and <b>hornblendes</b> glacially eroded by the GIS exhibit distinct intra- and inter-tectonic terrane differences in their Pb-isotope compositions and ages and that these differences are clearly expressed in the geochemistry and geochronology of sand-sized IRD deposited in marine sediments around Greenland. Although overlap exists between some Greenland-proximal IRD ‘source fields’ defined by these data, our approach has the potential to both better understand spatial patterns of Greenland-derived IRD in the modern day as well as during past episodes of iceberg calving...|$|R

5|$|The dacite volcanics {{composing}} Mount Fee contain brown {{volcanic glass}} {{as much as}} 70% and vesicular textures as much as 15%. About 25% of the volcanics contain crystal content, including plagioclase, <b>hornblende,</b> orthopyroxene, orthoclase and sporadic quartz. The orthoclase crystals are interpreted to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas.

5|$|The {{principal}} rock is dacite, rich in potassium. The rocks have a porphyric {{appearance and}} contain few vesicles.

Less important are allanite, apatite, clinopyroxene, olivine, orthopyroxene, quartz, sphene and zircon. The groundmass contains plagioclase, pyroxene, silicon dioxide and oxides of iron and titanium. The composition of Ciomadul's rocks has been fairly constant throughout its evolution, and this diversity of its components indicate that the genesis of Ciomadul magmas involved mixing between felsic and mafic magma.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{follow the}} calc-alkaline trend of magmatic differentiation, {{containing}} silicic lavas such as dacite. Their overall composition ranges from basaltic andesite to dacite, and the dominant lava rocks are andesite and basalt. Andesites range from green to gray in colour, and dacites are pink- and light-gray. The andesitic lavas contain phenocrysts of andesine, <b>hornblende,</b> plagioclase and hypersthene. Dacites have biotite, <b>hornblende,</b> plagioclase and quartz phenocrysts. Textures range from porphyritic to vitreophyritic. Andesites {{are more common}} in Pliocene rocks, and Pleistocene rocks tend to be dacitic. At least five cycles of andesite rock formation have been found on the southwest side of Koh-i-Sultan. Its rocks are typical volcanic-arc rocks in elemental chemistry, and may stem from mantle-derived magma. The satellite centre rocks differ from the main centre rocks in composition, suggesting that different processes generated the magmas which constructed the cones. There is a compositional trend from Bazman over Taftan to Sultan, with the latter having more potassium in its rocks than the other centres. Such compositional trends may come from different partial melting ratios and different fluid contributions to magma generation at each volcano.|$|E

5|$|Level Mountain basalt and {{andesite}} flows {{were presented}} in the 1926 Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. The andesites were described as porphyritic rocks with phenocrysts of feldspar of various size in a greyish or greenish matrix. Both <b>hornblende</b> and augite andesites were noted to have been represented under a microscope. The basalts were described as black rocks with basic plagioclase with or without olivine and were noted in many cases to contain a considerable percentage of brownish glass. Although there was not sufficient time available to study these flows in detail it was revealed at several points that the andesites formed the older and the basalts the younger flows. G. M. Dawson of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) was able to demonstrate that on the Stikine River {{there were at least}} four flows of basalt. The basalts and andesites were considered to be younger than all the rocks they were observed in contact with, namely granitic intrusives, porphyries and greenstones.
