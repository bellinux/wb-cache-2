25|$|Most of the licit {{morphine}} produced {{is used to}} make codeine by methylation. It is also {{a precursor}} for many drugs including heroin (3,6-diacetylmorphine), hydromorphone (dihydromorphinone), and oxymorphone (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone); many morphine derivatives can also be manufactured using thebaine or codeine as a starting material. Replacement of the N-methyl group of morphine with an N-phenylethyl group results in a product that is 18 times more powerful than morphine in its opiate agonist potency. Combining this modification with {{the replacement of the}} 6-hydroxyl with a 6-methylene group produces a compound some 1,443 times more potent than morphine, stronger than the Bentley compounds such as <b>etorphine</b> (M99, the Immobilon tranquilliser dart) by some measures.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is {{the most}} {{abundant}} opiate found in opium, the dried latex extracted by shallowly scoring the unripe seedpods of the Papaver somniferum poppy. Morphine is generally 8–14% of the dry weight of opium, although specially bred cultivars reach 26% or produce little morphine at all (under 1%, perhaps down to 0.04%). The latter varieties, including the 'Przemko' and 'Norman' cultivars of the opium poppy, are used to produce two other alkaloids, thebaine and oripavine, which {{are used in the}} manufacture of semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids like oxycodone and <b>etorphine</b> and some other types of drugs. P. bracteatum does not contain morphine or codeine, or other narcotic phenanthrene-type, alkaloids. This species is rather a source of thebaine. Occurrence of morphine in other Papaverales and Papaveraceae, as well as in some species of hops and mulberry trees has not been confirmed. Morphine is produced most predominantly early in the life cycle of the plant. Past the optimum point for extraction, various processes in the plant produce codeine, thebaine, and in some cases negligible amounts of hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, dihydrocodeine, tetrahydro-thebaine, and hydrocodone (these compounds are rather synthesized from thebaine and oripavine).|$|E
25|$|Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be {{reversed}} with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone or naltrexone. These competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists {{but do not}} activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the elimination half-life of naloxone can be shorter {{than that of the}} opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as nalmefene may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as <b>etorphine</b> and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etorphine</b> is {{available}} legally only {{for veterinary use}} and is strictly governed by law. It {{is often used to}} immobilize elephants and other large mammals. Diprenorphine (M5050), also known as Revivon, is an opioid receptor antagonist that can be administered in proportion to the amount of <b>etorphine</b> used (1.3 times) to reverse its effects. Veterinary-strength <b>etorphine</b> is fatal to humans. For this reason the package as supplied to vets always includes the human antidote as well as <b>etorphine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Acetorphine was {{developed}} in 1966 by the Reckitt research group that developed <b>etorphine.</b> Acetorphine {{was developed}} for the same purpose as <b>etorphine</b> itself, namely as a strong tranquilizer for use in immobilizing large animals in veterinary medicine. Despite showing some advantages over <b>etorphine,</b> for instance producing less toxic side effects in giraffes, acetorphine was never widely adopted for veterinary use, and <b>etorphine</b> (along with other tranquilizers such as carfentanil and azaperone) remains the drug of choice in this application.|$|E
50|$|Large Animal Immobilon is a {{combination}} of <b>etorphine</b> plus acepromazine maleate. An <b>etorphine</b> antidote Large Animal Revivon contains mainly diprenorphine for animals and a human-specific naloxone-based antidote, which should be prepared prior to the <b>etorphine.</b> A 5-15 mg dose is enough to immobilize an African elephant and a 2-4 mg dose is enough to immobilize a Black Rhino.|$|E
50|$|Other notable {{derivatives}} then {{result from}} further modification of this template, with saturation of the 7,8-double bond of <b>etorphine</b> {{resulting in the}} even more potent dihydroetorphine (up to 12,000× potency of morphine) and acetylation of the 3-hydroxy group of <b>etorphine</b> resulting in acetorphine (8700× morphine)—although while the isopentyl homologue of <b>etorphine</b> is nearly three times more potent, its 7,8-dihydro and 3-acetyl derivatives are less potent than the corresponding derivatives of <b>etorphine</b> at 11000× and 1300× morphine respectively. Replacing the N-methyl group with cyclopropylmethyl results in opioid antagonists such as diprenorphine (M5050, which is used {{as an antidote to}} reverse the effects of <b>etorphine,</b> M99), and partial agonists such as buprenorphine, which is widely used in the treatment of opioid addiction.|$|E

50|$|One of {{its main}} {{advantages}} is its speed of operation and, more importantly, {{the speed with which}} diprenorphine reverses the effects. The high incidence of side-effects, including severe cardiopulmonary depression, has caused <b>etorphine</b> to fall into disfavor in general veterinary practice. However, its high potency combined with the rapid action of both <b>etorphine</b> and its antagonist, diprenorphine, means that it has found a place for capture of large mammals such as rhinoceroses and elephants; under these circumstances both rapid onset and rapid recovery are very important characteristics. The high potency of <b>etorphine</b> means that sufficient <b>etorphine</b> can be administered to large wild mammals by projectile syringe (dart).|$|E

50|$|Addition of a two carbon group between carbons 6 and 14 (e.g., 6,14-ethano, 6,14-etheno, and 6,14-ethyno), {{and which}} {{significantly}} distorts the C ring, may increase potency 1,000 to 10,000 times, or greater, compared to morphine, as in <b>etorphine,</b> and others. The relative potency {{is thought to}} be associated with the degree of distortion of the C ring, and is perhaps greatest in diprenorphine, where this group is α,α-dimethyl-6,14-etheno. Diprenorphine (M5050) is the recommended <b>etorphine</b> (M99) antagonist, but it is not a pure opioid antagonist (i.e., it is also a weak opioid agonist), so naloxone remains a significant therapeutic tool in suspected cases of opioid overdose.
