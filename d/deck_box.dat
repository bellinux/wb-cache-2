25|$|By late August 2009, the {{temporary}} column work was complete, truss spans {{were in place}} and prefabricated sections were being placed upon it. A giant barge crane, the Left Coast Lifter, was used to place the 28 main <b>deck</b> <b>box</b> structures. Major segment placement on the SAS section of the bridge was completed in early October 2011. On October 19, 2011, the small gap between the SAS deck and the curved skyway extension was finally closed for the east-bound side, and the west-bound gap was closed the following week. By November 2011, the deck placement of the SAS span was complete, making 1½ miles of continuous roadway.|$|E
2500|$|The Severn Bridge {{crossing}} was strengthened and resurfaced in {{the late}} 1980s as the weight of traffic grew. The work included the strengthening of the Severn Bridge towers and deck, an extension to the existing Wye Bridge towers and {{the replacement of the}} original single stays with two stays. The open structure of the new stays is designed to facilitate maintenance. Most of the strengthening work was inside the <b>deck</b> <b>box</b> and towers and so is not visible. The surfacing is a [...] thick layer of mastic asphalt over an acrylic waterproofing membrane.|$|E

25|$|The {{automated}} welding procedures {{used by the}} <b>deck</b> <b>boxes</b> fabricator (Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Co. Ltd.) were frequently performed in the rain. Such welding has been long recognized as leading to the cracking of imperfect welds. Such welds were considered by Caltrans management to be of low criticality in this bridge owing to the compressive forces imposed on the deck structure by this particular design. There are also reports of the vendor being uncooperative {{to the concerns of}} Caltrans inspectors and engineers. Owing to the fragility of the old cantilever structure and the possibility of a destructive earthquake, Caltrans felt motivated to avoid further delays in the new span's completion.|$|R
5000|$|This {{restoration}} was {{not without}} controversy. Tourism, Culture and Heritage Department sources stated that the restoration was [...] "not intended to create an authentic replica of the original Bluenose" [...] and that the builders would not be using the plans. Large portions of the hull were chipped while other small pieces were given away at the rebuilding site in Lunenburg NS. The masts, sails, booms, gaffs, <b>deck</b> <b>boxes,</b> rigging, and some ironwork will go back onto the vessel upon completion. [...] This has led Joan Roue, a descendant of the first Bluenoses designer William Roue and current rights-holder of the design, to question whether this should even be considered the same ship.|$|R

40|$|The {{bridge deck}} {{sections}} used for long-span suspension bridges have evolved through the years, from the compact <b>box</b> <b>deck</b> girders geometrical configurations to twin-box and three-box bridge decks sections. The latest generation of split and multiple-box bridge decks proved {{to have better}} aerodynamic behavior; thus further optimization methods are sought for such geometrical configurations. A new type of multibox bridge deck, consisting of four aerodynamically shaped <b>deck</b> <b>boxes,</b> two side <b>decks</b> for the traffic lanes and two middle decks for the railway traffic, connected between them by stabilizing beams, was tested in the wind tunnel for identifying the flutter derivatives and to verify the aerodynamic performance of the proposed multibox deck. Aerodynamic static force coefficients were measured for the multibox bridge deck model, scaled 1 [*]:[*] 80, for Reynolds numbers up to 5. 1 × 105, under angles of attack between − 8 ° and 8 °. Iterative Least Squares (ILS) method was employed for identifying the flutter derivatives of the multibox bridge deck model, {{based on the results}} obtained from the free vibration tests and based on the frequency analysis the critical flutter wind speed for the corresponding prototype of the multibox bridge was estimated at 188 m/s...|$|R

Black variants have card numbers beginning with the letters BP; red variants have numbers that begin with T; the four listed alternate art variants were distributed with the <b>Deck</b> <b>Boxes</b> for the Seireitei expansion, and their card numbers begin with DB.

25|$|Production of the {{suspension}} cables {{was done by}} Thyssen of Germany, while the vertical suspenders were built by Bridon Ropes in England. The 24 steel <b>deck</b> <b>boxes</b> were built by Kværner Eureka in Moss. The first wire of {{the suspension}} cable was placed between the pylons on 1 July 1991. The three auxiliary roads on Askøy were completed by December 1991. Work was ahead of schedule, and the planned opening date was on 1 April 1992 moved from May 1993 to 12 December 1992. The last deck section was lifted in place on 4 April 1992. The first tube of the Damsgård Tunnel opened on 10 December, while the second was scheduled for 1 May 1993. West-bound traffic along National Road 555 was in the mean time routes via Laksevåg. Only one tube of the Lyderhorn Tunnel was open, but it instead had one lane in each direction.|$|R
