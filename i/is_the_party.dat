5|$|As regards proportionality, the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> attacked.|$|E

25|$|Bills become Acts {{after being}} {{approved}} three times by House votes and then receiving the Royal Assent from the Governor-General. The majority of bills are promulgated by the Government {{of the day}} (that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> or parties that have {{a majority in the}} House). It is rare for government bills to be defeated, indeed the first to be defeated in the twentieth century was in 1998, when the Local Government Amendment Bill (No 5) was defeated on its second reading. It is also possible for individual MPs to promote their own bills, called member's bills—these are usually put forward by opposition parties, or by MPs who wish to deal with a matter that parties do not take positions on. Local government and private individuals (for $2000 and only affecting themselves) may also bring forward legislation.|$|E

500|$|The {{sound in}} the film was complex for its time; it {{included}} dialogue spoken over ambient noises such as crowds {{at the airport and}} gunfire during the hunt. Film director Jean Prat said the film's soundtrack was [...] "of a perfection [...] never equaled by any French film." [...] Characters often talk at once or talk over each other's lines. One example of the dense soundtrack <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> scene, which includes dialogue over screams, gunfire and music. Except for the opening credits and {{the very end of the}} film, all of the music heard in the film is incidental. The sound engineer was Joseph de Bretagne. Music used in the film includes Mozart's Three German Dances, Monsigny's Le déserteur, Louis Byrec, Léon Garnier and Eugène Rimbault's , Strauss's Die Fledermaus, Saint-Saëns's Danse macabre, Chopin's Minute Waltz and Scotto's À Barbizon. The music was arranged by Joseph Kosma and Roger Désormière.|$|E
500|$|Nadodi Mannan is {{considered}} by many critics, historians and intellectuals to be a propaganda film of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). Ramachandran was affiliated with the DMK at that time. Film historians Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, Vaasanthi, and S. Rajanayagam note that the black and red flag of the DMK, as well as the party's rising sun symbol, are seen in the film. Rajadhyaksha and Willemen further state the Vijayavarman's corrupt nature is [...] "a thinly disguised reference to the Congress Party". Both Vaasanthi and another film historian, Selvaraj Velayutham, mention a scene where Ramachandran issues a decree that can be passed off as [...] "a DMK election manifesto". According to both Erik Barnouw and Sisir Kumar Das, the song [...] "Senthamizhe" [...] represents the glorification of the Tamil language, identity and culture. It also symbolises what Das describes as [...] "a medium of propagation of D.M.K. ideology". Ramachandran even went on to say, during the celebration of the film's 100th day theatrical run, that: [...] "Nadodi Mannan has been produced to show that the DMK <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> which is serving the people of this country." ...|$|E

2500|$|The SPGB has {{a longstanding}} {{position}} {{that it is}} [...] "opposed to a reform programme and to reformist organisations, but not opposed to reforms as such"—that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> does not campaign for reforms itself, since its sole object is the establishment of socialism, but is not opposed to reforms passed by the government when they are clearly {{in the interests of}} the working class.

Despite its small size, the branch is able through its leader, Fuad Dabbour, to get a decent footprint in Jordanian media. Dabbour's fiery statements on foreign policy are frequently quoted by the press. The party is less known than its pro-Iraqi counterpart, the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> branch of the Syrian-dominated Ba'ath Party in Jordan. Fuad Dabbour is the branch's Regional Secretary. It is believed that the party has fewer than 200 members.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{covenants}} in the Hebrew Bible, including the obligatory type and the promissory type. The obligatory covenant is more common with the Hittite peoples, and deals with the relationship between two parties of equal standing. In contrast, the promissory type of covenant {{is seen in the}} Abrahamic and Davidic covenants. Promissory covenants focus on the relationship between the suzerain and the vassal and are similar to the [...] "royal grant" [...] type of legal document, which include historical introduction, border delineations, stipulations, witnesses, blessings, and curses. In royal grants, the master could reward a servant for being loyal. God rewarded Abraham, Noah, and David in his covenants with them. As part of his covenant with Abraham, God has the obligation to keep Abraham's descendants as God's chosen people and be their God. When taking this oath we see that God is accompanied by a smoking oven and a torch. [...] These were objects used in the procedure of taking an oath much like oaths that involved sacrificing animals while taking the oath. God acts as the suzerain power and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> of the covenant accompanied by the required action that comes with the oath whether it be fire or animals in the sacrificial oaths. [...] In doing this, God <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> taking upon the curse if he does not uphold his obligation. [...] Through history there were also many instances where the vassal was the one who performed the different acts and took the curse upon them.|$|E

2500|$|Healey was {{appointed}} Shadow Chancellor in April 1972 after Roy Jenkins resigned {{in a row}} over the European Economic Community (Common Market). At the Labour Party conference on 1 October 1973, he said, [...] "I warn you {{that there are going}} to be howls of anguish from those rich enough to pay over 75% on their last slice of earnings". In a speech in Lincoln on 18 February 1974, Healey went further, promising he would [...] "squeeze property speculators until the pips squeak." [...] He alleged that Lord Carrington, the Conservative Secretary of State for Energy, had made £10m profit from selling agricultural land at prices 30 to 60 times as high as it would command as farming land. When accused by colleagues including Eric Heffer of putting Labour's chances of winning the next election in jeopardy through his tax proposals, Healey said the party and the country must face the consequences of Labour's policy of the redistribution of income and wealth; [...] "That is what our policy <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> must face the realities of it".|$|E
2500|$|It {{can also}} be argued that in a democracy, because the {{government}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> performing the act of imposing taxes, {{society as a whole}} decides how the tax system should be organized. The American Revolution's [...] "No taxation without representation" [...] slogan implied this view. For traditional conservatives, the payment of taxation is justified as part of the general obligations of citizens to obey the law and support established institutions. The conservative position is encapsulated in perhaps the most famous adage of public finance, [...] "An old tax is a good tax". Conservatives advocate the [...] "fundamental conservative premise that no one should be excused from paying for government, lest they come to believe that government is costless to them with the certain consequence that they will demand more government 'services'." [...] Social democrats generally favor higher levels of taxation to fund public provision {{of a wide range of}} services such as universal health care and education, as well as the provision of a range of welfare benefits. As argued by Tony Crosland and others, the capacity to tax income from capital is a central element of the social democratic case for a mixed economy as against Marxist arguments for comprehensive public ownership of capital. Many libertarians recommend a minimal level of taxation in order to maximize the protection of liberty.|$|E
