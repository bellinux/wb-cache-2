40|$|Abstract — Ceiling {{fans are}} one of the mostly used comfort device in {{domestic}} use. Air <b>delivery</b> produced from <b>fan</b> is multiple of the rotational frequency of the <b>fan.</b> Air <b>delivery</b> {{is one of the most}} important parameter. To analyze the air delivered from the fan was important to identify the parameters affecting it. Ceiling fans are extensively used to create an indoor breeze, improve the space air distribution and hence enhance the feeling of comfort. The fan speed, room size, number of blades and downrod length all play an important role in deciding the induced flow pattern features in space. Few previous studies have investigated fan induced flow and its characteristics under different geometric and operating conditions. In this study,response surface methodology was used to predict air <b>delivery</b> from the <b>fan.</b> The experiments were conducted based on three different Fan Blade, three different room volume, three different downrod lengths, three different fan speeds and mathematical model was developed. For targeted air delivery optimum levels of input parameters were selected using optimization analysis...|$|R
40|$|Deciphering {{the role}} and {{importance}} of climate vs. tectonism in controlling rates and processes of erosion in mountainous regions remains an area of active research in geomorphology. Through dating of alluvial fan aggradation in the Lost River Range of Idaho, USA, we investigate the influence of Quaternary climate on hillslope sediment supply and transport capacity of mountain streams in this region. Fans along the normally-faulted {{western side of the}} Lost River Range extend ~ 2 - 6 km from the range front. Sediment is predominantly limestone-derived pebble to cobble gravels with a sandy matrix and is often sorted into coarse-fine couplets that suggest sheetflooding has been the dominant process transporting and depositing sediment. We selected five alluvial fans for correlation and mapping of similar-age surfaces using geomorphic positions of surfaces, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, soil development, and thickness of pedogenic CaCO 3 coats on clasts within soil profiles. Late Pleistocene glacial extent within alluvial fan contributing basins varied from 0 - 80 % of catchment area, allowing investigation of the influence of glaciation versus regional climate on fan aggradation. OSL ages range from 4 - 115 ka and suggest synchronous fan aggradation regardless of the extent of past glaciation in catchments. Geomorphic maps of the fans suggests that approximately 10 % of total fan area was constructed during the Holocene, while ~ 80 % was constructed during the late Pleistocene (undated/older fan surfaces account for the remaining ~ 10 % of fan area). The more significant fan growth of the late Pleistocene may be divided into distinct periods at 10 - 20 ka, 20 - 35 ka, and 35 - 60 ka. Differences in the extent, facies, grain-size distributions, and average surface slopes between Holocene and late Pleistocene deposits suggest greater stream transport capacity and sediment <b>delivery</b> to <b>fans</b> during the late Pleistocene. These results suggest that the warmer and drier conditions of the Holocene (OIS 1) have promoted limited deposition and largely inactive fans. In contrast, the cold climate conditions throughout OIS 2 - 4 promoted aggradation and active fans in this region. While glaciers may {{have played a role in}} fan growth, deposition on fans with and without extensive glaciation in contributing basins suggests that glaciation was not required and that regional climate conditions drive other processes that result in fan aggradation. From these results, we infer that cold climate enhanced both stream transport capacity and sediment <b>delivery</b> to <b>fans,</b> resulting in aggradation. Greater stream transport capacity may have resulted from increased effective moisture as well as greater peak flows and total discharge during spring snowmelt. Greater sediment <b>delivery</b> to <b>fans</b> may have resulted from the direct effects of glaciers where present, but also through reduced vegetation density in contributing basins and more rapid weathering rates driven by greater effective moisture and temperature regimes that promoted more effective frost weathering processes. These findings suggest that in the Lost River Range and perhaps greater region, conditions during intervals of cold climate have most effectively driven denudation and subsequent alluvial fan growth...|$|R

Jin et al. designed a vegetable transplanting plug seedling automatic transmission device; the device reduced the transmission of vegetable seedling bowl failure rate and improved the delivery reliability [10]. Wang et al. designed a vegetable bowl seedling transplanter automatic potting and conveying device based on PLC, using of the top of the folder to take the seedling method to achieve the accurate launch and positioning of vegetable seedlings, effectively reducing the degree of loss of vegetable seedlings [11].

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of male obesity is increasing, but men {{are less likely}} than women to attend existing weight management programmes. We have taken a novel approach to reducing perceived barriers to weight loss for men by using professional football (soccer) clubs to encourage participation in a weight management group programme, gender-sensitised in content and style of <b>delivery.</b> Football <b>Fans</b> in Training (FFIT) provides 12 weeks of weight loss, physical activity and healthy eating advice at top professional football clubs in Scotland. This pilot randomized trial explored the feasibility of using these clubs as a setting for a randomized controlled trial of 12 month weight loss following men's participation in FFIT. METHODS: A two-arm pilot trial at two Scottish Premier League football clubs (one large, one smaller), with 103 men (aged 35 - 65, body mass index (BMI) >/= 27 kg/m 2) individually randomized to the intervention (n= 51, received the pilot programme (p-FFIT) immediately) and waitlist comparison (n= 52, received p-FFIT after four months) groups. Feasibility of recruitment, randomization, data collection and retention were assessed. Objective physical measurements (weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, body composition) and questionnaires (self-reported physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption, psychological outcomes) were obtained from both groups by fieldworkers trained to standard protocols at baseline and 12 weeks, and from the intervention group at 6 and 12 months. Qualitative methods elicited men's experiences of participation in the pilot trial. RESULTS: Following a short recruitment period, the recruitment target was achieved at the large, but not smaller, club. Participants' mean age was 47. 1 +/- 8. 4 years; mean BMI 34. 5 +/- 5. 0 kg/m 2. Retention through the trial was good (> 80 % at 12 weeks and 6 months; > 75 % at 12 months), and 76 % attended at least 80 % of available programme delivery sessions. At 12 weeks, the intervention group lost significantly more weight than the comparison group (4. 6 % c. f. - 0. 6 %, p<. 001) and many maintained this to 12 months (intervention group baseline- 12 month weight loss: 3. 5 %, p<. 001). There were also improvements in self-reported physical activity and diet, many sustained long term. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the feasibility of trial procedures and the potential of FFIT to engage men in sustained weight loss and positive lifestyle change. They supported the conduct of a fully-powered randomized controlled trial...|$|R
500|$|All {{tickets for}} the Wonder World Tour were sold {{exclusively}} through paperless ticket <b>delivery,</b> meaning that <b>fans</b> did not receive a physical concert ticket for their entry into the event. Ticket buyers were required to bring the credit card {{used to make the}} purchase and photo identification to the concert venue in order to gain entry. All groups were to enter the concert together, and ushers issued seat locator slips. The method of ticket sales was relatively new at the time, although Ticketmaster first experimented it with AC/DC's Black Ice World Tour (2008–10). However, it marked the first time for an arena tour to sell all tickets through paperless ticketing. This was done in response to the extensive ticket scalping that occurred during the Best of Both Worlds Tour and in order to give fans the opportunity to purchase good tickets at face value. Cyrus' manager and president of Morey Management Group, Jason Morey, stated, [...] "The focus was, 'How do we take all the information we gathered last time out and {{do a better job of}} it?' It was important to us to address the issue of demand. We thought that of every single option that was available out there, this was a really viable option, to go with the paperless ticketing." [...] As with the Best of Both Worlds Tour, one dollar from each ticket purchased was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center, a center dedicated to the prevention, treatment and research for the cure of cancer.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMountain ranges are {{frequently}} subjected to mass wasting events triggered by storms or earthquakes and supply {{large volumes of}} sediment into river networks. Besides altering river dynamics, large sediment <b>deliveries</b> to alluvial <b>fans</b> are known to cause hydro-sedimentary hazards such as flooding and river avulsion. Here we explore how the sediment supply history affects hydro-sedimentary river and fan hazards, and how well can it be predicted given the uncertainties on boundary conditions. We use the 2 D morphodynamic model Eros with a new 2 D hydrodynamic model driven by a sequence of flood, a sediment entrainment/transport/deposition model and a bank erosion law. We first evaluate the model against a natural case: the 1999 Mount Adams rock avalanche and subsequent avulsion on the Poerua river fan (West Coast, New Zealand). By adjusting for the unknown sediment supply history, Eros predicts {{the evolution of the}} alluvial riverbed during the first post-landslide stages within 30 [*]cm. The model is subsequently used to infer how the sediment supply volume and rate control the fan aggradation patterns and associated hazards. Our results show that the total injected volume controls the overall levels of aggradation, but supply rates have a major control on the location of preferential deposition, avulsion and increased flooding risk. Fan re-incision following exhaustion of the landslide-derived sediment supply leads to sediment transfer and deposition downstream and poses similar, but delayed, hydro-sedimentary hazards. Our results demonstrate that 2 D morphodynamics models are able to capture the full range of hazards occurring in alluvial fans including river avulsion aggradation and floods. However, only ensemble simulations accounting for uncertainties in boundary conditions (e. g., discharge history, initial topography, grain size) as well as model realization (e. g., non-linearities in hydro-sedimentary processes) can be used to produce probabilistic hazards maps relevant for decision making...|$|R
