This arrangement had a controversial end, when he clashed with the South Australian Cricket Association over money and moved to New Zealand to play for Otago.|$|E

Although progress was slow and racially motivated hostility continued for many years, the color barrier was broken in all major sports by 1950. Many of Motley and Willis's teammates on the Browns were used to playing with black players in college, where teams were integrated across most of the country. The presence of Motley and Willis, meanwhile, contributed to strong attendance at many of the Browns' early games as large black audiences came to watch them. By one estimate, 10,000 black fans saw the Browns play their first game.|$|E
40|$|Expectations {{about future}} {{economic}} activity should theoretically affect {{the demand for}} inventory holdings and therefore commodity spot and <b>futures</b> prices. Consistent <b>with</b> these predictions, we find that news related to future GDP growth is a significant factor that is priced in the cross-section of commodity futures sorted by percentage net basis. The latter is highly correlated with inventories. In particular, it establishes that commodity <b>futures</b> <b>with</b> high inventory levels provide a hedge against risk associated <b>with</b> <b>future</b> GDP growth so that investors {{are willing to accept}} lower return. By contrast, those commodity <b>futures</b> <b>with</b> low inventory levels are inversely related to the GDP-related factor so that investors require a higher return. Such results suggest that commodity futures excess returns are a compensation for risk...|$|R

Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political <b>future</b> <b>with</b> the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole's campaign offices.
