50|$|For example, a {{short-lived}} plant species that completes its reproductive life cycle during periods (such as a rainy season) when the salt concentration is low would be avoiding salt rather than tolerating it. Or a plant species may maintain a 'normal' internal salt concentration by excreting excess salts through its leaves, {{by way of}} a <b>hydathode,</b> or by concentrating salts in leaves that later die and drop off.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hydathode</b> {{is a type}} of {{secretory}} {{tissue in}} leaves, commonly found in angiosperms, that secretes water through pores in the epidermis or leaf margin, typically at the tip of a marginal tooth or serration. Hydathodes occur in the leaves of submerged aquatic plants such as Ranunculus fluitans as well as herbaceous plants of drier habitats such as Campanula rotundifolia. They are connected to the plant vascular system by a vascular bundle. Hydathodes are commonly seen in water lettuce, water hyacinth, rose, balsam, and many other species.|$|E
5000|$|Root pressure: If {{the water}} {{potential}} of the root cells is more negative {{than that of the}} soil, usually due to high concentrations of solute, water can move by osmosis into the root from the soil. This causes a positive pressure that forces sap up the xylem towards the leaves. In some circumstances, the sap will be forced from the leaf through a <b>hydathode</b> in a phenomenon known as guttation. Root pressure is highest in the morning before the stomata open and allow transpiration to begin. Different plant species can have different root pressures even in a similar environment; examples include up to 145 kPa in Vitis riparia but around zero in Celastrus orbiculatus.|$|E
50|$|The natural {{route of}} {{invasion}} by Xcc {{is through the}} <b>hydathodes,</b> though leaf wounds caused by insects and plant roots may also be portals of entry. Occasionally, infections occur through stomata. <b>Hydathodes</b> provide the pathogen a direct path from the leaf margins to the plant vascular system and thus systemic host infection. Invasion of the suture vein leads to production of Xcc infected seed.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Hydathodes</b> are {{involved}} in the process of guttation, in which positive xylem pressure (due to root pressure) causes liquid to exude from the pores.

5000|$|The vein or veins {{entering}} the leaf from the petiole are called primary or first order veins. The veins branching from these are secondary or second order veins. These {{primary and secondary}} veins are considered major veins or lower order veins, though some authors include third order. Each subsequent branching is sequentially numbered, {{and these are the}} higher order veins, each branching being associated with a narrower vein diameter. In parallel veined leaves, the primary veins run parallel and equidistant to each other for most of the length of the leaf and then converge or fuse (anastomose) towards the apex. Usually many smaller minor veins interconnect these primary veins, but may terminate with very fine vein endings in the mesophyll. Minor veins are more typical of angiosperms, which may have as many as four higher orders. In contrast, leaves with reticulate venation there is a single (sometimes more) primary vein in the centre of the leaf, referred to as the midrib or costa and is continuous with the vasculature of the petiole more proximally. The midrib then branches to a number of smaller secondary veins, also known as second order veins, that extend toward the leaf margins. These often terminate in a <b>hydathode,</b> a secretory organ, at the margin. In turn, smaller veins branch from the secondary veins, known as tertiary or third order (or higher order) veins, forming a dense reticulate pattern. The areas or islands of mesophyll lying between the higher order veins, are called [...] Some of the smallest veins (veinlets) may have their endings in the areoles, a process known as areolation. These minor veins act as the sites of exchange between the mesophyll and the plant's vascular system. Thus minor veins collect the products of photosynthesis (photosynthate) from the cells where it takes place, while major veins are responsible for its transport outside of the leaf. At the same time water is being transported in the opposite direction.|$|E
40|$|The genus Saxifraga contain {{many species}} that form a calcified crust on the leaf surface, {{originating}} from pore-containing pits that {{form part of}} the leaf <b>hydathode</b> structure. The detailed morphology {{and development of the}} hydathodes are not well understood for this genus. We present a study of the fine structure and developmental stages of <b>hydathode</b> pit formation along the leaf margin of the alpine plant Saxifraga cochlearis and cryo-fracture to reveal the internal <b>hydathode</b> structure. Raman- and stereo-microscopy have been used to deduce the composition and distribution of the crust. We find the pits occur as a developmental series along the leaf where conserved and oriented divisions within leaf lobes appear to give rise to the early pit. Both pit formation and lobe maturation are linked. As the pits deepen, <b>hydathode</b> pores differentiate to thick-walled, cone shaped structures and, together with the ovoid epithem tissue extrude liquid resulting in deposits of calcite that fill the pits and spill on to the leaf margin. The epithem does not possess the typical organisation or cell morphologies that have been reported for hydathodes from other plants, lacking lobed cells and having an indistinctive sheath-like cell layer.

40|$|Hydathodes are water pores {{found on}} leaves {{of a wide}} range of {{vascular}} plants and are the sites of guttation. We report here on the detailed anatomy of cauliflower (Brassicaoleracea) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) hydathodes. <b>Hydathode</b> surface presents pores resembling stomata giving access to large cavities. Beneath, the epithem is composed of a lacunar and highly vascularized parenchyma offering a direct connection between leaf surface and xylem vessels. Arabidopsis <b>hydathode</b> pores were responsive to ABA and light similar to stomata. The flg 22 flagellin peptide, a well-characterized elicitor of plant basal immunity, did not induce closure of <b>hydathode</b> pores in contrast to stomata. Because hydathodes are natural infection routes for several pathogens, we investigated <b>hydathode</b> infection by the adapted vascular phytopathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv campestris (Xcc), the causal agent of black rot disease of Brassicaceae. Microscopic observations of hydathodes six days postinoculation indicated a digestion of the epithem cells and a high bacterial multiplication. Postinvasive immunity was shown to limit pathogen growth in the epithem and is actively suppressed by the type III secretion system and its effector proteins. Altogether, these results give a detailed anatomic description of Brassicaceae hydathodes and highlight the efficient use of this tissue as an initial niche for subsequent vascular systemic dissemination of Xcc in distant plant tissues...|$|E

We evaluated Aeschynomene americana, A. ciliata, A. evenia, A. denticulata, A. fluminensis, A. rudis and A. sensitiva. The anatomy corroborates {{the separation of}} the series Americanae, Fluminenses, Indicae and Sensitivae, with the shape of the petiole, types of trichomes and quantity of vascular units in the petiole as main characteristics to delimit the species. The petiole shape varies from cylindric in A. americana, A. sensitiva and A. fluminensis, to triangular in A. evenia and quadrangular in A. rudis, A. denticulata and A. ciliata. We observed four types of trichomes: <b>hydathode</b> trichome, long conic trichome, short conic trichome and bulb-based trichome. The <b>hydathode</b> trichome was the most common, except for A. americana and A. fluminensis. Species with higher affinity with water share similar adaptive characteristics, including <b>hydathode</b> trichomes described for the first time for the genus.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of ions in plant cells and tissues {{is an essential}} factor in determining physiological function. In the present study, we established that concentration gradients of mobile ions exist in both xylem exudates and tissues within a barley (Hordeum vulgare) primary leaf. For K(+) and NO 3 (-), ion concentrations generally decreased from the leaf base to the tip in both xylem exudates and tissues. Ion gradients were also found for Pi and Cl(-) in the xylem. The <b>hydathode</b> strongly absorbed Pi and re-translocated it {{to the rest of}} the plant, whereas Cl(-) was extruded. The ion concentration gradients developed early during leaf growth, increased as the tissue aged and remained under both high and low transpiration conditions. Measurement of the expression profiles of Pi, K(+) and NO 3 (-) transporters along the longitudinal axis of the leaf revealed that some transporters are more expressed at the <b>hydathode,</b> but for most transporters, there was no significant variation along the leaf.

40|$|Secretion is a {{fundamental}} process providing plants with the means for disposal of solutes, improvement of nutrient acquisition, and attraction of other organisms. Specific secretory organs, such as nectaries, <b>hydathodes,</b> and trichomes, {{use a combination of}} secretory and retrieval mechanisms, which are poorly understood at present. To study the mechanisms involved, an Arabidopsis thaliana activation tagged mutant, glutamine dumper 1 (gdu 1), was identified that accumulates salt crystals at the <b>hydathodes.</b> Chemical analysis demonstrated that, in contrast with the amino acid mixture normally present in guttation droplets, the crystals mainly contain Gln. GDU 1 was cloned and found to encode a novel 17 -kD protein containing a single putative transmembrane span. GDU 1 is expressed in the vascular tissues and in <b>hydathodes.</b> Gln content is specifically increased in xylem sap and leaf apoplasm, whereas the content of several amino acids is increased in leaves and phloem sap. Selective secretion of Gln by the leaves may be explained by an enhanced release of this amino acid from cells.

40|$|Stomata are turgor-driven {{epidermal}} valves on {{the surface}} of plants that allow for efficient gas and water exchange between the plant and its environment. The Arabidopsis thaliana basic helixâ€“loopâ€“helix (bHLH) protein, MUTE, is a master regulator of stomatal differentiation where it is required for progression through the stomatal lineage and the differentiation of stomata. The genetic control of stomatal spacing across the epidermal surface is variable in different organs. For instance, a distinct suite of genes from those in leaves regulates stomatal patterning in hypocotyls. Here we report that regardless of organ type,MUTE controls downstream events directing stomatal differentiation, specifi-cally the transition from meristemoid to guard mother cell. Ectopic MUTE expression is sufficient to over-ride cell fate specification in cell types that do not normally differentiate stomata. Furthermore, MUTE is required for the production of the structure evolutionarily related to stomata, the <b>hydathode</b> pore. Consistently, MUTE displays expression at the tip of cotyledons and leaves, thus co-localizing with the auxin maxima. However, MUTE itself was not regulated by the auxin, and the absence of <b>hydathode</b> pores in mute did not affect the auxin maxima. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed that the requirement for MUTE could be partially circum-vented under conditions of compromised inhibitory signaling...|$|E

40|$|Mature {{leaves of}} field-grown eddo plants {{were used for}} observing <b>hydathode</b> {{morphology}} by light and scanning electron microscopies. There were approximately five <b>hydathode</b> pores on the adaxial surface of each leaf tip. A ring structure with two borders around the pore was detected in this study. Further observations revealed a large cavity underneath the pores. The cavity was directly connected to vascular bundles that lacked a bundle sheath, via intercellular spaces among loosely organized parenchyma cells. Many crystal cells were present around the cavity and vascular bundles. To evaluate the role of guttation in sodium excretion under salinity stress, eddo plants were grown in hydroponic solutions containing 0, 1, 4, 8, and 12 Â mM sodium chloride (NaCl) for 7 d. As the NaCl concentration in the hydroponic solution increased, the sodium contents increased in leaf blades, petioles, and roots but remained unchanged in corms. The sodium concentration in the guttation fluid increased; however, the volume of guttation fluid decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations. Therefore, sodium elimination via guttation decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations. The ratios of the sodium content in guttation fluid to that of leaf blades, leaves, and whole plants decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations. The ratios of potassium to sodium contents in leaves, roots, and guttation fluid also decreased as the NaCl concentration increased. These results indicate that guttation did not eliminate sufficient sodium {{to play a role}} in adjusting sodium homeostasis and the ratios of potassium to sodium contents in eddo plants under saline conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Submerged aquatic higher plants {{maintain}} acropetal {{water transport}} {{to the young}} leaves in active growth to satisfy their demand for nutrients and hormones derived from the roots. We here present the first measurements of hydraulic properties for a sub-merged plant, the monocotyledon Sparganium emersum Rehman. The hydraulic conductance per unit length, Kh, was measured in leaf segments without the leaf tip and shown to be greater in old, fully developed leaves (1. 5 Ã¡ 10) 10 Ã¡ m 4 Ã¡ MPa) 1 Ã¡ s) 1) than in young leaves (1. 0 Ã¡ 10) 10 Ã¡ m 4 Ã¡ MPa) 1 Ã¡ s) 1). In leaves with intact leaf tips, however, Kh was significantly greater in the youngest leaves, {{which suggests that the}} leaf tip with the <b>hydathode</b> influences resistance and thus flow. Microscopy confirmed that the hydathodal area, which is an apical opening, undergoes structural changes with leaf age; a matrix of microorganisms develops in the older leaves and probably restricts water flow by clogging the hydathodes. The leaf specific conductivity expressing transport capacity relative to the leaf area supplied, of S. emersum (0. 1 Ã¡ 10) 8 to 9 Ã¡ 10) 8 Ã¡ m 2 MPa) 1 Ã¡ s) 1) was within the same range as for various species of terrestrial ferns, vines and trees. This finding does not support the traditional concept of functionally reduced vascular transport in aquatic plants compared with their terrestrial counterparts. Our results demon-strate that some aquatic plants possess an ecient transport system for acropetal translocation of inorganic macronutrients and hormones and that this system is influenced by the developmental stage of the leaf <b>hydathode...</b>|$|E

In nature, these plants often go for {{extended periods of time}} without water intake through the roots. A few research studies have suggested that these desert plants may have an additional method for taking in water. Specialized structures in the epidermis of the leaves, called <b>hydathodes</b> may be responsible for foliar water uptake in the plants thus helping them to survive in arid conditions. Researchers have theorized that the remarkable ability of CAM plants to survive on such little precipitation {{is due in part to}} the presence of <b>hydathodes.</b> Researchers have hypothesized that the water is absorbed by the <b>hydathodes.</b> A number of rare or threatened members of the Crassulaceae in the genus Dudleya, are endemic to Southern California. For such plants, water uptake either directly by the leaves, or assisted by leaf morphology, could be important to their success. Occidental College has a large collection of African succulents in the Crassulaceae, and is close to field sites of a number of species of Dudleya. We propose to investigate the possibility of foliar water uptake in a variety of succulents. We also propose to examine the possible contribution of the rosette form of Dudleya to direct water flow from the surface of the leaves to the roots.
