40|$|Abstract—this paper {{deals with}} the <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> that can be {{implemented}} in a civil aircraft. It is important for an aircraft to have an ejection seat in case the plane meets an accident in a battle or during test flight and the pilot has to bail out to save his or her life. The mechanism involves lifting of the pilot to a safe distance away from the aircraft and then deploying the parachute. As there is increase in air traffic, this <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> provides additional safety measures {{to the life of}} passengers. By this method along with the pilot, the crew members and the passengers can be saved. This <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> consists of a specially made ejector pad, track system and parachute. The <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> is governed by a timing sensor which ensures that the movement of the passenger seat take place in equal interval of time to avoid collision between two consecutive seats.

40|$|Selection of {{the working}} fluid for the {{refrigeration}} or solar air-conditioning system is the crucial problem because of the strong influence of the thermodynamic fluid properties on the system efficiency. Moreover, the working fluid should fulfil the environmental criteria such as zero ODP (Ozone Depletion Potential) and as low GWP (Greenhouse Warming Potential) as possible. Therefore the natural fluids are thought as the best option. From presented in literature analysis {{it can be concluded}} that isobutane is the best option as a working fluid for <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> in application to air-conditioning since it offers the highest COP. Other important issue in ejection cycle analysis is the operating parameters. Thermal energy use as the motive energy for ejection cycles makes this cycle comparable with absorption system. In absorption system the temperature of the heat source tg in most cases exceeds 100 C. With decreasing of the generator (motive) temperature the efficiency of absorption system also decreases due to vanishing of the difference of strong and weak solutions concentrations. Therefore temperature tg 3 ̆c 80 C can be considered as the minimum value at which the absorption system can still operate. In contrast, for <b>ejection</b> <b>systems</b> for most of working fluids temperature of the motive fluid at the level of 100 C is not required. Also, there is no physical limitation for operation of the <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> at lower temperatures. Therefore the operation of the ejection cycle below tg 3 ̆c 80 C can be considered as very attractive and in this range of the motive temperatures the ejection cycles becomes truly competitive in comparison with the absorption refrigeration systems. The paper deals with numerical analysis of operation of the <b>ejection</b> <b>systems</b> driven by low grade heat. The aim of the paper is comparison of the operating parameters of the system for natural refrigerant isobutane with other popular in air-conditioning systems refrigerant R 134 a {{and one of the most}} promising fluid from HFO group HFO 1234. Three types of HFO 1234 has been investigated, such as 1234 yf, 1234 ze(E) and 1234 ze(Z). Analysis shows the promising feature of the HFO 1234 applied in <b>ejection</b> <b>system.</b> i. e. geometric similarity of ejectors designed for isobutane and HFO 1234. This proves that HFO 1234 can be substitution of isobutane due to its flammable and explosive conditions...|$|R
