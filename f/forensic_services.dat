These three sections of highway were 11.8, 54.7 and 41.2km, (7.3, 34.0 [...] and [...] 25.6mi), respectively. In 1964, the route became fully navigable from Windsor to the Ontario–Quebec border. In 1965 it was given a second designation, the Macdonald–Cartier Freeway, in honour of two Fathers of Confederation. At the end of 1968, the Gananoque–Brockville section was bypassed and the final intersection grade-separated near Kingston, making Highway401 a freeway for its entire 817.9-km length. On August 24, 2007, the portion of the highway between [...] Miller Road in Trenton and the Don Valley Parkway/ Highway404 Junction in Toronto was designated the Highway of Heroes, as the road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen Canadian Forces personnel from CFB Trenton to the coroner's office in Toronto. On September 27, 2013, the Highway of Heroes designation was extended west to Keele Street in Toronto, to coincide with the move of the coroner's office to the new <b>Forensic</b> <b>Services</b> and Coroner's Complex at the Humber River Hospital.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the establishment of}} an educational group, Health through Education in Law and Psychiatry (HELP), within an inpatient <b>forensic</b> psychiatric assessment <b>service.</b> Until recently HELP sessions have been provided twice weekly to suitable patients during their stay of some 30 days at the Metropolitan Toronto <b>Forensic</b> <b>Service</b> (METFORS). We first outline very briefly the function of METFORS, then describe the HELP project broadly, and finally discuss the rationale of the program in greater detail. Our point is that programs of this type form an added resource in assessment and {{in the early stages of}} treatment. We also argue that, along with the accepted clinical role in assessment, forensic psychiatrists and colleagues in related disciplines can serve a valuable role as teacher and therapist.
