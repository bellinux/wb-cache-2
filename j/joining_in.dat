5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors <b>joining</b> <b>in</b> the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E

5|$|McCabe {{was briefly}} {{a member of}} the Australian Defence Force during the Second World War, <b>joining</b> <b>in</b> late 1942. Due to his poor health and feet, he knew that his utility would be limited, and he also had a newborn son and fledgling {{business}} at the time, so he had not rushed to enlist {{at the start of the}} war. Due to McCabe’s incapacitation, he was given a clerical job at the Victoria Barracks. He stayed in the role for 12 months before his feet problems resulted in an early discharge. He was appointed to serve on the Sydney Sports Ground and Cricket Ground Trust and operated a sports store in George Street, Sydney from its opening until his death. McCabe often hired cricketing colleagues as salesmen; his close friend O'Reilly worked there in the late-1930s, as did paceman Ray Lindwall after the war, Lindwall opted to work for McCabe because he was offered leave to travel overseas for Test tours.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 9 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps was ordered to shift its own forward progress, from due north to the northeast, toward the {{settlement}} of Prokhorovka. Hoth had formulated this move, and had discussed it with Manstein since early May, as he expected large Soviet armoured reserve forces to arrive from the east, {{and he did not}} want his corps to be caught crossing the Psel River when they arrived. The plan originally envisioned elements of XLVIII Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps <b>joining</b> <b>in</b> the attack toward Prokhorovka, but this could not be realised. The Soviet command, however, interpreted the change in direction to be a response to the heavy resistance the German forces had faced driving toward Oboyan, and incorrectly believed the change indicated the German panzer forces had been severely weakened.|$|E
