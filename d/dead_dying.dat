500|$|At 8:45 a.m. the Newfoundland Regiment and 1st Battalion of the Essex Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move forward. The Newfoundland Regiment was situated at St. John's Road, a support trench [...] behind the British forward line {{and out of}} sight of the enemy. Movement forward through the communication trenches was not possible because they were congested with dead and wounded men and under shell fire. Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Lovell Hadow, the battalion commander, decided to move immediately into attack formation and advance across the surface, which involved first navigating through the British barbed wire defences. As they breasted the skyline behind the British first line, they were effectively the only troops moving on the battlefield and clearly visible to the German defenders. Subjected to the full force of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment, most of the Newfoundland Regiment who had started forward were <b>dead,</b> <b>dying</b> or wounded within 15 to 20 minutes of leaving St. John's Road trench. Most reached no further than the Danger Tree, a skeleton of a tree that lay in No Man's Land that was being utilized as a landmark. So far as can be ascertained, 22 officers and 758 other ranks were directly involved in the advance. Of these, all the officers and slightly under 658 other ranks became casualties. Of the 780 men who went forward only about 110 survived unscathed, of whom only 68 were available for roll call the following day. For all intents and purposes the Newfoundland Regiment had been wiped out, the unit as a whole having suffered a casualty rate of approximately 80%. The only unit to suffer greater casualties during the attack was the 10th Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, attacking west of Fricourt village.|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile {{we moved}} on to the ground of the encounter, which was cumbered by about four {{thousand}} prostrate human beings, <b>dead,</b> <b>dying,</b> and wounded, and literally stained red with blood. Ignosi issued an order, which was rapidly passed down the ranks, to the effect that none of the enemy's wounded were to be killed, and so far as we could see this command was scrupulously carried out. It would have been a shocking sight, if we had found time to think of such things.|$|E

60|$|John Carker {{had gone}} out, {{in pursuance of}} a letter of {{appointment}} from their friend, and Harriet {{was left in the}} house alone. She had been alone some hours. A dull, grave evening, and a deepening twilight, were not favourable to the removal of the oppression on her spirits. The idea of this brother, long unseen and unknown, flitted about her in frightful shapes He was <b>dead,</b> <b>dying,</b> calling to her, staring at her, frowning on her. The pictures in her mind were so obtrusive and exact that, as the twilight deepened, she dreaded to raise her head and look at the dark corners of the room, lest his wraith, the offspring of her excited imagination, should be waiting there, to startle her. Once she had such a fancy of his being in the next room, hiding--though she knew quite well what a distempered fancy it was, and had no belief in it--that she forced herself to go there, for her own conviction. But in vain. The room resumed its shadowy terrors, the moment she left it; and she had no more power to divest herself of these vague impressions of dread, than if they had been stone giants, rooted in the solid earth.|$|E

They are specialists on conifers, attacking many species of pine (Pinus) and spruce (Picea). Less often, they are found on hemlocks (Tsuga) and firs (Abies).|$|E
40|$|IntroductionMany {{antitumor}} therapies induce apoptotic {{cell death}} {{in order to}} cause tumor regression. Paradoxically, apoptotic cells are also known to promote wound healing, cell proliferation, and tumor cell repopulation in multicellular organisms. We aimed to characterize {{the nature of the}} regenerative signals concentrated in the micromilieu of <b>dead</b> and <b>dying</b> cells. MethodsCultures of viable melanoma B 16 F 10 cells, mouse fibroblasts, and primary human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in the presence of <b>dead</b> and <b>dying</b> cells, their supernatants (SNs), or purified agonists and antagonists were used to evaluate the stimulation of proliferation. Viable cell quantification was performed by either flow cytometry of harvested cells or by crystal violet staining of adherent cells. High-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry of cell SNs were deployed to identify the nature of growth-promoting factors. Coimplantation of living cells in the presence of SNs collected from <b>dead</b> and <b>dying</b> cells and specific agonists was used to evaluate tumor growth in vivo. ResultsThe stimulation of proliferation of few surviving cells by bystander dead cells was confirmed for melanoma cells, mouse fibroblasts, and primary FLS. We found that small soluble molecules present in the protein-free fraction of SNs of <b>dead</b> and <b>dying</b> cells were responsible for the promotion of proliferation. The nucleoside inosine released by <b>dead</b> and <b>dying</b> cells acting via adenosine receptors was identified as putative inducer of proliferation of surviving tumor cells after irradiation and heat treatment. ConclusionInosine released by <b>dead</b> and <b>dying</b> cells mediates tumor cell proliferation via purinergic receptors. Therapeutic strategies surmounting this pathway may help to reduce the rate of recurrence after radio- and chemotherapy...|$|R

50|$|Chicken meal {{is ground}} up chicken meat {{that has been}} {{carefully}} dried to a moisture level of 10%. The protein content is 65% and the fat level is 12%. Regular chicken contains about 70% water with 18% protein and 5% fat. To create chicken meal, ingredients are placed into large vats and cooked. This rendering process not only separates fat and removes water to create a concentrated protein product, it also kills bacteria, viruses, parasites and other organisms. Because meat can be rid of infectious agents through the rendering process, “4D” animals (<b>dead,</b> <b>dying,</b> diseased or disabled) are allowable chicken meal ingredients. While not always present, the possible inclusion of these ingredients makes chicken meal always considered unfit for human consumption.|$|E
