Students are graded as exceeding, meeting, or falling below the standard. The advantage is that students are not compared against each other, and all {{have the opportunity to}} pass the standard. However, the standard is typically set at a level that is substantially higher than previous achievement, so that a relatively high percentage of students fail at least some part of the standards in the first year, including an especially high percentage non-college bound students.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 review found {{a number}} of adverse events were {{reported}} after acupuncture in the UK's National Health Service (NHS) but most (95%) were not severe, though miscategorization and under-reporting may alter the total figures. From January 2009 to December 2011, 468 safety incidents were recognized within the NHS organizations. The adverse events recorded included retained needles (31%), dizziness (30%), loss of consciousness/unresponsive (19%), falls (4%), bruising or soreness at needle site (2%), pneumothorax (1%) and other adverse side effects (12%). Acupuncture practitioners should <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> prepared to be responsible for, any substantial harm from treatments. Some acupuncture proponents argue that {{the long history of}} acupuncture suggests it is safe. However, there is an increasing literature on adverse events (e.g. spinal-cord injury).|$|E
500|$|Biographer Mary Cross {{noted in}} her book Madonna: A Biography, how the song {{paved the way for}} its music video and became a {{testament}} to freedom. Authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted in their essays on Madonna, how she decimated [...] "patriarchal, racist and capitalist constructions", by the way she pronounced the word [...] "self" [...] in [...] "Express Yourself". They added that the opening line [...] "Don't go for second best, baby" [...] transformed the song into a postmodernist anthem. Scholar Sheila Whiteley noted {{in her book}} Women and Popular Music: Sexuality, Identity, and Subjectivity, that Madonna's acknowledgement of the pastiche and of being capable of imitating musical style was interesting to her, but given Madonna's ability to manipulate image, the musical exuberance of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] did not appear surprising. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blond Ambition declared that [...] "the song that most reflected the Madonna everyone had come to <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> shocked by was 'Express Yourself'." [...] O'Brien was impressed with the song, and gave a detailed review: ...|$|E

2500|$|Opponents of {{same-sex}} marriage, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Southern Baptist Convention, and National Organization for Marriage, argue that children do best when {{raised by a}} mother and father, and that legalizing same-sex marriage is, therefore, contrary to {{the best interests of}} children. [...] David Blankenhorn cites the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which says that a child has [...] "the right to <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> cared for by his or her parents," [...] in support of this argument (before he reversed position on the issue). [...] Some same-sex marriage opponents argue that having and raising children is the underlying purpose of marriage. The opponents {{of same-sex}} marriage assume that same-sex unions implicitly lack the everyday ability of opposite-sex couples to produce and raise offspring by natural means. They also argue that children raised by same-sex partners are disadvantaged in various ways and that same-sex unions thus cannot be recognized within the scope of [...] "marriage." [...] The argument that a child has the right to <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> cared for by his or her parents leaves a number of issues open to debate involving same-sex marriage, including infertile heterosexual couples or couples not wishing for children, as well as same-sex unions where a family exists with children from previous relationships, [...] adoption, artificial insemination, surrogacy, or co-parenting. Social consequences are also heavily debated, such as whether marriage should be defined in terms of procreation.|$|E

60|$|The {{article on}} Raleigh is very valuable; first, because Mr. Napier has {{had access to}} many {{documents}} unknown to former biographers; and next, because he clears Raleigh completely from the old imputation of deceit about the Guiana mine, {{as well as of}} other minor charges.
