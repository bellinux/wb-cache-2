50|$|In 1795 {{a new law}} {{replaced}} the three names gravet, grave and bar by a single generic unit name: the gram. The new gram was equal to the old gravet. Four new prefixes were added to cover the same range of units as in 1793 (milligram, centigram, <b>decigram,</b> gram, decagram, hectogram, kilogram, myriagram). The brass prototype of the grave was renamed to provisional kilogram.|$|E

50|$|Pierre and Marie further {{explored}} radioactivity {{by working}} {{to separate the}} substances in uranium ores and then using the electrometer to make radiation measurements to ‘trace’ the minute amount of unknown radioactive element among the fractions that resulted. Working with the mineral pitchblende, the pair discovered a new radioactive element in 1898. They named the element polonium, after Marie's native country of Poland. On December 21, 1898, the Curies detected the presence of another radioactive material in the pitchblende. They presented this finding to the French Academy of Sciences on December 26, proposing that the new element be called radium. The Curies then went to work isolating polonium and radium from naturally occurring compounds {{to prove that they}} were new elements. In 1902, the Curies announced that they had produced a <b>decigram</b> of pure radium, demonstrating its existence as a unique chemical element. While it took three years for them to isolate radium, they were never able to isolate polonium. Along with the discovery of two new elements and finding techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, Curie oversaw the world's first studies into the treatment of neoplasms, using radioactive isotopes. With Henri Becquerel and her husband, Pierre Curie, she was awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics. She was the sole winner of the 1911 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and she is the only woman to win the award in two different fields.|$|E

40|$|A {{relatively}} safe and inexpensive method {{was developed for}} {{the investigation of the}} oscillating bubble caused by the hot gases from an underwater explosion. High speed photography was employed to record the pulsations of the bubble caused by the detonation of <b>decigram</b> center-detonated spherical charges of P. E. T. N. Timing marks on the film were used to record the time interval or period of each oscillation. A description of the equipment constructed and used in the investigation is included {{in the body of the}} report. Calculations were carried out using the bubble period data and a semi-empirical equation with a rational basis to arrive at the relative underwater explosive strength of P. E. T. N, and T,N. T. Results obtained and recommendations for future work are offered in the last part of the report. Photographs of the entire sequence of events of an underwater explosion from detonation to the collapse of the second bubble are included as a appendix to this report. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|A key {{challenge}} for the academic and biopharmaceutical communities is the rapid and scalable production of recombinant proteins for supporting downstream applications ranging from therapeutic trials to structural genomics efforts. Here, we describe a novel system {{for the production of}} recombinant mammalian proteins, including immune receptors, cytokines and antibodies, in a human cell line culture system, often requiring < 3 weeks to achieve stable, high-level expression: Daedalus. The inclusion of minimized ubiquitous chromatin opening elements in the transduction vectors is key for preventing genomic silencing and maintaining the stability of <b>decigram</b> levels of expression. This system can bypass the tedious and time-consuming steps of conventional protein production methods by employing the secretion pathway of serum-free adapted human suspension cell lines, such as 293 Freestyle. Using optimized lentiviral vectors, yields of 20 – 100 [*]mg/l of correctly folded and post-translationally modified, endotoxin-free protein of up to ~ 70 [*]kDa in size, can be achieved in conventional, small-scale (100 [*]ml) culture. At these yields, most proteins can be purified using a single size-exclusion chromatography step, immediately appropriate for use in structural, biophysical or therapeutic applications...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn {{investigation of the}} primary shock front and Mach Y-stem systems was conducted utilizing <b>decigram</b> explosive charges. Distance and arrival time data of the primary shock front was correlated with that of high yield explosions. A good correlation would indicate the feasibility of conducting laboratory scale tests to obtain information on high yield explosions without the expenditure {{of time and money}} involved in large scale field tests. The shock front system was also investigated at the time of first formation of the Mach Y-stem. The critical angle of incidence of the primary shock front for the formation of the Y-stem was compared to the theoretical value. Theoretical calculations of the yield of the explosion was also compared to the actual yield. Basic data were obtained from the explosions by photographing the shadow of the shock front system utilizing a Polaroid camera, a microflash unit and a time delay generator. Correlation of the overpressure was excellent for small to moderate distances from the point of explosion, as was the yield comparison. The critical angle of incidence comparison indicated a marked difference between experimental end theoretical values. [URL] United States NavyLieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Amphotericin B {{has been}} used in the clinic for over fifty years in the {{treatment}} of serious fungal infections without any evidence of resistance developing, and recently has also become a frontline treatment for the parasite borne disease leishmaniasis, endemic in many poorer regions of the world. Alternative antibiotics are prone to the pathogens developing resistance, however amphotericin B is highly toxic leading to unpleasant side effects. A less toxic liposomal formulation is expensive limiting its use in the UK NHS and, even with a large WHO subsidy, restricting application to treating leishmaniasis. Semisynthetic modification has led to improved analogues, but at prohibitive cost. This thesis presents work as part of a programme with Dr Caffrey (UCD, Dublin) to use synthetic biology in order to generate in vivo improved analogues of amphotericin B at clinically affordable cost. A promising 16 -descarboxyl- 16 -methyl analogue has been identified by a previous student, but only isolated in very small quantities. An efficient protocol for the isolation of <b>decigram</b> quantities of 16 -descarboxyl- 16 -methyl analogue is developed, along with inexpensive semisynthetic modifications to decrease the haemolytic activity in animal cells. A noted synthetic analogue is the fructosylated disaccharide MFAME (N-methyl-N-D-fructosyl amphotericin B methyl ester), which has improved antifungal and decreased haemolytic properties, but due to the complex synthesis is not economically viable. Caffrey has produced a plasmid which when transfected into S. nodosus bacteria generates a mannosylated disaccharide analogue, the isolation and purification of which is documented in this thesis, along with biological testing where it was discovered to have reduced haemolytic activity compared to the parent molecule...|$|E
