5|$|In LMP2, Rast used {{intermediate}} tyres {{before making}} a pit stop for full wet tyres and recorded a lap time of two minutes and 7.374 seconds which gave him and co-driver Roman Rusinov a pole-setting two-lap average time of two minutes and 8.479 seconds. The two drivers were 1.1 seconds faster than the second-place class qualifier, the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports Ligier JS P2 of Pipo Derani and Chris Cumming. Derani set the category's fastest individual lap which was 0.059 second's faster than Rast. The No. 43 RGR Sport team qualified in third with both SMP Racing cars rounding out the top five LMP2 qualifiers. Sam Bird and Davide Rigon, competing in the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari, were the fastest LMGTE Pro drivers with a two-lap average time of two minutes and 12.440 seconds. They qualified 1.3 seconds in front of Richard Lietz and Michael Christensen in Dempsey-Proton Racing's No. 77 Porsche. MÃ¼cke and Pla in Ford Chip Ganassi Racing's No. 66 car took third despite Pla going into the Stowe corner gravel trap late in the session. Their sister No. 67 GT and the KCMG Porsche rounded out the top five class qualifiers. Calado recorded a time of two minutes and 11.589 seconds, and, after Bruni got into the car, {{he was unable to}} record a lap time and returned to a pit lane with an <b>engine</b> <b>bay</b> technical issue and started {{from the back of the}} overall field. Bachler and Khaled Al Qubaisi took the pole position in LMGTE Am, their first in the series, 2.297 seconds ahead of the second-place qualifier, KCMG's No. 78 car. Paolo Ruberti in Larbre Competition's No. 50 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R held the class pole position in the early part of the session but the team fell to third following the handover to co-driver Yutaka Yamagishi.|$|E
25|$|Other {{features}} such as the battery being located under {{the back seat of}} the car made more room available in the <b>engine</b> <b>bay.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{roof panel}} {{automatically}} folds away inside a space above the <b>engine</b> <b>bay.</b> The conversion from a closed top to an open-air convertible is a two-stage folding-action.|$|E
50|$|With their <b>engine</b> <b>bays</b> sized {{to fit the}} Continental {{straight}} six, the Aeros {{have plenty}} of room for small-block V8 swaps.|$|R
50|$|It is a one-story {{building}} with two fire <b>engine</b> <b>bays.</b> It was {{built as a}} Works Progress Administration project during 1941-42 and served as Lovington's city hall {{as well as its}} fire station.|$|R
5000|$|The four <b>engine</b> <b>bays</b> facing Academy Street house a tiller ladder, two modern engines, and the company's {{restored}} 1926 Seagrave engine [...] "Old Bessie" [...] {{which is}} used for parades and other special events.|$|R
25|$|Rover's {{plans to}} use its then fairly new 2.2L four-cylinder engine were soon {{abandoned}} as BL management ruled that substantially redesigned versions of Triumph's six-cylinder engine were to power the car instead. The Rover V8 engine was fitted in the <b>engine</b> <b>bay.</b> The three-speed automatic gearbox was the BorgWarner 65 model.|$|E
25|$|The {{front fairing}} of the Ninja H2R {{incorporates}} stub-wings, {{which are made}} of carbon fiber just like rest of the bodywork. They may be aerodynamic devices designed to create a low-pressure zone to help move cooling air through the <b>engine</b> <b>bay,</b> or to produce downforce at high speed, or to provide straight-line stability in a short-wheelbase sportbike chassis.|$|E
25|$|HSV branded {{special order}} options {{included}} electric tilt and slide glass sunroof, VDO MS5000 satellite navigation {{system in place}} of front console ashtray, HSV alloy pedals, limited slip differential, rear deck spoiler and choice of two 17-inch alloy wheel styles. Vehicles specially ordered with any HSV optional extras received a Holden-by-Design individually numbered build plate in the <b>engine</b> <b>bay.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Everything in the game, {{from the}} hull of your ship down to the {{individual}} engines, can be customized. Each ship has weapon bays, engineering <b>bays</b> and <b>engine</b> <b>bays</b> which can be filled with hundreds of different modules, all divided to several classes: ...|$|R
50|$|However, at a {{time when}} {{production}} technologies were relatively inflexible, the need to assemble differently configured <b>engine</b> <b>bays</b> on a single production line, along with the supplementary inventory requirements imposed both on Renault and on the dealership network, did compromise the Renault 21's profitability.|$|R
50|$|Spring clamps are {{particularly}} suited for confined or otherwise awkward places where other clip types would require tightening tools applied from narrow and possibly inaccessible angles. This {{has made them}} particularly popular for applications such as automotive <b>engine</b> <b>bays</b> and for securing barb connections in PC water-cooling.|$|R
25|$|The unusual Toronado powertrain, which {{combined}} {{an engine}} and transmission into an <b>engine</b> <b>bay</b> {{no larger than}} a conventional rear-wheel drive car, was dubbed the Unitized Power Package (UPP). During its seven-year development, UPP components were driven over 1.5million test miles to verify their strength and reliability. They proved so over-built the UPP was employed basically unchanged in the 1970s GMC motorhome.|$|E
25|$|A {{fatigue crack}} in the tenth stage {{compressor}} disc caused a power plant failure which {{was followed by the}} bursting of the compressor casing and the cutting of fuel lines that spanned the structure. This caused an intense in-flight fire in the <b>engine</b> <b>bay.</b> It is believed the fire consumed the Caravelle's supply of hydraulic fluid and this was the cause of the aircraft going out of control.|$|E
25|$|The latter {{company also}} carried out {{modifications}} to many FTOs {{during the period}} in which they were imported to the UK via that company, based at King Street in Dudley. These included installation of an aftermarket rear fog-light and its illuminated dashboard switch to meet UK legislation (Not OEM, or a requirement in Japan). The Company may also have fitted an 'English' text version of fuse box cover in the <b>engine</b> <b>bay,</b> and/or a RalliArt oil cap.|$|E
25|$|Toyota made {{revisions}} to the <b>engine</b> <b>bay's</b> inner fender aprons due to some bulging and cracking issues with the 2007 and some early 2008 models. The bulges and cracks in the inner fenders were attributed to a Toyota design flaw through certain vehicle identification numbers. Toyota addressed the problem and has changed the design.|$|R
50|$|The Nismo RB26DETT N1 {{engine block}} uses an 86 mm bore {{which can be}} bored up to either 87 mm or 88 mm. The N1 block is cast with an {{identification}} mark of 24U, whereas the standard RB26DETT block is marked with 05U. The RB26DETT N1 block is compatible with all GT-R <b>engine</b> <b>bays.</b>|$|R

The bulges and cracks in the inner fenders were attributed to a Toyota design flaw through certain vehicle identification numbers. Toyota addressed the problem and has changed the design.|$|R
25|$|Alternatively, some fires {{may have}} been because of the engine wiring harness {{bulkhead}} connector (C500) being located {{in the center of}} the <b>engine</b> <b>bay</b> above the exhaust manifold, where heat could possibly melt and ignite the wiring. The 1984 model had a magnesium grille over this area. In later models, the main engine harness connector (C500) was moved to the battery area, and was improved to some degree with better heat shielding wrapped around the wiring harness.|$|E
25|$|Anti-lock {{braking system}} (ABS) and Traction control system (TCS) (referred to as TCL on FTOs) {{can also be}} found as factory-fitted options on some earlier models such as the sports GX model. An easy-visual check for fitment of ABS to an FTO is to look in the <b>engine</b> <b>bay</b> - an alloy block, with six brake pipes emerging, will be present behind the battery and down against the bulkhead. ABS was {{standard}} equipment on facelift models.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the first}} three F-15Es started in July 1985. The first of these, 86-0183, made its maiden flight on 11 December 1986. Piloted by Gary Jennings, the {{aircraft}} reached a maximum speed of Mach 0.9 and an altitude of 40,000feet (12,000m) during the 75-minute flight. This aircraft had the full F-15E avionics suite and the redesigned front fuselage, but not the aft fuselage and the common <b>engine</b> <b>bay.</b> The latter was featured on 86-0184, while 86-0185 incorporated all the changes of the F-15E from the F-15. On 31 March 1987, the first officially completed F-15E made its first flight.|$|E
50|$|There are 3 major {{styles of}} underglow LED lights: pod style led lights, LED strips and {{flexible}} LED tubes. LED pod {{consists of a}} rigid housing, bunch of led lights and a lens. LED strips are easy to install almost everywhere, including <b>engine</b> <b>bays</b> or air intake scoops. LED tubes put out steady light that resembles classic neon glow.|$|R
5000|$|Because the VZ was {{originally}} for pickup truck and SUV use, the 3VZ-FE {{happens to be}} a physically tall motor. To make the engine fit in FWD <b>engine</b> <b>bays,</b> Toyota tilted the motor towards the firewall. This [...] "tilt" [...] is so severe (~15 degrees) that reaching the rear bank of cylinders is nearly impossible without first removing the intake plenum.|$|R
50|$|The Sea Cliff Firehouse is a {{historic}} fire station located at Sea Cliff, Nassau County, New York. The fire department was established in 1884, and the firehouse was built in 1931. It is a 1 1/2-story, Tudor Revival style brick building with ornamental half tmbering. It has four <b>engine</b> <b>bays</b> with segmental arched openings and a steep slate roof with dormers. It features a bell tower topped by a slate gable roof.|$|R
25|$|The Gallardo {{was entered}} by privateers to the GT300 {{class of the}} Japanese Super GT Championship, the car had to conform to rather {{different}} regulations. It could produce no more than 300PS (295bhp/224kW) and must be Rear-Wheel-Drive. The power was limited by air restrictors placed in the <b>engine</b> <b>bay.</b> The gearbox was a sequential 6-Speed twin-clutch setup. The rules regarding aerodynamics are far looser than those in FIA GT, meaning the Super GT car has more advanced aero, including a much bigger rear wing. It {{took a while to}} be competitive, only being consistently at the top during the 2009 season.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Aston {{introduced}} an aftermarket dealer approved upgrade path {{for power and}} handling of the 4.3-litre variants that maintained the warranty with Aston. The power upgrade was The V8 Vantage Power Upgrade, creating a more potent version of the Aston Martin 4.3-litre engine {{with an increase in}} Peak power of 20bhp to 400bhp while peak torque is increased by 10Nm to 420Nm. This consists of the fitting of the following revised components; manifold assembly (painted Crackle Black), valved air box, right and left hand side vacuum hose assemblies, <b>engine</b> <b>bay</b> fuse box link lead (ECU to fuse box), throttle body to manifold gasket, intake manifold gasket, fuel injector to manifold seal, and a manifold badge.|$|E
25|$|The AS332 Super Puma {{is powered}} by a pair of Turbomeca Makila 1A1 {{turboshaft}} engines which drive the rotorcraft's four-bladed main rotor and five-bladed tail rotor as well two separate hydraulic systems and a pair of electrical alternators. Fuel is housed in six internal fuel tanks, additional auxiliary and external tanks can be equipped for extended flight endurance. For safety, the fuel tanks use a crashworthy plumbing design and fire detection and suppression systems are installed in the <b>engine</b> <b>bay.</b> The monocoque tail boom is fitted with tail rotor strike protection, the forward portion of the boom accommodated a luggage compartment. The retractable tricycle landing gear is designed for high energy absorption qualities.|$|E
5000|$|Pre-Engineered Fire Suppression Systems use pre-designed {{elements}} {{to eliminate the}} need for engineering work beyond the original product design. Typical industrial solutions use a wet or dry chemical agent, such as potassium carbonate or monoammonium phosphate (MAP), to protect relatively smaller spaces such as distribution boards, battery rooms, <b>engine</b> <b>bays,</b> wind turbines, hazardous goods and other storage areas. A number of residential designs have also emerged that typically employ water mist and target retrofit applications.|$|R
25|$|Enlarged forward fuselage, {{enlarged}} tail surfaces, {{additional fuel}} capacity, and enlarged <b>engine</b> nacelles <b>bays</b> for 32 sonobouoys, redesignated S-2D in 1962, 100 built.|$|R
50|$|Torpedo-bomber {{powered by}} three {{improved}} Alfa Romeo 126 <b>engines,</b> bomb <b>bay</b> removed and often crew armour added. One had three Piaggio P.XI engines.|$|R
25|$|The F40 was {{designed}} with aerodynamics in mind. For speed the car relied more on its shape than its power. Frontal area was reduced, and airflow greatly smoothed, but stability rather than terminal velocity was a primary concern. So too was cooling as the forced induction engine generated {{a great deal}} of heat. In consequence, the car was somewhat like an open-wheel racing car with a body. It had a partial undertray to smooth airflow beneath the radiator, front section, and the cabin, and a second one with diffusers behind the motor, but the <b>engine</b> <b>bay</b> was not sealed. Nonetheless, the F40 had an impressively low drag coefficient of 0.34 with lift controlled by its spoilers and wing.|$|E
25|$|The air {{conditioning}} system on the new Insight has an expanded thermodynamic range compared to conventional systems. Unlike the separate low pressure and high pressure refrigerant pipes used in conventional systems, the Insight has its low pressure cold pipe enclosing the high pressure hot refrigerant pipe that allows the cold refrigerant on its {{way back to the}} <b>engine</b> <b>bay</b> to cool the warm refrigerant traveling to the cabin. A unique, spiral groove along the outside of the inner pipe increases the surface area and therefore the efficiency of the heat transfer between the outer and inner tubes. This improves the thermal efficiency of the air-conditioning system and, as a result, less effort is required from the compressor, resulting in improved fuel efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} in February 2007 on concerns that quiet cars like the Prius may pose a safety risk {{to those who}} rely on engine noise to sense the presence or location of moving vehicles. Blind pedestrians are a primary concern, and the National Federation of the Blind advocates audio emitters on hybrid vehicles, {{but it has been}} argued that increased risks may also affect sighted pedestrians or bicyclists who are accustomed to aural cues from vehicles. However, silent vehicles are already relatively common, and there is also a lack of aural cues from vehicles that have a conventional internal combustion engine where engine noise has been reduced by noise-absorbing materials in the <b>engine</b> <b>bay</b> and noise-canceling muffler systems. In July 2007, a spokesman for Toyota said the company is aware of the issue and is studying options.|$|E
50|$|The Engine House is {{a two-story}} red brick {{building}} with trim of red-orange sandstone and salmon colored brick {{topped with a}} high double-pitch hip roof {{in the front and}} a lower roof in the rear. Dormers feature wooden cornices containing sculpted faces, serpents, and dragonheads. Two <b>engine</b> <b>bays</b> are located on the first floor, along with the station office, kitchen, and dining & recreation room. The sleeping quarters, officerâs room, locker room and bathroom are on the second floor. A hose-drying chamber stretches from the first floor to the attic.|$|R
50|$|All seven fire {{stations}} are box-shaped, two-story structures, with <b>engine</b> <b>bays</b> {{on the ground}} floor and dormitories upstairs. All have drying towers, which were required for the cloth-covered rubber hoses of the era in which they were built, but which also serve as visual landmarks and decorative elements. The buildings are all of sturdy masonry, with white stucco walls and tiled roofs, in a Mediterranean style. The Waikiki Fire Station on Kapahulu Avenue followed a similar model when it was built in 1927, but it was extensively remodeled in 1963 to fit an evolving Hawaiian rather than Mediterranean style, so it was excluded from the National Register application.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} plan {{had called for}} two roundhouses {{to be built in}} Rockhampton, however only one was to be constructed. Foundation work began in August 1913 for a complete circle roundhouse with 52 stalls allocated for stabling locomotives in traffic. Drop pits were to be constructed, along with inspection pits. The central element of the roundhouse was to be a revolving turntable allowing for access to each of the <b>engine</b> <b>bays</b> and individual stalls. In a design similar to the North Ipswich roundhouse an external circular running road was provided to accommodate a shunt locomotive held captive serving as a mobile boiler for wash out purposes.|$|R
