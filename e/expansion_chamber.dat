5|$|Roberts {{announced}} that the 1983 season would be his final year in Grand Prix competition. Yamaha team manager Giacomo Agostini {{had been unable to}} agree on a contract with rider Graeme Crosby, so AMA Superbike champion Eddie Lawson was brought in as Roberts' new teammate. The 1983 battle for the championship between Roberts and Honda's Spencer would be considered one of the greatest seasons in motorcycle Grand Prix history, along with the 1967 500cc duel between Mike Hailwood and Giacomo Agostini. Roberts began the season with his YZR500 having problems with overheating and rear suspension, while Spencer started strongly, winning the first three races and five out of the first seven. Roberts was leading the second race in France, when his Yamaha split an <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> causing it to lose power as Spencer won, with Roberts falling to fourth place. In Round 3 at Monza, Roberts crashed while leading Spencer three laps from the finish. Roberts came back to win the German Grand Prix, but then finished second to Spencer in Spain in a race Spencer called one of the toughest of his career. Things began to go Roberts' way at the Austrian Grand Prix as Roberts won while Spencer's Honda suffered a crankshaft failure. In the Yugoslavian Grand Prix, Roberts' Yamaha failed to start immediately, while Spencer charged to an early lead, leaving Roberts to fight through the field to finish in fourth place. Roberts then went on a three-race winning streak with victories in the Netherlands, Belgium and England, while Spencer stayed close with a third place and two second-place finishes.|$|E
25|$|Mature axon tracts {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder. Such mechanical stretch was applied by a custom axon stretch-growth bioreactor composed of four main components: custom-designed axon <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber,</b> linear motion table, stepper motor and controller. The nerve tissue culture is placed within the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> with a port for gas exchange and a removable stretching frame, which is able to separate two groups of somas (neuron cell bodies) and thus stretch their axons. Collagen gel was used to promote the growth of larger stretch-grown axon tracts that were visible to the unaided eye. There are two reasons for the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates. Examination by scanning electron microscope and TEM {{showed no signs of}} axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1cm/day after only 8 days of acclimation, which is much greater than the 1mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for growth cone extension. The rate of 1mm/day is also the average transport speed for structural elements such as neurofilaments.|$|E

2500|$|Compression-ignition engine {{research}} is being undertaken by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, which {{was commissioned by}} DARPA to develop a compression-ignition Wankel engine {{for use in a}} prototype VTOL flying car called the [...] "Transformer". The engine, based on an earlier concept involving an unmanned aerial vehicle called [...] "Endurocore", powered by a Wankel diesel. plans to utilize Wankel rotors of varying sizes on a shared eccentric shaft to increase efficiency. The engine is claimed to be a 'full-compression, full-expansion, compression-ignition-cycle engine'. An October 28, 2010 patent by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, describes a Wankel engine superficially similar to Rolls-Royce's earlier prototype, that required an external air compressor to achieve high enough compression for compression-ignition-cycle combustion. The design differs from Rolls-Royce's compression-ignition rotary, mainly by proposing an injector both in the exhaust passage between the combustor rotor and expansion rotor stages, and an injector in the expansion rotor's <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber,</b> for 'afterburning'.|$|E

There are also described the analytic solutions of flow in the cracks and possible use of simulation programs, such as Fluent, for investigation of more difficult tasks. The computational part compares analytically determined values of the volume flow for smooth gap, with the values obtained from the program Fluent. Thanks to the values from this program is also possible to assess the effect of rotation on the flows. Analytical relationships do not include this impact. For easier comparison the flow in the <b>expansion</b> <b>chambers</b> are further drawn contours of the static pressure, velocity vectors and pathlines in their cross-section...|$|R

50|$|<b>Expansion</b> <b>chambers</b> {{almost always}} have turns and curves built into them to {{accommodate}} their fit within the engine bay. Gases and waves do not behave {{in the same}} way when encountering turns. Waves travel by reflecting and spherical radiation. Turns causes a loss in the sharpness of the wave forms and therefore must be kept to a minimum to avoid unpredictable losses.|$|R
50|$|In various {{countries}} the laws mandated that road-registered machines have lights/horn/blinkers/stop lights/mirrors in various permutations.

50|$|The {{detailed}} {{operation of}} <b>expansion</b> <b>chambers</b> in practice {{is not as}} straightforward as the fundamental process described above. Waves traveling back up the pipe encounter the divergent section in reverse and reflect {{a portion of their}} energy back out. Temperature variations {{in different parts of the}} pipe cause reflections and changes in the local speed of sound. Sometimes these secondary wave reflections can inhibit the desired goal of more power.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the exhaust}} {{pressure}} {{has fallen to}} near-atmospheric level, the piston uncovers the transfer ports. At this point energy from the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> {{can be used to}} aid the flow of fresh mixture into the cylinder. To do this, the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber</b> is increased in diameter so that the out-going acoustic wave (created by the combustion process) creates a reflected vacuum (negative pressure) wave that returns to the cylinder. This part of the chamber is called the divergent (or diffuser) section and it diverges at 7 to 9 degrees. It may be made up of more than one diverging cone depending on requirements. The vacuum wave arrives in the cylinder during the transfer cycle and helps suck in fresh mixture from the crankcase into the cylinder, and/or prevent the suction of exhaust gases into the crankcase (due to crankcase vacuum). However, the wave may also suck fresh mixture out the exhaust port into the header of the <b>expansion</b> <b>chamber.</b> This effect is mitigated by the port-blocking wave.|$|E

40|$|<b>Expansion</b> <b>chambers</b> with single-inlet and double-outlet {{are used}} in the exhaust system of {{internal}} combustion engines since they provide noise attenuation similar to simple chambers (single inlet/outlet), and reduce the flow noise and back pressure. This work presents a detailed analysis of the acoustic attenuation performance of elliptical <b>expansion</b> <b>chambers</b> with single-inlet and double-outlet. First, the finite element method (FEM) is considered in order to obtain a reference solution. Then, the mode-matching method (MMM) is applied at the area discontinuities of the muffler, considering a circular inlet pipe, a central elliptical chamber and two circular outlet pipes. This method reduces the computational requirements and enables to couple the acoustic fields within each region, described by means of Mathieu functions in the elliptical chamber and Bessel functions in the circular pipes. The solution given by this analytical approach is compared with finite element results and experimental measurements for a selected configuration, showing a good agreement. The acoustic behaviour is then analysed in detail {{as a function of the}} chamber length, the. eccentricity of the elliptical cross-section and the position of the inlet and outlet pipes. Some potential means to improve the acoustic performance are proposed...|$|R
