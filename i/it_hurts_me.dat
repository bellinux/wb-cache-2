[...] It was in this {{interview}} that Jackson stated he had a skin disorder (vitiligo) and also stated that the disorder was hereditary, rather than something he caused; he also said he used make-up to even out the uneven skin tone. [...] "It is something I cannot help," [...] explained Jackson. [...] "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, <b>it</b> <b>hurts</b> <b>me.</b> It's a problem for me. I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody says nothing about that." [...] Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62million Americans. It also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo, a relatively unknown condition before then.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{skin had}} been a medium-brown color during his youth, but from the mid-1980s {{gradually}} grew paler. The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors {{that he might have}} been bleaching his skin. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1984; vitiligo results in white patches on the skin. Although Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, Taraborrelli stated that Jackson had been skin bleaching. He said that Jackson was diagnosed with lupus, and that while the vitiligo partially lightened Jackson's skin, the lupus was in remission. Both illnesses made Jackson's skin sensitive to sunlight. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches he could appear pale. Jackson stated that although he used makeup to control the patchy appearance of his skin, he never purposely bleached his skin. He said of his vitiligo: [...] "It is something I cannot help. When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, <b>it</b> <b>hurts</b> <b>me.</b> It's a problem for me. I can't control it." [...] Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in his autopsy, though not lupus.|$|E

[...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And <b>it</b> <b>hurts</b> <b>me</b> to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E

It is about love and I do not know anything about love. Mother told me once that love is a curse, and that I must pray that it would never enter into my life. She said it very earnestly, and so I believed her. But your book teaches that it is a blessing. It says that it is the most splendid and wonderful thing in life. Which am I to believe?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I twisted my foot in some way," [...] she said, [...] "and I do {{not know}} what I am going to do. <b>It</b> <b>hurts</b> <b>me</b> to make a step, and I am sure I cannot work my wheel." ...|$|E
