5000|$|The {{most common}} type of baler in industrialized {{countries}} today is the round baler. It produces cylinder-shaped [...] "round" [...] or [...] "rolled" [...] bales. The design has a [...] "thatched roof" [...] effect that withstands weather well. Grass is rolled up inside the baler using rubberized belts, <b>fixed</b> <b>rollers,</b> or a combination of the two. When the bale reaches a predetermined size, either netting or twine is wrapped around it to hold its shape. The back of the baler swings open, and the bale is discharged. The bales are complete at this stage, but they may also be wrapped in plastic sheeting by a bale wrapper, either to keep hay dry when stored outside or convert damp grass into silage. Variable-chamber large round balers typically produce bales from 48 to 72 in in diameter and up to 60 in in width. The bales can weigh anywhere from 1100 to 2200 lb, depending upon size, material, and moisture content. Common modern small round balers (also called [...] "mini round balers" [...] or [...] "roto-balers") produce bales 20 to 22 in in diameter and 20.5 to 28 in in width, generally weighing from 40 to 55 lb.|$|R

Nevertheless, the current implementations do not support collaborative design by remote participants. This paper reports on an implementation of virtual claying in a collaborative virtual design environment where ideas and actions of the stylists and the designers are converted to a model by physically-based operators. The basis of the model is a vague discrete modeling kernel. Physical operators are implemented on class and instance levels. The classes contain the generic support constraints and external forces, which can be combined to deform the shape. The instances of a physical operator class are able to model specific effects by various load-support arrangements.

The slabs measured 2350 x 1700 mm (92. 5 x 66. 9 in.) on plan and were 180 mm (7. 1 in.) thick. One end of the slab was supported on a 300 mm (11. 8 in.) square column with a boot at its base for imposition of eccentricity.

40|$|Vibratory rollers are {{commonly}} used for compaction of embankments and landfills. This task is time consuming and constitutes {{a significant part of}} most large construction and infrastructure projects. By improving the compaction efficiency, the construction industry would reduce costs and environmental impact. This research project studies the influence of the vibration frequency of the drum, which is normally a <b>fixed</b> <b>roller</b> property, and whether resonance can be utilized to improve the compaction efficiency. The influence of frequency on roller compaction has not before been studied but the concept of resonance compaction has previously been applied successfully in deep compaction of fills and natural deposits. In order to examine the influence of vibration frequency on the compaction of granular soil, small-scale compaction tests of sand were conducted under varying conditions with a vertically oscillating plate. Subsequently, full-scale tests were conducted using a vibratory soil compaction roller and a test bed of crushed gravel. The results showed that resonance can be utilized in soil compaction by vibratory rollers and plates and that the optimum compaction frequency from an energy perspective is at, or slightly above, the coupled compactor-soil resonant frequency. Since rollers operate far above resonance, the compaction frequency can be significantly reduced, resulting in a considerable reduction in fuel consumption, environmental impact and machine wear. The thesis also presents an iterative equivalent-linear method to calculate the frequency response of a vibrating foundation, such as a compacting plate or the drum of a roller. The method seems promising for predicting the resonant frequency of the roller-soil system and can be used to determine the optimum compaction frequency without site- and roller-specific measurements.

40|$|Piezoelectric polymer, poly (vinylidene fluoride), PVDF is {{a widely}} used {{fluorocarbon}} polymer with varied range of applications. PVDF is known to exhibits scientifically interesting and technologically important electrical properties due to their polar structure. When it is subjected to mechanical deformation, it becomes electrically polarized and exhibits strong piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties i. e. the material {{can be used as}} a plastic transducer element, which will generate electrical charge as a result of externally, imposed mechanical or thermal fields. PVDF polymer exists in four different forms namely alpha, beta, gama and delta. Beta (β) phase is the well-known piezoelectric form of PVDF. Beta-phase PVDF is produced from film stretching or rolling the films at certain temperatures. To obtain the β phase of film stretching equipment required. So film can be stretched stage by stage. The condition required for stretching the PVDF film can be obtained by passing the film through three heated rollers. The concept is similar to that of a sugar cane squeezing machine. Here we are including heaters to heat the rollers from the inside. The stretching unit consists of three rollers of diameter 40 mm. Center roller is fixed permanently to the frame, but can rotate freely in the position, and the other rollers is made to slide up and down above the <b>fixed</b> <b>roller</b> to achieve a good compression of the film and a stretch ratio of 4 : 1. The sliding roller is fixed to two slides at each end, which slides on the walls of the frame.

40|$|Vibratory rollers are {{commonly}} used for compaction of embankments and landfills. In a majority of large construction projects, this activity constitutes {{a significant part of}} the project cost and causes considerable emissions. Thus, by improving the compaction efficiency, the construction industry would reduce costs and environmental impact. In recent years, rollers have been significantly improved in regard to engine efficiency, control systems, safety and driver comfort. However, very little progress has been made in compaction effectiveness. While the compaction procedure (e. g. layer thickness and number of passes) has been optimized over the years, the process in which the machine compacts the underlying soil is essentially identical to the situation in the 1970 s. This research project investigates the influence of one crucial parameter, namely vibration frequency of the drum, which normally is a <b>fixed</b> <b>roller</b> parameter. Frequency is essential in all dynamic systems but its influence on the compaction efficiency has not been studied since the early days of soil compaction. Since laboratory and field equipment, measurement systems and analysis techniques at the time were not as developed as they are today, no explicit conclusion was drawn. Frequencyvariable oscillators, digital sensors and computer‐based analysis now provide possibilities to accurately study this concept in detail. In order to examine the influence of vibration frequency on the compaction of granular soil, small‐ scale tests were conducted under varying conditions. A vertically oscillating plate was placed on a sand bed contained in a test box. The experiments were carried out in laboratory conditions to maximize controllability. The first test setup utilized an electro‐dynamic oscillator where dynamic quantities, such as frequency and particle velocity amplitude, could be varied in real‐time. The second test setup included two counter‐rotating eccentric mass oscillators, where tests were conducted at discrete frequencies. This type of oscillator has a force amplitude that is governed by frequency. The main objectives of the tests were to determine the optimal compaction frequency and whether resonance can be utilized to improve compaction efficiency. Results showed that resonance had a major influence in the electro‐dynamic oscillator tests, where the applied force amplitude is low, and the optimal compaction frequency is the resonant frequency under these circumstances. In the rotating mass oscillator tests, where a high force was applied to the plate, resonant amplification was present but not as pronounced. Since force increase with frequency, the optimal frequency to obtain the highest degree of compaction is very large. In a practical regard, however, frequency should be kept as low as possible to minimize machine wear and emissions while still achieving a sufficient compaction of the soil. Considering the practical issues, it is proposed that surface compactors should operate slightly above the resonant frequency. However, the applicability to vibratory rollers must be confirmed in full‐scale tests. The thesis also presents an iterative method to calculate the frequency response of a vibrating plate, incorporating strain‐dependent soil properties. Calculated dynamic quantities are compared to measured values, confirming that the method accurately predicts the response. QC 20140129 </p...|$|E
50|$|Several factors affect {{drill bit}} selection. Due {{to the high}} number of wells that have been drilled, {{information}} from an adjacent well is most often used to make the appropriate selection. Two different types of drill bits exist: <b>fixed</b> cutter and <b>roller</b> cone. A <b>fixed</b> cutter bit is one where there are no moving parts, but drilling occurs due to shearing, scraping or abrasion of the rock. Fixed cutter bits can be either polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) or grit hotpressed inserts (GHI) or natural diamond. Roller cone bits can be either tungsten carbide inserts (TCI) for harder formations or milled tooth (MT) for softer rock. The manufacturing process and composites used in each type of drill bit make them ideal for specific drilling situations. Additional enhancements can be made to any bit to increase the effectiveness for almost any drilling situation.|$|R

5000|$|Stewart {{spent three}} weeks {{recording}} Gouldman, Godley and Creme singing [...] "ahhh" [...] 16 times for each {{note of the}} chromatic scale, building up a [...] "choir" [...] of 48 voices for each note of the scale. The main problem facing the band was {{how to keep the}} vocal notes going for an infinite length of time, but Creme suggested that they could get around this issue by using tape loops. Stewart created loops of about 12 feet in length by feeding the loop at one end though the tape heads of the stereo recorder in the studio, and at the other end through a capstan <b>roller</b> <b>fixed</b> {{to the top of a}} microphone stand, and tensioned the tape. By creating long loops the 'blip' caused by the splice in each tape loop could be drowned out by the rest of the backing track, providing that the blips in each loop did not coincide with each other. Having created twelve tape loops for each of the 12 notes of the chromatic scale, Stewart played each loop through a separate channel of the mixing desk. This effectively turned the mixing desk into a musical instrument complete with all the notes of the chromatic scale, which the four members together then [...] "played", fading up three or four channels at a time to create [...] "chords" [...] for the song's melody. Stewart had put gaffer's tape across the bottom of each channel, which meant it was impossible to completely fade down the tracks for each note; this resulted in the constant background hiss of vocals heard throughout the song. Composer and music theory professor Thomas MacFarlane considered the resulting [...] "ethereal voices" [...] with distorted synthesized effects that are an example of early synclavier music to be a major influence on Billy Joel's hit ballad [...] "Just the Way You Are", released two years later.|$|R
40|$|Our {{primary goal}} was to develop an {{adaptive}} device to allow a user with limited upper body mobility to more effectively {{play a game of}} pool. Within this goal it was important to design around the concept of a least restrictive environment, in order to provide the user with as close to a standard pool playing experience as possible. The device was designed to specifically meet the needs of John Lee, an Assistive Technology Specialist at Cal Poly 2 ̆ 7 s Disability Resource Center. Mr. Lee has muscular dystrophy, which limits his upper and lower body mobility and currently requires his use of a wheelchair. Research into the specific needs of our customer, current products, and pool game elements was performed to better understanding of the project goals. From this research and discussion with John Lee, customer requirements and engineering specifications were developed. These were then used to guide the design development process. Several ideation techniques were used, and concepts for a bridge mechanism and supporting bases were created. A rough prototype was developed to test the concepts before our final design direction was decided. Our final design acts as a robust bridge device with a self-supporting base that constrains the path of the pool cue to a set path, allowing the user to focus their effort on providing power to the shot. The base can be rolled around the table, and stabilizing posts are lowered through a cable system when the shot is being made to prevent the base from sliding. The shooting mechanism features horizontal and vertical angle adjustment to allow for proper positioning of the cue, as well as a small cue stop to adjust the allowable travel of the pool cue. A vertical height adjustment is also present to allow the mechanism to reach {{over the edge of the}} pool table and for special high angle shots. The shooting mechanism itself features <b>fixed</b> and sliding <b>rollers</b> that act as a modified pool bridge, limiting travel of the pool cue to one axis of motion. The top part of the device can be separated from the base and clamped to the upright post for easier transport. These design choices allow the device to be compatible with any size regulation pool cue. Engineering analysis was performed to select materials and size components for the final device. Parts were specified and costs recorded to keep within the program budget. The device was then manufactured to the specifications shown in the included technical drawings, and testing was performed to verify that the final product met the design requirements. The overall experience was successful, and the final product received strong approval from John Lee. Recommendations for potential future improvement of both manufacturing and design of the device are included, as are as tips for device operation...|$|R
