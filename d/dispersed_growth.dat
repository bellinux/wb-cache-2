40|$|It is {{possible}} to obtain finely <b>dispersed</b> <b>growth</b> of tubercle bacilli by adding to the media {{in which they are}} cultivated certain non-ionic wetting agents. The polyoxyethylene esters of oleic acid (Atlas G- 2144), lauric acid (Arias G- 2124), sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60), sorbitan monopalmitate (Tween 40), and sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), have proven especially effective in this respect. In addition to their wetting effect on the cell, certain of the water-dispersible esters just mentioned are capable of enhancing the growth of many strains of tubercle bacilli, probably by supplying them with long chain fatty acids in a non-toxic form available for metabolic utilization (3). Unfortunately, the ester linkage in these wetting agents is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis by lipases, a fact which prohibits their use in media containing animal tissues or fluids rich in these enzymes. It is therefore desirable to find other types of wetting agents capable of promoting <b>dispersed</b> <b>growth</b> of tubercle bacilli and stable in the presence of animal tissues.

Nowadays they are menaced by the uncontrolled sprawl of the urban area. The present expansion of the urban area, following the demand’s requirements, is the cause of major problems due to <b>disperse</b> <b>growth</b> and are already present in the area: excessive soil use, growing requirements for service networks, larger consumption of energy used in transportation and the segregation or functional zoning, all contributing to social disintegration. To modify the city’s tendency to grow in an anarchic mode, irrationally exploiting resources and generally occupying valuable productive fields would be a fundamental step towards establishing urban development guidelines that would progressively correct the present trends, establishing the necessary theoretical basis, in order to consolidate a model of sustainable city. The present study evaluates the different present configurations of soil appropriation and their incidence, direct or indirect, within the universe of intervening variables, (dimensions and orientation of the gridiron, building morphology, green spaces and public urban forest, soil’s sealing, the features of urban edges and the environmental degradation produced at the interface of the natural and the man-made environment, among others) on the energy efficiency of the building stock and the availability of renewable energy resources in each urban environment...|$|R

40|$|Growth {{rates of}} {{unicellular}} microbes are usually determined by measurements of culture turbidity or by cell counts. However, growth of filamentous microbes cannot be assessed by counting and the heterogeneous distribution of mycelium generally precludes accurate turbidimetric measurements. Therefore gravimetric determinations, which are laborious and less accurate at low concentration, are required. This partly explains the comparative {{lack of information}} on the growth kinetics of such microbes. The growth kinetics of several fungi grown in submerged culture and on agar media have been studied by Trinci (1969, 197 ra, b, 1972), who compared specific growth rates, radial extension of colonies and germ-tube growth rates. Most actinomycetes form stable filaments and are generally regarded as slow-growing microbes, but there have been few attempts to determine their growth rates accurately. Haines (1932) recorded exponential germ-tube extension rates of several unidentified isolates, while Marshall & Alexander (1960) claimed that the rate of increase of mass of a Streptornyces sp. and a Nocardia sp. in submerged culture fitted a cube root relationship. Recently, Schuhmann & Berger (1976) studied the growth kinetics of Streptomyces hygroscopicus on solid medium. Since turbidity measurements can be used to estimate growth rates of fungi which have reasonably <b>dispersed</b> <b>growth</b> in submerged culture (Trinci, I 972; Caldwell & Trinci, 1973), we decided to evaluate the use of turbidimetric methods for determining the specific growth rates of streptomycetes.

Despite this, Australia has a weak tradition of regional planning with {{two thirds of the}} population concentrated in capital cities. This paper builds on the authors' previous research into peri-urban regions by testing alternative future scenarios. Using a case study of Melbourne's peri-urban region, an area under intense development pressure, the research explores the capacity for regional growth under a range of different spatial scenarios. The scenarios include 'business as usual', the concentration of growth in major regional cities, and <b>dispersing</b> <b>growth</b> in a network of smaller towns. The methodology employs a geographical information system model and iterative policy decisions.

Scenarios also relate development pressure on rural land and natural resources to development options for regional cities and towns by examining the capacity for transferring development rights from rural land holdings to townships. The paper places regional development scenarios in the context of the dominant Australian paradigm of major city population concentration, and outlines comprehensive regional planning as an alternative to the metropolitan primacy of Australia's cities...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hexavalent}} chromium, Cr(VI), addition on various operating parameters of activated sludge process was evaluated. To accomplish this, two parallel lab-scale continuous-flow activated sludge plants were operated. One {{was used as}} a control plant, while the other received Cr(VI) concentrations equal to 0. 5, 1, 3 and 5 mg 1 (- 1). Cr(VI) concentrations of 0. 5 mg 1 (- 1) caused significant inhibition of the nitrification process (up to 74 % decrease in ammonia removal efficiency). On the contrary, the effect of Cr(VI) on organic substrate removal was minor for concentrations up to 5 mg 1 (- 1), indicating that heterotrophic microorganisms are less sensitive to Cr(VI) than nitrifiers. Activated sludge floc size and structure characterization showed that Cr(VI) concentrations higher than 1 mg 1 (- 1) reduced the filaments abundance, causing the appearance of pin-point flocs and free-dispersed bacteria. Additionally, the variability of protozoa and rotifers was reduced. As a result of <b>disperse</b> <b>growth,</b> effluent quality deteriorated, since significant amounts of suspended solids escaped with the effluent. Termination of Cr(VI) addition led to a partial recovery of the nitrification process (up to 57 % recovery). Similar recovery signs were not observed for activated sludge floc size and structure. Finally, shock loading to the control plant with 5 mg 1 (- 1) Cr(VI) for 2 days resulted in a significant inhibition of the nitrification process and a reduction in filamentous microorganisms abundance.

40|$|Introduction: Cancer is a {{multifactorial disease}} {{characterized}} by the uncontrolled and <b>disperse</b> <b>growth</b> of abnormal cells. If this growth and its dispersion are not controlled at the appropriate time, it could result in metastasis, which {{increases the risk of}} death associated to this disease. In the last years, the oxidative stress had become a therapeutic target against this disease, due to its important role in the carcinogenesis process that has been evidenced and of there that the antioxidants and pro-oxidants are potential antitumor agents that could be administered alone or as co-adjuvants in the chemotherapies and radiotherapies. Objective: To review the implication of oxidative stress in the DNA damages and in the carcinogenesis process. Methods: Thematic review. An informatic search was carried out in English and Spanish, in the databases ScienceDirect and Scielo between the years 2009 and 2013. Studies in humans and animals were included. 150 summaries were obtained, 50 summaries were considered as pertinent, and of transcendence and contribution. All were acquired in full text, reviewed and cited lengthways of the present thematic review. Results: The oxidative stress occurs as an imbalance between the production of reactive species and the antioxidant system that neutralizes them. The reactive species had been implied in the carcinogenesis process and due to they could mediate the activation of cellular proliferation ways and to inhibit the apoptosis, also it has been demonstrated that the oxidative damage to the DNA carries to mutations favoring this process. Conclusions: The oxidative stress could be an important cellular event implied in the carcinogenesis, therefore the use of antioxidant and pro-oxidant agents as potent antitumor agents constitutes an alternative for the anticancer therapy, already be alone or as co-adjuvant. Although, more studies are required to allow validating the obtained results. Rev. cienc. biomed. 2015; 6 (1) : 107 - 117 KEYWORDS Cancer; Oxidative stress; Antioxidants...|$|R

30|$|Concerning {{macroscopic}} morphology, {{the production}} of an adhesive compound {{could be one of}} the reasons for the initial aggregation of conidia to form pellet nuclei, enabling the further formation of pellets by the subsequent aggregation of small clamps of germinated conidia (Prosser and Tough 1991). In this connection, although several lines of evidence suggest that an extracellular compound secretion is involved in the conidia aggregation of many fungal species (Zelinger et al. 2006; Fontaine et al. 2010), Deyesen and Nielsen (2003) also explain this process as a result of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions by using Aspergillus nidulans as a model. Interestingly, when A. niger MYA 135 grew mainly as dispersed mycelia the presence of an extracellular compound, if any, was only detected with electron microscope (data not shown). In addition, {{the production of}} an emulsifier activity was significantly increased (p[*]<[*] 0.05) under environmental conditions that support dispersed mycelial growth (Colin et al. 2010 a). Similarly, Prosser and Tough (1991) reported that the addition of nonionic surfactants, e.g., Span, to shake-flask cultures of A. niger also decreases spore aggregation thus allowing for <b>dispersed</b> <b>growth.</b> These observations encourage us to quantify the conidia adhesion capacity under different environmental conditions.|$|E

40|$|The elucidation of the genomic {{sequence}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed {{the presence of}} a novel multigene family designated PE/PE_PGRS that encodes numerous, highly related proteins of unknown function. In this study, we demonstrate that a transposon insertion in a PE_PGRS gene (1818 (PE_PGRS)) found in Mycobacterium bovis BCG Pasteur, which is the BCG homologue of the M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv gene Rv 1818 c, introduces new phenotypic properties to this BCG strain.

Complementation of the 1818 (PE_PGRS) ::Tn 5367 mutant with the wild-type gene restores both aggregative growth (clumping) in liquid medium and reestablishes infectivity of macrophages to levels equivalent to those for the parent BCG strain. Western blot analysis using antisera raised against the 1818 (PE_PGRS) protein shows that PE_PGRS proteins are found in cell lysates of BCG and M. tuberculosis H 37 Ra and in the cell wall fraction of M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv. Moreover, immunofluorescent labeling of mycobacteria indicates that certain PE_PGRS proteins are localized at the cell surface of BCG and M. tuberculosis.
