40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to analyze the {{characteristics}} of some eucalypts pulps available in the market, aiming to understand their influence in {{the properties of the}} offset papers. Another objective of this work was to show alternatives {{to reduce the number of}} laboratory tests in the pulp specifications. Thirteen (13) market pulps (Brazilian and international pulps) were analyzed and the tests applied were as follows: intrinsic viscosity, alkali solubility at 5 %, coarseness, numbers of fibers per gram of pulp, average length of fibers, fine fraction by the Dynamic Paper Chemistry Jar (DPCJ), <b>drainability</b> by Schopper Riegler, before refining. Other tests, such as: tensile index, stretch, burst index, tear index, bulk, air resistance, opacity and absorption of water by cappilarity (Klemm) were performed for each type of pulp before refining and for refining levels of 25 ºSR, 30 ºSR, 40 ºSR and 55 ºSR. No evidence of the influence of S 5 and intrinsic viscosity was observed at the range of the market pulp properties variation. The Brazilian pulps presented higher initial <b>drainability</b> and required lower PFI revolutions to the same level of refining in comparison to the international pulps. The initial average values of strength indexes: tensile, stretch, burst and tear were higher to the Brazilian pulps. However, this situation was changed at 25 ºSR and other levels of <b>drainability.</b> Due to the higher number of correlations at 30 ºSR, this level of <b>drainability</b> was chosen to determine the pulp characteristics profile. At this level, international pulps showed better values of tensile and tear index, but a higher energy consumption and a lower opacity in comparison to the Brazilian pulps. In addition, this paper  suggested the concentration of the lab technical evaluation of pulps on the analysis of opacity, tensile and tear indexes.

The same aggregate sieve distribution and paste content can result in different pervious concrete pavement characteristics depending on the compaction energy applied.

40|$|Pervious {{concrete}} {{provides a}} sound solution for managing storm waters in built environments {{where the water}} runoff {{as well as the}} natural recharge of the groundwater are important issues. The use of pervious concrete is also commonly related to other environmental benefits such as the Urban Heat Island reduction, traffic noise absorption, and pollutant filtering. Despite the broad capabilities, comprehensive standards are still limited and many issues have not yet been completely fixed. For example, compaction is often underestimated and one of the common compaction effort is provided by hand-rolling; however, different compaction energies, techniques, or timing can significantly affect mechanical and functional properties of the material. Performance can be furthermore improved by adding a small amount of fine sand, as suggested by many; sand can lead towards better raveling and skid resistance, also improving the maximum flexural strength. On the other hand, too much sand and improper compaction energy may lead to an excessively low void content and reduced <b>drainability</b> features. Compaction and sand addition should be therefore analyzed more in details. The present research aimed at (1) evaluating the effect of differential levels of compaction energy and (2) analyzing the influence of fine sand addition into several pervious concrete mixtures. Results suggested that adding small amounts of fine sand (around 5 % of the total aggregate weight) to pervious concrete mixtures provided better mechanical and surface properties, and a consequent reduction of <b>drainability.</b> However, the correct balance of mechanical and hydrological properties can be achieved due to both accurate mix-design and proper compaction plan...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPervious {{concrete}} {{is a novel}} pavement material {{characterized by}} a porous structure that allows the water to percolate through it with consequent numerous environmental benefits. However, high-drainability characteristics do not generally correspond to high strength and good surface conditions when submitted to vehicular traffic, hence, to date, the applications of pervious concrete are limited to particular urban areas. In addition, mix design and rigorous construction standards {{have not yet been}} defined. The present laboratory study aimed to compare the properties of several pervious concrete mixtures submitted to different compaction energies. The main objectives were, on one hand, to define the effects of compaction energy on the design requirements of strength and <b>drainability,</b> on the other, to compare the reinforcing effect of different admixtures on the material properties. Different percentages of sand and several reinforcing fibres with various physical and chemical properties were added to the mixes, changing water to cement ratio while fixing the aggregate size distribution and the paste content. Laboratory tests, such as indirect tensile strength, elastic modulus, and Cantabro resistance, were conducted to measure the mechanical behaviour of the material; while, porosity, bulk density and <b>drainability</b> capacity were evaluated to define volumetric and functional characteristics. The result of this investigation provided useful information about the effectiveness of laboratory compaction to achieve the optimal strength-drainability balance, adequate for the different urban uses. Moreover, this study identified the suitable admixtures, with the appropriate proportioning, that could enhance the mechanical properties of the material leading to a wiser use in medium-high traffic roads...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} to refining of wheat straw and eucalyptus pulps {{as well as}} the relationships between refining, fiber properties, and paper properties are described in this paper. Pulps were bleached applying different bleaching sequences and thereafter refined to varying degrees. Pulp and fiber properties were investigated and set into relation to the final sheet properties. The results show that wheat straw pulps respond to refining more easily than eucalyptus pulps and that the differences are due mainly to morphological and ultrastructural differences as well as fines content and xylan content. The development of strength properties of the different pulps was found to be strongly correlated to the number of dislocations, i. e. weak points in the fiber wall, {{as well as to the}} morphological appearance of the pulp fibers after refining. A higher initial number and a faster development of dislocations together with the creation of large amounts of fines explain the slower and lower development of strength properties of wheat straw pulps than of eucalyptus pulps. Removal of fines from wheat straw pulps improved not only the <b>drainability</b> of the pulp suspension but also the mechanical and optical sheet properties. This indicates that the fines in the wheat straw pulps act mainly as filler with low bonding properties. The fact that fractionated D(EOP) D wheat straw pulps can deliver good mechanical sheet properties at very good <b>drainability</b> with no or only minor refining is very interesting when evaluating the potential of replacing or partially replacing eucalyptus with domestic Chinese raw materials in furnishes for production of different paper products...|$|E

Likewise, sparkling wines and carbonated beverages are fundamentally assessed by sensory evaluation. Computer vision is an emerging technique that has been applied in the food industry to objectively assist quality and process control. However, publications describing the application of this novel technology to carbonated beverages are scarce, as the methodology requires tailored techniques to address the presence of carbonation and foamability. Here we present a robotic pourer (FIZZeyeRobot), which normalizes the variability of foam and bubble development during pouring into a vessel. It is coupled with video capture to assess several parameters of foam quality, including foam ability (the ability of the foam to form) <b>drainability</b> (the ability of the foam to resist drainage) and bubble count and allometry. The foam parameters investigated were analyzed in combination to the wines scores, chemical parameters obtained from laboratory analysis and manual measurements for validation purposes.

Significant correlations were observed between the wine quality measurements of total protein, titratable acidity, pH and foam expansion.

40|$|With over 68 {{thousand}} miles of gravel roads in Iowa {{and the importance}} of these roads within the farm-to-market transportation system, proper water management becomes critical for maintaining the integrity of the roadway materials. However, the build-up of water within the aggregate subbase can lead to frost boils and ultimately potholes forming at the road surface. The aggregate subbase and subgrade soils under these gravel roads are produced with material opportunistically chosen from local sources near the site and, many times, the compositions of these sublayers are far from ideal in terms of proper water drainage with the full effects of this shortcut not being fully understood. The primary objective of this project was to provide a physically-based model for evaluating the <b>drainability</b> of potential subbase and subgrade materials for gravel roads in Iowa. The Richards equation provided the appropriate framework to study the transient unsaturated flow that usually occurs through the subbase and subgrade of a gravel road. From which, we identified that the saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks, was a key parameter driving the time to drain of subgrade soils found in Iowa, thus being a good proxy variable for accessing roadway <b>drainability.</b> Using Ks, derived from soil texture, we were able to identify potential problem areas in terms of roadway drainage. It was found that there is a threshold for Ks of 15 cm/day that determines if the roadway will drain efficiently, based on the requirement that the time to drain, Td, the surface roadway layer does not exceed a 2 -hr limit. Two of the three highest abundant textures (loam and silty clay loam), which cover nearly 60 % of the state of Iowa, were found to have average Td values greater than the 2 -hr limit. With such {{a large percentage of the}} state at risk for the formation of boils due to the soil with relatively low saturated hydraulic conductivity values, it seems pertinent that we propose alternative design and/or maintenance practices to limit the expensive repair work in Iowa.

The high AV content confers to PFC mixtures both high permeability and noise reduction effectiveness. These characteristics and the high values of surface friction exhibited by PFC mixtures, as compared to dense-graded HMA, lead to improvements in safety and the environment, which make PFC one of the safest, cleanest, and quietest alternatives currently available for surface paving. The main objective of this study was improving the current PFC mix design method and construction practices in terms of compaction control. Corresponding results were integrated in an improved mix design method that is based on the guidelines of the current mix design method used by the Texas Department of Transportation. The improved mix design included modified computation of the inputs required to determine mixture density (or corresponding total AV content). These changes led to a proposed modification of the density specification for mix design from 78 - 82 % to 76 - 80 %. In addition, the water-accessible AV content was proposed as a surrogate of the total AV content for mix design and evaluation. The improved mix design method also includes verification of <b>drainability,</b> durability, and stone-on-stone contact. Computation of the expected value of permeability (E[k]) and measurement of the water flow value were recommended, respectively, for verification of <b>drainability</b> in the laboratory (using specimens compacted in the Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC)) and in the field.

However, <b>drainability</b> and long-term durability of a subbase must be balanced when attempting to optimize performance of the overall concrete pavement structure. To design an appropriate roadbed system, pavement designers must first understand the sources of moisture and several of the drainage systems available to them. Where permeable (open-graded) subbases previously had been used with an edge drain system, it is now recommended that a daylighted free-draining subbase be used due to various problems encountered with permeable subbases. This publication briefly discusses these topics, but more more details are available in ACPA’s EB 204 P, “Subgrades and Subbases for Concrete Pavements. ” Drainage as a Single Design Element It is important not to build a roaded system that holds water underneath the pavement slabs because this can lead to poor field performance. It is equally important not to over design the permeability of a subbas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The surface {{properties}} of several purified cellulose (Sigmacell 101, Sigmacell 20, Avicel pH 101, and Whatman CF 11) were characterised, {{before and after}} cellulase adsorption. The following techniques were used: thin-layer wicking (except for the cellulose Whatman), thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry (for {{all of the above}} celluloses). The results obtained from the calorimetric assays were consistent with those obtained from thin-layer wicking – Sigmacell 101, a more amorphous cellulose, was the least hydrophobic of the analysed celluloses, and had the highest specific heat of dehydration. The other celluloses showed less affinity for water molecules, as assessed by the two independent techniques. The adsorption of protein did not affect the amount of water adsorbed by Sigmacell 101. However, this water was more strongly adsorbed, since it had a higher specific heat of dehydration. The more crystalline celluloses adsorbed a greater amount of water, which was also more strongly bound after the treatment with cellulases. This effect was more significant for Whatman CF- 11. Also, the more crystalline celluloses became slightly hydrophilic, following protein adsorption, as assessed by thin-layer wicking. However, this technique is not reliable when used with cellulase treated celluloses. Key words: cellulase, cellulose, <b>drainability,</b> protein adsorptio...|$|E
40|$|The {{soil survey}} of the Dollard area was made to solve certain {{agricultural}} problems, especially those arising in the older polders. For these studies {{the value of the}} soils for different crops was assessed. The region consists of Pleistocene and Holocene sediments. Its geological history could be compared with those of the other marine landscapes. Dating of the Holocene sediments proved that the first incursion was slightly younger than in the west of the Netherlands. In the 15 th and 16 th century the sea inundated a vast area of peat and two types of sediments were deposited. After the 16 th century successive dikings took place, giving the Dollard its final form. Loss of CaCO 3 was 1 % in 100 years, a lower figure than stated by older theories, which supposed a uniform CaCO 3 content for newly reclaimed polders. The suitability of these soils was studied by the 'determination-of-arrangement' method; in this method soils were grouped in sequence according to suitability for a range of crops, allowing also for non-soil factors. <b>Drainability</b> and possibilities of soil improvement were studied and mapped...|$|E
40|$|The PERSUADE project aims at {{developing}} poroelastic {{road surfacing}} (PERS). A small size field test of PERS was constructed before constructing full scale test sections to gain experience from mixing and laying the PERS material outside {{the laboratory and}} to monitor {{the performance of the}} pavement over a winter as well as to investigate the performance of the PERS by measuring the characteristics of the surface. The test section was constructed in Denmark on a ramp from a parking area with low traffic volume and driving speed. The test section is 7 meter long and 1. 5 meter wide. It is not possible to perform noise measurements using the SPB or the CPX method. Instead absorption, mechanical impedance, texture and <b>drainability</b> have been measured and used as indicators for the acoustical properties of the pavement. At the test site there is also an old dense asphalt concrete with 11 mm maximum aggregate size as well as a new single layer porous asphalt concrete pavement with 8 mm maximum aggregate size which are both used for comparison. The results all indicate that the PERS pavement has a good potential for noise reduction...|$|E
40|$|Coal seam gas has {{historically}} been and still remains a major issue for underground Illawarra Coal’s mining operations in the Southern Coalfield. The control of seam and strata gas is essential to maintaining operational safety and mining continuity. The Resource and Exploration department surface exploration drilling program is currently investigating coal seam gas characteristics {{through the use of}} coal permeability testing (injection fall-off testing). The need for coal permeability testing is essential for assessing the reservoir gas characteristics in the seams. Coal seam structure and reservoir properties are closely related to regional and localised geological structure, which greatly influence insitu coal seam permeability and reservoir characteristics. Testing is conducted on all seams within the mining stress relaxation envelope of the mined seam. Specialist software (PAN Systems) is used to process the data and interpretation is undertaken in conjunction with all other available data-sets. Permeability testing is critical for understanding the gas regimes within Illawarra Coal’s four mining lease areas. Permeability data is needed for the Bulli through to the Tongarra coal seams primarily for mine gas drainage, evaluation of Coal Bed Methane production potential of deeper seams in the Illawarra Coal Measures and identification of zones of variable gas <b>drainability</b> and outburst potential...|$|E
