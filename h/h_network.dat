40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN) consists {{of a large number}} of wireless sensor nodes that collect information from their sensing terrain. Wireless sensor nodes are, in general, battery-powered devices with limited processing and transmission power. Therefore, the lifetime of WSNs heavily depends on their energy efficiency. Multiple-cluster 2 -hop (MC 2 <b>H)</b> <b>network</b> structure is commonly used in WSNs to reduce energy consumption due to long-range communications. However, networks with the MC 2 <b>H</b> <b>network</b> structure are commonly associated with long data collection processes. The delay-aware data collection network structure (DADCNS) is proposed to shorten the duration of data collection processes without sacrificing network lifetime. In this paper, a k-means-based formation algorithm for the DADCNS, namely DADCNS-RK, is proposed. The proposed algorithm can organize a network into the DADCNS, while minimizing the total communication distance among connected sensor nodes by performing k-means clustering recursively. Simulation results show that, when comparing with other DADCNSs formed by different algorithms, the proposed algorithm can reduce the total communication distances of networks significantly.

Hence, hydrotreating and hydrocracking processes now play increasingly important roles in modern refineries. Refinery hydrogen networks {{are becoming more and}} more complicated as well. Therefore, optimisation of overall hydrogen networks is required to improve the hydrogen utilisation in oil refineries. In previous work for hydrogen management many methodologies have been developed for <b>H</b> 2 <b>network</b> optimisation, all with fixed H 2 /Oil ratio and H 2 partial pressure for H 2 consumers, which may be too restrictive for <b>H</b> 2 <b>network</b> optimisation. In this work, a variable H 2 /Oil and H 2 partial pressure strategy is proposed to enhance the <b>H</b> 2 <b>network</b> optimisation, which is verified and integrated into the optimisation methodology. An industrial case study is carried out to demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of the approach. Another important issue is that existing binary component <b>H</b> 2 <b>network</b> optimisation has a very simplistic assumption that all H 2 rich streams consist of H 2 and CH 4 only, which leads to serious doubts about the solution's validity. To overcome the drawbacks in previous work, an improved modelling and optimisation approach has been developed. Light-hydrocarbon production and integrated flash calculation are incorporated into a hydrogen consumer model. An optimisation framework is developed to solve the resulting NLP problem. Both the CONOPT solver in GAMS and a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm are tested to identify a suitable optimisation engine. In a case study, the CONOPT solver out-performs the SA solver.

40|$|In rodent neonates, the {{neurotransmitter}} serotonin (5 -HT) modulates {{the activity}} of both the medullary respiratory rhythm generator and the cervical phrenic motoneurons. To determine whether 5 -HT also contributes to the maturation of the respiratory network, experiments were conducted in vitro on the brainstem-spinal cord preparation of neonatal mice originating from the control strain (C 3 H) and the monoamine oxidase A-deficient strain, which has a brain perinatal 5 -HT excess (Tg 8). At birth, the Tg 8 respiratory network is unable to generate a respiratory pattern as stable as that produced by the C 3 <b>H</b> <b>network,</b> and the modulation by 5 -HT of the network activity present in C 3 H neonates is lacking in Tg 8 neonates. In addition, the morphology of the phrenic motoneurons is altered in Tg 8 neonates; the motoneuron dendritic tree loses the C 3 H bipolar aspect but exhibits an increased number of spines and varicosities. These abnormalities were prevented in Tg 8 neonates by treating pregnant Tg 8 dams with the 5 -HT synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine or a 5 -HT(2 A) receptor antagonist but were induced in wild-type neonates by treating C 3 H dams with a 5 -HT(2 A) receptor agonist. We conclude that 5 -HT contributes, probably via 5 -HT(2 A) receptors, to the normal maturation of the respiratory network but alters it when present in excess. Disorders affecting 5 -HT metabolism during gestation may therefore have deleterious effects on newborns...|$|E

We study the separation between the two ribbons seen in H as a function of time and find that the separation motion consisted of a fast stage of rapid motion at a speed of about 15 km s 1 in the first 20 minutes and a slow stage with a separation speed of about 1 km s 1 lasting for 2 hr. We then estimate the rate of the magnetic reconnection in the corona, as represented by the electric fields Ec in the reconnecting current sheet, by measuring the ribbon motion speed and the magnetic fields obtained from MDI. We find that there were two stages as well in evolution of the electric fields: Ec 1 Vcm 1 averaged over 20 minutes in the early stage, followed by Ec 0 : 1 Vcm 1 in the subsequent 2 hr. The two stages of the ribbon motion and electric fields coincide with the impulsive and decaying phases of the flare, respectively, yielding clear evidence that the impulsive flare energy release is governed by the fast magnetic reconnection in the corona. We also measure the projected heights of the erupting filament from KSO H and SOHO/EIT images. The filament started to rise 20 minutes before the flare.

40|$|The {{long-lasting}} {{enhancement of}} synaptic effectiveness known as long-term potentiation (LTP) {{is considered to}} be the cellular basis of long-term memory. LTP elicits changes at the cellular and molecular level, including temporally specific alterations in gene networks. LTP {{can be seen as a}} biological process in which a transient signal sets a new homeostatic state that is remembered by cellular regulatory systems. Previously, we have shown that early growth response (Egr) transcription factors are of fundamental importance to gene networks recruited early after LTP induction. From a systems perspective, we hypothesized that these networks will show less stable architecture, while networks recruited later will exhibit increased stability, being more directly related to LTP consolidation. Using random Boolean network simulations we found that the network derived at 24 h was markedly more stable than those derived at 20 min or 5 h post-LTP. This temporal effect on the vulnerability of the networks is mirrored by what is known about the vulnerability of LTP and memory itself. Differential gene co-expression analysis further highlighted the importance of the Egr family and found a rapid enrichment in connectivity at 20 min, followed by a systematic decrease, providing a potential explanation for the down-regulation of gene expression at 24 h documented in our preceding studies. We also found that the architecture exhibited by a control and the 24 <b>h</b> LTP co-expression <b>networks</b> fit well to a scale-free distribution, known to be robust against perturbations. By contrast the 20 min and 5 <b>h</b> <b>networks</b> showed more truncated distributions. These results suggest that a new homeostatic state is achieved 24 h post-LTP.

40|$|Low-molecular-weight gelators (LMWGs) form {{a network}} via non-covalent {{interactions}} to immobilise the surrounding bulk solvent {{and form a}} gel. Whilst such gels are highly responsive and dynamic, they are often mechanically weak. In order to enhance the mechanical strength of such networks, the LMWG network can be supplemented with a second network formed from stronger polymer gelators (PGs) to yield a multi-component, multi-functional material – a hybrid gel. By using this multi-functionality, hybrid gels were made that could demonstrate the following: a) robustness yet responsiveness, b) spatial control over the formation of one network {{in the presence of}} another, and c) temporal control over the formation of one network in the presence of another. For the first aim, a pH-responsive LMWG (1, 3 : 2, 4 -dibenzylidene-D-sorbitol dicarboxylic acid, DBS-CO 2 H) was combined with the robust PG agarose. The assembly of DBS-CO 2 H in the presence and absence of agarose was investigated by NMR and CD spectroscopies, whilst materials properties were examined by rheology. DBS-CO 2 H was found to retain its pH-responsive character, as was demonstrated by cycling the pH within the gel – whilst the DBS-CO 2 <b>H</b> <b>network</b> could be switched “on” or “off”, the robust agarose network remained intact. Following this, DBS-CO 2 H was combined with the photo-inducible PG poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDM). Spectroscopic methods and electron microscopy showed that the kinetics and morphology of DBS-CO 2 H assembly were impacted by the presence of PEGDM. The application of a mask during photoirradiation allowed patterning of the PEGDM network to form a material with two distinct, spatially-resolved regions, defined as a “multidomain gel”, achieving the second aim. The different domains had different properties with regards to the diffusion and release of dyes. DBS-CO 2 H was then combined with another pH-responsive LMWG (1, 3 : 2, 4 -dibenzylidene-D-sorbitol-dicarbonyl-glycine, DBS-Gly). The two gelators showed a good degree of kinetic self-sorting, their self-assembly being triggered at different pHs. It was possible to use two proton sources – the slow hydrolysis of glucono-δ-lactone, and the more rapid photoacid generator diphenyliodonium nitrate – to achieve a two-step process of network formation. As the second step was UV-initiated, photopatterned multi-component gels were produced; these materials were both spatially and temporally resolved, achieving the third aim. Finally, the combination of DBS-CO 2 H, DBS-Gly and PEGDM into a three-gelator, multi-component hybrid hydrogel was investigated. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Mammalian {{spinal cord}} can {{generate}} well-coordinated locomotor activity called fictive locomotion {{in the absence}} of any higher brain center input or of rhythmic sensory feedback. This activity clearly provides evidence for the central pattern generator (CPG) that produces the locomotor rhythm. Such CPG consists of glutamatergic excitatory and glycinergic and GABAergic inhibitory interneuronal connections that finally excite or inhibit the motoneuronal pools. Many factors including fast (ion channels) and slow (modulatory G-protein coupled receptors; GPCRs) processes control these neuronal pools to act rhythmically. These factors are perturbed following spinal cord injury (SCI) in the early and late phases. The present study addresses the role of a few modulatory processes, namely acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) and cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB 1 Rs) at both initial and the late phases of injury. Objectives: Recent evidence has shown that the deletion of ASICs slows down the progression of disease in ischemic conditions, whereas the same protocol increases seizure severity. CB 1 R activation or deletion also results in neuroprotective or toxic mechanisms. In order to understand the importance of ASICs and CB 1 Rs in the spinal locomotor circuits, it is crucial to analyze them in physiological and pathological conditions. To investigate this issue, both organotypic slice culture and an in vitro rat spinal cord model were used. With the latter, fictive locomotion can be recorded from the ventral roots of the lumbar region for a time window of 24 <b>h.</b> <b>Network</b> parameters like synaptic transmission, fictive locomotion and disinhibited bursting provide information to explain the physiological modifications and pathological severity after excitotoxicity caused by transient kainate (KA; glutamate analog) application. Drugs that modulate CB 1 Rs and ASICs may supply evidence for the role of these processes in fictive locomotion. Results and conclusion: Our results show that the CB 1 R activation or block for 24 h diminished the locomotor rhythm. In particular, CB 1 R pharmacological block completely depressed both dorsal root (DR) and chemically evoked fictive locomotion. This depression was amplified following KA treatment. Furthermore, a limited neuroprotection was observed after CB 1 R agonists (anandamide; AEA or 2 -arachidanoyl glycerol; 2 AG) and an endogenous cannabinoid uptake inhibitor. These results allow us to propose the innate activity of CB 1 R (that is well preserved) to be important after KA mediated excitotoxicity, while any neuroprotective role might come in later phases after injury. A low concentration of KA that can induce a borderline injury elicited rapid glutamate release combined with proton discharge (acidification) in the organotypic SCI model. In response to this challenge, the ASIC subtypes (1 a, 1 b, 2 a and 3) mRNA levels were found to be elevated after 24 h. Both neuronal numbers and network activity were highly depressed after application of ASIC pharmacological blockers that intensified the consequences of KA treatment. These results indicate that moderate acidification might be beneficial for the recovery (or limitation) of KA mediated excitotoxicity. Hence, this study demonstrates that both ASICs and CB 1 Rs activity are important in the early phase of experimental SCI in vitro. Their pharmacological modulation can outline future strategies for neuroprotection...|$|E

In this paper, we are describing the all prominent attacks and alsoVarious attacks on the routing protocol are described in literature in a consistent manner to provide a concise comparison on attack types. To the best of our knowledge...|$|R

A mobility metric,whi h quantifies th e#ect of node movement in order to measure th communication potential in a mobile network, can be used to develop an adaptive ad <b>h</b> c <b>network</b> protocol. We provide a set of requirements necessary for a mobility metric to form a basis for an adaptive protocol. Next, we introduce a mobility metric, link duration,tha meets our demanding requirements and is a good indicator of protocol performance. In addition, we investigateth suitability for enabling adaptive adh oc network protocols of several previously proposed popular metrics...|$|R
