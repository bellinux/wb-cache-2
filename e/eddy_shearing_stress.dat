Bibliography: leaves [91]- 97. ix, 97 l graphs, tablesA two-dimensional, time dependent, {{numerical}} {{model of the}} atmospheric boundary layer is formulated and used to investigate various characteristics of air motion when a change occurs in the roughness of the underlying surface. The model assumes a dry adiabatic atmosphere and adiabatic changes of state, no dynamic pressure effects due to flow accelerations and no vertical displacement of the zero-velocity level at the lower boundary when a discontinuity in surface roughness is encountered. Numerical evaluation of all terms in the resulting equations shows little change in the computed fields of velocity if an incompressible atmosphere is assumed and horizontal mixing is neglected. A computational stability analysis is made which provides the relationship between time-step and grid spacing necessary to insure convergence of the numerical solution. For horizontally homogeneous conditions, comparison of the numerical solutions with various analytical solutions shows that the errors inherent in the finite difference formulation {{can be reduced to}} any desirable level by reducing the grid spacing, particularly near the lower boundary. Computed quantities include the two-dimensional distributions of horizontal velocity, vertical velocity and <b>eddy</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>stress.</b> Increasing surface roughness causes a decrease in the horizontal velocity near the lower boundary. This results in upward vertical motion. For a prevailing geostrophic wind speed of 10 m/sec and roughness parameters varying from 1 cm through 10 cm, maximum vertical motion on the order of 5 cm/sec is found over the roughness discontinuity at heights ranging from 50 to 100 meters. Vertical velocities in excess of 0. 1 cm/sec are found several meters upstream from the discontinuity and persist for several. hundred meters downstream for the cases considered. The computations also show that a nearly logarithmic wind profile with associated constant shearing stress becomes established throughout a layer which increases in depth with distance downwind from the roughness discontinuity. The ratio of depth to downwind distance of this layer lies between 1 / 50 and 1 / 100. Reestablishment of the logarithmic profile does not imply equilibrium flow, however. It is found that a fetch on the order of several kilometers is necessary before the surface eddy stress differs by less than ten percent from the final. equilibrium values. Excellent quantitative' agreement is found with Panofsky and Townsend (1964), who employed data of Kutzbach (1961) to show that their theory agreed with observations. Because of the inability of the {{numerical model}} to consider zero-plane displacement and non-neutral atmospheric stability, both of which are probably significant and certainly present in the observations available from the University of Wisconsin, no further quantitative comparisons were made. However, the general features of the computed velocity and stress distributions agree very well with results of Stearns and Lettau (1963), hence there is at least good qualitative agreement with observations. Suggestions are made for generalizing and improving the numerical model...|$|E

It is the objective of this study to get a better insight into the physical processes in the surf zone. In this study, we make use of the data obtained during the LIP llDexperiments (Arcilla et al. [1994] and Roelvink and Reniers [1994]). We derive the characteristics of bedforms from measured profiles. We relate these bedform characteristics to the hydraulic conditions and analyse if they can be predicted with present prediction methods. Further, we develop an inverse modelling technique, which is based on the mass and momentum balance equations. With this technique we derive values of important physical parameters, like <b>eddy</b> viscosity, <b>shear</b> <b>stresses,</b> friction factors, bed roughness and mass flux. The derived physical parameters are compared with present methods to describe these parameters. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} evaluated {{flow characteristics}} in three irrigation system components: Venturi injector, chemigation oil drop generator, and pressurized landscape bubbler. Foliar chemicals are often applied as oils through irrigation systems {{in order to}} prevent wash off from leaves. The system application uniformity and efficiency depends on oil drop size distribution. The primary parameters that influence oil drop size are water flow rate and <b>eddy</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> interfacial tension and oil viscosity. In this laboratory experiment, the oil-based chemical drop diameter distributions were evaluated over a range of these physical parameters. Drop sizes were in the range of an equation used to predict drop size in turbulent flow; however, there was very little change in drop size with change in physical parameters. The injection flow rate for four chemicals (CAN 17, UAN 32, soybean oil, and OrchexRTM) and water was measured over a range of pressure differentials between the upstream and downstream side of the Venturi, and over a range of chemical temperatures. The injection flow rate for water, with low viscosity, did not change significantly with temperature. However, the injection rate for the four chemicals was correlated with temperature and viscosity. If the chemical tank temperature variation is 20 °C during the day, then the injection flow rate variation would be in the range of 50 % for soybean oil, 30 % for OrchexRTM, 10 % for UAN 32, and 5 % for CAN 17. Five commercial bubbler with flow rate screw adjustments were evaluated: RainbirdRTM, ToroRTM, IrritrolRTM, HunterRTM, and LegoRTM. The coefficient of variation at full flow for the five brands ranged from 8. 2 % to 20. 8 %. Bubbler flow rates were measured at 140 and 210 kPa over a range of number of screw turns. Equations were developed for each bubbler based on the emitter flow equation, Q = KHx. Because K and x varied with number of screw turns, equations were developed for K and x for each bubbler based on regression of flow data. Correlation between calculated flow rates with the equations and measured flow rates was in the range of 80 % to 90 %...|$|R

The &quot;viscous &quot; Cartesian grid is capable of resolving boundary layers with high-aspect ratio projected viscous layer grids. Compared with an Octree data structure, the 2 n tree data structure supports anisotropic grid adaptations {{in any of the}} coordinate directions in an arbitrary manner. This capability enables flow features such as shocks, shear layers, and wakes to be resolved very efficiently. In this paper, steady-state Navier-Stokes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses were performed on a cylindrical body Ogive using five different turbulence models in the commercial flow solver Cobalt with the 2 n based Cartesian grid generator. Turbulence models tested were the Spalart-Allmaras (SA), Menter-Shear-Stress Transport (SST), coupled Detached Eddy Simulation – Spalart-Allmaras (DES-SA), coupled Detached <b>Eddy</b> Simulation- <b>Shear</b> <b>Stress</b> Transport (DES-SST), and the κ-ω model.

The governing equations are derived from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with assumptions of shallow water flows including bed frictions, <b>eddy</b> viscosity, wind <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> and Coriolis forces. The thermal effects are incorporated in the momentum equation by using a Boussinesq approximation. The dispersion of free-surface temperature is modelled by an advection-diffusion equation.

Neither upwind discretization procedures nor Riemann problem solvers are needed in discretizing the shallow water equations.

We sought to determine the importance of <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> in maintaining normal dilation and normal levels of ecNOS in rat soleus feed arteries (SFA). SFA were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats and cannulated for in vitro microscopy (Fig. 6). SFA were exposed to no <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> low <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> or high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> conditions for 4 hours. After 4 hours, endothelium-dependent dilation (acetylcholine: ACh) and endothelium-independent dilation (sodium nitroprusside: SNP) were tested. Arteries were then uncannulated, mRNA was isolated, and RT-PCR for ecNOS mRNA was performed to determine whether <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> altered ecNOS gene expression. <b>Shear</b> <b>stress</b> did not alter dilation to ACh, but dilation to SNP was greater in the high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> arteries. ecNOS mRNA content was greater in high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> arteries than low <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> arteries.

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that exposing endothelial cells to steady or non-reversing pulsatile <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> produces a healthy, anti-atherogenic endothelium, whereas a reversing pulsatile <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> promotes an unhealthy, pro-atherogenic endothelium. To further investigate this hypothesis, a novel parallel plate flow chamber system {{was used to}} expose human endothelial cells to a pro-atherogenic reversing <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> waveform designed to simulate the wall <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> at the carotid sinus, a region prone to atherosclerosis. Cells exposed to this reversing <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> were compared to cells exposed {{to high levels of}} steady <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (15 dynes/cm²), low steady <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (1 dyne/cm², the time-average of the carotid <b>shear</b> <b>stress),</b> and static culture conditions. Functional analysis confirmed previous findings that reversing <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> increases cell proliferation and monocyte adhesion. Microarray results indicate that although there are unique sets of genes controlled by both low average <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> and by reversing flow, more genes were controlled by low average <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> We propose that low-time average <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> and not fluid reversal/oscillation, may be the more significant mechanical force. The reversing <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> system was also used to investigate two shear stress-responsive genes, CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1. Both were maximally up-regulated at arterial steady <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> of at least 15 dynes/cm² and reversing pulsatile <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> attenuated expression of both genes. Furthermore, AhR nuclear localization and CYP 1 A 1 protein expression correlate with the flow patterns in the mouse aortic arch. The data strongly suggest that the AhR/CYP 1 pathway promotes an anti-atherogenic phenotype in the endothelium. Changes in free zinc were measured under different <b>shear</b> <b>stresses.</b> High steady <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> dramatically increases the levels of free zinc in endothelial cells as compared to cells grown in static culture. This increase in free zinc is attenuated under reversing <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> and low steady <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> which correlates with an increase in zinc-binding metallothinein proteins and zinc exporter Znt- 1. Overall, the findings provide further insight into endothelial responses to mechanical forces and may be important in understanding mechanisms of atherosclerotic development and localization to regions of disturbed flow.

Atherosclerotic lesions developed invariably in the regions with lowered <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> or vortices, whereas the regions of increased <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> were protected. Lowered <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> lesions were larger (intima/media, 1. 38 +/- 0. 68 versus 0. 22 +/- 0. 04); contained fewer smooth muscle cells (1. 9 +/- 1. 6 % versus 26. 3 +/- 9. 7 %), less collagen (15. 3 +/- 1. 0 % versus 22. 2 +/- 1. 0 %), and more lipids (15. 8 +/- 0. 9 % versus 10. 2 +/- 0. 5 %); and showed more outward vascular remodeling (214 +/- 19 % versus 117 +/- 9 %) than did oscillatory <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> lesions.

40|$|AbstractProlonged {{exposure}} to fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> alters leukocyte functions {{associated with the}} immune response. We examined the initial response of freshly isolated human leukocytes to fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> under high magnification. Adherent leukocytes exhibit a rapid biomechanical response to physiological levels of fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> After passive displacement {{in the direction of}} a constant fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> adherent leukocytes actively recoil back in the opposite direction of the fluid flow. Recoil is observed within seconds of the applied fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> Simultaneously, fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> induces a stiffening of the cell. The immediate cell displacement in response to a step increase in fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> is greatly attenuated in subsequent steps compared to the initial fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> step. Recoil is not mediated by actin polymerization-dependent mechanisms, as cytochalasin D had no effect on this early response. However, stiffening was determined in part by an intact actin cytoskeleton. Inhibiting myosin force generation with ML- 7 abolished the recoil and stiffening responses, implicating force generation by myosin as an important contributor to the early leukocyte response to fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> This initial <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> response may be particularly important in facilitating leukocyte attachment under sustained fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> by the flowing blood in the microcirculation...|$|R
40|$|An {{instrument}} for measuring <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> for erosion in situ (ISIS) {{has been developed}} to measure the erosion <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> of muddy sediments on intertidal mud flats. Erosion <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> is defined in this paper as the minimum applied bed <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> required to initiate erosion and remove sediment from the bed surface. An applied <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> is generated by the flow through and around a specially shaped bell head, which draws water radially across the bed into {{the centre of the}} bell head. The applied <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> {{is a function of the}} distance from the bell head to the bed surface and the discharge through the system. The design of ISIS was assisted by the use of a computational numerical flow modelling package. The operating conditions giving the most even <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> across the whole test section were discharges of 0. 01 - 0. 6 ls(- 1), and bell-to-bed distance of 4 - 8 mm giving a <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> of 0. 02 - 5 Nm(- 2). The ISIS system was calibrated using hot film <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> probes. The calibration data gave a 92 % fit to the calibration function for <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> Laboratory measurements with ISIS of the erosion <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> of mud beds consolidated for c. 1. 5 days, showed surface <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> of 0. 11 - 0. 24 Nm(- 2).

The effects of orbital and laminar <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> on EC morphology, proliferation, and apoptosis were compared. MethodsECs {{were exposed to}} orbital <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> with an orbital shaker (210 rpm) or laminar <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (14 dyne/cm 2) with a parallel plate. <b>Shear</b> <b>stress</b> in the orbital shaker was measured with optical velocimetry. Cell proliferation was assessed with direct counting and proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining; apoptosis was assessed with transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling staining. Cell surface E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule expression were assessed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Akt phosphorylation was assessed with Western blotting. ResultsOrbital <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> increased EC proliferation by 29 % and 3 [H]thymidine incorporation two-fold compared to 16 % and 38 % decreases, respectively, in ECs treated with laminar <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (P <. 0001 and P =. 03, analysis of variance). Cells in {{the periphery of the}} culture well aligned to the direction of <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> similar to the shape change seen with laminar <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> whereas ECs {{in the center of the}} well appeared unaligned similar to ECs not exposed to <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> <b>Shear</b> <b>stress</b> at the bottom surface of the culture well was reduced in the center of the well (5 dyne/cm 2) compared to the periphery (11 dyne/cm 2); the Reynolds’ number was 2066. ECs were seeded differentially in the center and periphery of the wells. ECs in the center of the well had increased proliferation, increased apoptosis, reduced Akt phosphorylation, increased intercelluar adhesion molecule expression, and reduced E-selectin down-regulation, compared with ECs in the periphery of the well. ConclusionAlthough the orbital shaker does not apply uniform <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> throughout the culture well, arterial magnitudes of <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> are present in the periphery of the well.

There is ample evidence that atherosclerotic plaques are generated at low <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> regions in the cardiovascular system, while high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> regions are protected. In the course of plaque progression, advanced plaques start to encroach into the lumen, and thereby start to experience high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> at the endothelium. Until now the consequences of high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> working at the endothelium of an advanced plaque are unknown. As high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> influences tissue regression, we hypothesised that high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> can destabilise the plaque by cap weakening leading to ulceration. We investigated this hypothesis in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of a 67 -year-old woman with a plaque in the carotid artery at baseline and an ulcer at ten-month follow-up. The lumen, plaque components (lipid/necrotic core, intraplaque haemorrhage) and ulcer were reconstructed three dimensionally and the geometry at baseline was used for <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> calculation using computational fluid dynamics.

40|$|The {{opening of}} Calcium {{permeable}} channels {{in response to}} their selective stimulus, such as mechanical stress or agonists, causes an influx of Calcium ion into cells. Intracellular calcium signalling is of importance, as the Calcium ion is a potent and versatile intracellular messenger that regulates {{a wide range of}} spatial and temporal cellular signals. Intracellular calcium level, is tightly controlled by efflux from the cell through ion transporters, sequestration in intracellular compartments, buffering high affinity cytosolic Calcium-binding proteins, and influx through regulated ion channels. Microfluidic based solutions have assisted in the investigation of various aspects of intracellular calcium signalling, due to the ability for small reagent volumes, parallelism, and short assay durations. One area of interest for biologists and engineers is mechanotransduction, in which cells sense mechanical stimulation from their surroundings, which subsequently cause a cascade of biological events in response to this stimulation. These events modulate a range of cellular functions, such as proliferation; differentiation; migration; which in turn are crucial for cellular homeostasis and function. Different mechanical forces, for instance, <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> strain/stretch, and compression are being examined on microfluidic platforms, through flow chambers, flexible membranes and valves, respectively. Of interest is <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> which if often used for the investigation of drug delivery and transport of chemical agents to target studies, {{and on the other hand}} is used as an independent stimulus - to gain a better insight into <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> flows experienced within the human body.

However, microfluidic and conventional biological strategies are limited in the <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> range, which can be applied to non-adherent cells; such strategies are limited to approximately 20 dyn/cm 2. In order to address this issue, I developed Discontinuous Dielectrophoresis, a novel microfluidic based approach to overcome the limited <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> range, such that a <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> range up to 63 dyn/cm 2 with a trapping efficiency of greater than 90 % can be investigated, as discussed in extensive detail in the thesis. Discontinuous Dielectrophoresis takes advantage of Dielectrophoresis, in which label-free, non-invasive, selective and quick immobilisation of cells can be achieved. However,unlike conventional Dielectrophoresis experiments, the electric field does not remain active during experiments, which allows biological buffers, such as HBS (HEPES buffered saline), to be supplied to the cells during experiments. In addition, the short activation of the electric field, of around 120 s, minimises damage to the cell behaviour and viability &ndash; which resulted in cell viability rates greater than 90 %. In this thesis, I focus on three different experimental <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> conditions of <b>shear</b> stimulus influence on intracellular calcium signalling, with HEK- 293 -TRPV 4 as the model cell line, transfected stably expressing TRPV 4 (Transient Receptor Potential Vaniloid). TRPV 4 is a mechano-sensitive, non-selective Ca 2 + permeable cation channel, expressed in vascular endothelial cells - which experience <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> from blood flow. TRPV 4 is a polymodal receptor, which plays important roles in cellular processes such as mechano-, thermo-, and osmo- sensation. All different conditions of <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> simulation were achieved by utilising the Discontinuous Dielectrophoresis procedure, to enable the investigation of high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> influence to be investigated. Firstly, I investigated the influence of singular <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> which occurs in a straight channel, with a singular <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> present throughout the channel. High levels of <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> were applied to non-adherent cells, with <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> up to 63 dyn/cm 2 investigated. With experiments indicating, reduced cellular and peak response times, increased pharmacological efficacy and percentage of activated cells, with increasing <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> Secondly, I investigated concurrent high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> and chemical (TRPV 4 -selective agonist, GSK 1016790 A) stimulation. Experiments were undertaken at different <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> levels and GSK 1016790 A concentrations. The experiments revealed that <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> sensitises GSK 1016790 A-evoked intracellular calcium signalling of cells in a shear-stimulus dependent manner. Thirdly, I explored the influence of a spatial <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> gradient and dynamic <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> A spatial <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> gradient was achieved via the design of a unique lateral trapezoid microfluidic microchannel, which was made possible using 3 D printing techniques. As a result the <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> profile increases laterally across the microfluidic channel, producing a spatially resolved <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> gradient, over a large <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> range. Along the spatial <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> gradient (from low to high <b>shear</b> <b>stress),</b> a decrease in the response and peak response times was observed; however, no change was observed in the maximum fold increase of the intracellular calcium level. Dynamic <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> was achieved by varying the <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> temporally on the trapezoid microfluidic platform; with the temporal <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> applied in a pulsatile like manner. Experiments revealed that the percentage of cells decreased significantly, and slower cellular and peak response times were observed, in comparison to the spatial <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> gradient (in the absence of temporal <b>shear</b> <b>stress)</b> of the same <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> level. Consequently, these investigations into different shear stimulus scenarios suggested that the role of TRPV 4 may be underestimated in endothelial cells - which experience high levels of <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> This in turn, highlighted the importance of conducting studies at high levels of <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> In particular, one must also consider more complicated scenarios, such as <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> gradients, or concurrent stimulation with chemicals or heat, for instance, at high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> levels. Or on the other hand, dynamic <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> such as temporal <b>shear</b> <b>stress...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that red blood cells (RBC) either lyse or at least experience mechanical damage following prolonged exposure to high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (= 100 Pa). Conversely, prolonged <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> exposure within the physiological range (5 - 20 Pa, 300 s) was recently reported to improve RBC deformability. This study investigated the relationships between <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> and RBC deformability to determine the breakpoint between beneficial vs. detrimental exposure to <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (i. e., "subhemolytic threshold"). A second aim {{of the study was to}} determine whether the frequency of intermittent application of <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> influenced the subhemolytic threshold. METHODS: RBC were exposed to various levels of <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (0 - 100 Pa) in a Couette type shearing system for 300 s. RBC deformability was then immediately measured via ektacytometry. Parallel experiments were conducted at the same <b>shear</b> <b>stresses,</b> except the application time differed while keeping constant the total exposure time: <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> was applied either for 30 s and repeated 10 times (10 ׳ 0 s) or applied for 15 s and repeated 20 times (20 ױ 5 s). RESULTS: For a range of donors, the subhemolytic threshold with constant <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> application was between 30 - 40 Pa. When physiological <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> was applied in an intermittent manner, more frequent applications tended to improve (i. e., increase) RBC deformability. However, when supra-physiological <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> was applied, both continuous and intermittent protocols damaged RBC. Changes of RBC mechanical behavior occurred without increases of hemoglobin in the suspending media, thus attesting to the absence of hemolysis. CONCLUSION: <b>Shear</b> <b>stress</b> has a biphasic effect on the mechanical properties of RBC, with the duration and rate of exposure appearing to have minimal impact on the subhemolytic threshold when compared with the magnitude of applied <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R

30|$|Alterations in wall <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> {{have been}} implicated in the focal {{distribution}} of coronary artery disease (Dhawan et al. 2010). Atherosclerotic plaques predominantly form in regions of low <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> whereas regions of physiological moderate <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> are generally protected in the early stage of atherosclerosis (Wentzel et al. 2012). On the other hand, advanced plaques that start to project into the lumen experience high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> at their most stenotic regions, which promotes plaque destabilization (Fukumoto et al. 2008). The vascular response to the altered <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> is also a determinant of plaque stability and the progression of atherosclerosis (Koskinas et al. 2010). Expanded arterial remodeling occurs in exposed lesions with high <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> leading to physiological and adaptive arterial enlargement to preserve the lumen and, subsequently, to restore <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> to a more physiological level (Dhawan et al. 2010). In the current study, we focused the vascular maladaptive response to increased <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> as a coronary risk marker because the dysfunctional response finely corresponded {{to the presence of}} IHD. By contrast, Gori et al. (2008) demonstrated that the vascular maladaptive response to low <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> also corresponds to the existence of IHD. However investigation is required to elucidate the more concise relationship between the vascular response to altered <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> and the risk of atherosclerosis progression.|$|R

Beyond a limit <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> it induces the cell death. Thus, the <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> is an important scale-up parameter. A better modeling of the generated <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> in the medium and their impact on the cell would achieve a bioreactor scale-up more effective. In this work, the <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> is studied in a new design of mixing system especially developed by the biotechnological industry Artelis S. A. for a single-used animal cell bioreactor. The aims of this work are to develop a methodology to determine the <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> in a device, to model the effect of <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> on cellular viability and to use this model as optimization tool and to study the scale-up of the bioreactor. In a first step, the Artelis device is simulated by Computational Fluid Dynamics. These simulations are experimentally validated and are the base of the model of <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> generated in the device. In a second step, this model of <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> is confronted to the experimental measurements of cellular viabilities for different impeller rotation speed. Hence, a model of effects of <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> on the cellular viability is established. Finally, two scales-up are simulated to study their impacts on the cellular viability. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
