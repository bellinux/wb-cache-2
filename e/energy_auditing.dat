This resulted in energy consumption among households to be very wasteful. For that action is required to minimize the consumption of household electrical energy. There are several ways {{that can be done}} to overcome this problem, one of which is to conduct a conservation <b>energy</b> <b>audit.</b> This audit is done using LEAP software. The conservation <b>energy</b> <b>audit</b> process is divided into 3 sections, i. e. energy surveys, initial <b>energy</b> <b>audits,</b> and detailed <b>energy</b> <b>audits.</b> The result of conservation <b>energy</b> <b>audits</b> undertaken include loads of 450, 900, 1300 and 2200 KWh.

5000|$|The general audit (alternatively {{called a}} mini-audit, site energy audit or {{detailed}} energy audit or complete site energy audit) expands on the preliminary audit described above by collecting more {{detailed information about}} facility operation and by performing a more detailed evaluation of energy conservation measures. Utility bills are collected for a 12- to 36-month period to allow the auditor to evaluate the facility's energy demand rate structures and energy usage profiles. If interval meter data is available, the detailed energy profiles that such data makes possible will typically be analyzed for signs of energy waste. [...] Additional metering of specific energy-consuming systems is often performed to supplement utility data. In-depth interviews with facility operating personnel are conducted to provide {{a better understanding of}} major energy consuming systems and to gain insight into short- and longer-term energy consumption patterns.This type of audit will be able to identify all energy-conservation measures appropriate for the facility, given its operating parameters. A detailed financial analysis is performed for each measure based on detailed implementation cost estimates, site-specific operating cost savings, and the customer's investment criteria. Sufficient detail is provided to justify project implementation.The evolution of cloud-based <b>energy</b> <b>auditing</b> software platforms is enabling the managers of commercial buildings to collaborate with general and specialty trades contractors in performing general and energy system-specific audits. The benefit of software-enabled collaboration is the ability to identify the full range of energy efficiency options that may be applicable to the specific building under study with [...] "live time" [...] cost and benefit estimates supplied by local contractors.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} guidebook is to give <b>energy</b> <b>audit</b> {{programme}} developers {{clear and}} comprehensive guidance on the topics {{that need to be}} considered at the start and throughout the lifetime of an <b>energy</b> <b>audit</b> programme.

In 2009, bilateral Development Cooperation between Nepal and the Federal Republic of Germany, has agreed upon the joint implementation of “Nepal Energy Efficiency Programme”. The lead executing agencies for the implementation are the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS). The aim of the programme is the promotion of energy efficiency in policy making, in rural and urban households {{as well as in the}} industry.Due to the lack of a government organization that promotes energy efficiency in the country, the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) has established the Energy Efficiency Centre under his roof to promote energy conservation in the private sector.

The Centre is also supported by Nepal Energy Efficiency Programme of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit.A study conducted in 2012 found out that Nepalese industries could save 160,000 Megawatt hours of electricity and 8,000 Terajoule of thermal energy (like diesel, furnace oil and coal) every year. These savings are equivalent to annual energy cost cut of up to 6.4 Billion Nepalese Rupees.As a result of Nepal Economic Forum 2014, an economic reform agenda in the priority sectors was declared focusing on energy conservation among others. In the energy reform agenda the government of Nepal gave the commitment to introduce incentive packages in the budget of the fiscal year 2015/16 for industries that practices energy efficiency or use efficient technologies (incl. cogeneration).|$|E
