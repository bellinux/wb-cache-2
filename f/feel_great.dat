On February24, 1923, commission secretary Hans Caemmerer showed the completed models to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary Margaret O'Reilly, who was pleased with them. [...] O'Reilly suggested that if Beach was certain there would be no further changes, that he send photographs of the models to the commission's offices, to be forwarded with its endorsement to the Bureau of the Mint in Washington. [...] This was done, and the designs were approved by both Mint Director Frank Edgar Scobey and Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon on March8.

500|$|The album's lyrical themes explore [...] "hate, {{ignorance and}} sexism", and AllMusic noted its feminist lyrics. According to George Lang of The Oklahoman, [...] "Kittie's lyrics {{are full of}} spit and venom, {{directed}} at preppy cheerleaders, rich kids, rude boys and women who trade on their sexuality". According to the Sun-Sentinel, [...] "Raven" [...] is [...] "inspired by a death threat" [...] from another band. [...] "Jonny" [...] is reportedly a reaction to male domination of women, and [...] "Paperdoll", according to Morgan Lander, is about the degradation of women as objects. Fallon Bowman said that [...] "Choke" [...] is [...] "about someone telling you that they love you so much, and they put you up on a pedestal and make you <b>feel</b> <b>great,</b> then they {{turn around and say}} 'screw you. According to Morgan Lander, [...] "Do You Think I'm a Whore" [...] "is about not judging a book by its cover" [...] and the song's title was given [...] "basically to prove people wrong". [...] "Charlotte" [...] was inspired by a serial killer from the book Rites of Burial by Tom Jackman and Troy Cole. [...] "Brackish" [...] "is a commentary on a friend of" [...] Kittie [...] "and the relationship that she was in at the time".|$|E
500|$|Every November, Vukovar's {{authorities}} hold {{four days}} of festivities to commemorate the town's fall, culminating in a [...] "Procession of Memory" [...] held on 18 November. This represents the expulsion of the town's Croat inhabitants and involves a five-kilometre (3.1 mile) walk from the city's hospital to the Croatian Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims. It is attended by {{tens of thousands of}} people from across Croatia. Local Serbs have avoided participating in the Croatian commemorations, often preferring either to leave the town or stay indoors on 18 November. Until 2003, they held a separate, low-key commemoration at the Serbian military cemetery on 17 November. Such commemorations have been held on 18 November since then. The RSK-era term [...] "Liberation Day" [...] has been dropped, but Serbs also avoid using the Croatian terminology, instead calling it simply [...] "18 November". The issue of how to remember the Serb dead has posed particular difficulties. Local Serbs who died fighting alongside the JNA were buried by the Croatian Serb authorities on a plot of land where Croatian houses had once stood. The gravestones were originally topped with a sculptural evocation of the V-shaped Serbian military cap, or šajkača. After Vukovar's reintegration into Croatia, the gravestones were repeatedly vandalised. The Serb community replaced them with more neutral gravestones without overt military connotations. Vukovar Serbs report feeling marginalised and excluded from places associated with Croatian nationalist sentiment, such as war monuments. The Croatian sociologist Kruno Kardov gives the example of a prominent memorial, a large cross made from white stone, where the Vuka flows into the Danube. According to Kardov, Serbs rarely if ever go there, and they <b>feel</b> <b>great</b> stress if they do. A Serb boy spoke of how he wanted to know what was written on the monument but was too frightened to go and read the inscription; one day he got up the courage, ran to the monument, read it and immediately ran back to [...] "safety". As Kardov puts it, Vukovar remains divided by an [...] "invisible boundary line ... inscribed only on the cognitive map of the members of one particular group." ...|$|E

[...] The Mail & Guardian, which had itself published a controversial cartoon of Mohammed in its pages, distanced itself from the group, noting that it [...] "claimed to be a protest against restrictions on freedom of speech and religious fanaticism, but had seemingly become a forum for venting Islamophobic sentiment." [...] Hugo Rifkind, writing for The Times, called the Facebook initiative a [...] "grubby project": [...] "... there’s something here that makes me twitch. I think it’s the 'everybody'. It’s the 'everybody' of a man at the back of a mob, trying to persuade other people to get lynching. If a cartoonist wants to satirise Islam by drawing Mohammed, I’m on his side all the way. But among the 13,000 pictures on the EDMD Facebook page, you have Mohammed as a dog in a veil, Mohammed as a pig and Mohammed as a monkey. That’s not resistance, but picking a fight. Issuing a death threat against somebody who drew a picture isn’t my thing, but this isn’t either." [...] Bilal Baloch, writing for The Guardian, called the initiative [...] "juvenile" [...] and [...] "an irresponsible poke-in-the-eye", {{while at the same time}} criticizing the Pakistani government's response, and calling on [...] "Pakistan's Internet community to engage in an organised and compelling dialogue: if not with the offenders, then most certainly with the rest of the world that is watching." ...|$|E
