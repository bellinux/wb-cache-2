50|$|<b>Fifth</b> <b>wheels</b> were {{originally}} {{not a complete}} circle and were hand forged. When mass production of buggy parts {{began in the early}} 19th century, <b>fifth</b> <b>wheels</b> were among the first products to be made. There were a number of patents awarded for fifth-wheel design. Edward and Charles Everett, Quincy, Illinois patented a type of <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1850, followed by Gutches' metallic head block and <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1870 and Wilcox <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1905.|$|R
5000|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> for motorized trucks is often credited to US inventor Charles H. Martin of the Martin Rocking <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> Co. who invented the device in 1915. [...] It was submitted for patent in 1915, and finalized in 1916. Herman Farr invented it, and Martin hooked up with him and became the assignee. When they formed the Martin <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> company Martin was president and Farr was named secretary. The 5th wheel was Farr's invention. Martin capitalized on it. [...] "It's a fair question whether you really can consider the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> as a milestone separate from the semi-trailer. After all, {{the purpose of the}} <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> is to link the tractor and the trailer; indeed, trailers existed before Charles H. Martin introduced the Martin Rocking <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> in 1915. At the time, the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> literally was a wheel that moved with the trailer—unlike today’s technology that secures a kingpin. What makes the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> so important is the ability it gave fleet owners to attach large trailers to tractors easily and safely and the freedom it gave them to switch out trailers. Without a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel,</b> the modern distribution system would look quite different as drop-and-hook would not be easy. The semi-trailer increased the capacity of trucks, but it was the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> that brought the flexibility for drivers to keep moving while receivers unloaded the loads they just delivered." ...|$|R

25|$|The <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> {{coupling}} {{provides a}} pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some recreational vehicles have a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> configuration, requiring the coupling {{to be installed}} {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck as a towing vehicle. The coupling consists of a coupling pin (or kingpin) {{on the front of the}} semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> on the rear of the towing vehicle. In 1911, Charles Martin invented the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> coupler consisting of a round plate with a hole in it, attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.|$|R

50|$|The {{two types}} of {{couplings}} are <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> coupling and automatic. In some applications, no separable coupling is fitted, and the trailer is bolted to the tractor unit, using a bearing, and rocker feet as are used under a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> skid plate.|$|R
50|$|Today's <b>fifth</b> <b>wheels</b> {{allow the}} {{trailers}} to {{slide into the}} <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> and lock into it, and are a very reliable unit when maintained and serviced properly. The engagement of the king pin into the fifth-wheel locking mechanism is {{the only means of}} connection between tractor and trailer; no other device or safety mechanism is used. Couplers and pintle hooks use safety chains {{in the event of a}} trailer separation while going down the road. Trailer-to-trailer connection can also be made by using <b>fifth</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
