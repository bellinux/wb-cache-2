40|$|The Himalaya is well {{recognized}} for its bio-physical diversity and socio-cultural heritage, traditional systems and an ample quantity of indigenous knowledge. The {{study was conducted}} with the help of Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tool to document the diversity of <b>fodder</b> <b>plants</b> of Betalghat Block of Nainital District (Western Himalaya). Total 210 <b>fodder</b> <b>plants</b> species belonging to 70 families, 164 genera of different habits such as trees (35 %), shrubs (31 %), herbs (25 %), and climbers (9 %), were recorded. Out of 70 families, 12 dominant families were Poaceae (18 species), followed by Fabaceae (16 species), Moraceae (10 species), Rosaceae (10 species), Asteraceae (8 species), Euphorbiaceae (7 species), Mimosaceae (6 species), Caesalpinaceae (5 species), Ranunculaceae (5 species), Rhamnaceae (5 species), Urticaceae (5 species) and Rubiaceae (5 species). Of the total recorded species, 41 % of the species were used during winter days, 38 % during summer and 21 % throughout the year. For each species, scientific and vernacular names, multipurpose uses (Fuel, medicinal, timber, agricultural tools, religious and fiber) were used. For the conservation of <b>fodder</b> <b>plant</b> species prioritization, mass multiplication with afforestation, reforestation and forest rehabilitation must be done.
