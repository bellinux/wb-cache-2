I propose an extraordinary act of statesmanship and courage - an act at once noble and heartbreaking; at once serving the greater interests of the nation, the institution of the Presidency, and the stated goals for which he so successfully campaigned" [...] - Nixon's resignation. Buckley was the first major conservative Republican figure to call for such a resignation. Nixon did not resign at that time, but eventually did lose the support of other key Republican figures, including Sen. Barry Goldwater, and ultimately resigned on Aug. 9, 1974.|$|E

The Church's education, healthcare and social services in these backward areas has empowered the weak, poor and deprived vested interests of vote banks and cheap labour. The emancipation through education, healthcare, awareness of alternatives and provision of opportunities have set the oppressed classes free from the clutches of the upper caste or rich Hindus and slavery of their political masters. These interests are therefore hitting back at the Christians to maintain their hold on those, whom they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exploiting</b> since ages... We condemn those indulging in conversion by force or inducement. Catholics do not accept a conversion, unless it comes from the heart. But the saffron brigade raises this bogey, since in believes in Geobbels's (Nazi Propaganda Chief Joseph Goebbels) [...] principle of repeating a lie umpteen times, so that it will stick. Another ploy is to divide us into Catholics and Protestants, so that they can divide and rule. This makes it easy for Hindutva radicals to take the remaining Christian population.

The [...] "Book of Austria" [...] published {{by the government in}} 1948 stated that Austria has been a country of simple, peaceful people of high culture, kind Catholics famous not for their wars or politics but for their ancient traditions. The place of an internal enemy (Nazism) of the new ideology took the familiar foreign enemy - Bolshevism. The image of an [...] "innocent victim", mostly addressed to the victory states and estimated on the near pullout of the occupational troops, fitted into the internal policy well too. The [...] "victim theory" [...] assumed two forms: one for internal and one for foreign use. Austrians still <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exploiting</b> the slogan of the Moscow Declaration about [...] "Hitler's first victim" [...] in their foreign politics. But inside Austria it was transformed into the newest unifying myth that all the Austrians, without any exception, have been the victims. Following the political necessity all the sections of the society were sequentially included to the list of the victims. Former Nazis were included to the myth as [...] "victims" [...] who have been deluded and deceived by the foreign tempter. Soon after the Federal Elections of 1949 (Nationalratswahl in Österreich 1949) they were officially recognized the [...] "victims" [...] of denazification and all of those who they have ever victimized. In 1949 Rosa Jochmann, ideologist of social democrats, anti-fascist of the immediate past and former prisoner of Ravensbrück, presented the new doctrine in this way:We all were the victims of fascism. A soldier who has come through the war in its worst form at the front was the victim. The population of the home front, who has been afraid of waiting for air-raid alarm and who has been dreaming of getting rid of bombing horror, was the victim. Those who had to leave their motherland were the victims … and finally we, unprotected victims of SS, inmates of prisons and camps, were the victims.|$|E
50|$|An {{official}} at the Ministry of Labour said inspection teams from the ministry are closely monitoring companies who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>exploiting</b> people with disabilities {{in order to encourage}} their Saudization rates. The officials check on employees with disabilities during inspection rounds to identify the nature of the work, their presence at the job, and the type of arrangements and services provided to them, noting that the number of people with disabilities employed at a facility cannot exceed 10 percent. If employees with disabilities in a firm exceed more than 10 percent {{of the total number of}} Saudi employees, then each disabled worker is calculated like any other Saudi. “It is unfortunate that there are some companies and individuals who exploit people with disabilities to pump up their Saudization rates,”and Saudi workers with disabilities who are able to work are counted as four employees in the Saudization ratio. They must be paid a minimum monthly wage of 3,000 riyals and should not be counted as part of the Saudization ratio of another establishment. To recent reports which reveal that companies have been hiring Saudis with disabilities in order to boost Saudization rates as these disabled employees count as 4 employees, thus saving the company from hiring able-bodied Saudi employees at higher salaries. An executive at a private company said there are some people with disabilities who present themselves to the companies for employment in return for salaries, bonuses, and benefits. Companies are thus paying less to a disabled employee who is equal to four Saudis than they would if they hired four Saudis with salaries of more than SR 20,000 each. They offer their services. Some companies accept, refuse, others added. The Ministry of Labour and other agencies work together regarding the issue of employees with disabilities, noting that the Ministry of Labor determines the nature of disability upon interviewing the employee. They currently posted a draft to the disability employment legislation on the “Together We Improve” portal for discussion before making a decision to amend the definition of disability work and conditions for employment stipulated in Article 13. Disabled employee to count as more than one employee in Nitaqat, the individual must hold a license or identification card from the Ministry of Social Affairs or Ministry of Labor indicating the type and degree of disability. Further, work conditions and systems must be acceptable and suitable for employees based on the type of disability, and establishments should ensure all services are in place before the employee begins work.|$|E
