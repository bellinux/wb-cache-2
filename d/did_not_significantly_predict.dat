40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of culture and personality on the career decision self-efficacy of 338 Latino seventh-grade public middle school students. Specifically, we examined the role of acculturation, enculturation, ethnic identity, and conscien-tiousness on career decision self-efficacy. Findings indicated Latina girls were more acculturated and enculturated than Latino boys. For Latino boys and Latina girls, respectively, 34 % and 25 % {{of the variance in}} career decision self-efficacy was accounted for by the predictors. Acculturation, ethnic identity, and conscientious-ness significantly predicted career decision self-efficacy for girls.

Self-report data were collected from 138 secondgeneration Latino/a adolescents (mean age 14. 02 years) and 244 second-generation Latino/a emerging adults (mean age 18. 57 years). Participants completed the Vancouver Index of Acculturation (Ryder, Alde, & Paulhus, 2000), the Multidimensional Acculturative Stress Index (Rodriguez, Myers, Mira, Flores, & Garcia-Hernandez, 2002), and the Profile of Mood States-Adolescent Version (Terry, Lane, Lane, & Keohane, 1999). Multiple regressions were run to test the effects of acculturative stress on psychological well-being and to test if acculturation moderated this association, separately by developmental period. The results indicate that among emerging adults, heritage acculturative stress did significantly predict psychological well-being.

This barrier is even more pronounced to those with disabilities living in deprived areas. Using Census data and Area Deprivation Index (ADI) developed by University of Wisconsin-Madison's ADI project, OLS and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) regression analyses showed that high area deprivation index (ADI) and high percentage of public-only health insurance coverage predict disability prevalence. While ADI, public-only insurance coverage percentage and disability prevalence <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>predict</b> the number of hospitals, they slightly improved the fit of the GWR model, which was significantly predictive.

Rising income inequality might pose an explanation for what is behind the Great Recession and why regions react differently, as it has been considered one of the structural causes of the crisis. In this research, I explore the relationship between income inequality and economic resilience for U. S. counties. Specifically, I examine the relationship between three measures of inequality and income distribution – the Gini coefficient, poverty rate, share of aggregate income held by households earning $ 200, 000 or more – and economic resilience measures developed by Han and Goetz (2015).

Each student was asked to find a willing conversational partner, to decide upon a conversation they had recently, and [...] without consulting with each other [...] to complete a questionnaire about that conversation. The questionnaire was composed of scales intended to measure perceptions of a partner's communication competence, perceptions of one's own competence, and self-monitoring behavior [...] the tendency of individuals to focus on internal or external cues for yegulating self-behavior.

Yet, religion may differentially affect dimensions of delin-quency in the early life course. Therefore, using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we examine the relationship between measures of adolescent religion, as well as changes in religious involvement, and later patterns of marijuana use. We also examine the extent to which religious effects, if any, are mediated by key predictors of delinquency drawn from prominent criminological theories. The results suggest that the primary effect of religion on marijuana use is to prevent its initiation in the first place. Only part of religion’s preventative effect on initiation is mediated by social bonds, delinquent peers, or self control. Although religious youth are less likely to ever use marijuana, adolescent religious involvement <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>predict</b> desistence from marijuana use.

We hypothesized that the frequency or density of these cells may be associated with more aggressive tumor behavior. We borrowed these multiplexed, flow-based methods to develop an in situ method to define CSCs in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue, with the goal of assessing the prognostic value of the presence of CSCs in breast cancer. Using a retrospective collection of 321 node-negative and 318 node-positive patients with a mean follow-up time of 12. 6 years, we assessed TMAs using the AQUA method for quantitative immunofluorescence. Using a multiplexed assay for ALDH 1, CD 44, and cytokeratin to measure the coexpression of these proteins, putative CSCs appear in variable sized clusters and in 27 cases (of 490), which showed significantly worse outcome (log rank P = 0. 0003).

40|$|Background. Cross-sectional {{findings}} in community surveys of adults suggest that adolescent anxiety disorders are strong predictors {{of the subsequent}} onset of alcohol use, abuse and dependence. However, prospective data that follow a sample of adolescents into adulthood are needed to confirm these associations. Method. Baseline and 4 -year follow-up data from the EDSP-Study, a prospective community survey of 3021 (2548 at follow-up) {{adolescents and young adults}} aged 14 to 24 years at baseline carried out in Munich, were used. DSM-IV anxiety disorders, alcohol use and alcohol use disorders were assessed with the Munich-Composite-International-Diagnostic-Interview (M-CIDI). Multiple logistic regression analysis, controlling for age, gender, other mental disorders, substance use disorders and antisocial behaviour was used to study the associations of baseline anxiety disorders with the subsequent onset and course of alcohol use and alcohol disorders. Results. Baseline social phobia <b>significantly</b> <b>predicts</b> the onsets of regular use and hazardous use and the persistence of dependence.

40|$|Introduction: Obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease and lung inflammation {{are associated with}} cardiovascular events; therefore, incidental chest CT findings might reveal subjects with an increased cardiovascular risk, which remains often unnoticed in the population. The prognostic value of incidental CT findings is unfortunately usually unknown. Objective: To study the prognostic value of specific morphologic abnormalities found on routine chest CT scans for predicting cardiovascular events. Methods: In a multi-center cohort study including 14366 subjects we recorded 493 cardiovascular events during an average follow-up time of 17. 8 months. A case-cohort design was employed where 1191 subjects were randomly sampled as a subcohort and CT scans from the subcohort and all cases were scored {{for a variety of}} lung, pleural en mediastinal abnormalities. Results: CT abnormalities in the lung (prevalence: 26 - 44 %), mediastinum (80 %) and pleura (14 - 15 %) are common. Airway wall thickening, ground glass lesions, consolidations, pleural effusions and lymph-adenopathy <b>significantly</b> <b>predict</b> the incidence of cardiovascular events. Subjects with these findings have up to a 3. 6 -fold higher risk resulting in an annual event rate of more than 6. 7 %.

30|$|The {{presence}} {{and influence of}} Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety on performance has often {{been reported in the}} literature (e.g., Cubukcu 2007; Horwitz et al. 1986; Liu 2006; MacIntyre and Gardner 1991). Gardner and MacIntyre (1993) claimed that language anxiety was the best single correlate of achievement. In a similar vein, Ganschow et al. (1994) study demonstrated that students with high levels of anxiety exhibited poorer language skills. Ganschow and Sparks (1996) also reported that students with low anxiety levels outperformed those with high anxiety levels overall. This study identified three interrelated constructs: class anxiety, test confidence, and test anxiety, and supported a negative association between class anxiety and test confidence, as well as between test anxiety and test confidence. Both forms of anxiety are closely correlated, with cognitive test anxiety being a significant negative predictor and test confidence being a significant positive predictor of the test scores. Foreign language classroom anxiety, however, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>predict</b> test performance. Hence, this study managed to break down the language anxiety concept and looked at different effects of the anxiety facets on language performance. This result is a step further from previous correlational studies, for example, in Salehi and Marefat’s (2014) correlation investigation, they found both foreign language anxiety and test anxiety had a statistically significant negative correlation with the exam grades. The two sub-concepts in the FLCAS (communication apprehension and fear of negative evaluation), however, are not identifiable statistically.|$|R
