It is a strategy for making women’s as well as men’s concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated.

2500|$|Over {{the past}} few years, [...] "gender mainstreaming" [...] has become a {{preferred}} approach for achieving greater health parity between men and women.

The <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> approach {{is a response to}} the realisation that gender concerns must be dealt with in every aspect of policy development and programming, through systematic gender analyses and the implementation of actions that address the balance of power and the distribution of resources between women and men. In order to address gender health disparities, <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> in health employs a dual focus.

Furthermore there are documented gender differences in Europe regarding behavior and views on climate change. (Räty and Carlsson-Kanyama 2010, Goldsmith et al. 2013). This article investigates the relevancy of the double democratic deficit for EU´s climate policymaking. We map the representation of female and male experts at the Commission´s climate units and search for gender recognition in EU´s climate documents. There we discover silence regarding gender, confirmed through interviews with policy-makers. Using feminist institutionalism we conclude that existing gender power relations within the Commission affect the explored climate units, which reproduce masculine institutional practices...|$|R

Findings revealed that teacher education colleges do not have own college gender policies, had not engendered their curricula as well as their budgets. Female students far outnumbered male students. Males dominated decision- making positions at student, lecturer and non-lecturing levels.

50|$|Like many {{criticisms of}} the <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> {{movement}} in general, <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> in mine action has faced similar problems such as ineffective results, poor implementation, those using it to hinder progress, and being primarily western dominated. Asa Massleberg, for the Gender and Mine Action Programme, wrote that the common measurements of success in mine action, such as meters squared of land cleared of mines and {{number of people who}} received a service, are insufficient because they do {{not take into account the}} overall and long term impact of a community. She argues it can only be done by assessing all the processes and procedures in a project cycle which are adapted to the needs of women, girls, boy and men in a community. According to the Gender and Mine Action Programme, the effects of <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> are still largely undocumented, not understood by those implementing it, and require further research. Trying to deal with other biases not included in <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming,</b> the Gender and Mine Action Programme has also expanded <b>gender</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> to include the term diversity. Gender and diversity mainstreaming includes other factors in the demographics of a community that may hinder or help the long term impact of mine action.|$|E
