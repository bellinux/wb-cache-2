He also required competitive bids from banks where state funds were deposited; the extra interest generated by this process generated an additional $50 million in revenue to the general fund. He opened communications and contacts with Japan, {{setting the stage for}} future economic relations between that country and Kentucky. Among his other accomplishments as governor were the implementation of competitive bidding for government contracts and passage of a weight-distance tax on trucks.|$|E

25|$|By 1953, Henry J. Kaiser {{purchased}} a majority share in Chase Aircraft, feeling that after having completed C-119s for Fairchild under contract, {{he could take}} control of the impending C-123 contract. Two airframes were completed at Kaiser's Willow Run factory in Ypsilanti, Michigan, before a pricing scandal that led to Kaiser's being told that no further contracts with him would be honored. The C-123 contract was put up <b>for</b> <b>bid,</b> and the two completed airframes scrapped. The contract was finally awarded to Fairchild Engine and Airplane, who assumed production of the former Chase C-123B, a refined version of the XC-123. Before turning production over to Fairchild, Chase originally named their C-123B the AVITRUC but it never stuck.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Delaware North {{sued the}} NPS in the United States Court of Claims for breach of contract, {{claiming}} that the contract with Yosemite Hospitality excluded intellectual property from the asset purchasing clause, and demanded a payment for the property to be determined in court. Delaware North initially asserted the fair market value of its properties to be $51 million. When it offered <b>for</b> <b>bid</b> the contract to operate these facilities, the National Park Service estimated {{the value of the}} intangible assets at $3.5 million. Delaware North claimed to have offered to temporarily license the trademarks while the dispute is resolved, but claims that the government did not respond. The dispute gained national attention after it was publicized in an issue of Outside magazine, which led to the Sierra Club issuing a petition requesting that Delaware North drop the lawsuit.|$|E

25|$|An auction is {{a process}} of buying and selling goods or {{services}} by offering them up <b>for</b> <b>bid,</b> taking bids, and then selling the item to the highest bidder. The open ascending price auction is arguably {{the most common form of}} auction in use today. Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid required to be higher than the previous bid. An auctioneer may announce prices, bidders may call out their bids themselves (or have a proxy call out a bid on their behalf), or bids may be submitted electronically with the highest current bid publicly displayed. In a Dutch auction, the auctioneer begins with a high asking price for some quantity of like items; the price is lowered until a participant is willing to accept the auctioneer's price for some quantity of the goods in the lot or until the seller's reserve price is met. While auctions are most associated in the public imagination with the sale of antiques, paintings, rare collectibles and expensive wines, auctions are also used for commodities, livestock, radio spectrum and used cars. In economic theory, an auction may refer to any mechanism or set of trading rules for exchange.|$|E
25|$|The City of Chicago {{is looking}} into a plan for an express train that would take tourists, locals, and other {{travelers}} from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport in about 20 minutes, which is half {{the time it takes}} on the City's Blue Line. If an express train does get built, one-time tickets would likely cost around $30 to $35. Less expensive monthly passes and family discounts might also become available. The City will look for a private company to cover construction costs and operate the system, but it's likely public money would go into building stations at the airport and downtown if the project moves ahead. The city says an engineering firm will spend the next 10 months evaluating potential routes, drafting designs and coming up with a construction timeline and cost estimate, then put it out <b>for</b> <b>bid</b> in 2017. In the early 1990s, the idea of a 20-minute O'Hare express train service has been proposed. Some plans included bypass tracks on the CTA Blue Line that run {{down the middle of the}} Kennedy Expressway as well as use of a Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way near the Kennedy. However no plans were ever materialized.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, the HPA ran {{a massive}} fundraiser {{to support those}} in dire need after the tragic event of the Haiti earthquake. Live webcasts were held in which celebrities (especially those {{a part of the}} Harry Potter Fandom) {{performed}} and encouraged viewers to donate money. Donations came through an auction that did not guarantee you the prize. Some items that were up <b>for</b> <b>bid</b> were: a signed set of the Harry Potter books, a guitar signed by actor Tom Felton, handmade earrings from actress Evanna Lynch, and a one thousand word story about whatever the winner wishes it to be written by Maureen Johnson and John Green. The webcasts were rather successful, garnering over $125,000. The original plan of Helping Haiti Heal was to have three plane fulls of aid (each one dubbed: Harry, Hermione, and Ron) shipped off to Haiti. As of June the same year, five planes were sent to Haiti, Harry, Hermione, Ron, DFTBA (Don't Forget To Be Awesome) and the last being Dumbledore. On 28 June, there was a livestream video celebrating the landing of Dumbledore. Evanna Lynch was present at the stream and even answered questions asked by fans. Ophelia Dahl, the daughter of the late British author Roald Dahl was also present since she worked with Partners in Health, who the Harry Potter Alliance teamed up with for Helping Haiti Heal.|$|E

500|$|In 1948, the Highway 80 Chamber of Commerce {{president}} {{complained that}} funds were being prioritized for US 395 construction, {{instead of on}} US 80.

The next month, $1 million was allocated to the realignment of the Viejas grade, namely, increasing the radius of the curves from [...] to , as well as limiting the grade to 4 percent. By 1949, the project was under way, with prisoners contributing to the labor force, and was projected to include a tunnel {{as well as several}} crossings of the Sweetwater River. A longer [...] tunnel through the Cuyamaca Mountains was also proposed that year, which would have been the longest in the world. But by 1950, work on the Viejas grade had stalled, due to the prison labor camp being shut down; efforts were then made to start work again. More funds were allocated by the State Highway Commission a few months later, and the work was to be put out <b>for</b> <b>bid</b> to complete the project.|$|E
