He also {{was one of the}} first to raise his arm on an icing call to let his defencemen <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> He perfected a stand-up, {{positional}} style, cutting down the angles; he became one of the first goaltenders to write a how-to book about the position. He was a pioneer of stickhandling the puck; before that time, goaltenders passively stood in the net and simply deflected pucks to defencemen or backchecking forwards.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the hospital on 12 July for a tetanus injection, Behan was arrested by five policemen and taken to their Arcidosso barracks for questioning. He did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> at first as the police had no interpreter in the barracks. He was only provided with a lawyer and interpreter 15 hours later when a magistrate from Grosseto came. Behan exercised his right not to answer questions. He was released, but was formally informed that he was under suspicion. As of 15 July 2008 {{he was the only}} suspect in the case. The police subsequently seized his car and a knife from his home, and secured a room in the house in which traces of blood were allegedly found. In addition, shoe prints found were said to have matched his footwear. Custody of his car and home (except for the cellar) were returned to him on 14 July by the judge overseeing the investigation.|$|E
25|$|During this period, the MWRC {{networked}} {{with community}} cultural leaders through the Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Cultural Centre (KALACC), an Aboriginal organisation {{that supports the}} traditional practices of the 30 language groups in the Kimberley. Oscar revealed the significance of their support in the alcohol restriction campaign:It was really important to let elders <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> We liaised with cultural leaders and elders through KALACC. KALACC helped facilitate approval from elders for the alcohol restrictions.The role of KALACC was critical; {{it would have been}} very interesting had they not supported the campaign. The support of KALACC managed some of the forces in the community.Oscar’s move to get the backing of elders and cultural leaders was a major factor in persuading the Director of Liquor Licensing to impose the alcohol restrictions and should not be underestimated. Certain sectors of the community were against the restrictions and the support from elders gave the MWRC campaign the legitimacy it needed in enduring strong criticism. In the face of fierce opposition from some members of her community who had a vested interest in the sale of alcohol, Oscar stood firm. She knew the restrictions would give her people much needed relief from the trauma and chaos caused by alcohol abuse.|$|E

500|$|Though major labels were courting the band, in 1988 {{they signed}} to the {{independent}} label SST Records for their debut album, Ultramega OK, released on October 31, 1988. Cornell said the band [...] "made a huge mistake with Ultramega OK" [...] because they used a producer suggested by SST who [...] "didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in Seattle". According to Steve Huey of AllMusic, [...] Soundgarden demonstrates, a [...] "Stooges/MC5-meets-Zeppelin/Sabbath sound" [...] on the album. Mark Miremont directed the band's first music video for [...] "Flower," [...] which aired regularly on MTV's 120 Minutes. Soundgarden supported Ultramega OK on a tour in the United States {{in the spring of}} 1989, and a tour in Europe, which began in May 1989—the band's first overseas tour. Ultramega OK earned the band a Grammy Award nomination for Best Metal Performance in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Yeats {{was raised}} {{a member of}} the Protestant Ascendancy, which was at the time {{undergoing}} a crisis of identity. While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage, and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man you have to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in the world when he was twenty [...] "is manifestly true of W.B.Y." [...] Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent {{around the turn of the}} century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.|$|E

2500|$|Froiseth was passionately against polygamy. In 1880 she {{edited and}} {{published}} The Anti-Polygamy Standard. The eight-page monthly paper {{has the same}} biblical verse printed on every issue, [...] "Let every man have his own wife, and let every women have her own husband" [...] (1 Corinthians 7:2). The Standard told the stories of women suffering in polygamous marriages and further educated the country on polygamy in the Utah territory. The Anti-Polygamy Standard only lasted three years, ending abruptly in 1883 {{due to lack of}} funding. During the newspaper's life Froiseth compiled the stories of suffering women in polygamous marriages in order to publish The Women of Mormonism: Or, The story of polygamy as told by the victims themselves. The book focuses on the misery and distress felt by wives subjected to polygamy. One reverend wrote, [...] "I have read some of the proof sheets of The Women of Mormonism. If the statements made are true—and they are amply vouched for by intelligent and trustworthy persons—they will certainly stir the blood of those who read them." [...] Froiseth wanted women from all over the United States to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in Utah territory.|$|E
