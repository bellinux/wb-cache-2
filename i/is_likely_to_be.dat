25|$|Compared with GABAA, GABAC receptors have {{a higher}} {{affinity}} for GABA, they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> longer-lasting in activity, and their responses <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> generated by lower GABA concentrations.|$|R

5|$|Since 47 Ursae Majoris c was {{detected}} indirectly, properties {{such as its}} radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Based on its high mass, the planet <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a gas giant with no solid surface.|$|E

5|$|Tolls {{cannot be}} levied on the ferry without {{changing}} the 1885 Act of Parliament. However, {{it is possible}} that the service may eventually be tolled in conjunction with other projects such as the Gallions Reach Crossing, which <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tolled.|$|E
50|$|Even at {{this level}} of {{classification}} there <b>are</b> conflicts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved. Recent molecular evidence shows that, while the first two groups <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> monophyletic, the protosteloids <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> polyphyletic.

National Security Advisor Nancy McNally and Leo {{consider}} the potential implications of possible retributions and are relieved when the Palestinians respond to American pressure by arresting a leader of a militant group.

5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.|$|E

5|$|Amyloid imaging <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in {{conjunction}} with other markers rather than as an alternative. Volumetric MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.|$|E
5|$|Availability of {{substitute}} goods: The {{more and}} closer the substitutes available, {{the higher the}} elasticity <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> as people can easily switch from one good to another if an even minor price change is made; There is a strong substitution effect. If no close substitutes are available, the substitution effect will be small and the demand inelastic.|$|E
5|$|Based on an {{observed}} excess {{emission of}} infrared radiation, Vega {{appears to have}} a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars which display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{its high}} mass, Gliese 876 c <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a gas giant with no solid surface. Since it was {{detected}} indirectly through its gravitational {{effects on the}} star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Assuming a composition similar to Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the planet is predicted to have a cloudless upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine-derived melanin {{probably}} {{appears in}} at least some other biological systems as well. Some of the dopamine in plants <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as a precursor for dopamine-melanin. The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings, as well as black-and-white stripes on the bodies of insect larvae, are also thought to be caused by spatially structured accumulations of dopamine-melanin.|$|E
