[...] "He's below; {{do you wish to}} see him?" [...] "I do, sir." [...] The captain, who was then below, on being called, asked what he wanted, to which he answered, [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> that penant, sir?" [...] "Because my country allows me to, sir." [...] "My {{commander}} thinks it was done to insult him, and if you don't take it down he will send a force to do it." [...] Captain Rogers then exclaimed to the engineer, [...] "Get the hot-water engine ready." [...] Although there was no such machine on board the vessel, it had the desired effect, and John Bull was glad to paddle off as fast as possible.|$|E

6000|$|... "Have a {{care that}} that {{headpiece}} of yours has not perverted your taste, my lord," [...] said Mowbray. [...] "But why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> that disguise on your last appearance? You should, I think, have been uncovered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, grandma, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> it? Did <b>you</b> see him? <b>Do</b> tell us {{all about}} it, {{and that will be the}} best of the whole," [...] cried Polly, who loved history, and knew a good deal about the gallant Frenchman and his brave life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Always {{ready to}} make {{allowances}} for her, provided she sends you to lecture me, Conny. Why <b>dont</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> your hat properly?" [...] He arranged her hat as he spoke. Constance laughed and blushed. Marian shuddered. [...] "Now youre all that fancy painted you: youre lovely, youre divine. Are you ready for Bushy Copse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not this weapon," [...] {{answered}} the sword-bearer; [...] "but {{you have your}} own at command, and, besides, for what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> your poniard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, why," [...] {{said the}} large {{man in the}} silk hat, {{trembling}} from head to foot, [...] "why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> your hat before the king?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Clarkson," [...] he said, [...] "if {{you will}} forgive my {{mentioning}} a purely personal matter, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> such uncomfortable collars and such an exceedingly unbecoming tie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{he turned}} to hasten back to the castle, Hayraddin laid hold of him.--"Nay, hear you--hear you--you run upon your death! What the foul fiend <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> the colours of the old one for?--I will never trust blue and white silk again. But she has almost as large a dower--has jewels and gold--hath pretensions, too, upon the earldom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! give it me,' she faintly murmured, {{extending}} her hand; {{and then}} she added, in a firmer and livelier tone, 'and <b>did</b> <b>you</b> really <b>wear</b> it near your heart!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said Dickory, {{as he and}} Lucilla stood {{together}} on the sand, [...] "that in that gown of gray, with the white sleeves, and the red cord around your waist, you please me better than even <b>you</b> <b>did</b> when <b>you</b> <b>wore</b> your sailor garb?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you have}} such a poor opinion of us, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> our colour?' asked Dolly, painfully {{conscious}} that he was not improving the advantages his Alma Mater offered him, but bound to defend her.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. But I'll {{never wear}} {{anything}} again {{that can be}} called immoral. I {{want to be able}} to say why I wear a dress. You haven't answered my question yet. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> what you frankly admit is disgusting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Zack," [...] {{returned}} young Thorpe, clapping his new acquaintance on {{the back}} with brotherly familiarity already. [...] "You're a glorious fellow; and I like your way of talking. Where do you come from, Mat? And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> that queer cap under your hat for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's annoying," [...] said Kells, with {{exasperation}} at himself. [...] "Where {{on earth}} can I {{get you a}} dress? We're two hundred miles from everywhere. The wildest kind of country.... Say, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>wear</b> a man's outfit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Macumazahn," [...] said Umslopogaas hoarsely, [...] "I tell <b>you</b> that <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>wear</b> the Great Medicine on your breast, I {{would kill}} {{you where you}} sit and bury you beneath {{the floor of the}} hut, as one who knows--too much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, child! And good heavens, my dear! that's {{a pretty}} diamond cross. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean by <b>wearing</b> {{it in the}} morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One moment, Mr. President," [...] I interrupted; [...] "would {{you mind}} {{changing}} that cylinder? I {{could have gotten}} all that from the American Press Association if I had wanted plate matter. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> flannels? What is your favorite poet, brand of catsup, bird, flower, {{and what are you}} going to do when you are out of a job?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to make a remark, Captain Granet," [...] he said, [...] "upon which you can comment or not, as you choose. Was not your costume last night rather a {{singular}} one for the evening? You say that you were on your way upstairs to undress when you heard the Zeppelin. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> rubber shoes and a Norfolk jacket for dinner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not one jot, cousin. Why, Sir Gervaise, {{it seems}} to me that you have been born two centuries too late, and that you should have been a knight errant, instead of being sworn to obey orders, and bound to celibacy. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> no lady's favour in your helm? I know that not a few of your Order do so." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Haiti, rape {{has been}} {{considered}} a serious felony punishable by the courts only since 2005. Police can be slow to arrest perpetrators, doctors are often unwilling to help provide the medical evidence necessary for prosecution, and the court system often works against victims, particularly those who are poor. [...] "Most of the laws we have here {{have been made by}} men," [...] BAI's managing attorney Mario Joseph said in 2014. [...] "They look for a way to accuse the women:'Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> that dress? Why were you there at this time? Why didn't you stay home?' Even when you start the process it's like you've lost the process." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it must {{be because}} there is some other woman whom you wish to gain. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> always <b>wear</b> that strange necklace?" [...] she added sharply. [...] "Did it belong to this savage girl Iduna, as, {{from the look of}} it, it might well have done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Tidger sniffed derisively. [...] "You men are all alike," [...] she snapped. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think Ann <b>wears</b> that pink bodice for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|If {{love is a}} thorn, {{they show}} no wit Who foolishly hug and foster it. If love is a weed, how simple they Who gather and gather it, day by day!

6000|$|... "Ay. Look at {{the women}} looking at us. I'm {{something}} between a bull {{and a couple of}} worms stuck together, I am. See that spink!" [...] he raised his voice for the girls to hear. [...] "Pretty, isn't he? What for?—And what for <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> a fancy vest and twist your moustache, Sir! What for, at the bottom! Ha—tell a woman not to come in a wood till she can look at natural things—she might see something—Good night, Sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{do women}} wear extreme clothes? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> and I <b>wear</b> {{open-work}} silk stockings, skirts to our knees, gowns without sleeves or bodices?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} Mr. Armadale is alive," [...] pursued the doctor, [...] "and {{you know that}} he is coming back to England. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{continue}} to <b>wear</b> your widow's dress?" ...|$|R
6000|$|TOUCHIT.--Translucent orbs! {{beams of}} {{flashing}} light! lovely lashes veiling celestial brightness! No, they haven't cried much for Tom Flight, that faithless captain! nor for Lawrence O'Reilly, that killing Editor.

6000|$|... "Beppo! that beard {{of yours}} becomes you not; [...] It shall be shaved before you're a day older: [...] Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> it? Oh!

60|$|I {{wonder you}} can bear it. I think of Fleet Street and Lincoln's Inn {{now with a}} shudder of disgust. There are only two {{things in the world}} that make life worth living, love and art. I cannot imagine you sitting in an office over a ledger, and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> a tall hat and an {{umbrella}} and a little black bag? My feeling is that one should look upon life as an adventure, one should burn with the hard, gem-like flame, and one should take risks, one should expose oneself to danger. Why do you not go to Paris and study art? I always thought you had talent.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> {{that pretty}} {{likeness}} of the Great One yonder over your heart, as I have known {{you do with}} things that belonged to women in past days, Baas? Do {{you know that it}} is Zikali's Great Medicine, nothing less, as everyone does throughout the land? When Zikali sends an order far away, he always sends that image with it, for then he who receives the order knows that he must obey or die. Also the messenger knows that he will come to no harm if he does not take it off, because, Baas, the image is Zikali himself, and Zikali is the image. They are one and the same. Also it is the image of his father's father's father--or so he says." ...|$|E

Reed Vreeland {{dancing on}} the roof of New Yorks St. Regis Hotel in a white lace Chanel dress and a bolero with roses in her hair one evening in 1936, she knew shed found Bazaars newest staffer. Diana, who is said to have invented the word [...] "pizzazz", first came to the {{attention}} of readers with her [...] "Why Dont You ... ?" [...] column. (A typical suggestion: [...] "Why <b>dont</b> <b>you</b> ... <b>wear,</b> like the Duchess of Kent, three enormous diamond stars arranged in your hair in front?") Before long, she became fashion editor, collaborating with photographers Louise Dahl-Wolfe and Richard Avedon and, later, art director Henry Wolf. Her eccentricity, perception and wit, as well as her sharp wit and sweeping pronouncements ("I adore that pink! Its the navy blue of India," [...] "Elegance is refusal!"), were memorialized in the movie Funny Face, making her, for many, the prototypical fashion-magazine editor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Virginia, child." [...] said Mrs. Colfax, peevishly, {{one morning}} {{as they sat}} at breakfast, [...] "why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> persist it <b>wearing</b> that old gown?

6000|$|... "I {{wish that}} <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not <b>wear</b> such strange clothes and that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not talk the dialect of these fishermen, {{and that you}} had more money. Then you too might come and see me, might you not, when we have that house in London?" ...|$|R
