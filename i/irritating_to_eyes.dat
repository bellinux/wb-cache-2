40|$|THE MIC President {{was last}} week {{reported}} as saying "this {{was a clear}} case of the poor being denied their rights" when referring to an incident involving a "land grab" (Malay Mail, April 22). Nowhere is such comment more relevant {{when it comes to}} the proposed lifting of the ban on paraquat, which is now being hotly contested by the pour — this time the plantation workers over their rights to better health. Dubbed as one of the "dirty dozen" pesticides, paraquat is widely used for weed control, at least before the ban, despite its deadly health effects. For example, paraquat warnings recognise that "it is very toxic by inhalation; toxic in contact with skin and if swallowed; <b>irritating</b> <b>to</b> <b>eyes</b> respiratory system and skin; and can be a serious threat to health...|$|E

40|$|Australian Home Beautiful’s October 1960 Edition {{was devoted}} to the {{modernisation}} of the Victorian and Edwardian-era houses of Australian cities’ inner suburbs. One of the articles inside was entitled ‘Terrace Houses are Common Problem’, in which the magazine’s architectural consultant Leonard A. Bullen suggested; “With houses of this type, the multiplicity of embellishments that appear in almost every possible place is <b>irritating</b> <b>to</b> <b>eyes</b> that have become accustomed to the cleaner and less ornamented lines of modern houses” and “The first necessity is {{to get rid of}} the superfluous decoration and emphasise horizontal features. ” (Bullen 1960, 31). The post-World War Two period was a time when Australia’s traditional imagining of itself was confronted by both popular modernity and a diversity of new migrant cultures and ways of thinking. In a contemporary environment that theoretically celebrates diversity and creates audiences for increasingly multiplying expressions of culture and history, perhaps it is time that 1950 s and ‘ 60 s alterations to old houses were re-imagined as intrinsic elements in Australia’s cultural landscape. This supposition will be discussed in relation to the United Nations’ 2002 Kanazawa Resolutions’ definition of the relationship between culture and sustainability as ‘dialogical coexistence’ (Nadarajah and Yamamoto 2007) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEye {{irritation}} {{evaluation is}} mandatory for predicting health risks in consumers exposed to textile dyes. The two dyes, Reactive Orange 16 (RO 16) and Reactive Green 19 (RG 19) {{are classified as}} Category 2 A (<b>irritating</b> <b>to</b> <b>eyes)</b> based on the UN Globally Harmonized System for classification (UN GHS), according to the Draize test. On the other hand, animal welfare considerations and the enforcement of a new regulation in the EU are drawing much attention in reducing or replacing animal experiments with alternative methods. This study evaluated the eye irritation of the two dyes RO 16 and RG 19 by combining the Short Time Exposure (STE) and the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability (BCOP) assays and then comparing them with in vivo data from the GHS classification. The STE test (first level screening) categorized both dyes as GHS Category 1 (severe irritant). In the BCOP, dye RG 19 was also classified as GHS Category 1 while dye RO 16 was classified as GHS no prediction can be made. Both dyes caused damage to the corneal tissue as confirmed by histopathological analysis. Our findings demonstrated that the STE test did not contribute to arriving at a better conclusion about the eye irritation potential of the dyes when {{used in conjunction with}} the BCOP test. Adding the histopathology to the BCOP test could be an appropriate tool for a more meaningful prediction of the eye irritation potential of dyes...|$|E
40|$|Ozone is a bluish, {{explosive}} gas or blue liquid. It has {{a characteristic}} pungent odor that is detectable at concentrations {{as low as}} 0. 02 to 0. 05 ppm. At greater concentrations it is <b>irritating</b> <b>to</b> <b>eyes</b> and the respiratory tract and at high concentrations ozone may be fatal. It is a strong oxidizing agent, mp – 193 o C, bp – 111. 9 o C. It is sparingly soluble in water. At 20 o C, solubility of 100 percent ozone is 570 mg/L (Richardson, 1994). Atmosphere at sea level contains an ozone concentration of about 0. 05 ppm (Budavari, 1996). In cities with smog conditions ozone concentration may reach 0. 5 ppm or higher at times. (Francis, 1997) Ozone decomposes spontaneously in water (US EPA, 1999). The reaction generates hydroxyl free radicals, which are very reactive oxidizing agents but have a half-life of microseconds. In aqueous solution, ozone can react by direct oxidation of compounds or can oxidize compounds by hydroxyl free radicals that are produced during ozone decomposition. How Made: Ozone is usually formed by combining an oxygen molecule with an oxygen atom in an endothermic reaction. Naturally occurring ozone is produced in the outer atmosphere by the photoreaction of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation on oxygen. At ground level, ozone may be produced by reactions caused by changes in entropy, e. g. water falling on rocks in a waterfall. Ozone is also produced by photoreactions with nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) from industrial emissions, vehicles and other sources (US EPA, 1999) ...|$|E
