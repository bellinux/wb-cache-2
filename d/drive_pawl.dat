25|$|Typical European four-operation {{machines}} use the Odhner mechanism, or {{variations of}} it. This kind of machine included the Original Odhner, Brunsviga and several following imitators, starting from Triumphator, Thales, Walther, Facit up to Toshiba. Although {{most of these}} were operated by handcranks, there were motor-driven versions. Hamann calculators externally resembled pinwheel machines, but the setting lever positioned a cam that disengaged a <b>drive</b> <b>pawl</b> when the dial had moved far enough.|$|E
50|$|This {{mechanical}} type uses {{a spring}} {{to hold a}} <b>drive</b> <b>pawl</b> against a notch in the rotor. It may feature automatic or manual reset. A compression adjustment on the spring determines the torque limit.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, P&H earth moving {{machines}} evolved into larger, {{more powerful and}} more productive prime movers of material. By 1930, welding technology made possible the fabrication of lighter, stronger machinery versus traditional riveted-design machinery. P&H not only was an early adapter to welded design, but the firm also designed and manufactured its own line of electric arc welding machinery and welding rod products. Another technology advance applied to P&H digging machines during the 1930s was the Ward-Leonard DC electric motor <b>drive</b> system. <b>Pawling</b> & Harnischfeger began designing and making their own electric motors and controls starting in 1893 when they acquired assets of the Gibb Electric Company that were not needed when Gibb was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company.|$|R
50|$|De Gekroonde Poelenburg is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 3.0 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20.3 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft cast by foundry De Prins van Oranje as number 0430 in 1866. The brake wheel with 66 cogs on the wind shaft drives the crank wheel with 26 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has three crank pins. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the three frame saws. Reciprocating lever bars also <b>drive</b> the <b>pawl</b> and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms. The winches {{can be used with}} the log hoist to lift logs from the water onto the sawing platform and to pull the log carriages back to their starting position.|$|R
50|$|De Otter is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 2.80 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 19.50 m. They are carried on Azob√© wooden windshaft made by Saendijck in 1996. The function of the brake wheel is split between two wheels, one wheel with a flat outer rim for the brake blocks to work on and another wheel with 71 radial cogs driving the lantern wheel with 29 staves on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. Connecting rods from the three cranks drive the three wooden sawing frames. Reciprocating lever bars also <b>drive</b> the <b>pawl</b> and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms.

The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 2.80 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft of unknown manufacturer. The brake wheel with 75 cogs drives the crank wheel with 33 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has four crank pins to drive four sawing frames, one more than common in Dutch wind-sawmills. The mill is also a bit wider than common to accommodate the extra sawing frame. The rearmost sawing frame was later removed and replaced by a reciprocating weight to keep the mechanism balanced. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the frame saws. Reciprocating lever bars also <b>drive</b> the <b>pawl</b> and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms.
