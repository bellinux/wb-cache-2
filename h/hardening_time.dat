40|$|When {{applying}} the slip form system, the early setting time of concrete {{corresponds to the}} <b>hardening</b> <b>time</b> of early-age concrete indicating that cast-in-place concrete has developed sufficient strength to be safely stripped off the form. This <b>hardening</b> <b>time</b> is thus an important indicator for {{the determination of the}} slip-up velocity of the slip form system. Therefore, need is for a technique enabling to evaluate the early <b>hardening</b> <b>time</b> of concrete in order to secure the safety of the slip form system {{and the quality of the}} constructed concrete. Among the methods using ultrasonic waves, this paper applies the surface wave velocity to evaluate the degree of hardening of concrete so as to estimate the early setting time and decide the slip-up time of the slip form system. To that goal, penetration resistance test, compressive strength test and surface wave velocity measurement test are performed concurrently with respect to the mix materials and curing temperature of concrete. The test results are used to derive the relationship between the compressive strength and surface wave velocity according to the early <b>hardening</b> <b>time</b> of concrete. Continuous wavelet transform is applied for the measurement of the surface wave velocity. The validity of the application of the continuous wavelet transform is verified through numerical analysis. Finally, the surface wave velocity required for the slip-up of the slip form system is proposed and the applicability of the proposed surface wave velocity for the determination of the climbing time of the slip form system is verified by means of tests on a reduced-scale slip form system prototype...|$|E

Methods: Fourteen formulations using different alginate (ALG) and CaCl 2 concentrations {{as well as}} <b>hardening</b> <b>times</b> were prepared using extrusion technique. The prepared beads were characterized in terms of size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency and bacterial viabilities in acid (pH 1. 8, 2 hours) condition. Results: The results showed that spherical beads with narrow size distribution ranging from 1. 32 ± 0. 04 to 1. 70 ± 0. 07 mm were achieved with encapsulation efficiency higher than 98 %. Surface response analysis revealed that alginate concentration was the important factor for the size, shape and encapsulation efficiency of prepared beads.

The effects of concentration and pH of CS solution, amount of GA and <b>hardening</b> <b>time</b> on the physicochemical properties and drug release of these microcapsules were investigated. The SEM photomicrographs revealed that surface morphology of microcapsules depended on the pH of CS solution. Decreasing the pH increased the smoothness of the surface due to the relaxation of CS chain in acidic medium. The geometric mean diameters of the microcapsules were between 126 - 212 microns.

A new alternative is using palm kernel oil polyol (PKO-p) -based polyurethane (PU) as filler. Rigid PU is a block copolymer comprised of a monomeric PKO-p and 2, 4 -methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (crude MDI). The property of PKO-p, its ratio with crude MDI and reaction time were determined. The reaction time showed the average of 60 s for cream time and 95 s for rise time with maximum <b>hardening</b> <b>time</b> of 8 min. The reaction between PKO-p to MDI at 1 : 1 ratio resulted in a very short <b>hardening</b> <b>time</b> (within 2 min). The compressive strength of the rigid PU was at 7. 0 MPa at a density of 206 kg/m 3. Further increase in the amount of PKO-p increased the density and compressive strength of the PU.

We find that the same encounters between cusp stars and the BHB that are responsible for the hardening and eccentricity evolution of the binary, lead to a reorientation of the binary orbital plane. In particular, binaries whose angular momentum is initially misaligned with respect to that of the stellar cusp tend to realign their orbital planes with the angular momentum of the cusp on a timescale of a few <b>hardening</b> <b>times.</b> This is due to angular momentum exchange between stars and the BHB during close encounters, and may have important implications for the relative orientation of host galaxies and radio jets.

A 33 full-factorial design and feed-forward neural network with multilayer perceptron was used to investigate the effect of process variables on percentage of entrapment, time required for 50 % and 90 % of the enzyme release, particle size, and angle of repose. Topographical characterization was conducted by scanning electron microscopy, and entrapment was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Times required for 50 % (T 50) and 90 % (T 90) of enzyme release were increased in all 3 of the process variables. Percentage entrapment and particle size {{were found to be}} directly proportional to sodium alginate concentration and inversely proportional to calcium chloride concentration and <b>hardening</b> <b>time,</b> whereas angle of repose and degree of cross-linking showed exactly opposite proportionality. Beads with > 90 % entrapment and T 50 of < 10 minutes could be obtained at the low levels of all 3 of the process variables.
