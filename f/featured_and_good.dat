40|$|Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a part-based image {{representation}} method {{which adds}} a non-negativity constraint to matrix factorization. NMF {{is compatible with}} the intuitive notion of combining parts to form a whole face. In this paper, we propose a framework of face recognition by adding NMF constraint and classifier constraints to matrix factorization to get both intuitive <b>features</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> recognition results. Based on the framework, we present two novel subspace methods: Fisher Non-negative Matrix Factorization (FNMF) and PCA Non-negative Matrix Factorization (PNMF). FNMF adds both the non-negative constraint and the Fisher constraint to matrix factorization. The Fisher constraint maximizes the between-class scatter and minimizes the withinclass scatter of face samples. Subsequently, FNMF improves the capability of face recognition. PNMF adds the non-negative constraint and characteristics of PCA, such as maximizing the variance of output coordinates, orthogonal bases, etc. to matrix factorization. Therefore, we can get intuitive <b>features</b> <b>and</b> desirable PCA characteristics. Our experiments show that FNMF and PNMF achieve better face recognition performance than NMF and Local NMF...|$|R

A test conducted at Taihu Lake in Jiangsu province, China shows that this system can perform well. And this system has many features such as low cost, low consumption, multi-parameter and real-time data upload. The <b>features</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> performance above suggest the practical and potential application of the system in water monitoring. And this system still has much space to improve.

40|$|Short-term {{electricity}} price forecasting is now crucial practice in deregulated electricity markets, as it {{forms the basis}} for maximizing the profits of the market participants. In this thesis, short-term {{electricity price}}s are forecast using three different predictor schemes, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a hybrid scheme, respectively. ANNs are the very popular and successful tools for practical forecasting. In this thesis, a hidden-layered feed-forward neural network with back-propagation has been adopted for detailed comparison with other forecasting models. SVM is a newly developed technique that has many attractive <b>features</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> performance in terms of prediction. In order to overcome the limitations of individual forecasting models, a hybrid technique that combines Fuzzy-C-Means (FCM) clustering and SVM regression algorithms is proposed to forecast the half-hour electricity prices in the UK electricity markets. According {{to the value of}} their power prices, thousands of the training data are classified by the unsupervised learning method of FCM clustering.

It may occurs in oral cavity, tracheobronchial tree, upper gastrointestinal tract and other mucous membrans, too. Due to the plasminogen deficiency, destruction of trauma induced fibrin plaque is defected. Although autosomal ressessive inheritence is described, most of the cases are sporadic. Generally it develops during infancy and childhood, but can occurs at any age. Four year old male infant is introduced to Opthalmology department with pink to red membranous lesion on his left eye extending from conjunctiva to the iris. Histopathologic evaluation of excised material is compatible with ligneous conjunctivitis and diagnosis is confirmed with significant decreased level of plasminogen in the case.
