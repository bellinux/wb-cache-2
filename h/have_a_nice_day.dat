5|$|After {{the release}} of Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!, a {{greatest}} hits record, the duo took a hiatus from the mid-1990s before returning with the albums <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Day</b> (1999) and Room Service (2001). They continued to chart in other territories, mainly in Europe and Latin America, where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards {{until the beginning of}} the new millennium. In 2002, the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again {{for the first time in}} 8 years, in 2009, during Gessle's European Party Crasher tour. In 2011, they released Charm School, their first studio album in ten years. This was followed by Travelling a year later.|$|E

The tour was the third-highest-grossing tour of 2006 taking in just over $131 million, just behind The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang World Tour and Madonna's Confessions Tour. On November 14, 2006, Bon Jovi were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame alongside James Brown and Led Zeppelin.|$|E

50|$|The {{motto of}} the first {{children}} studio 2008 was: the joy of painting, the creative process, the participation, without “rights and wrongs”. Equipped with 1000 canvases, 800 paint brushes and 400 litre buckets of colour, hundreds of children and assistants met to create the biggest children's studio in the world located in the depot of “Rheinbahn Düsseldorf”. This event was under the patronage of Ursula von der Leyen, the minister of family in the German government. The free participation enabled every social rank for <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>day,</b> intercommunity and creativity. The project “the biggest children's studio” was completed in September, 20th 2008 in Düsseldorf and was written down in the Guinness Book of Records.|$|R

This kind of behaviour seems normal now after 3 years of studying in Leeds, but thinking back to the way of life in my town, which sits just south of London, it couldn’t be more different. Before I arrived at university I thought that anything above Watford was northern; Birmingham was WAY up north, and I had never crossed the border from London {{to the rest of the}} country above. I had always fancied the north for my university choice, as I thought the north brought a more ‘fun’ way of life...|$|R
25|$|Cactus Jack {{wrestled}} Big Van Vader on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, {{but being}} severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot {{to sell a}} storyline injury. Vader removed the protective mats at ringside and powerbombed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot. While Foley was away, WCW ran an angle where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a farcical comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia. Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy vignettes that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Day</b> {{that they were the}} brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved.|$|E

On my way home I found myself compelled to visit an old favorite place of mine at the rim of the world highway where I took a moment to sit down by the sequoia grove and write a little song. I just wanted to share this in hopes that one individual's hope and prayer for peace might contribute to the possibility of it in the long run.

500|$|Gessle and Fredriksson reunited in 1998 {{to record}} {{material}} for a new Roxette album, <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Day,</b> which was released in March 1999 and gave Roxette a comeback in continental Europe. It entered at No.1 in Sweden and No.2 in Germany. The first single, [...] "Wish I Could Fly", became their highest charting UK single since 1993 (No.11). In Sweden it charted at No.4, their best position since [...] "Sleeping in My Car." [...] Although the second single, [...] "Anyone," [...] did not chart well in Europe, [...] "Stars," [...] the third single, charted well in Scandinavian and German speaking countries. NME's review called <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Day</b> [...] "...another clever-clever bastard of an album which defies Doctor Rock." [...] A review of [...] "I Wish I could Fly" [...] written by Håkan Steen of Aftonbladet said, [...] "The come-back single is a disappointment. The lyrics which conveys a sense of distance in a relationship, are not particularly engaging." [...] The album, according to Billboard magazine, was under discussion for release in the US, but ultimately, it was not released there.|$|E
500|$|<b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>day</b> is a {{commonly}} spoken expression used to conclude a conversation (whether brief or extensive), or end a message by hoping {{the person to}} whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day. Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers {{at the end of}} a transaction, particularly in Israel and the United States, its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing, according to some journalists and scholars, especially outside of these two countries, a cultural connotation of impersonality, lack of interest, passive–aggressive behavior, or sarcasm. The phrase is generally not used in Europe, as some find it artificial or even offensive. Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative, obliging the person to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>day.</b> Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended. While defenders of the phrase agree that [...] "Have a nice day" [...] can be used insincerely, they consider the phrase to be comforting, in that it improves interactions among people. Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response.|$|E
500|$|In the 1994 film Forrest Gump, title {{character}} Forrest is jogging {{down the street}} when a T-shirt salesman approaches him, asking him to put his face on T-shirts as inspiration to people. While the men are jogging, a truck splashes mud into Forrest's face, and the salesman gives him a yellow shirt to wipe the mud off. Forrest rolls up the shirt and hands it back, saying [...] "have a nice day". Unrolling the shirt, the man finds a smiley face outlined on it. Thus the film credits Forrest Gump with inventing the Smiley logo and the <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>day</b> slogan.|$|E

In doing so, it replaced some non-US hits with songs from <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Day.</b> To promote the release the duo did a small tour of America, performing at the Boston Mixfest and at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square.

500|$|Carol Swiderski of the Chicago Tribune {{wrote that}} {{although}} saying [...] "have a nice day" [...] {{may not be}} sincere, the speaker has acknowledged that the recipient is there.

[...] Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored [...] "insincerely meant human kindness to a robot". She encouraged people to respond to [...] "have a nice day" [...] with [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>day,</b> too" [...] because she hoped that when {{a sufficient number of}} people do this, there could be a time when people will sincerely intend it.|$|E
500|$|Jefferson Starship {{covered the}} song on their 2008 release, Jefferson's Tree of Liberty, with Paul Kantner, David Freiberg, and Cathy Richardson on vocals. Additionally, the Senegalese {{musician}} Youssou N'Dour recorded an unusual cover {{version of the}} song, in which he treated the song as an anthem for the many people in Africa struggling to survive. The melody of [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] was deliberately borrowed by Billy Bragg for the song [...] "Ideology", from his third album, Talking with the Taxman about Poetry, with Bragg's chorus [...] "above the sound of ideologies clashing" [...] echoing Dylan's [...] "we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing". In addition, the Bon Jovi song [...] "Bells of Freedom", from their <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Day</b> album, is somewhat reminiscent of [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] in structure. Neil Young's song [...] "Flags of Freedom" [...] from his Living with War album mentions Dylan by name and melodically recalls the tune and verse structure of [...] "Chimes of Freedom", though Young is listed as the song's only writer.

People with highly variable jobs such as emergency room nurses may appreciate [...] "have a routine day", while mothers of young children may wish to [...] "have a quiet day". Debbie Lundberg wrote in her 2008book <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Day</b> Is Not Thank You, and No Problem Is Not You're Welcome that service people should say [...] "thank you" [...] instead of [...] "have a nice day". She argued that [...] "thank you" [...] is shorter and is a [...] "recognition of the ability you have to thank someone", which adds more worth to the purchase than something that will occur in the future. Paul V. Marshall, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem, concurred, writing in the Reading Eagle that he prefers [...] "thank you" [...] to [...] "have a nice day" [...] or [...] "have a great day" [...] even though [...] "thank you" [...] has a [...] "host of socially acceptable responses". He stated that when people say [...] "thank you", they admit that they are dependent on others, {{which leads to a}} healthier, safer society.|$|E

2500|$|The cage {{giving way}} {{completely}} {{was a surprise}} to both Foley and The Undertaker. The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall. [...] Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around. Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Watching from the back, I thought he was dead. I ran out here and looked down at him, still lying in the ring where he'd landed. His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, like a dead fish's eyes." [...] Foley later said that the only reason he survived the fall was because he did not take the chokeslam properly. In his memoir <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Day,</b> Foley called it both the best and worst chokeslam he ever took, saying that despite its looks, he would have likely died if he had landed properly. He also cited the fact that the ring he landed in had a harder surface than the modern rings do, which stopped his momentum once he landed. Foley would later explain that the roof of the cell was supposed to sag sufficiently so that Undertaker could kick him through, allowing him to dangle by his feet and eventually fall in a rotation to land on his front.|$|E
2500|$|Foley then {{engaged in}} a storyline rivalry with Ric Flair, {{inspired}} by real-life animosity between the two. In <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Day!,</b> Foley wrote that Flair was [...] "every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it." [...] In response, Flair wrote in his autobiography that Foley was [...] "a glorified stuntman" [...] {{and that he was}} able to climb the ladder in the WWF only because he was friends with the bookers. The two had a backstage confrontation at a Raw event in 2003, but Foley has said that they have largely reconciled. To spark the feud, Flair again called Foley a [...] "glorified stuntman" [...] and Foley called Flair a [...] "washed up piece of crap" [...] and challenged him to a match. The result was a Two-out-of-Three Falls match at Vengeance, where Flair beat Foley in two straight falls; with a rollup counter to the figure four in the first and by disqualification in the second after a trashcan shot. After the match, Flair was split wide open by Foley with a barbed-wire bat. The two then wrestled an [...] "I Quit" [...] match at SummerSlam, which Flair won when he forced Foley to quit by threatening Melina with a barbed-wire bat. On the edition of August 21 of Raw, Foley literally kissed Vince McMahon's buttocks as part of McMahon's [...] "Kiss My Ass Club" [...] gimmick after he threatened to fire Melina. Shortly thereafter, she betrayed Foley and announced that he was fired.|$|E
