5|$|During Commando Hunt V (10 October 1970 to 30 April 1971) Air Force {{intelligence}} claimed 16,266 trucks {{destroyed and}} another 7,700 damaged {{during the dry}} season offensive. The Seventh Air Force headquarters in Saigon, chagrined by the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the figures, recomputed them and lowered the estimate to 11,000 destroyed and 8,000 damaged. In fact, there were only 2,500–3,000 PAVN trucks operating on the trail during 1970–1971, each carrying approximately four tons of materiel.|$|E
5|$|I can't complain...Exile {{brought out}} in me, in {{addition}} to a revulsion against violence and against depreciation of the human condition, a feeling for the universality of man. Exile lent me perspectives from which to know my own country from other people's point of view, and from which to live for the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> its misfortune.|$|E
5|$|To {{finance the}} war, the Confederate {{government}} initially issued bonds, but investment {{from the public}} never met the demands. Taxes were lower than in the Union and collected with less efficiency; European investment was also insufficient. As the war proceeded, both the Confederate government and the individual states printed more and more paper money. Inflation increased from 60% in 1861 to 300% in 1863 and 600% in 1864. Davis {{did not seem to}} grasp the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the problem.|$|E

The gospel of Jesus Christ has all the properties of a great and true light; it has a piercing power and penetrating virtue; it enters the darkest recesses of the soul, and detects the errors of men's judgment, as well as discovers the <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> their lives.--Ryland.|$|R
5|$|Balzac's usual mode of {{revision}} involved vast, complicated edits made to galley proofs {{he received}} from the printer. When creating La Cousine Bette, however, he submitted the work to his editor piece by piece, without viewing a single proof. The book was serialized in Le Constitutionnel from 8October to 3December, and Balzac rushed {{to keep up with}} the newspaper's rapid printing schedule. He produced an average of eight pages each day, but was struck by the unexpected <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the story as it evolved. Balzac was paid 12,836 francs for the series, which was later published with Le Cousin Pons as a twelve-volume book by Chiendowski and Pétion. The first collected edition of La Cousine Bette was organized into 132 chapters, but these divisions were removed when Balzac added it to his massive collection La Comédie humaine in 1848.|$|E
5|$|British Railways {{undertook}} a massive programme to establish itself by repainting all its locomotives {{with their new}} BR numbers and replacing their previous corporate identity with its own. Gone were the tenders proclaiming the railway companies' logos, emblems and even coats of arms, {{to be replaced by}} the stark 'BRITISH RAILWAYS' lettering. The <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> this task meant that the necessary repainting was not necessarily carried out to coincide with an overall repaint. For the Coronation Class, all locomotives had been through this process by the end of 1948 except for Nos. 6223, 6238, 6248, 6250, and 6252–6255, a total of 29 locomotives. Only thirteen locomotives out of the 29 received new liveries to accompany their renumbering.|$|E
5|$|The {{event was}} to have been {{sponsored}} by American Express, however they backed out at the last moment failing to come to terms regarding ArtRave's production. Gaga performed a concert which was streamed live on Vevo and later rebroadcast through the website's syndication partners. The set list consisted of songs from Artpop. On November 11, Clear Channel aired a half-hour special called Album Release Party with Lady Gaga, hosted by Ryan Seacrest on more than 150 radio stations throughout the United States. On November 19, The CW aired a television special with footage from the album release party. ArtRave received generally positive reviews from critics who noted the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the production, as well as Gaga's performance and enthusiasm; the launch of Volantis was generally criticised.|$|E
60|$|If the signor {{cared to}} see prisons, he said, the driver must {{take him to}} those of Ecelino, at present the {{property}} of a private gentleman near by. As I had just bought a history of Ecelino, at a great bargain, from a second-hand book-stall, and had a lively interest in all the <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> that nobleman, I sped the driver instantly to the villa of the Signor P----.|$|R

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, I felt my host had been frank with me. If this {{was indeed the}} same Lemuel Gulliver whose repute my infancy had prized so well, I need have no fear of blood and treachery at his hands, however {{primitive}} and disgusting his household, or distorted his intellect might be. He who had proved no tyrant in Lilliput, nor quailed before the <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> Brobdingnag, might abhor the sight of me; he would not play me false.|$|R
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to ascertain fully the employment potential of the telecom sector but the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the opportunities can be gauged {{from the fact that}} there were 3.7 million Public Call Offices in December 2005 up from 2.3 million in December 2004.|$|E

60|$|Never was man more {{completely}} the tool of every villain who gained his ready ear. It was {{the whisper of}} evil counsellors that fired his jealousy of his young brothers, and drove him into rebellion against his father; the evil counsel of William led him to persecute Henry, loving him all the time: and when in possession of his dukedom, his careless, profuse habits kept him in constant poverty, while his idle good-nature left unpunished the <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> the barons who made his country miserable.|$|R

25|$|Evidence and {{the results}} of {{research}} began to appear after Stalin's death. This revealed the full <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the Purges.

25|$|At Lee's sentencing, as {{required}} by Utah Territory statute, {{he was given the}} option of being hanged, shot, or beheaded, and he chose to be shot. In 1877, before being executed by firing squad at Mountain Meadows on March 23, 1877, Lee professed that he was a scapegoat for others involved. Brigham Young stated that Lee's fate was just, but not a sufficient blood atonement, given the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the crime.|$|E
6000|$|Is {{it not to}} {{the same}} system of anarchy, of equalization, and want of subordination, which has been {{recommended}} in some clubs and defended even in the Convention, that we owe the pillages, the murders, the <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> all kinds, which {{it was difficult for}} the officers to put a stop to, from the general spirit of insubordination,--excesses which have rendered the French name odious to the Belgians? Again, is it not to this system of anarchy, and of robbery, that we are indebted for the revolutionary power, which has so justly aggravated the hatred of the Belgians against France? ...|$|R

60|$|The {{struggle}} with America ceased {{about the time}} of Lord Cadurcis' last visit to Cherbury, when, from his indignant lips, Venetia first learnt the <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> her father's career. Since that period some three years had elapsed until we introduced our readers to the boudoir of Lady Monteagle. During this period, among the Whigs and their partisans the literary fame of Herbert had arisen and become established. How they have passed in regard to Lady Annabel Herbert and her daughter, on the one hand, and Lord Cadurcis himself on the other, we will endeavour to ascertain in the following chapter.|$|R
25|$|The commonest of all {{penalties}} was a fine. This {{is awarded}} by the Code for corporal injuries to a mushkenu or to a slave (paid to his master), for damages done to property, or for breach of contract. The restoration of goods appropriated, illegally bought, or damaged by neglect, was usually {{accompanied by a}} fine, giving it the form of multiple restoration. This might be double, treble, fourfold, fivefold, sixfold, tenfold, twelvefold, or even thirtyfold, according to the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the offence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the camp}} of the Red Army beside the Wanquan River, a newly formed Detachment of Women is being trained. Wu Qinghua arrives to meet Hong Changqing and Xiao Pang, who {{introduce}} her to others. In a solo dance, Wu tells the Red Army soldiers the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> Nanbatian's crimes. She then ceremoniously receives a rifle and is {{accepted as a}} member of the Women's Detachment. With determination, they plan to liberate the peasants and slave girls under the oppression of Nanbatian.|$|E
25|$|If {{the offer}} was refused, however, the Mongols would invade and destroy the city or town, but allow a few civilians to flee and spread terror by {{reporting}} their loss. These reports were an essential tool to incite fear in others. However, both sides often had a similar if differently motivated interest in overstating the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the reported events: the Mongols' reputation would increase and the townspeople could use their reports of terror to raise an army. For that reason, specific data (e.g. casualty figures) given in contemporary sources needs to be evaluated carefully.|$|E

60|$|Before {{his time}} the <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> {{the worship of}} Jaghernauth, and {{the horrors of the}} car, beneath which human victims threw themselves, had hardly been realized; and his very {{effective}} style of writing brought into full prominence the atrocities of the Suttee, or burning of widows on the funeral pile, a custom with which {{it was supposed to be}} impossible to interfere, but which has been proved to be entirely a corrupt practice, unsanctioned by any ancient law, only encouraged by the Brahmins out of avarice. Happily the present generation only knows of these atrocities as almost proverbial expressions, but when the century came in they were in full force.|$|R
60|$|This treaty did {{not contain}} one word which could justify any {{interference}} in the Nabob's government. That evil system, as Mr. Hastings calls it, is not even mentioned or alluded to; nor is there, I again say, one word which authorized Warren Hastings, or any other person whatever, to interfere in the interior affairs of his country. He was legally constituted Viceroy of Oude; his dignity of Vizier of the Empire, with all the power which that office gave him, derived from and held under the Mogul government, he legally possessed; and this evil system, which Mr. Hastings says led him to commit the <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> which you shall hear by-and-by, was neither more nor less than what I have now stated.|$|R
25|$|As MacKenzie's layout {{was seen}} by more and more people, a {{collective}} shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed—"looking like rabbits in the headlights"—as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> it. It was a 'classic smear'.|$|E
25|$|Staff {{meetings}} were always held on Fridays in the Astronaut Office {{and it was}} here that Collins found himself on January 27, 1967. Don Gregory was running the meeting in the absence of Alan Shepard and so it was he who answered the red phone to be informed that there was a fire in the Apollo 1 CM. When the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the situation was ascertained, it fell on Collins to go the Chaffee household to tell Martha Chaffee that her husband was dead. The Astronaut Office had learned to be proactive in informing astronauts' families of a death quickly, because of the death of Theodore Freeman in an aircraft crash, when a newspaper reporter was the first to his house.|$|E
25|$|Nuit et Brouillard (Night and Fog, 1955) {{was one of}} {{the first}} documentaries about the Nazi {{concentration}} camps, but it deals more with the memory of the camps than with their actual past existence. Realising that standard documentary techniques would be incapable of confronting the <b>enormity</b> <b>of</b> the horror (and even risked humanising it), Resnais chose to use a distancing technique by alternating historical black-and-white images of the camps with contemporary colour footage of the sites in long tracking shots. The accompanying narration (written by Jean Cayrol, himself a survivor of the camps) was intentionally understated to add to the distancing effect. Although the film encountered censorship problems with the French government, its impact was immense and it remains one of the director's most admired works.|$|E

For which of the vices of that pattern of benevolence, of piety, and of all the virtues, did they put her to death? For which of her vices did they put to death the mildest of all human creatures, the Duchess of Biron? What were the crimes of those crowds of matrons and virgins of condition, whom they mas sacred, with their juries of blood, in prisons and on scaffolds? What were the <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> the infant king, whom they caused, by lingering tortures, to perish in their dungeon, and whom if at last they dispatched by poison, it was in that detestable crime the only act of mercy they have ever shown? ...|$|R

In {{the chapter}} on Power in the [...] "Seven Lamps of Architecture," [...] I have stated what seems, at first, the reverse of what I am saying now; namely, {{that it is better}} to have one grand {{building}} than any number of mean ones. And that is true, but you cannot command grandeur by size till you can command grace in minuteness; and least of all, remember, will you so command it to-day, when magnitude has become the chief exponent of folly and misery, co-ordinate in the fraternal <b>enormities</b> <b>of</b> the Factory and Poorhouse,--the Barracks and Hospital.
