5|$|An X-ray {{study of}} {{pterosaur}} brain cavities {{revealed that the}} animals (Rhamphorhynchus muensteri and Anhanguera santanae) had massive <b>flocculi.</b> The flocculus is a brain region that integrates signals from joints, muscles, skin and balance organs.|$|E
5|$|The flocculus {{sends out}} neural signals that produce small, {{automatic}} {{movements in the}} eye muscles. These keep the image on an animal's retina steady. Pterosaurs may have had such a large flocculus because of their large wing size, which would mean {{that there was a}} great deal more sensory information to process. The low relative mass of the <b>flocculi</b> in birds is also a result of birds having a much larger brain overall; though this has been considered an indication that pterosaurs lived in a structurally simpler environment or had less complex behaviour compared to birds, and recent studies of crocodilians and other reptiles show that it is common for sauropsids to achieve high intelligence levels with small brains.|$|E
60|$|Before {{comparing}} {{these conclusions}} with facts, let us pursue the reasoning a little further, and observe certain subordinate actions. The respective <b>flocculi</b> must be drawn not towards their common {{centre of gravity}} only, but also towards neighbouring <b>flocculi.</b> Hence the whole assemblage of <b>flocculi</b> will break up into groups: each group concentrating towards its local centre of gravity, {{and in so doing}} acquiring a vortical movement like that subsequently acquired by the whole nebula. According to circumstances, and chiefly according {{to the size of the}} original nebulous mass, this process of local aggregation will produce various results. If the whole nebula is but small, the local groups of <b>flocculi</b> may be drawn into the common centre of gravity before their constituent masses have coalesced with one another. In a larger nebula, these local aggregations may have concentrated into rotating spheroids of vapour, while yet they have made but little approach towards the general focus of the system. In a still larger nebula, where the local aggregations are both greater and more remote from the common centre of gravity, they may have condensed into masses of molten matter before the general distribution of them has greatly altered. In short, as the conditions in each case determine, the discrete masses produced may vary indefinitely in number, in size, in density, in motion, in distribution.|$|E
6000|$|But {{now what}} may be {{expected}} by and by to happen? When radiation has adequately lowered the temperature, these molecules will precipitate; and, having precipitated, they will not remain uniformly diffused, but will aggregate into flocculi; just as water, precipitated from air, collects into clouds. Concluding, thus, that a nebulous mass will, in course of time, resolve itself into <b>flocculi</b> of precipitated denser matter, floating in the rarer medium from which they were precipitated, let us inquire what are the mechanical results to be inferred. Of clustered bodies in empty space, each will move along a line which is the resultant of the tractive forces exercised by all the rest, modified from moment to moment by the acquired motion; and the aggregation of such clustered bodies, if it eventually results at all, can result only from collision, dissipation, {{and the formation of}} a resisting medium. But with clustered bodies already immersed in a resisting medium, and especially if such bodies are of small densities, such as those we are considering, the process of concentration will begin forthwith: two factors conspiring to produce it. The <b>flocculi</b> described, irregular in their shapes and presenting, as they must in nearly all cases, unsymmetrical faces to their lines of motion, will be deflected from those courses which mutual gravitation, if uninterfered with, would produce among them; and this will militate against that balancing of movements which permanence of the cluster pre-supposes. If it be said, as it may truly be said, that this is too trifling a cause of derangement to produce much effect, then there comes the more important cause with which it co-operates. The medium from which the <b>flocculi</b> have been precipitated, and through which they are moving, must, by gravitation, be rendered denser in its central parts than in its peripheral parts. Hence the <b>flocculi,</b> none of them moving in straight lines to the common centre of gravity, but having courses made to diverge to one or other side of it (in small degrees by the cause just assigned, and in much greater degrees by the tractive forces of other <b>flocculi)</b> will, in moving towards the central region, meet with greater resistances on their inner sides than on their outer sides; and will be thus made to diverge outwardly from their courses more than they would otherwise do. Hence a tendency which, apart from other tendencies, will cause them severally to go on one or other side of the centre of gravity, and, approaching it, to get motions more and more tangential. Observe, however, that their respective motions will be deflected, not towards one side of the common centre of gravity, but towards various sides. How then can there result a movement common to them all? Very simply. Each flocculus, in describing its course, must give motion to the medium through which it is moving. But the probabilities are infinity to one against all the respective motions thus impressed on this medium, exactly balancing one another. And if they do not balance one another the result must be rotation of the whole mass of the medium in one direction. But preponderating momentum in one direction, having caused rotation of the medium in that direction, the rotating medium must in its turn gradually arrest such <b>flocculi</b> as are moving in opposition, and impress its own motion upon them; and thus there will ultimately be formed a rotating medium with suspended <b>flocculi</b> partaking of its motion, while they move in converging spirals towards the common centre of gravity.[14] ...|$|E
60|$|Third Dissection.-- (Before this is {{performed}} the mammalian skull {{should have been}} studied and examined.) Take {{the head of a}} rabbit, the brain of which has been hardened by spirit, and carefully remove cranium; be particularly careful in picking away the periotic bone, on account of the <b>flocculi</b> of cerebellum. It is difficult to avoid injury to the pituitary body embedded in the basisphenoid bone. Examine with the help of Sheet 8. Make the sections there indicated.|$|E
60|$|Section 122. The {{cerebellum}} (metencephalon) {{consists of}} a central mass, the vermis (v.cbm.), and it also has lateral lobes (l.l.), prolonged into <b>flocculi</b> (f.cbm.), which lastare -em-bedded in pits, [in] the periotic bone, and on that account render the extraction of the brain from the cranium far more difficult than it would otherwise be. The roof of the hind-brain, before and behind the cerebellum, consists of extremely thin plates of nervous matter. Its floor is greatly thickened to form {{the mass of the}} medulla, and in front a great transverse track of fibres is specialized, the pons Varolii (p.V.). Its cavity is called, the fourth ventricle.|$|E
60|$|When {{diffused}} matter, precipitated from a rarer medium, is aggregating, {{there are}} certain {{to be here and}} there produced small <b>flocculi,</b> which long remain detached; as do, for instance, minute shreds of cloud in a summer sky. In a concentrating nebula these will, in the majority of cases, eventually coalesce with the larger <b>flocculi</b> near to them. But it is tolerably evident that some of those formed at the outermost parts of the nebula, will not coalesce with the larger internal masses, but will slowly follow without overtaking them. The relatively greater resistance of the medium necessitates this. As a single feather falling to the ground will be rapidly left behind by a pillow-full of feathers; so, in their progress to the common centre of gravity, will the outermost shreds of vapour be left behind by the great masses of vapour internally situated. But we are not dependent merely on reasoning for this belief. Observation shows us that the less concentrated external parts of nebulæ, are left behind by the more concentrated internal parts. Examined through high powers, all nebulæ, even when they have assumed regular forms, are seen to be surrounded by luminous streaks, of which the directions show that they are being drawn into the general mass. Still higher powers bring into view still smaller, fainter, and more widely-dispersed streaks. And it cannot be doubted that the minute fragments which no telescopic aid makes visible, are yet more numerous and widely dispersed. Thus far, then, inference and observation are at one.|$|E
60|$|Take {{first the}} {{relation}} between the planes of the planetary orbits and the plane of the Sun's equator. If, when the nebulous spheroid extended beyond the orbit of Neptune, all parts of it had been revolving exactly in the same plane, or rather in parallel planes--if all its parts had had one axis; then the planes of the successive rings would have been coincident {{with each other and with}} that of the Sun's rotation. But it needs only to go back to the earlier stages of concentration, to see that there could exist no such complete uniformity of motion. The <b>flocculi,</b> already described as precipitated from an irregular and widely-diffused nebula, and as starting from all points to their common centre of gravity, must move not in one plane but in innumerable planes, cutting each other at all angles. The gradual establishment of a vortical motion such as we at present see indicated in the spiral nebulæ, is the gradual approach towards motion in one plane. But this plane can but slowly become decided. <b>Flocculi</b> not moving in this plane, but entering into the aggregation at various inclinations, will tend to perform their revolutions round its centre in their own planes; and only in course of time will their motions be partly destroyed by conflicting ones, and partly resolved into the general motion. Especially will the outermost portions of the rotating mass retain for a long time their more or less independent directions. Hence the probabilities are, that the planes of the rings first detached will differ considerably from the average plane of the mass; while the planes of those detached latest will differ from it less.|$|E
60|$|Speaking {{generally}} (and {{of course}} differences of distance negative anything beyond average statements), the spiral nebulæ {{are smaller than}} the irregular nebulæ, and more resolvable; {{at the same time}} that they are not so small as the regular nebulæ, and not so resolvable. This is as, according to the hypothesis, it should be. The degree of condensation causing spiral movement, is a degree of condensation also implying masses of <b>flocculi</b> that are larger, and therefore more visible, than those existing in an earlier stage. Moreover, the forms of these spiral nebulæ are quite in harmony with the explanation given. The curves of luminous matter which they exhibit, are not such as would be described by discrete masses starting from a state of rest, and moving through a resisting medium to a common centre of gravity; but they are such as would be described by masses having their movements modified by the rotation of the medium.|$|E
60|$|In {{the third}} place, these remotest <b>flocculi</b> of nebulous matter will, at the outset, be {{deflected}} from their direct courses {{to the common}} centre of gravity, not all on one side, but each on such side as its form, or its original proper motion, determines. And being left behind before {{the rotation of the}} nebula is set up, they will severally retain their different individual motions. Hence, following the concentrated mass, they will eventually go round it on all sides; and as often from right to left as from left to right. Here again the inference perfectly corresponds with the facts. While all the planets go round the sun from west to east, comets as often go round the sun from east to west as from west to east. Of 262 comets recorded since 1680, 130 are direct, and 132 are retrograde. This equality is what the law of probabilities would indicate.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 14: A {{reference}} may fitly be {{made here}} to a reason given by Mons. Babinet for {{rejection of the}} Nebular Hypothesis. He has calculated that taking the existing Sun, with its observed angular velocity, its substance, if expanded so as to fill the orbit of Neptune, would have nothing approaching the angular velocity which the time of revolution of that planet implies. The assumption he makes is inadmissible. He supposes that {{all parts of the}} nebulous spheroid when it filled Neptune's orbit, had the same angular velocities. But the process of nebular condensation as indicated above, implies that the remoter <b>flocculi</b> of nebulous matter, later in reaching the central mass, and forming its peripheral portions, will acquire, during their longer journeys towards it, greater velocities. An inspection of one of the spiral nebulæ, as 51st or 99th Messier, at once shows that the outlying portions when they reach the nucleus, will form an equatorial belt moving round the common centre more rapidly than the rest. Thus the central parts will have small angular velocities, while there will be increasing angular velocities of parts increasingly remote from the centre. And while the density of the spheroid continues small, fluid friction will scarcely at all change these differences.|$|E
60|$|Section 18. The same {{essential}} parts {{are to be}} found in the brain of both frog and rabbit, but in the former the adult is not so widely modified from the primitive condition as in the latter. The fore-brain consists of a thalamencephalon (th.c. and 1), which is exposed in the dorsal view of the brain, and which has no middle commissure. The cerebral hemispheres (c.h.) are not convoluted, do not extend back to cover parts behind them, as they do in the rabbit, and are not connected above the roof of the thalamencephalon by a corpus callosum. Moreover, the parts usually regarded, as the olfactory lobes (rh.) fuse in the middle line. The mid-brain gives rise to the third nerve, and has the optic lobes on its dorsal side, but these are hollow, and they are not subdivided by a transverse groove into corpora quadrigemina, as in the rabbit. In the hind-brain the cerebellum is a mere band of tissue without lateral lobes or <b>flocculi,</b> and the medulla gives origin only to nerves four to ten; there is no eleventh nerve, and the hypoglossal is the first spinal-- from which it has been assumed that the rabbit's medulla equals that of the frog, plus a portion of the spinal cord incorporated with it. The hypoglossal is very distinctly seen on opening the skin beneath the hyoid plate.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the centre}} of a spiral nebula is seen a mass both more {{luminous}} and more resolvable than the rest. Assume that, in process of time, all the spiral streaks of luminous matter which converge to this centre are drawn into it, as they must be; assume further, that the <b>flocculi,</b> or other discrete portions constituting these luminous streaks, aggregate into larger masses {{at the same time}} that they approach the central group, and that the masses forming this central group also aggregate into larger masses; and there will finally result a cluster of such larger masses, which will be resolvable with comparative ease. And, as the coalescence and concentration go on, the constituent masses will gradually become fewer, larger, brighter, and more densely collected around the common centre of gravity. See now how completely this inference agrees with observation. [...] "The circular form is that which most commonly characterises resolvable nebulæ," [...] writes Arago. Resolvable nebulæ, says Sir John Herschel, [...] "are almost universally round or oval." [...] Moreover, {{the centre of}} each group habitually displays a closer clustering of the constituent masses than the outer parts; and it is shown that, under the law of gravitation, which we now know extends to the stars, this distribution is not one of equilibrium, but implies progressing concentration. While, just as we inferred that, according to circumstances, the extent to which aggregation has been carried must vary; so we find that, in fact, there are regular nebulæ of all degrees of resolvability, from those consisting of innumerable minute masses, to those in which their numbers are smaller and the sizes greater, and to those in which there are a few large bodies worthy to be called stars.|$|E

It is exceedingly compact, for 100 pairs of plates need not occupy a trough of more than three feet in length, ii. By Dr. Hare's plan of making the trough turn upon copper pivots which rest upon copper bearings, the latter afford fixed terminations; and these I have found it very convenient to connect with two cups of mercury, fastened {{in the front of}} the stand of the instrument. These fixed terminations give the great advantage of arranging an apparatus to be used in connexion with the battery before the latter is put into action, iii. The trough is put into readiness for use in an instant, a single jug of dilute acid being sufficient for the charge of 100 pairs of four-inch plates, iv. On making the trough pass through a quarter of a revolution, it becomes active, and the great advantage is obtained of procuring for the experiment the effect of the first contact of the zinc and acid, which is twice or sometimes even thrice that which the battery can produce a minute or two after (1036. 1150.). v. When the experiment is completed, the acid can be at once poured from between the plates, so that the battery is never left to waste during an unconnected state of its extremities; the acid is not unnecessarily exhausted; the zinc is not uselessly consumed; and, besides avoiding these evils, the charge is mixed and rendered uniform, which produces a great and good result (1039.); and, upon proceeding to a second experiment, the important effect of first contact is again obtained. vi. The saving of zinc is very great. It is not merely that, whilst in action, the zinc performs more voltaic duty (1128. 1129.), but all the destruction which takes place with the ordinary forms of battery between the experiments is prevented. This saving is of such extent, that I estimate the zinc in the new form of battery to be thrice as effective as that in the ordinary form. vii. The importance of this saving of metal is not merely that the value of the zinc is saved, but that the battery is much lighter and more manageable; and also that the surfaces of the zinc and copper plates may be brought much nearer to each other when the battery is constructed, and remain so until it is worn out: the latter is a very important advantage (1148.). viii. Again, as, in consequence of the saving, thinner plates will perform the duty of thick ones, rolled zinc may be used; and I have found rolled zinc superior to cast zinc in action; a superiority which I incline to attribute to its greater purity (1144.). ix. Another advantage is obtained in the economy of the acid used, which is proportionate to the diminution of the zinc dissolved. x. The acid also is more easily exhausted, and is in such small quantity that there is never any occasion to return an old charge into use. The acid of old charges whilst out of use, often dissolves portions of copper from the black <b>flocculi</b> usually mingled with it, which are derived from the zinc; now any portion of copper in solution in the charge does great harm, because, by the local action of the acid and zinc, it tends to precipitate upon the latter, and diminish its voltaic efficacy (1145.). xi. By using a due mixture of nitric and sulphuric acid for the charge (1139.), no gas is evolved from the troughs; so that a battery of several hundred pairs of plates may, without inconvenience, be close to the experimenter. xii. If, during a series of experiments, the acid becomes exhausted, it can be withdrawn, and replaced by other acid with the utmost facility; and after the experiments are concluded, the great advantage of easily washing the plates is at command. And it appears to me, that in place of making, under different circumstances, mutual sacrifices of comfort, power, and economy, to obtain a desired end, all are at once obtained by Dr. Hare's form of trough.|$|E

40|$|Multimodal {{particle}} size distributions (PSDs) of fine-grained cohesive sediments {{are common in}} a marine and coastal environment. Curve-fitting software in this research decomposed such multimodal PSDs into subordinate log-normal PSDs. The four modal peaks, consisting of four-level ordered structures of primary particles, <b>flocculi,</b> microflocs and macroflocs, were identified and found to alternately rise and sink in a flow-varying tidal cycle due to shear-dependent flocculation. The four modal PSDs could further be simplified to two discrete size groups of <b>flocculi</b> and flocs. This allowed the develoment of a two class population balance equation (TCPBE) model with <b>flocculi</b> and flocs to simulate flocculation involving multimodal PSDs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to suggest a methodology for the practical inversion of acoustic backscatter to obtain suspended mass concentration of marine flocs. Optical data collected using a LISST- 100 at the same time as acoustic backscatter (ABS) measurements were made during a series of controlled flocculation laboratory experiments using kaolin (MacDonald et al., 2013) showed a consistent peak in the particle size distribution at around 10 – 20 μm in 50 of the 75 experimental runs. This peak corresponds to the size of the strongest and most tightly bound of component floc structures referred to as ‘flocculi’ (Van Leussen, 1994; Lee et al., 2012). Log-normal distributions fitted to these peaks accounted for between 30. 1 % and 90. 7 % of the total volume of particles (median 50. 4 %). The equivalent mean floc sizes identified from the FLOCView camera system were between 38 and 92 μm. It was hypothesised that the acoustic backscatter from the flocculated kaolin was occurring from the <b>flocculi</b> (and not the flocs per se) and that the <b>flocculi</b> could be treated as elastic spheres with density and acoustic wave propagation speeds equal to bulk kaolin. The ABS signals were inverted, using the methodology suggested by Lee and Hanes (1995), using the form function and total scattering cross section defined by Moate and Thorne (2009) for particles with a broad size distribution, to determine the particle size. Excluding the unflocculated runs the particle diameters were 15. 5 ± 4. 9 μm; the particle size tended to increase with concentration and with the ‘level’ of flocculation. The viscous attenuation, which cannot be neglected for particles of this size, was also estimated from the ABS data and was found to be consistent with Urick's (1948) model. It is concluded that the <b>flocculi</b> model of acoustic backscatter is supported by laboratory measurements on a simple suspension of kaolin, and may offer a practical way forward for the interpretation of marine field data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Non-syndromic {{familial}} thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAADs), inherited in an {{autosomal dominant}} manner {{in up to}} 19 % of patients, are genetically heterogeneous. The ACTA 2 gene, which encodes the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) -specific isoform of alpha-actin, is known to cause TAADs and occlusive vascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and premature ischemic stroke. We have investigated a Korean family with DeBakey type I aortic dissection related to pregnancy and a strong family history of TAADs. All affected family members underwent surgical repair of the ascending aorta. Other clinical features of familial TAAD, including inguinal hernias, iris <b>flocculi,</b> and livedo reticularis, were not observed. Histologic studies of aortic tissues showed medial degeneration and SMC hyperplasia in the aorta, consistent with previous observations. Molecular analyses of the ACTA 2 gene showed a novel heterozygous missense mutation (c. 76 G>T; p. Asp 26 Tyr).

PSDs were measured with a LISST 100 X and classified using entropy analysis in terms of subtidal alongshore flow. The PSDs during tide-dominated conditions showed distinct multimodal behaviour due to flocculation, revealing that {{the building blocks of}} flocs consist of primary particles (< 3 µm) and <b>flocculi</b> (15 µm). <b>Flocculi</b> comprise clusters of clay minerals, whereas primary particles have various compositions (calcite, clays). The PSDs during storms with a NE-directed alongshore subtidal current (NE storms) are typically unimodal and characterised by mainly granular material (silt, sand) resuspended from the seabed. During storms with a SW-directed alongshore subtidal current (SW storms), by contrast, mainly flocculated material can be identified in the PSDs. The findings emphasise the importance of wind-induced advection, alongshore subtidal flow and highly concentrated mud suspensions (HCMSs) as regulating mechanisms of SPM concentration, as well as other SPM characteristics (cohesiveness or composition of mixed sediment particles) and size distribution in a high-turbidity area. The direction of subtidal alongshore flow during SW storm events results in an increase in cohesive SPM concentration, HCMS formation, and the armouring of sand; by contrast, there is a decrease in cohesive SPM concentration, no HCMS formation, and an increase in sand and silt in suspension during NE storms...|$|E

We have recently demonstrated a 4 -fold increase in the prevalence of BAV in a large cohort of unrelate...|$|E
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleThoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections (TAADs) are a common cause of sudden death of young adults. The pathophysiology of TAAD is complex and multi-factorial. To date, though classic cardiovascular risk factors play a pivotal role in a majority of patients, several genes have been identified in both syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of TAAD, including FBN 1 (Marfan syndrome, MFS) drome type 1 to 3, LDS) [4], SLC 2 A 10 (Arterial tortuosity syndrome, ATS) [5], ACTA 2 (TAAD with livedo reticularis and iris <b>flocculi)</b> [6], MYH 11 (TAAD with patent ductus arteriosus) [7], and MYLK (TAAD 7) [8]. Although clinical features show significant overlap, these entities differ in the extent of vascular involvement and clinical course and, as a consequence, molecular characterization has become crucial in the evaluation, counseling and management of these patients. Among the syndromic forms of TAAD, LDS is a rare autosomal dominant disorder with wide...|$|E
40|$|Images {{from the}} High Resolution Camera on the Chandra X-ray Observatory {{were used to}} measure the proper motion of the neutron star in Cassiopeia A over a {{baseline}} of 10 years (1999 - 2009). One background source and 13 quasi-stationary <b>flocculi</b> were chosen to register the two images. Pixel offsets between features at each epoch were measured using four different statistical methods: Gaussian fitting, centroiding, cross correlation, and the Cash statistic. In many cases the offset measurements disagree in magnitude and/or direction by as much as 1 arcsecond, resulting in large uncertainties. As a result, the measurement for the motion of the neutron star is marginal at 390 +/- 400 km/s in the southeast direction. This motion is typical of the birth velocities of young pulsars and is consistent with the inferred proper motion based on the offset of the neutron star from the center of expansion of the optical ejecta.

40|$|If {{we compare}} two {{monochromatic}} {{photographs of the}} sun, taken respectively with the H_ 2 line of calcium and the H_α line of hydrogen, we find that dark areas on the hydrogen plate correspond roughly in form with bright areas on the calcium plate. The exquisite details of structure, which on sharply defined H_α negatives appear like the delicate tracery of hoar-frost, have no counterpart on H_ 2 negatives, where the bright clouds of calcium vapour, or foccutli, more nearly resemble cumulus clouds in the earth's atmosphere. Thus there is no precise agreement in form, through the larger regions occupied by dark hydrogen and bright calcium <b>flocculi</b> usually do not differ greatly in area or general outline. In certain places dark hydrogen seems {{to be replaced by}} bright hydrogen, which frequently assumes the form of a narrow ring partially or completely encircliing a sun-spot. * Brilliantly luminous areas, rapidly changing in form, are often photographed with Ha, usually in the neighbourhood of active spots (see Plate 1, fig. 1) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} {{shock wave}} positions and expansion in Cas A {{can be interpreted}} in a model of supernova interaction with a freely expanding stellar wind with a mass loss rate of ~ 3 e- 5 Msun/yr for a wind velocity of 10 km/s. The wind was probably still being lost {{at the time of}} the supernova, which may have been of Type IIn or IIb. The wind may play a role in the formation of very fast knots observed in Cas A. In this model, the quasi-stationary <b>flocculi</b> (QSFs) represent clumps in the wind, with a density contrast of several 1000 compared to the smooth wind. The outer, unshocked clumpy wind is photoionized by radiation from the supernova, and is observed as a patchy HII region around Cas A. This gas has a lower density than the QSFs and is heated by nonradiative shocks driven by the blast wave. Denser clumps have recombined and are observed as HI compact absorption features towards Cas A. Comment: 13 pages, ApJL, in pres...|$|E
