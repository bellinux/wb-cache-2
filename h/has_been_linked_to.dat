5|$|Neuroblastoma <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> copy-number {{variation}} {{within the}} NBPF10 gene, {{which results in}} the 1q21.1 deletion syndrome or 1q21.1 duplication syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{recurrent}} miscarriage, {{and possibly}} various complications of pregnancy such as intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, severe pre-eclampsia and abruptio placentae.|$|E

50|$|Byproducts of coal plants <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> acid rain.|$|R
5|$|In humans, the 561 {{amino acid}} EFS protein {{acts as a}} {{scaffolding}} protein for cell signaling based on interactions with SRC, FAK, and other proteins, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> roles in {{the function of the}} immune system, and the development of cancer.|$|E
5|$|Trivalent {{chromium}} {{occurs in}} trace amounts in foods, wine and water. In contrast, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) or Cr6+) is highly toxic and mutagenic when inhaled. Ingestion of chromium(VI) in water <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> stomach tumors, {{and it may}} also cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{studied by}} Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers {{off the island}} of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior {{does not depend on}} feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> a change in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area.|$|E
50|$|Tocotrienols <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{improved}} {{markers of}} heart disease.|$|R
50|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> thyrotoxic {{periodic}} paralysis.|$|R
50|$|Variants at IL18RAP <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{susceptibility}} to Coeliac disease.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{generating}} the activated form of NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression, proteasomal activity <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein most {{frequently}} grows as a colonist of bare and disturbed soil, usually on sandy or chalky ones. It grows best in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, {{although it can}} grow {{in a variety of}} habitats, including banksides, meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. This ability to grow {{in a wide range of}} habitats <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> strong phenotype variation rather than adaptation capacities.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{in young children}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> learning disabilities, and children with blood lead concentrations greater than 10μg/dL {{are in danger of}} developmental disabilities. Increased blood lead level in children has been correlated with decreases in intelligence, nonverbal reasoning, short-term memory, attention, reading and arithmetic ability, fine motor skills, emotional regulation, and social engagement.|$|E

5|$|Sea turtles are {{protected}} by law in Costa Rica, but poaching remains common. Locals take eggs, which {{are believed to be}} an aphrodisiac, and sell them on the black market. The egg trade <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> drug trafficking and organized crime. Environmentalists working in Limón say they are often threatened for trying to protect turtle eggs. Jairo Mora was one such environmentalist working in the area.|$|E
5|$|Team {{cohesion}} {{is viewed}} as ‘‘a general indicator of synergistic group interaction—or process’’. Furthermore, cohesion <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> greater coordination during team-tasks as well as improved satisfaction, productivity, and group interactions. Team efficacy refers to team members’ perceptions of task-specific team competence. This construct is thought {{to create a sense}} of confidence within the team that enables the group to persevere when faced with hardship.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism {{as early}} as 14.5million years ago <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the Anahim hotspot, with the latest {{eruption}} having {{taken place in the}} last 8,000years. This volcanic activity has produced rocks that show a bimodal distribution in composition. While these rocks were being deposited, the hotspot coincided with periods of crustal extension and uplift. Activity in modern times has been limited to earthquakes and volcanic gas emissions.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> atopic {{dermatitis}} and asthma.|$|R
50|$|Some genetic subtypes, in some people, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the disorder.|$|R
50|$|Dopamine has {{a number}} of {{important}} functions in the brain; this includes regulation of motor behavior, pleasures related to motivation and also emotional arousal. It plays a critical role in the reward system; people with Parkinson's disease <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> low levels of dopamine and people with schizophrenia <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> high levels of dopamine.|$|R
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} the most common from a group of {{hereditary}} diseases that cause copper overload in the liver. All can cause cirrhosis at a young age. The other members of the group are Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC), endemic Tyrolean infantile cirrhosis and idiopathic copper toxicosis. These are not related to ATP7B mutations: for example, ICC <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> mutations in the KRT8 and the KRT18 gene.|$|E
5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> {{an increase in}} volcanic activity and its westward migration, but {{it is unlikely that}} the pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E

5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was {{isolated from the}} spleen. The illness {{appeared to be a}} co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
