40|$|Cystic meningiomas {{are rare}} {{variants}} of meningiomas; they can pose a radiological {{as well as}} histopathological diagnostic dilemma. Leaving behind cystic components at surgery can lead to recurrence of a potentially curable tumour. Cyst will certainly affect the surgical strategy and outcome of these patients, therefore, recognition of this entity and keeping it as a differential is important in making surgical decisions. Here, we discuss 48 -year-old female who presented to us with recurrence of left frontotemporal <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumour</b> according to her previous records {{as well as new}} confusing computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging done after her admission to our institution. The final diagnosis confirmed by intraoperative findings as the tumour was atypical extra-axial dural based cystic meningioma...|$|E
30|$|DWI shows {{variable}} signal intensities {{for primary}} and secondary tumours. The ADC is inversely proportional to cellular density. Therefore, the ADC value of high-grade gliomas is classically {{lower than that of}} low-grade gliomas [40]. In the same way, lymphoma tends to have low ADC due to its high cellularity. The tumour may, therefore, appear with high DWI signal intensity. PWI may then be helpful because solid tumours do not show areas of low relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) as a stroke would. On the contrary, rCBV tends to increase with neoplasm grade [41]. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy may be useful too, as the typical pattern of an <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumour</b> includes an elevated peak of choline and reduced NAA, the former not being present in an acute stroke. In cases where the diagnosis remains uncertain, follow-up will confirm or deny the presence of a brain tumour.|$|E
40|$|The {{radiological}} {{diagnosis and}} differential diagnosis of <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumours</b> no longer relies on CT scan and routine MR sequences alone. Standard multiplanar imaging {{has to be}} combined with fMRI to allow the exact anatomic location of the lesion and precise determination of {{the extension of the}} tumour. Perfusion and diffusion MR {{is becoming more and more}} important in the differential diagnosis of cerebral mass lesions and in the grading and typing of gliomas. More sophisticated techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and spectroscopy will further enhance the value of the radiological studies. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Meningiomas {{are highly}} {{vascular}} lesions and therefore demonstrate hyperperfusion on perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), of which dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI {{is the most}} commonly used. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) should be raised and values are typically reported between 6 and 9 with slightly higher or lower values for angiomatous or fibrous subtypes respectively [15]. This is in contrast with metastases which have much lower rCBV values of 2 or less; the exception being the more vascular metastases of renal carcinoma or melanoma which may be indistinguishable from meningiomas [16]. Furthermore, extra-axial tumours in general can be differentiated from <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumours</b> due to the tendency of the former’s time-intensity curve to not return to baseline during the first pass [17]. This is due to their complete lack of a blood-brain barrier allowing more vascular leakage of contrast.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the space}} demands in the cerebellopontine angle lie extra-axially. Important {{structures}} run within the cisterns of the cerebellopontine angle, such as the trigeminal, facial and vestibulocochlear nerves {{as well as the}} anterior inferior and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries and the veins which lead to the petrosal sinus. The most common space demands are caused by acoustic neuromas, meningeomas, vascular ectasia and aneurysms. Less common are epidermoid and other schwannomas as well as metastases, paragangliomas and arachnoidal cysts. <b>Intra-axial</b> <b>tumours</b> {{in the area of the}} cerebellopontine angle include the medulloblastoma, astrocytoma and the ependymoma, which occurs predominantly in children, in addition to the uncommon choroid plexus papilloma. Nearby, there are also space demands around the petrous bone, such as cholesterol granuloma, malignant otitis media, paraganglioma and metastases. For differential diagnosis, an understanding {{of the space}} requirements of the tumours in the cerebellopontine angle is needed in addition to knowledge of the anatomical structures...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the mechanism of}} cyst formation in extra-axial tumours in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Cyst fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasma were analysed in eight patients with nine peritumoral cysts: four with meningiomas, two with intracranial and two spinal intradural schwannomas. Measuring concentrations of various proteins [albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, alpha(2) -macroglobulin and IgM] in cyst fluid, CSF and blood plasma provides insight into the state of the semipermeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Peritumoral cysts accompanying <b>intra-axial</b> brain <b>tumours</b> are the end result of disruption of the BBB and oedema formation. Unlike <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumours</b> which lie embedded within nervous tissue, extra-axial tumours tend to be separated from nervous tissue by arachnoid and pia mater. High concentrations of proteins were measured in the cyst fluid, approaching blood plasma levels, suggesting a local barrier disruption, and passage across the arachnoid, pia mater and cortical/medullary layer into the CNS parenchyma, leaving the protein concentrations of CSF practically unchanged. We confirmed that very high concentrations of protein {{are to be found in}} tumour cysts, plasma proteins forming almost 90 % of the total protein in the cyst. We review current hypotheses on the pathogenesis of cysts accompanying neoplasms, particularly meningiomas and schwannomas, and conclude that the majority of proteins in cyst fluid in extra-axial, intradural meningiomas and schwannomas are plasma proteins. This provides a strong argument for pathogenesis of extra-axial intradural tumour cysts in favour of leakage of plasma proteins out of the tumour vessels into the nervous tissue...|$|R
30|$|Bilateral VCP is {{indicative}} of a central cause in the medulla oblongata [8]. Acute onset of symptoms also points toward a central cause. The area of the medullary nuclei of the vagal nerve can best be evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [9, 10], using T 2 -weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T 1 -unenhanced and gadolinium-enhanced imaging. Possible pathology in the medulla oblongata comprises demyelinating diseases, infarction and <b>intra-axial</b> <b>tumours</b> [1, 7, 11, 12]. The cisternal part is best visualised by high-resolution heavily T 2 -weighted sequences and T 1 -weighted imaging with gadolinium [13, 14]. At this location, the vagal nerve can be affected by external compression by extra-axial masses, vascular structures, or by pathology that affects the nerve itself like schwannoma, paraganglioma or neuritis [1, 7, 11, 12]. If multiple cranial nerves are involved, the jugular foramen should be scrutinised. Pathology {{in and around the}} jugular foramen is best depicted by an MRI of the posterior fossa comprising T 2 -weighted imaging, DWI and T 1 -unenhanced and gadolinium-enhanced imaging [9, 13, 14].|$|R
40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) {{has been}} indicated being a significant oncomodulator. Recent reports {{have suggested that}} an antiviral treatment alters {{the outcome of a}} glioblastoma. We analysed the performance of commercial HCMV-antibodies applying the immunohistochemical (IHC) methods on brain sample obtained from a subject with a verified HCMV infection, on samples obtained from 14 control subjects, and on a tissue microarray block containing cores of various brain tumours. Based on these trials, we selected the best performing antibody and analysed a cohort of 417 extra- and <b>intra-axial</b> brain <b>tumours</b> such as gliomas, medulloblastomas, primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and meningiomas. HCMV protein pp 65 immunoreactivity was observed in all types of tumours analysed, and the IHC expression did not depend on the patient’s age, gender, tumour type, or grade. The labelling pattern observed in the tumours differed from the labellin...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the peri-tumoural choline/N-acetyl- aspartate ratio {{can be used to}} differentiate solitary primary <b>intra-axial</b> brain <b>tumour</b> and metatasis. Methods: In this retrospective study, 18 treatment-naïve adults presenting with a solitary intra-axial mass underwent conventional contrast-enhanced and proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging. The images were interpreted retrospectively by an experienced neuroradiologist and a radiology fellow with 6 years' experience. The radiologists were blinded to the clinicopathological and demographic data. The choline/N-acetyl-aspartate ratio was measured over the area of peri-tumoural oedema, which was defined by T 2 hyperintensity and non-enhancing areas immediately adjacent to the enhancing portion of the tumour. A peri-tumoural choline/N-acetyl-aspartate ratio of > 1 was classified as positive, meaning primary brain tumour. Statistical analysis was performed using a 2 x 2 contingency table. The interclass correlation coefficient (alpha) was calculated as the index of concordance exceeding chance for inter-rater reliability. Results: Of 18 patients, four were excluded from the study owing to absence of peri-tumoural cerebral oedema. Of the remaining 14 patients, nine had a solitary intra-axial high-grade gliomas confirmed pathologically, of whom eight had a peri-tumoural choline/N-acetyl-aspartate ratio of > 1. The remaining five patients were classified as having a solitary brain metastasis with no known primary. A choline/N-acetyl-aspartate ratio of > 1 in peritumoural region {{can be used as a}} parameter predicting a primary brain tumour; respective values for sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 90 %, 100 %, 100 % and 83 %, respectively. Conclusion: The peri-tumoural choline/N-acetyl-aspartate ratio of > 1 can be used as a parameter to differentiate the <b>intra-axial</b> primary brain <b>tumour</b> from metastasis. © 2010 Hong Kong College of Radiologists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The goal of {{the current}} study was to assess the usefulness, {{reliability}} and safety of the imageguided stereotactic biopsy of <b>intra-axial</b> brain <b>tumours.</b> METHODS The study was conducted within a time frame of one year. 20 patients – 14 males and 6 females (median age 63. 5 years) were included. Computerized tomography (CT) – guidedstereotactic biopsies were performed by a single stereotactic neurosurgeon. A modifiedRiechert Stereotactic System (MHT Medical High Tech) and a workstation for multiplanartrajectory planning (Amira) were used. Biopsies were done with small forceps and 10 – 15 samples were collected for histological analysis. During the operations also touch imprints and crush smears of the specimens were examined by the cytopathologist. Correct place ofthe biopsy and any detectable bleeding were analyzed by post-op CT scan. Descriptivestatistic methods were used and results were compared with the data from the literature. RESULTS Overall treatment morbidity was limited to one patient (5 %), there was no mortality. A conclusive tissue diagnosis could be achieved in 19 out of 20 patients (95 %). There were 3 glioblastomas, 3 anaplastic astrocitomas, 5 astrocitomas, 1 inflammation, 2 lymphomas,and 2 malignant tumours – not further classified and 3 metastasis. All patients had postbiopsy CT scan to check for haemorrhage (none occurred). CONCLUSIONS MHT Stereotactic system and Amira multiplanar image guided trajectory planningsoftware are reliable tools enabling trained stereotactic neurosurgeon to obtain tissuediagnosis in almost every case with very little morbidit...|$|R
