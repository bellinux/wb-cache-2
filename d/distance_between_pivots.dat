50|$|The Kater {{pendulum}} {{consists of}} a rigid metal bar with two pivot points, one near {{each end of the}} bar. It can be suspended from either pivot and swung. It also has either an adjustable weight that can be moved up and down the bar, or one adjustable pivot, to adjust the periods of swing. In use, it is swung from one pivot, and the period timed, and then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the period timed. The movable weight (or pivot) is adjusted until the two periods are equal. At this point the period T is equal to the period of an 'ideal' simple pendulum of length equal to the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>pivots.</b> From the period and the measured <b>distance</b> L <b>between</b> the <b>pivots,</b> the acceleration of gravity can be calculated with great precision from the equation (1) above.|$|R
5000|$|Kater {{performed}} 12 trials.

He measured the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>pivot</b> blades with a microscope comparator, to an accuracy of 10−4 in. (2.5 μm).

25|$|When either {{wheel is}} {{deflected}} upward, the center {{span of the}} spring (the portion between the pivotable mounts) deflects downward. If both wheels deflect upward {{at the same time}} (for example, when hitting a bump in the road) the center section bends uniformly <b>between</b> the <b>pivot</b> mounts. In a roll, only one wheel is deflected upwards, which tends to form the center of the spring into an S-shaped curve. The result is that the wheel rate of one side of the suspension depends on the displacement of the other side. The extent to which the spring acts as an anti-roll bar depends on the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>pivot</b> mounts and their rigidity.|$|R
50|$|To use, the {{pendulum}} was {{hung from a}} bracket on a wall, with the knife blade pivots supported on two small horizontal agate plates, {{in front of a}} precision pendulum clock to time the period. It was swung first from one pivot, and the oscillations timed, then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the oscillations timed again. The small weight (c) was adjusted with the adjusting screw, and the process repeated until {{the pendulum}} had the same period when swung from each pivot. By putting the measured period T, and the measured <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>pivot</b> blades L, into the period equation (1), g could be calculated very accurately.|$|R

They are found by balancing the pendulum on a knife edge to find its center of gravity, and measuring {{the distances}} {{of each of the}} pivots from the center of gravity.

2500|$|Kater built a {{reversible}} pendulum (shown at right) {{consisting of a}} brass bar with two opposing pivots made of short triangular [...] "knife" [...] blades (a) near either end. It could be swung from either pivot, with the knife blades supported on agate plates. Rather than make one pivot adjustable, he attached the pivots a meter apart and instead adjusted the periods with a moveable weight on the pendulum rod (b,c). In operation, the pendulum is hung {{in front of a}} precision clock, and the period timed, then turned upside down and the period timed again. The weight is adjusted with the adjustment screw until the periods are equal. Then putting this period and the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>pivots</b> into equation (1) gives the gravitational acceleration g very accurately.|$|R

This invention provides miniature motions of a TCD transducer probe to optimize TCD signals. The mechanical probe uses spherical bearing in guiding and locating the tilting crystal face. The lateral motion of the crystal face as it tilts across {{the full range of}} motion was achieved by minimizing the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>pivot</b> location and the crystal face. The smallest commonly available metal spherical bearing was used with an outer diameter of 12 mm, a 3 -mm tall retaining ring, and 5 -mm overall height.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the problem of}} reducing the cost of searching for the k closest pairs in metric spaces. In general, a k-closest pair search method initializes the upper bound <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the k closest pairs as infinity and repeatedly updates the upper bound distance whenever it finds pairs of objects whose distances are shorter than that distance. Furthermore, it prunes dissimilar pairs whose distances are estimated as longer than the upper bound distance based on the distances from the pivot to objects and the triangle inequality. The cost of a k-closest pair query is smaller for a shorter upper bound distance and a sparser distribution of <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> the <b>pivot</b> and objects. We propose a new divide-and-conquer-based k-closest pair search method in metric spaces, called Adaptive Multi-Partitioning (AMP). AMP repeatedly divides and conquers objects from the sparser distance-distribution space and speeds up the convergence of the upper bound distance before partitioning the denser space. As a result, AMP can prune many dissimilar pairs compared with ordinary divide-and-conquer-based method. We compare our method with other partitioning method and show that AMP reduces distances computations...|$|R
2500|$|British {{physicist}} and army captain Henry Kater in 1817 realized that Huygens' principle {{could be used}} to find the length of a simple pendulum with the same period as a real pendulum. [...] If a pendulum was built with a second adjustable pivot point near the bottom so it could be hung upside down, and the second pivot was adjusted until the periods when hung from both pivots were the same, the second pivot would {{be at the center of}} oscillation, and the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the two <b>pivots</b> would be the length L of a simple pendulum with the same period.|$|R

After applying corrections for the finite amplitude of swing, the buoyancy of the bob, the barometric pressure and altitude, and temperature, he obtained a value of 39.13929inches for the seconds pendulum at London, in vacuum, at sea level, at 62°F. The largest variation from the mean of his 12 observations was 0.00028 in. representing a precision of gravity measurement of 7×10−6 (7 mGal or 70 µm/s2). Kater's measurement was used as Britain's official standard of length (see below) from 1824 to 1855.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} the self-excited rotation of an elliptical cylinder towed in a viscous fluid as a canonical model of nonlinear fluid structure interactions with possible {{applications in the}} design of sensors and energy extraction devices. First, the self-excited ellipse system is shown to be analogous to the forced bistable oscillators studied in classic chaos theory. A single variable, the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>pivot</b> and the centroid, governs the system bifurcation into bi-stability. Next, fully coupled computational fluid dynam-ics simulations of the motion of the cylinder demonstrate limit cycle, period doubling, intermittently chaotic, and fully chaotic dynamics as the distance is further adjusted. The viscous wake behind the cylinder is presented for the limit cycle cases and new types of stable wakes are characterized for each. In contrast, a chaotic case demonstrates an independence of the wake and structural states. The rotational kinetic energy is quan-tified and correlated to the vortex shedding and the trajectory periodicity. Chaotic and high-period system responses are found to persist when structural damping is applied and for Reynolds numbers as low as 200.

50|$|In Kater's time, {{the period}} T of pendulums could be {{measured}} very precisely by timing them with precision clocks {{set by the}} passage of stars overhead. Prior to Kater's discovery, the accuracy of g measurements was limited by the difficulty of measuring the other factor L, {{the length of the}} pendulum, accurately. L in equation (1) above was the length of an ideal mathematical 'simple pendulum' consisting of a point mass swinging {{on the end of a}} massless cord. However the 'length' of a real pendulum, a swinging rigid body, known in mechanics as a compound pendulum, is more difficult to define. In 1673 Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens in his mathematical analysis of pendulums, Horologium Oscillatorium, showed that a real pendulum had the same period as a simple pendulum with a length equal to the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the <b>pivot</b> point and a point called the center of oscillation, which is located under the pendulum's center of gravity and depends on the mass distribution along the length of the pendulum. The problem was there was no way to find the location of the center of oscillation in a real pendulum accurately. It could theoretically be calculated from the shape of the pendulum if the metal parts had uniform density, but the metallurgical quality and mathematical abilities of the time didn't allow the calculation to be made accurately.|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of a}} {{committee}} appointed by the Royal Society in 1816 to reform British measures, Kater had been contracted by the House of Commons to determine accurately {{the length of the}} seconds pendulum in London. He realized Huygens' principle could be used to find the center of oscillation, and so the length L, of a rigid (compound) pendulum. If a pendulum were hung upside down from a second pivot point that could be adjusted {{up and down on the}} pendulum's rod, and the second pivot were adjusted until the pendulum had the same period as it did when swinging right side up from the first pivot, the second pivot would be at the center of oscillation, and the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the two <b>pivot</b> points would be L. Kater wasn't the first to have this idea. French mathematician Gaspard de Prony first proposed a reversible pendulum in 1800, but his work was not published till 1889. In 1811 Friedrich Bohnenberger again discovered it, but Kater independently invented it and was first to put it in practice.|$|R
40|$|Among {{the metric}} space {{indexing}} methods, AESA {{is known to}} produce the lowest query costs {{in terms of the}} number of distance computations. However, its quadratic construction cost and space consumption makes it infeasiblefor large dataseis. There have been some work on reducing the space requirements of AESA. Instead of keeping all the <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> objects, LAESA appoints a subset of the database as pivots, keeping only the <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> objects and <b>pivots.</b> Kvp uses the idea of prioritizing the pivots based on their distances to objects, only keeping pivot distances that it evaluates as promising. FQA discretizes the distances using a fixed amount of bits per distance instead of using system's floating point types. Varying the number of bits to produce a performance-space trade-off was also studied in Kvp. Recently, BAESA has been proposed based on the same idea, but using different distance ranges for each pivot. The t-spanner based indexing structure compacts the distance matrix by introducing an approximation factor that makes the pivots less effective. In this work, we show that the Kvp prioritization is oriented toward symmetric distance distributions. We offer a new method that evaluates the effectiveness of pivots in a better fashion by making use of the overall distance distribution. We also simulate the performance of our method combined with distance discretization. Our results show that our approach is able to offer very good space-performance trade-offs compared to AESA and tree-based methods. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|On {{level with}} plastic {{deformations}} an elastic interaction between elements of rolling equipment and rolled metal takes important place in sheet steel rolling. Contacts between work roll and rolled band, {{between work and}} backup rolls are examples of such interactions. In contrast to the work roll and rolled band contact interaction, which {{is the subject of}} many detailed theoretical and experimental investigations, the work roll and backup roll contact is considered only {{from the point of view}} of rolling load redistribution in multirolled systems. However, wide application of profiled rolls’ axial shifting in unscheduled rolling technology demands further investigations of elastic interaction with slippage. Inconstancy of <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> rolls’ <b>pivot</b> pins and contact surfaces leads to local mismatch between peripheral speeds of work and backup rolls. This effect is a reason of slippage. Later on it leads to uneven wear of work rolls. It must be necessarily taken into account while developing roll contours for axial shifting and algorithms for unscheduled rolling technology with automatic profile and flatness control for ensuring of rolled band’s profile which satisfies consumer’s demands. In the article there is formulated target setting of elastic contact of two osculating half-planes under speed asymmetry and compressive load. Principle of virtual work was used. There are obtained approximate solutions for completely elastic earth describing deflected mode without relative speed (Hertzian problem) and under speed asymmetry, which leads to appearance of slip zones on a contact surface. Influence of acting load, speed asymmetry, constant of friction and Poisson's ratio on slip zones‘ lengths is shown. In the article there are presented dependencies for correction of wear factors of work rolls, which are used in finishing train’s stands of wide-strip hot rolling mill with equipment for axial shifting. These dependencies are used to determine wear values of profiled work and backup rolls...|$|R

40|$|A linear elastic second {{gradient}} orthotropic two-dimensional solid that is invariant under (Formula presented.) {{rotation and}} for mirror transformation is considered. Such anisotropy {{is the most}} general for pantographic structures that are composed of two identical orthogonal families of fibers. It {{is well known in}} the literature that the corresponding strain energy depends on nine constitutive parameters: three parameters related to the first gradient part of the strain energy and six parameters related to the second gradient part of the strain energy. In this paper, analytical solutions for simple problems, which are here referred to the heavy sheet, to the nonconventional bending, and to the trapezoidal cases, are developed and presented. On the basis of such analytical solutions, gedanken experiments were developed {{in such a way that}} the whole set of the nine constitutive parameters is completely characterized in terms of the materials that the fibers are made of (i. e., of the Young’s modulus of the fiber materials), of their cross sections (i. e., of the area and of the moment of inertia of the fiber cross sections), and of the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the nearest <b>pivots.</b> On the basis of these considerations, a remarkable form of the strain energy is derived in terms of the displacement fields that closely resembles the strain energy of simple Euler beams. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the presented results.
