40|$|Investigating the {{collapse}} of a building poses multiple and complex forensic challenges. Large numbers of specialized personnel and equipment are required, as are the combined technical skills of many different kinds of forensic investigators. Forensic pathology teams are integral to these efforts. This report describes the investigation that occurred after a building collapsed in southern Italian location. Several families were still living in small, and abandoned building built in the early 20 th century. The buildings were located over cellars 3 meters underground, known locally as “the caves. ” Eight people were found dead under the debris of one of {{the collapse}}d houses and 6 were brought out alive. A team of forensic pathologists and engineers was appointed to investigate the causes of death and of the collapse, respectively. A complete autopsy was performed in every case, along with radiologic assessment and toxicological analysis. Autopsy findings were coded using the Abbreviated Injury Scale and the New Injury Severity Score. Systems for victim <b>identification,</b> <b>arrangements</b> for human remains, management of dead bodies, evaluation of the different patterns of injuries and, finally, detailed identification of the cause of death all played an important role...|$|E

In the area extraction, the area is extracted as the minimum rectangle surrounding all BBs belonging to the area (refer to “Extraction of the area {{for a group of}} regularly arranged objects” section). Moreover, in the <b>identification</b> of the <b>arrangement</b> patterns, the BoW vector independent of the number of BBs is used (refer to “Identifying arrangement patterns” section).

40|$|Despite recent {{developments}} in computer-aided design in architecture, {{both in terms of}} form generation techniques and performance-based design tools, there still appears to be polarization between the “visual” and the “technical” elements of design. Two causes of this are discussed: long-standing tradition within the discipline and perception of design as primarily a visual exercise. Structural layout optimization is a technique which enables automatic <b>identification</b> of optimal <b>arrangements</b> of structural elements in frames. As the technique appears to have the potential to help reduce the polarization between the visual and the technical elements of design, it can be considered as an “integrative” form generation tool. Applications of the technique are considered via three design examples, demonstrating both its potential and areas where refinement is required before it is suitable for application in practice...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} properties of components made of short fibre reinforced composites, generally obtained by injection moulding, are strongly linked to fibre orientation. Therefore, {{it is of}} great importance {{to be able to}} verify the results of manufacturing process simulations obtained by commercial software. From the experimental point of view, the definition of carbon short fibre structure within a polymeric matrix in a micro-tomography is a non-trivial task, as the X-rays absorption properties of the two phases are very similar. This paper presents how this problem was overcome by using phase contrast imaging techniques. High resolution fibre structure reconstructions could therefore be obtained. The reconstruction of a large sample volume by overlapping of successive tomographies was also discussed.

40|$|Abstract Background Today, {{recognition}} and classification of sequence motifs and protein folds is a mature field, {{thanks to the}} availability of numerous comprehensive {{and easy to use}} software packages and web-based services. Recognition of structural motifs, by comparison, is less well developed and much less frequently used, possibly {{due to a lack of}} easily accessible and easy to use software. Results In this paper, we describe an extension of DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer through which structural motifs may be defined and searched for in large protein structure databases, and we show that common structural motifs involved in stabilizing protein folds are present in evolutionarily and structurally unrelated proteins, also in deeply buried locations which are not obviously related to protein function. Conclusions The possibility to define custom motifs and search for their occurrence in other proteins permits the <b>identification</b> of recurrent <b>arrangements</b> of residues that could have structural implications. The possibility to do so without having to maintain a complex software/hardware installation on site brings this technology to experts and non-experts alike. </p...|$|R

Different <b>arrangements</b> of FFANN were taken into consideration {{to find out the}} best topology which can produce identification results with acceptable accuracy levels. In order to examine the performance of the FFANN and obtain the satisfactory arrangements, different numbers of input data sets are tested. The test results showed that the use of very large number of input data will cause a large increase in training time beside to it may lead to unstable FFANN with over-fitting. To avoid these deteriorated results, different data reduction techniques have been proposed for reducing dimensionality of the input data to achieve an acceptable data reduction level. The conducted results indicated that the FFANN models have been successfully employed for crack identification and estimates the turbine operating conditions using vibration data sets. Moreover the results revealed that the pruning mechanism which is based on the data reduction mechanism can led to satisfactory results...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} how {{population}} dynamics in a post-socialist Russian village intertwine {{with the use}} of local resources. Specifically, it explores two interrelated issues: first, it looks at how attitudes to local resources vary, depending on people’s ways of engaging with place; second, it focuses on the contexts in which people reify and manipulate their identification with place by ascribing place-related identities to themselves and others as they deal with local resources. The research is based on fieldwork carried out in the village of Kuzomen’ on the White Sea Coast, in north-west Russia. Traditionally, research in Russia has focused on regions in which farming or herding is the main source of livelihood. This thesis explores the peculiarity of post-Soviet conditions in a part of Russia where fishing is the prevailing economic activity. The following questions were addressed: 1) what factors affect people’s relations with and attitudes towards resources in Kuzomen’? 2) how does the postsocialist condition affect resource use in the area? 3) what is the connection between people’s identification with place and their attitudes to its resources? The main findings are that the specificity of postsocialist conditions in Russia and population migration in Kuzomen’ have contributed to the differentiation of people’s attitudes to local resources. In particular, {{there is a difference between}} local people and incomers on the one hand, and between permanent dwellers and summer visitors on the other. The deterioration of established systems of state management and control, and the inefficient implementation of newly emerged legislation regarding resource use in post-Soviet Russia, have led to a situation in which access to resources is often regulated through informal arrangements. In these <b>arrangements,</b> <b>identification</b> with place becomes important as people use place-related identities such as local or incomer in their negotiations over access and rights to local resources.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the thesis is to develop recommendations for institutional arrangements within various levels of government agencies concerned with irrigation for improved development and management of small scale irrigation in Lao PDR. Secondary objectives of the thesis are the identification of a legal framework {{to protect the rights}} of investors, developers and beneficiaries; and the <b>identification</b> of financial <b>arrangements</b> to ensure the availability of funds for construction and development, as well as the generation of funds for effective operation and maintenance. Using experience from studies in other Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries and within Lao PDR, the thesis reviews existing organisational arrangements for the irrigation sub-sector in Lao PDR and makes recommendations for change. It is acknowledged that some of existing arrangements, although not ideal, are unlikely to be changed within the next few years. Funding arrangements for irrigation are set out on the basis that the water users will contribute substantially to costs. Government funding flows are detailed and again it is noted that change is unlikely. The organisation of the National level Department of Irrigation is considered in some detail with recommended roles and responsibilities recommended for five operational divisions. These are the Survey, Study and Design Division; the Technical Management Division; the Operations and Maintenance Division; the Administrative Division; and the Planning and Cooperation Division. Operational units of each of these divisions are also detailed. Staff numbers for each unit have been estimated and the recommended minimum number of staff required to effectively operate the Department of Irrigation is specified. Detailed job descriptions determined from an analysis of the capabilities and needs of the Government and experiences of the literature review, sub-sectoral review and case studies have been published separately. These recommendations are considered to adequately meet the objectives of the thesis. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

40|$|Improving public {{accountability}} is currently {{high on the}} global agenda. At the same time, the organisation of health services in low- and middle-income countries {{is taking place in}} fragmented institutional landscapes. State and non-state actors are involved in increasingly complex governance arrangements. This often leads to coordination problems, confusion of roles and responsibilities and possibly accountability gaps. This study aimed at assessing the governance arrangements and the accountability practices of key health actors at the level of a Ghanaian health district with the aim to understand how far public {{accountability is}} achieved. We adopted the case study design as it allows for in-depth analysis of the governance arrangements and accountability relations between actors, their formal policies and actual accountability practices towards the public and towards stakeholders. Data were collected at a rural health district using in-depth interviews, observation and document review. In the analysis, we used a four-step sequence: identification of the key actors and their relationships, description of the multi-level governance <b>arrangements,</b> <b>identification</b> of the actual accountability relations and practices between all actors and finally appraisal of the public accountability practices, which we define as those practices that ensure direct accountability towards the public. In this rural health district with few (international) non-governmental organisations and private sector providers, accountability linkages towards management and partners in health programmes were found to be strong. Direct accountability towards the public, however, was woefully underdeveloped. This study shows that in settings where there is a small number of actors involved in organising health care, and where the state actors are underfunded, the intense interaction can lead to a web of relations that favours collaboration between partners in health service delivery, but fails public accountability. It is clear that new formal channels need to be created by all actors involved in health service delivery to address the demand of the public for accountability. If the public does not find an adequate response to its genuine concerns, distrust between communities and service users on one hand, and providers, international non-governmental organisations and District Health Management Teams on the other is likely to increase to the detriment of all parties' interests...|$|R
