Researches of {{temperature}} effect on plant {{have yet to}} provide obvious results of how leaf temperature and media temperature differs plant growth. The research of objectives are to study effects of water temperature irrigated to media and water temperature sprayed to the leaves on Chili seedling growth. Completely randomized block design {{was used in the}} research. The factor studied were <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> <b>watering</b> media and <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> spraying seedling leaves. The result showed that <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> spraying seedling leaves significantly affected all variables observed, including seedling height, seedling diameter, leaf size, wet weight of seedling, wet weight of the roots, dried weigh of seedling, and dried weigh of the roots. <b>Water</b> temperature <b>for</b> <b>watering</b> media did not significantly affect all variables observed. There were significant interactions between <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> <b>watering</b> media and <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> spraying seedling leaves on seedling diameter and leaf size. Water temperature of 120 C <b>for</b> <b>watering</b> media in combination with normal <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> spraying seedling leaves was the best treatment combination, while water temperature of 120 C <b>for</b> <b>watering</b> media in combination with 120 C <b>water</b> temperature <b>for</b> spraying seedling leaves was the worst treatment...|$|R

From October 1961 to August 1969 he was the leading professional official within the United States government developing and implementing policies for comprehensive river basin planning. In 1968 he drafted and gained political acceptance of a Water Resources Councils' regulation changing the discount rate used in planning water projects from a formula based on the coupon rate of government bonds to one based on the yield rateâ€”a substantial and important policy change.
