5000|$|During the Cold War arms race, {{the nuclear}} threat {{was used to}} justify the cost of {{providing}} a more capable system. These developments led eventually to the deployment of the Global Positioning System (GPS). The US Navy required precise navigation to enable submarines to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs. The USAF had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system, as did the United States Army for geodetic surveying [...] for which purpose they had developed the SECOR system. SECOR used ground-based transmitters from known locations that sent signals to satellite transponder in orbit.

40|$|Southern Tunisia is {{a region}} very prone to wind erosion {{because of its}} soil features, and the {{development}} of mechanized agriculture.

40|$|Data {{from the}} series of Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometers (TOMS) have been {{compared}} to column ozone measurements taken by ground-based systems (Dobsons, Brewers and Filtermeters). On average, the comparisons show good agreement, with approximately 80 % of the ground stations having less than a 2. 5 % standard deviation when compared to TOMS on a monthly mean basis. There are, however, differences that imply possible errors either in the TOMS ozone retrieval algorithm or in the basic assumptions used by the ground-based instruments. Some of the issues arising from these differences are: What are the relative calibrations of TOMS instruments? Why do the calibrations of the <b>ground-based</b> <b>stations</b> vary {{as much as they}} do with respect to TOMS as a transfer standard? Why are the TOMS data so much larger (approximately 6 %) than the ground-based data in Antarctica and other ice-covered locations?

30|$|The {{duration}} of the LIDAR operation was determined based on several factors.
