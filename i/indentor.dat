Substrates made of plastically graded materials are often encountered in nature or are artificially produced as a result of chemical and/or physical surface treatments. The variation of the plastic properties depends on micro-structural or compositional changes of the material with depth. The analysis of indentation of plastically graded substrates by sharp <b>indentors</b> provide the load-penetration response, as well as the strains and stresses inside the substrate, at maximum loading and at complete unloading. The parametric analysis of the solutions enables the direct correlation of the plastic properties and the load-penetration curves obtained from instrumented indentation tests.
