5|$|On May 2, 1947, General Douglas MacArthur {{lifted the}} {{restrictions}} on displaying the Hinomaru in {{the grounds of the}} National Diet Building, on the Imperial Palace, on the Prime Minister's residence and on the Supreme Court building with the ratification of the new Constitution of Japan. Those restrictions were further relaxed in 1948, when people were allowed to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> flag on national holidays. In January 1949, the restrictions were abolished and anyone could <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> Hinomaru at any time without permission. As a result, schools and homes were encouraged to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> Hinomaru until the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The {{display of}} the Hinomaru at homes and {{businesses}} is also debated in Japanese society. Because {{of the association of}} the Hinomaru with uyoku dantai (right wing) activists, reactionary politics, or hooliganism, some homes and businesses do not <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> flag. There is no requirement to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> flag on any national holiday or special events. The town of Kanazawa, Ishikawa, has proposed plans in September 2012 to use government funds to buy flags with the purpose of encouraging citizens to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> flag on national holidays. The Japanese Communist Party is vocally against the flag.|$|E

5|$|Besides common {{avionics}} {{and computer}} systems, the 757 shares its auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, flight deck, and hydraulic parts with the 767. Through operational commonality, 757 pilots can obtain a common type rating to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> 767 {{and share the}} same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft. This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets.|$|E

5|$|No.410 Squadron was {{reactivated}} on 1 December 1946 as an Air Defence squadron flying de Havilland Vampire F.3 aircraft, and was re-formed from a defence role {{into that}} of a fighter role at St Hubert (Montreal), Quebec on 1 December 1948. From May 1949 to August 1951, the Blue Devils aerobatics team formed, to demonstrate the abilities of the new Vampire aircraft at formation flying. The squadron later converted to Canadair Sabres and was deployed to Europe, flying from RCAF Station North Luffenham in the UK, and then at RCAF Station Marville (No.1 (Fighter) Wing) in France. The squadron {{had been the first}} regular force fighter unit to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> Vampire aircraft and was the first to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> Sabre and the first to join No.1 (Fighter) Wing of No.1 Air Division Europe.|$|E

50|$|Following World War II, the 74th was {{activated}} {{at various}} times and locations throughout the world. From 1946-1949 <b>the</b> 74th <b>flew</b> <b>the</b> P-47 at Northwest Field, Guam. During the years of 1951-1954, <b>the</b> 74th <b>flew</b> <b>the</b> F-86 and F-94 at Presque Isle AFB, Maine.

50|$|The U.S. Marine Corps also <b>flew</b> <b>the</b> Skyray. When the Department of Defense {{adopted a}} uniform {{aircraft}} designation system patterned on the U.S. Air Force aircraft designation system in September 1962, the F4D was redesignated as the F-6A Skyray. In addition to multiple Navy and Marine Corps squadrons, Naval Air Reserve and Marine Air Reserve squadrons VF-881, VF-882 and VMF-215 also <b>flew</b> <b>the</b> Skyray. The last operational squadron was VMF(AW)-115, which <b>flew</b> <b>the</b> Skyray until February 1964.|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, Braathens SAFE applied for a {{concession}} to fly to it along the West Coast, as well as the direct route from Oslo. SAS applied to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> Oslo-service. The ministry wanted Braathens SAFE to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> route with a concession granted to SAS, but Braathens SAFE rejected this. Instead, they were granted both the routes on temporary basis. The new airport received three daily flights to Oslo, of which two went via Ålesund, and four services on the West Coast route. At the same time, there was a discussion about who was to operate the new STOL-airports on the West Coast. Braathens SAFE stated that they wanted a local airline to do the flying, and chose not to apply. The concession was granted to Widerøe, and Braathens SAFE subsequently bought part of the airline.|$|E
5|$|Rules {{defined by}} the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act govern the use and display of the {{national}} flag. These have been relaxed to allow citizens to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> flag from vehicles during national holidays and from homes {{at any time of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|The St George's Cross {{has been}} the {{national}} flag of England since the 13th century. Originally the flag {{was used by the}} maritime Republic of Genoa.

5|$|A {{medical report}} {{documented}} that wearing an underwire bra in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, {{can lead to}} severe furuncular myiasis of the breast caused by the Tumbu <b>fly.</b> <b>The</b> eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially {{along the length of}} the metal wires of an underwire bra, and can only be killed by applying heat through ironing.

5|$|According to the CBS document, the {{original}} Bhutanese flag was a bicolour square flag divided diagonally {{from the lower}} hoist to the upper <b>fly.</b> <b>The</b> field of yellow extended from the hoist to the upper fly, and the red field extended from the fly end to the lower hoist.

5|$|After {{a year of}} {{developmental}} testing of the B-29, Tibbets was assigned in March 1944 as director of operations of the 17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Very Heavy), a B-29 training unit based at Grand Island Army Air Field, Nebraska, and commanded by Armstrong. Its role was to transition pilots to the B-29. Tibbets taught two Women Airforce Service Pilots, Dora Dougherty and Dorothea (Didi) Moorman, to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> B-29 as demonstration pilots.|$|E
5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|As the P.1127 {{had been}} {{developed}} {{at a time of}} deep UK defense cuts, Hawker had to seek commercial funding, and significant engine development funding came from the U.S. Research assistance was also provided by U.S.; including a series of wind tunnel tests conducted by NASA's Langley Research Center using sub-scale models, which demonstrated acceptable flight characteristics. Hawker test pilot Hugh Merewether went to the U.S. at NASA's request to <b>fly</b> <b>the</b> Bell X-14. In March 1959, the company's board of directors (Hawker Siddeley then) decided to privately fund two P.1127 prototypes.|$|E
