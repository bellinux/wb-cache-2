40|$|This paper {{presents}} how to tune up the set <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the condensing <b>temperature</b> {{for improving}} the coefficient of performance (COP) of air cooled chillers under various operating conditions. The thermodynamic model of an air cooled screw chiller was developed using the simulation program TRNSYS and validated using the operating data and specifications of the chiller. A new configuration of variable speed condenser fans was proposed for the chiller. An algorithm was introduced to make use <b>of</b> a set <b>point</b> <b>of</b> condensing <b>temperature</b> {{to determine the number}} and speed of condenser fans staged at any given cooling capacity. A model was used to investigate how the COP changes with various set <b>points</b> <b>of</b> condensing <b>temperature.</b> It was found that the optimum set point for maximum COP is a function <b>of</b> outdoor <b>temperature</b> and chiller load. Depending on the operating conditions, the COP could increase by 12. 1 - 110. 4 % when the variable speed condenser fans and the optimum set <b>point</b> <b>of</b> condensing <b>temperature</b> were applied to the existing air cooled screw chillers.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an operating strategy <b>of</b> condensing <b>temperature</b> control (CTC), which means regulating the set <b>point</b> <b>of</b> condensing <b>temperature</b> {{based on the}} outdoor temperature, to enhance the efficiency of air-cooled chillers used in air-conditioned buildings. A mathematical model of an air-cooled chiller is developed for simulation and is validated by using the operating data of an existing chiller and of an experimental chiller. Compared to head pressure control (HPC) with a fixed set <b>point</b> <b>of</b> condensing <b>temperature,</b> CTC brings a moderate rise in the condensing temperature above the outdoor temperature, and hence enables the compressors to operate at a lower condensing pressure through staging more condenser fans. While more condenser fan power is consumed, compressor power can drop considerablely, reducing the annual chiller power consumption by 18. 4 %. It is suggested that the condensing temperature can be coupled with the outdoor temperature and the part load ratio of chillers to gauge the achievable part load efficiency.

30|$|So, {{fluoroboric acid}} (HBF 4) is being {{proposed}} in the scope of future work. Numerous advantages were observed in HBF 4 {{when compared to the}} mud acid. It causes greater increase in the permeability, less reduction in the mechanical strength of core plugs and has also significantly lower corrosiveness. HBF 4 is more beneficial than conventional mud acid due to its retardation effect. However, there is no innovative discovery of the limitation of this retardation effect. Although HBF 4 has a slow hydrolysis process to form HF, its retardation effect is a function <b>of</b> <b>temperature.</b> This means that as the temperature increases, the retardation effect of HBF 4 will be reduced until it reaches an optimum <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature.</b> Hence, the persistence of HBF 4 at high temperatures deserves detailed investigation in future to provide a more precise and reliable recommendation of acid choice between HF and HBF 4.|$|R
