40|$|In {{developing}} its thesis, this Article {{will review the}} history and purpose <b>of</b> IAEA <b>safeguards</b> and their relation to the NPT, and then show that special inspections in the DPRK represent a transitional moment for the IAEA safeguards system. This Article will then consider two different {{arguments in favor of}} a continuing right to inspections even against a state exercising its right to withdraw from the NPT to escape its safeguards obligations: the first identifies circumstances under which a state would {{not have the right to}} withdraw from the NPT; and the second asserts that the effects of withdrawal from the NPT do not include the extinction <b>of</b> the <b>safeguards</b> <b>obligations,</b> or at least certain critical safeguards duties established through NPT adherence. The Article demonstrates that it is impossible to identify any meaningful and principled limitation to a NPT party 2 ̆ 7 s right to withdraw. It then argues that, although the IAEA 2 ̆ 7 s right to apply safeguards with respect to the nuclear activities of the withdrawing state terminates with withdrawal, a right to conduct any special inspection requested before withdrawal relating to suspect activities that occurred while the state was still a party to the NPT should survive withdrawal. This argument is framed in terms not only of general principles of treaty law articulated in the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties, which, for the most part, represents a codification of customary international law, but also in terms of the object and purpose of the NPT and safeguards agreements entered into by states to fulfill their NPT <b>safeguards</b> <b>obligations.</b> Finally, this Article recommends that an interpretation to this effect be reflected in the final documents of the conference to be held by the parties to the NPT in 1995 for the review and extension of the Treaty...|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) Member States are {{interested}} in using health impact assessment (HIA) as a means <b>of</b> <b>safeguarding</b> their <b>obligations</b> to protect human health under the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam. However, several have encountered difficulties institutionalizing HIA with the policy-making process. As a consequence, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe has suggested coupling HIA with strategic environmental assessment (SEA). Traditionally, the incorporation of HIA into other forms of impact assessment has been resisted, for fear of losing its focus on health issues to environmental concerns, and compromising its social model of health {{with the introduction of}} biophysical indicators. But can these fears be substantiated? In this paper, we investigate the grounds for such concerns by reviewing the relevant policy documents and departmental guidelines of four non-European countries that have considered the use of integrated assessment. We found that the case for associating HIA with SEA in Europe is strong, and offers potential solutions to problems of screening, theoretical framework, causal pathways and ready entry to the policy process. Coupling HIA with SEA may thus be the next step forward in a longer journey towards institutionalizing HIA as an independent policy-linked device...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary The <b>safeguards</b> system <b>of</b> the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is {{intended}} to provide the international community with credible assurance that a State is fulfilling its <b>safeguards</b> <b>obligations.</b> Effective and cost-efficient IAEA safeguards at the facility level are, and will remain, an important element <b>of</b> IAEA <b>safeguards</b> as those safeguards evolve towards a “State-Level approach. ” The Safeguards by Design (SBD) concept can facilitate the implementation of these effective and cost-efficient facility-level safeguards (Bjornard, et al. 2009 a, 2009 b; IAEA, 1998; Wonder & Hockert, 2011). This report, sponsored by the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Office <b>of</b> Nuclear <b>Safeguards</b> and Security, introduces a methodology intended {{to ensure that the}} diverse approaches to Safeguards by Design can be effectively integrated and consistently used to cost effectively enhance the application <b>of</b> international <b>safeguards...</b>|$|R

In April 1993 the IAEA Board concluded that the DPRK was in non-compliance with its <b>safeguards</b> <b>obligations</b> and reported the matter to the UN Security Council.

40|$|In principle, {{there is}} {{consensus}} among World Trade organisation members (WTO) {{on the need}} to establish Special Safeguard Mechanisms (SSM) for use by developing countries. Building on a survey of literature, empirical studies, and <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> ideas through participation in the international debate on the subject matter, this paper outlines the architecture of a pro-development SSM. The elaboration is based on ten dimensions: country eligibility, criteria for selection of special products, triggers <b>of</b> <b>safeguard</b> action, precondition for application <b>of</b> <b>safeguard</b> action, geographic coverage, permissible remedies, restrictions on the levels of compensation, time scale, other rules, and treatment of developing countries. Compared to the SSG, it allows trigger levels at lower volumes and higher prices. Also, it differentiates demand increase and import surges, maintains linkages of domestic producers to long-run world market dynamics, and allows the computation of the price trigger on consignment by consignment basis...|$|R

50|$|Both {{products}} are an officially SAP Certified Solution since the 25th of November of year 2009. MyWorkPLAN and WorkPLAN Enterprise can receive jobs or task lists from the SAP ERP or other ERP systems, detailing parts and quantities of components to be produced. WorkPLAN then manages the manufacturing process, including the production planning and scheduling, production performance monitoring, and recording {{the time spent}} on each task by each employee or machine in real time, using touchscreens, barcode readers or data-entry forms. As production proceeds, data can be fed back into SAP {{in the form of}} time taken, events completed and parts produced. Detail such as set-up times, processing times, teardown times, quantities completed, reworked or scrapped can be included in the information flow. Real-time recording of this information in WorkPLAN helps keep the SAP system up to date, producing a dynamic <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> data, and <b>safeguards</b> the business information, so when it is presented to managers, it reflects the true and current status of manufacture. Companies using SAP solutions at a corporate level can benefit from this integration, which enables to optimise the performance of specialised areas within the organization, such as engineering departments or manufacturing units of moulds, dies or prototypes.|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{safeguards}} aim {{to confirm}} that nuclear materials and activities are used for peaceful purposes. To ensure that States are honoring their <b>safeguards</b> <b>obligations,</b> quantitative conclusions regarding nuclear material inventories and transfers are needed. Statistical analyses used to support these conclusions require uncertainty quantification (UQ), usually by estimating the relative standard deviation (RSD) in random and systematic errors associated with each measurement method. This paper has two main components. First, it reviews why UQ is needed in nuclear safeguards and examines recent efforts to improve both top-down (empirical) UQ and bottom-up (first-principles) UQ for calibration data. Second, simulation is {{used to evaluate the}} impact of uncertainty in measurement error RSDs on estimated nuclear material loss detection probabilities in sequences of measured material balances...|$|R

In November 2003 IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei reported that Iran had repeatedly and over an extended period failed to meet its <b>safeguards</b> <b>obligations,</b> including by failing to declare its uranium enrichment program. After about two years of EU3-led diplomatic efforts and Iran temporarily suspending its enrichment program, the IAEA Board of Governors, acting under Article XII.C of the IAEA Statute, found in a rare non-consensus decision with 12 abstentions that these failures constituted non-compliance with the IAEA safeguards agreement. This was reported to the UN Security Council in 2006, after which the Security Council passed a resolution demanding that Iran suspend its enrichment.Instead, Iran resumed its enrichment program.|$|R
