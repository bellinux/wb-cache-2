25|$|CRREL {{staff members}} {{participated in the}} {{exploration}} of two transportation options, {{the use of an}} ice-breaking oil tanker, and the use of an over-land pipeline that would cross much of Alaska over regions of permafrost. As for the Beaufort Sea, CRREL researchers conducted studies of the properties and behavior of arctic sea ice, which would present a problem for off-shore drilling operations. CRREL researchers were active participants in both voyages of the <b>icebreaking</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanker</b> SS Manhattan to assess the feasibility of the sea transport option. At the same time, CRREL engineers reviewed and advised the federal inspector of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. During the construction of the pipeline, CRREL researchers studied the engineering implications of foundations and roadways over permafrost and ice.|$|E

After leaving Saint Lucia, U-161 torpedoed Sarniadoc and sank the United States Coast Guard {{lighthouse}} tender Acacia with gunfire.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} ice model testing in Finland began when Wärtsilä Icebreaking Model Basin (WIMB) was opened in a {{converted}} air raid shelter in Helsinki in 1969. The second ice test basin in the world, preceded by and modeled after the 1955-built Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in Leningrad, Soviet Union, {{was a result of}} co-operation between Wärtsilä and Esso International, initially created for developing the hull form of the <b>icebreaking</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tanker</b> SS Manhattan. Later Wärtsilä, already an experienced and widely recognized builder of icebreaking ships, utilized the 50 m test basin for its own projects at a time when Helsinki New Shipyard was continuously building new icebreakers. In the early 1980s, a decision was made to construct a new model test facility above ground.|$|E
