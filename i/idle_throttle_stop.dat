50|$|Both the B1 and B2 {{featured}} Fuel Injection. The B1 model featured an EFI (electronic) {{system that}} was modelled on the 1980 z1000H and (also used in the 1980 z1000G model). This system was a hybrid car design using an air flap that had many reliability issues causing most owners to end up removing it {{and replace it with}} the 34mm Keihin CV carburettors used on all the later z1000 and z1100 models. The key problem with the EFI on the B1 was the use of an air-flap design rather than a MAP sensor used in modern systems and the early Throttle Position sensor (TPS) design registered only open or closed (<b>idle)</b> <b>throttle</b> positions. Later models (B2 and ZX1100A)featured DFI (digital) which used a variable TPS that accurately represented the throttle position and hence a better Electronic Control Unit (ECU) algorithm called Alpha-N.|$|R

50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly valve in the carburettor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in <b>idle</b> <b>throttle</b> position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to standstill.|$|R

The engine was a , air-cooled, two-stroke with 3 speed manual clutch transmission. Starting was primary kick with the starter {{on the right side of}} the bike. The bike used conventional controls just like larger models. The shift pattern was neutral at the bottom and 3 up. Lubrication was premix at 25:1. The exhaust had a spark arrestor.

50|$|Only a few delay box {{manufacturers}} {{were willing}} to pay NHRA delay box approval fees and submit designs for the NHRA's approval without getting a non-disclosure agreement. Nor did many delay box manufacturers wish to be forced to comply with NHRA design change demands. These manufactures promptly went out of business or transitioned into non-racing related markets. As a result, very few companies manufacture delay boxes for drag racing today and each design is close in functionality to the next. The reduced competition allows these few companies to enjoy the entire market to themselves. Innovation has virtually ceased in the market. The approved manufacturers of delay boxes also enjoy a bonus of reduced competition in the market for their other on-board race timers such as: <b>throttle</b> <b>stop</b> timers, data loggers (data recorders), shifter timers, RPM switches, electronic nitrous oxide injection controllers and other devices. Delay box manufacturers that do not receive NHRA approval are shut out of the entire drag race electronics market.|$|R

25|$|Supercharging {{was used}} to force the charge into the cylinder, rather than {{crankcase}} compression, as on most two-stroke engines.

Stratified charge was used: the fuel was injected into a bulb-like extension of the combustion chamber where the twin spark plugs ignited the rich mixture. Operable air-fuel ratios of from 15 to 23:1 were available to govern the power produced between maximum and 60%. The rich mixture maintained near the spark plugs reduced detonation, allowing higher compression ratios or supercharger boost. Supercharger throttling was used as well to achieve <b>idling.</b> The supercharger <b>throttles</b> were novel vortex types, varying the effective angle of attack of the impeller blades from 60 to 30 degrees. This reduced the power required to drive the supercharger when throttled, and hence fuel consumption at cruising power.|$|R

50|$|Bandwidth {{throttling}} is {{a tactic}} that allows information and telecommunication companies to regulate network traffic and control network congestion.

Comcast, one of the major ISPs, conducted bandwidth throttling on 49% of its customers who were using bandwidth for P2P file sharing.

In particular, this form of net bias frequently targets heavy mobile users who consume large amounts of content (packets), like unlimited data plans. Mobile companies such as AT&T and Verizon have their own throttling policy because they are sometimes required to limit users’ traffic to maintain the quality of the entire network. Recently, however, throttling has become a controversial issue because some companies infringe upon this policy. For example, AT&T had to pay US$850 to one customer to compensate for slowing down data speeds because they violated the terms of unlimited smartphone data contracts.

5000|$|The {{most basic}} {{carbureted}} engines, such as single cylinder Briggs & Stratton lawn-mower engines, feature a single small throttle plate over a basic carburetor {{with a single}} venturi.
