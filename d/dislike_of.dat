5|$|Although Monroe {{had become}} one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her {{contract}} had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal <b>dislike</b> <b>of</b> her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version of The Girl in Pink Tights, which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{following}} year, Alexandra's father had ascended the throne of Denmark, her brother George had become King of the Hellenes, her sister Dagmar was engaged to the Tsesarevich of Russia, and Alexandra had given birth to her first child. Her father's accession gave rise to further conflict over the fate of Schleswig-Holstein. The German Confederation successfully invaded Denmark, reducing the area of Denmark by two-fifths. To the great irritation of Queen Victoria and the Crown Princess of Prussia, Alexandra and Albert Edward supported the Danish side in the war. The Prussian conquest of former Danish lands heightened Alexandra's profound <b>dislike</b> <b>of</b> the Germans, a feeling which stayed with her {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
5|$|Creative {{differences}} {{arising from}} his work with Douglas and the film studios, a <b>dislike</b> <b>of</b> Hollywood, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick {{to move to the}} United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers, Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964).|$|E

5|$|During {{his early}} years as a practising barrister, Garrow was {{particularly}} noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of cross-examination. When James Wingrove was charged with theft and violence {{in the course of}} a highway robbery in 1784, Garrow's cross-examination of William Grove (who acted as a witness and the person charging Wingrove) got him to admit that he was perjuring himself in an attempt to get a reward, and that Wingrove had not robbed the two injured parties. Garrow showed a <b>dislike</b> <b>of</b> most thief-takers, of which Grove was one, although he did not treat the Bow Street Runners and other professionals with contempt. His <b>dislike</b> <b>of</b> such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft; they were charged with assaulting John Troughton, putting him in fear of his life, and stealing his hat. The issue was whether the assault put him in fear of his life, or whether he was exaggerating to claim a reward, which could not be claimed for simple theft. Garrow established that Troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat, despite his attempts to claim that the defendants knocked it off him, and after four witnesses gave character evidence the defendants were found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|During the {{remainder}} of World War II, Bär was credited with 130 other aerial victories, including 16 while flying {{one of the first}} jet fighters, the Me 262, an achievement which would normally have earned him the coveted Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. Hermann Göring's personal <b>dislike</b> <b>of</b> Bär, coupled with Bär's insubordinate character and lack of military discipline, deprived him of this award. After World War II, Bär continued his career as an aviator. He was killed in a flying accident on 28 April 1957 near Braunschweig.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in his}} tenure, Kosygin {{challenged}} Brezhnev's {{right as}} general secretary to represent the country abroad, a function Kosygin believed should {{fall into the hands}} of the head of government, as was common in non-communist countries. This was actually implemented for a short period, which led Henry A. Kissinger to believe that Kosygin was the leader of the Soviet Union. Kosygin, who had been the chief negotiator with the First World during the 1960s, was hardly to be seen outside the Second World after Brezhnev consolidated his position within the Politburo, but also due to Andrei Gromyko's <b>dislike</b> <b>of</b> Kosygin meddling into his own ministerial affairs.|$|E

He worked as a preschool teacher {{for two years before}} the success of The Wiggles led him to focus on children's music full-time. Despite Field's strong <b>dislike</b> <b>of</b> touring, The Wiggles {{became one of the most}} successful and active groups in Australia. Field, who wore blue while performing with the group, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, CDs, and DVDs. His issues with chronic pain and depression, which almost forced him out of the group at the height of their success, are well-documented.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, Lorne was {{appointed}} Governor General of Canada. Louise became viceregal consort, but her stay was unhappy {{as a result}} of homesickness and <b>dislike</b> <b>of</b> Ottawa. Following Victoria's death in 1901, Louise entered the social circle established by her brother, the new king, Edward VII. Louise's marriage survived thanks to long periods of separation; the couple reconciled in 1911 and she was devastated by her husband's death in 1914. After the end of the First World War in 1918, at the age of 70, she began to retire from public life, undertaking few public duties outside Kensington Palace, where she died at age 91.|$|E

In 1764, she ordered the release of those Jews who had been jailed for a blood libel {{in the village of}} Orkuta. Notwithstanding her strong <b>dislike</b> <b>of</b> Jews, Maria Theresa supported Jewish commercial and industrial activity in Austria.|$|E

5|$|Outwardly at least, by 743 the Umayyad {{position}} in Khurasan appeared stronger than ever. The reality beneath the splendid façade however was different. Tension and mutual mistrust {{existed between the}} Khurasani Arab levies (muqatila) and the 20,000 Syrian troops introduced into the province as a security measure after the disastrous Battle of the Defile in 731, while tribal antagonism continued to create trouble: apart from continued Yemeni resentment at Nasr, there was strong <b>dislike</b> <b>of</b> the Umayyads' Syrian regime, fanned by their unjust tax policies. Although Nasr tried to remedy the situation, it was too late.|$|E

He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and perspective.|$|E
