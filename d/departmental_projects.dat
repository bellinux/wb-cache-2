40|$|This study {{investigated}} challenges encountered by {{schools in the}} implementation of inclusive education in the Eastern Cape. It was a Survey Study carried out in Ngcobo District. School principals of randomly-sampled mainstream schools and special schools participated in this research project. The key research question that the study sought to answer was: What are the challenges encountered by schools {{in the implementation of}} Inclusive Education in the Ngcobo District of the Eastern Cape Province? The following were the sub-research questions: (a). How does the lack of specialized or in-service, trained human resource personnel challenge or hinder the implementation of Inclusive Education? (b). How is the implementation of Inclusive Education affected by available infra-structure? (c). How do the attitudes of stake holders such as learners, educators (ILST) and parents (SGB) affect the implementation of inclusive education? The findings of the study revealed that: There is a gross shortage of educators qualified in inclusive education or related streams, and in some schools none at all. Institution Level Support Teams (ILSTs) in some schools have not been established and some of those that are established are not functional. Needed specialists such as psychologists and occupational therapists are not available in special schools. Workshops or in-service training for educators generally are held for to ILSTs only instead of all educators and SMTs. School buildings and toilets have not been adapted for when inclusion is to be implemented and there are no specific, funded <b>departmental</b> <b>projects</b> to rectify this. Assistive devices for learners experiencing barriers to teaching, learning and development are rarely found. There are no clear departmental budgets to ensure the policy is implemented in ordinary schools. Negative attitudes of some parents, teachers and learners toward inclusion still exist. The following recommendations were made for consideration in order to facilitate the smooth implementation of Inclusive Education in the schools. There should be adequate provision of human resource training and development Educators have to further their studies in Inclusive Education. There should be provision of a specific budget for buildings. Maintenance funds ought to be used to renovate school buildings so as to be Inclusive Education friendly.

40|$|The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) {{was enacted}} on February 17, 2009, to {{jumpstart}} {{the economy by}} creating or saving millions of jobs, spurring technological advances in health and science, and investing in the Nation's energy future. The Department of Energy received over $ 32. 7 billion in Recovery Act funding for various science, energy, and environmental programs and initiatives. As of November 2009, the Department had obligated $ 18. 3 billion of the Recovery Act funding, but only $ 1. 4 billion had been spent. The Department's Offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Fossil Energy, Environmental Management, Science, and Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability received the majority of funding allocated to the Department, about $ 32. 3 billion. Obligating these funds {{by the end of}} Fiscal Year 2010, as required by the Recovery Act, and overseeing their effective use in succeeding years, represents a massive workload increase for the Department's programs. The effort to date has strained existing resources. As has been widely acknowledged, any effort to disburse massive additional funding and to expeditiously initiate and complete projects increases the risk of fraud, waste and abuse. It is, therefore, important for the Department's program offices to assess and mitigate these risks to the maximum extent practicable. In this light, we initiated this review as an initial step in the Office of Inspector General's charge to determine whether the Department's major program offices had developed an effective approach for identifying and mitigating risks related to achieving the goals and objectives of the Recovery Act. The Department's program offices included in our review identified risks and planned mitigation strategies that, if successfully implemented and executed, should help achieve the goals and objectives of the Recovery Act. While each office identified risks unique to its respective areas of responsibility, {{there were a number of}} risks shared in common. These included the mechanical and substantive requirements related to the award and distribution of funds; program and project performance monitoring; and, program and project execution activities. In particular, the offices self-identified common risks such as: (1) The inability to award and distribute funds in a timely manner to achieve the goals of the Recovery Act; (2) The sufficiency of monitoring procedures and resources to, among other things, prevent and detect fraud, waste and abuse throughout the performance period of financial assistance awards and contracts; and (3) The inherent cost, schedule and performance risks associated with first-of-a-kind, innovative research and demonstration projects. Our review confirmed that the Department had begun to implement a number of strategies designed to mitigate these and other program-specific risks. Our testing, however, identified challenges to the effective implementation of these mitigation strategies that need to be addressed if the Department is to meet the goals and objectives established by the Recovery Act. At the time of our review: (1) Program staffing resources, critical to the success of all other mitigation strategies, remained inadequate both in numbers and qualifications (certifications and training) for positions in procurement and acquisition, project management, and monitoring and oversight functions; (2) Performance measures for achieving Recovery Act goals such as distributing funds in an expeditious manner had not always been established and included in performance plans, and, in financial assistance and contract documents; and (3) Programs had not consistently demonstrated that previously reported deficiencies, identified through audits, inspections, investigations and other oversight activities, had been considered in designing mitigation strategies for the Recovery Act related risks. As we noted in our Special Report on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act at the Department of Energy (OAS-RA- 09 - 01, March 2009) these sorts of deficiencies, which were described in the March 2009 report, had adversely impacted the success of earlier <b>Departmental</b> <b>projects.</b> We concluded that consideration of these previously encountered internal control weaknesses was essential if the Department was to avoid the same or similar problems in executing the Recovery Act programs/projects. During the course of our audit we identified other internal control weakness indicators. When brought to their attention by the Office of Inspector General audit staff, program officials acted promptly to address these problems by modifying or improving their risk mitigation strategies. For instance, we found that the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, responsible for $ 16. 8 billion in Recovery Act program activities, took steps to strengthen its merit review process to avoid potential conflict of interest concerns...|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{arose from}} a wider University of Limerick, Clinical Therapies <b>Departmental</b> <b>project,</b> seeking to plot Irish {{occupational}} therapy history. Dr. Eamonn O’Sullivan’s, “ A Textbook of Occupational Therapy with Chief Reference to Psychological Medicine” {{emerged as a}} primary document outlining occupational therapy in Ireland {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th Century. Objective: The study aims to identify the philosophical assumptions of occupational therapy articulated within Dr. O’Sullivan Textbook. In an effort to cement Dr. O’ Sullivan’s position within Irish occupational therapy heritage the Textbook is reviewed as a document of historical merit. Methods: Historical documentary analysis of the Textbook, viewed as a primary source of data ensued. A pertinent dataset of eleven chapters was identified after external criticism and Textbook familiarisation. Inductive thematic analysis, at semantic level then followed. Results: Analysis revealed four themes: process and outcome of occupational therapy, consequences of occupational engagement, classification of occupation form and the person. Conclusion: The identified themes enunciated the contradictory philosophical assumptions of pragmatism and structuralism, orthodox philosophies guiding occupational therapy’s evolution. Analysis promotes the Textbook’s relevance in the profession’s contemporary education and practice. Modern Irish occupational therapy University programmes have to date limited the exploration of activity analysis and skilled occupation use, skills deemed paramount within the Textbook. Furthermore, analysis highlights the Textbook’s richness, acknowledging the vast future areas of study. Specifically in relation to fellow early occupational therapy textbooks and within the contextual (political, social, cultural, religion) factors influential in Irish society during this period...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The 8 -semester Engineering Clinic {{sequence}} at Rowan University {{provides the}} venue for multidisciplinary student teams {{to engage in}} semester-long design and development projects. The majority of these projects are funded by local industry, faculty research grants or <b>departmental</b> budgets. Clearly, <b>projects</b> such as these are central to developing the design, problem solving and project management skills that are lacking in the traditional engineering coursework. Often miss-ing, however, in the industry and faculty sponsored design projects, is the spirit of invention, inno-vation and entrepreneurship. One way to promote the entrepreneurial spirit is {{to provide students with}} the opportunity to propose their own original enterprises. Accordingly, funding from the Na-tional Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA) has created a Venture Capital Fund, specifically ear-marked for the development of original inventions by multidisciplinary student teams within the Junior and Senior Engineering Clinics. Funding of up to $ 2500 per student team per semester is competitively awarded based on student-generated proposals to the Venture Capital Fund.

The case study organisation is a small- edium sized Taiwanese-owned construction company (staff size of approximately 50) with an annual turnover of approximately TWD 50 (AUD$ 1. 85) billion. Approximately {{one half of the}} company comprised project-related staff (e. g. construction project management, project documentation, estimation, procurement, and design), while the other comprised administrative and business-related staff (e. g. office administration and management, business development, and finance and accounting). The researcher undertook a series of surveys and one-on-one interviews whilst ‘embedded’ for several months with the organisation. As part of a larger research project, this case study was one of four case studies conducted in major construction organisations in Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia. The study revealed the recognition, importance and commitment of organisational culture to KM, and the effects the knowledge management initiatives have on the organisation’s ability to manage knowledge across its projects and deliver the projects at various ‘levels’ of the organisation (individual, <b>project,</b> <b>departmental,</b> and corporate). It concludes that a technologically and functionally sound KM infrastructure does not necessarily assure an organisation with a capability to manage knowledge. Organisations need to ensure that the KM repository is made up of quality and relevant contents (not just quantity), and that corporate culture (especially the willingness of individuals to share what they know) is a critical determining factor to the organisation’s ability to share, apply and create knowledge (i. e. low sharing capability leads to low application and creation capabilities). <br /...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: The {{experience}} of clinicians at two public hospitals in Sydney, Australia, {{with the introduction}} and use of an oncology information system (OIS) was examined to extract lessons to guide the introduction of clinical information systems in public hospitals. Methods and materials: Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 12 of 15 radiation oncologists employed at the two hospitals. The personnel involved in the decision making process for the introduction of the system were contacted and their decision making process revisited. The transcribed data were analyzed using NVIVO software. Themes emerged included implementation strategies and practices, the radiation oncologists 2 ̆ 7 current use and satisfaction with the OIS, project management and the impact of the OIS on clinical practice. Results: The hospitals had contrasting experiences in their introduction and use of the OIS. Hospital A used the OIS in all aspects of clinical documentation. Its implementation was associated with strong advocacy by the Head of Department, input by a designated project manager, and use and development of the system by all staff, with timely training and support. With no vision of developing a paperless information system, Hospital B used the OIS only for booking and patient tracking. A departmental policy that data entry for the OIS was centrally undertaken by administrative staff distanced clinicians from the system. All the clinicians considered that the OIS should continuously evolve to meet changing clinical needs and departmental quality improvement initiatives. Conclusions: This case study indicates that critical factors for the successful introduction of clinical information systems into hospital environment were an initial clear vision to be paperless, strong clinical leadership and management at the <b>departmental</b> level, committed <b>project</b> management, and involvement of all staff, with appropriate training.

40|$|The role {{of service}} quality in higher {{education}} has only recently begun to occupy academic research. In the past, the 'customer-led' axiom of quality improvement was deemed inappropriate for university service exchange. Nonetheless, {{in light of recent}} changes to the UK education system, universities are finding it necessary to reassess this stance. An {{increase in the number of}} institutions has led to competition between universities to attract potential students. Whilst, research now suggests that improving service performance can lead to substantial gains including higher market share and profitability, universities are being forced to recognise the value of tracking service quality - and improving it. This is particularly true of postgraduate education where student contribution to tuition fees, and <b>departmental</b> research <b>projects,</b> make them a valuable segment to attract. Postgraduates have received scant attention in the educational literature, in comparison to their undergraduate counterparts. This study aimed to redress this balance using a sample of taught postgraduates at the University of Plymouth. This in turn led to the development of the research problem: 'An examination of tlie service quality delivered to taught postgraduate students in a UK based university: identifying areas for improvement' A mixed method approach was used to address the research problem. Convergent interviews with 18 postgraduate students were used to identify the 'service attributes' most important in the service exchange. Each service attribute was then tested using an online survey approach. The questionnaire utilised the 'Importance-Performance' framework for measuring service quality. In total 170 responses were collected from students studying in the 'social science & business' faculty of the university. Factor analysis was then conducted to reduce the number of 'service attributes', into a smaller number of 'service factors'. Each of the emerging 'service factors' were then tested for service quality, using 'Performance minus Importance' analysis. Logistic regression and the 'IP Matrix' were then used to prioritise critical areas for improvement. Factor analysis identified four 'service factors' that postgraduate students determine their service quality evaluation by. These include 'Academic', 'Leisure', 'Industry Links', and 'CostA^alue for Money'. Tests for service quality, foimd that the University of Plymouth appears to be failing to provide an adequate level of service in three of the four factors. Only 'leisure' aspects of the service are currently being offered at a level that exceeds the requirement of postgraduate students. Postgraduates show they are more concerned with the 'academic' and 'industry link' services provided by the university, in comparison to 'cost/value for money' and 'leisure'. The 'IP Matrix' and logistic regression confirm this inference, suggesting that the University of Plymouth should prioritise 'Academic' aspects of the service, if it wishes to improve ciurent service quality. The research conducted in this dissertation presents a small, but valuable contribution, to existing studies especially from a methodological perspective where the research utilised, and successfully implemented, the 'Importance-Performance' framework to measure service quality; in a previously unexplored setting. Moreover, this research provides the University of Plymouth with some useful and practical data, for use in improving the service it currently offers. FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCE & BUSINES...|$|R

40|$|Wearable Metal Origami” is a {{research}} leading to a collection of wearable objects, made from metallised folding textile. The research engages with current concerns in industrialised society, where new materials and innovative products are in demand. The material I have developed is influenced by historical and contemporary jewellery and clothing {{as well as by}} deployable structures; folding patterns are based on folding patterns in nature and on the knowledge of origami mathematicians; production processes include traditional printing and jewellery techniques. Bridging all these disciplines, the outcome is a novel material {{that could be used in}} various design fields but is particularly relevant to jewellery for its striking visual character, its flexible movement which easily adjusts to the human body, and the possibility to use precious metals. I based my research in the department of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery because this department had helped me develop the initial material during my MA course, so I knew it could provide me with the necessary equipment and support in designing wearable pieces. My project was finally conducted within a <b>departmental</b> team research <b>project</b> (Deployable Adaptive Structures) in which my colleagues investigated the broader application of metallised or otherwise tessellated folded textile in such fields as interior architecture, sunscreens and water sculptures, and ways of actuating the material either virtually or by mechanical means. ““Wearable Metal Origami”?” is based on MA project work, where I had used one folding pattern and found one production method. I strongly believed that this material would be ideal for the creation of jewellery and larger wearable objects if I could expand the range of flexibly moving patterns, improve the production process of the material and develop appropriate design processes. My research set out to fulfil these requirements and prove the value of the material in the context of metalwork and jewellery and the applied arts. To expand the range of folding patterns I collected and analysed existing tessellating origami patterns. With this knowledge I created my own variations. All patterns were evaluated on their suitability for “Wearable Metal Origami” and a basic classification was made, based on their folding properties. A small selection of patterns was then tested to get an understanding of the influence of plate thickness, hinge width and hinge flexibility by making card-textile and plywood-textile models. I developed and tested new processes for the production of the metallised folding textile. These included preparatory processes (before electroforming), electroforming and various ways of treating the material after electroforming. Each process was evaluated on its practicality. To develop appropriate design processes for wearable objects of Metallised Folding Textile I ran four case studies, each with its own design brief. I set the briefs in such a way that they addressed different parts of the body and different qualities of the material, such as changing shape and flexibility. For each application an origami pattern was chosen and adjusted through a process of trial and error until it had the correct proportions and movement...|$|R
40|$|The year 1988 {{marked the}} 100 th {{anniversary of the}} {{founding}} of the Department of Physics at the University of Nebraska. While the year passed without fanfare in the department, DuaneJaecks, {{one of the members of}} the faculty, suggested to the author that it would be a good time to write a history of what is now the Department of Physics and Astronomy. He not only provided the initial impetus for the project, but has also given it his continual help and encouragement. While the initial plan was to write only a brief, informal <b>departmental</b> history, the <b>project,</b> like Topsy, grew. An attempt has been made to not only tell the story of the founding, subsequent growth, and development of the department, but also to relate its history to state, national, and world events since they have often had a profound influence on the department. When the Nebraska legislature established the University of Nebraska on June 2, 1869, the stated object was 2 ̆ 2 to afford to the inhabitants of the State, the means of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the various branches of literature, Science, and the arts. 2 ̆ 2 Evidently, the lawmakers had the teaching function of a university clearly in mind, but at that time the other usual function of a university, that of producing new knowledge through research, was evidently not yet considered to be an activity suitable to be supported by public funds. Nebraska, which had joined the Union only two years before, was still largely a frontier state. The population was small and money was scarce. Many lived in sod huts and relatively few had any interest in supporting education, let alone anything as remotely related to their lives as scholarly research. So, it is not surprising that no research was done in physics or astronomy during the university 2 ̆ 7 s first three decades. What is surprising is that research was begun as early as it was. Even well into the present century, research at the University of Nebraska was still thought of as an expensive frill to be pursued only during vacations, holidays, and other spare time using borrowed or makeshift apparatus. In spite of this attitude, the first chairman of the department, DeWitt Bristol Brace, was able to carry out important investigations at the forefront of physics and brought the new department into a position of international prominence at the tum of the century. The question of the place of original research and its relationship to teaching is one of the interesting themes that recurs throughout the history of the department. After Brace 2 ̆ 7 s untimely death, the department went through a long period of decline, as measured on the scale of national and international prominence, largely as a result of a lack of funds and overwork of the professorial staff. While the university as a whole has often suffered from a shortage of funds to do the projects its professors wished to do, science departments, with their reliance on apparatus and supplies for laboratory work, were particularly restricted by lack of money. The dependence of the activity of the department, especially its research activity, on the economic condition of the university, the state, and the nation is another prominent theme of this study. After World War II the support of scientific research in this country was, to a large extent, taken over by the United States government. Federal grants and contracts for research combined with increased state support for faculty and buildings and new sources of private support allowed for a rapid increase in the breadth and depth of the department and its facilities during the 1960 s. As a result, by the end of that decade it had onc again achieved widespread recognition for its research. Astronomy, as an academic subject, began at the University of Nebraska under the protective wings of the, Physics Department, but soon combined with meteorology to become a separate department. The unsuccessful struggle of its long-time chairman, Goodwin Swezey, to build an adequate astronomical observatory on the campus is an especially poignant story. Taken over by the Mathematics Department in the 1930 s, astronomy eventually declined in popularity and was dropped from the curriculum by 1962. A few years later, it underwent a rebirth in the Physics Department where it has grown in staff and facilities far beyond the dreams of Professor Swezey. Just as physics has been the mother of many new branches of science, the Physics Department has also been the mother of two other university departments in addition to astronomy. The Electrical Engineering Department at Nebraska began with the electricity courses in the Physics Department during the last two decades of the 19 th century. And in the 1960 s it was a member of the Physics Department who created the Institute of Computational Science, of which the present-day Department of Computer Science was a part. The events leading up to the creation of these departments are recounted in this history. As far as the professorial staff was concerned, the most recent decade and a half has been a time of unusual stability in the department and until very recently, no new professors were added and very few retired or left. With a relatively favorable economic situation, this has allowed growth and diversification in the research program and improvements in teaching which have led to a strong and versatile department...|$|R
