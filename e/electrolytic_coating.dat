Available optical techniques are reviewed and a specific case developed {{for the use of}} Photoelastic stress analysis (PSA). As a result of this research two novel developments in PSA are presented, including an industrially robust coating material technology and methods for high-speed acquisition of transient stress fields. These developments extend the potential applications of PSA and simplify the procedures involved. A novel birefringent <b>electrolytic</b> <b>coating</b> is presented and calibrated to demonstrate its potential as a practical photoelastic coating. The 20 m thickness coating is characterised and shown to behave linearly with strain. The coating also shows potential for application in plastic and non-linear photoelastic measurements. Several types of anodising and sealing treatments are compared, focusing on their relative sensitivity. The strain-optical coefficient (K) is derived for four thicknesses of decorative sulphuric acid anodising allowing qualitative and quantitative data to be extracted. Two time-resolved photoelastic techniques capable of measuring high(kHz) and low(Hz) frequency transient stress fields are described and demonstrated. Both techniques are based on a concept of a `Multiple View Polariscope', where the phase steps are captured simultaneously from multiple views. The configurations include a planar multi-camera method and a single camera with a modified `Quadrant' lens. As part of a collaborative study, compressor blade geometries were generated based on an existing Rolls-Royce component. The potential of the high-speed Multiple View Polariscope is demonstrated by the application to the compressor blades, which are subjected to a dynamic impact load to simulate domestic object damage. The resulting quantitative time-resolved stress fields allowed the performance of each blade to be compared against the original component. This investigation has shown the potential for general robust optical tools for industrial quantitative applications of residual, static and dynamic stress measurement. ...|$|E

The as-coating was Mg OH 2 which was formed by the electrolysis, Mg 2 + + 2 OH− → Mg OH 2, and finally transformed into MgO at 350 °C. The surface morphology and phase structure were analyzed using scanning electron microscope and grazing angle X-ray diffraction. Polarization curves and immersion tests were used to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the coated specimens. More OH− ions were produced, and the migration of Mg 2 + was enhanced at a more negative applied potential, leading to a higher nucleation rate of Mg OH 2 on the specimen and resulting in the 001 preferred orientation. The weight gain resulted from coatings increased with increasing deposition time for the initial 40 min, and the increasing rate slowed down after 1 h due to the precipitation of Mg OH 2 in the solution. A coating deposited at − 1. 8 V Ag/AgCl for 40 min and annealed at 400 °C for 1 h was suggested to provide a more uniform and dense MgO protective coating, which results in a reduction of corrosion current density from 99. 5 down to 0. 2 A/cm 2 and the enlarged passivation region between − 1. 52 and − 1. 25 V Ag/AgCl in 3. 5 wt % NaCl aqueous solution, with respect to the uncoated specimen.

The residual stress value and springback phenomenal were investigated by commercial program code DEFORM 2 D which was able to analyze the effect stress and force in bending area. <b>Electrolytic</b> zinc <b>coated</b> carbon steel grade JIS; SECC, JIS; 440 and JIS; 590 which having the thickness of 1 mm were employed as the workpiece material for all experiments. The result of three materials in conventional U bending die shows larger spring back than the corner setting technique and bottoming process. Moreover, the corner setting technique reduces spring back value in bending process but requires high bending force. Corner setting technique and bottoming process at 15 % and 20 % shows that the spring go of all parts. The FEM simulation results explained the effect of residual stress to springback phenomenal. Comparisons between experimental and finite element method results were also performed...|$|R
