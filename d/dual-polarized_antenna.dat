50|$|The {{cross-polarization}} {{interference canceller}} (known as XPIC) is a signal processing technique implemented on the demodulated received signals at the baseband level. It is typically necessary in Polarization Division Multiplexing systems: the data sources to be transmitted are coded and mapped into QAM modulating symbols at the system's symbol rate and upconverted to a carrier frequency, generating two radio streams radiated {{by a single}} <b>dual-polarized</b> <b>antenna</b> (see feed pattern of Parabolic antenna).
