5|$|Seoul unit {{director}} Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell {{were the}} visual effects supervisors {{of the first}} season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production {{made the decision to}} do most of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for a great number of shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving {{in and out of the}} frame <b>in</b> <b>timely</b> <b>fashion</b> requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was done is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.|$|E

The Polish methods were revealed to French and British intelligence representatives in a meeting at Pyry, south of Warsaw, on 25 July 1939. France was represented by Gustave Bertrand and Air Force cryptologist Captain Henri Braquenié; Britain, by Government Code and Cypher School chief Alastair Denniston, veteran cryptologist Alfred Dillwyn Knox, and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the section that had developed and controlled the Royal Navy's intercept and direction-finding stations. The Polish hosts included Cipher Bureau chief Gwido Langer, the Bureau's German-Section chief Maksymilian Ciężki, the Bureau's General-Staff-Intelligence supervisor Stefan Mayer, and the three cryptologists Rejewski, Różycki and Zygalski.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{two main}} {{challenges}} {{typically associated with}} mining data streams are concept drift and data contamination. To address these challenges, we seek learning techniques and models that are robust to noise and can adapt to changes <b>in</b> <b>timely</b> <b>fashion.</b> In this paper, we approach the stream-mining problem using a statistical estimation framework, and propose a discriminative model for fast mining of noisy data streams. We build an ensemble of classifiers to achieve adaptation by weighting classifiers {{in a way that}} maximizes the likelihood of the data. We further employ robust statistical techniques to alleviate the problem of noise sensitivity. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-life data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of this new discriminative model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This poster {{discusses}} the pathophysiology of Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) {{and the importance}} of timely intervention to minimize irreversible tissue damage. Ischemic stroke is characterized by the obstruction within a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain. The general population is not well informed as to the warning signs or symptoms of stroke, leading to substantial delays in emergency medical services. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of acute ischemic stroke <b>in</b> <b>timely</b> <b>fashion</b> is very important because the treatment window is very narrow. This author worked as a nurse at Interventional Radiology (IR); observing patients with AIS undergoing clot retrieval procedure or receiving tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Consequently, the student began to develop interest in studying acute ischemic stroke and its relations with pathophysiology. Overall, advanced practice nurses should equip themselves with the current protocols and timely interventions to save patients from devastating AIS disability and financial burden...|$|E
