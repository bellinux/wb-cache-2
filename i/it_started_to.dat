The triumvirate expired {{on the last day}} of 33 BC and was not renewed in law and in 31 BC, war began again. At the Battle of Actium, Octavian decisively defeated Antony and Cleopatra in a naval battle near Greece, using fire to destroy the enemy fleet.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{topography}} {{of the area}} in the vicinity of Scotch Run, the area near the stream was not settled until some time after the first settlement in the surrounding areas. Alexander McCauley settled on the stream in Beaver Township 1774. Some time before 1820, a carding mill was built by George Fleming on the stream southeast of Mainville. In 1820, <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> be used as a school, which was run by Jacob Gensel.|$|E
5|$|On September 9 a {{tropical}} wave moved off the African coast and moved west into the Atlantic. <b>It</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> become more organized on September 13 and the National Hurricane Center began {{to watch it}} closely for further development. Tropical Depression Seventeen formed from the wave on September 17 when it was 350miles (560km) east of Barbados. The depression strengthened further to become Tropical Storm Philippe that evening, and the official forecasts correctly indicated that Philippe would move northwards and not approach the Lesser Antilles despite climatology suggesting {{an impact on the}} islands.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} medieval foundation {{set up by}} Adam de Brome, {{under the}} patronage of Edward II, was called the House or Hall of the Blessed Mary at Oxford. The first design allowed for a Provost and ten Fellows, called 'scholars', and the College remained a small body of graduate Fellows until the 16th century, when <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> admit undergraduates. During the English Civil War, Oriel played host to high-ranking members of the King's Oxford Parliament.|$|E
5|$|While {{over land}} the system moved towards the {{south-southwest}} {{and moved into}} the Bligh Waters, where <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> rapidly intensify as convection erupted around the system. As a result, before the system made landfall on Viti Levu, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone, on the Australian cyclone intensity scale and named it Gene. The system then made landfall shortly after 0600UTC near Lautoka, before <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> move westwards and passed near Nadi before it {{moved out of the}} archipelago. Early on January 29 as the system moved westwards, RSMC Nadi reported that Gene had intensified into a category two tropical cyclone before it briefly weakened into a Category 1 because of the effects of a moderate amount of vertical windshear. However, the system quickly reintensified and by 1200UTC the next day had become a category 3 Severe Tropical Cyclone and equivalent to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 7. It tracked across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development due to strong wind shear. The wave then split into two, with the northern portion dissipating over Cuba on August 15 and the southern portion continuing westward. The wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 16. Deep convection increased over the wave upon entering the Pacific, and early on August 19 <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> become better organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 20 while located about 275miles (445km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E

5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced {{as if they were the}} length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> operate with a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E
5|$|During December 12, Wasa {{passed through}} the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed {{directly}} over Tubuai, before it degenerated into a tropical depression later that day. However, gale-force winds remained associated with the depression, before the system turned towards the east-northeast and entered into warmer waters near the Tuamotu Islands. During December 14, Wasa regenerated into a tropical depression and was renamed Arthur for various reasons. During that day the system gradually intensified before it reached its secondary peak intensity with sustained wind speeds of 95km/h (60mph). During December 15, the system maintained its peak intensity, as it moved through the uninhabited Acteon Group of islands, before during the next day <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> gradually weaken. Arthur degenerated into a shallow depression during December 17, before it was last noted during the next day as it dissipated {{to the north of}} the Pitcairn islands.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 24, Karl {{continued}} its north-northeast track over the open north-central Atlantic {{and continued to}} gradually weaken. <b>It</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> {{come in contact with}} the baroclinic zone and began to lose tropical characteristics, while still a Category1 hurricane. Karl became extratropical shortly afterward over the northern Atlantic at about 47°N, with its winds dropping below hurricane strength shortly thereafter. The extratropical storm made landfall on the Faroe Islands with hurricane-force wind gusts. As an extratropical low, the cyclone moved northeastward and eastward across the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, eventually reaching Norway before it was absorbed into another extratropical low late on September 28.|$|E

5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
5|$|Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! premiered at Liberty Cinema in {{southern}} Mumbai on 5 August 1994; it eventually ran there for over 100 weeks. The film initially saw {{a very limited}} release, also showing at the Regal and Eros theatres, with only 26 prints total. Eventually <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> appear in many more theatres. When initial viewers complained about the film's length, 2 of the 14 song sequences were removed. These were later restored when film goers were found to enjoy all of the songs. Early reviewers of Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! predicted {{that it would be}} a huge flop; hence the industry was stunned when it went on to become the most successful film of all time up to that point.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, United College Sarawak (UCS) was {{established}} in Sibu at Teku Street. It was renamed to Kolej Laila Taib (KLT) in 2010.

University College of Technology Sarawak (UCTS), located just opposite the KLT, commenced its maiden intake of new undergraduate students in September 2013. This university is established to provide human capital {{for the development of}} Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE). In 1967, Pilley Memorial Secondary School {{was established}} in Sibu. In April 1991, the school was upgraded to Methodist Pilley Institute (MPI) and <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> offer accounting, business management, and computer science courses.|$|E

Seventeen cases have been referred to the circuit court and three men freed by April 2016. Another 130 similar cases of torture by Chicago police have been claimed, beyond the scope of Burge and his cohort. The sponsors are trying to have the bill amended to accommodate these victims. In 2015 the City of Chicago announced that it has established a $5.5 million fund for reparations to victims of torture by Burge, and to aid their families. By that time, the city had paid more than $57 million to victims of Burge and his cohort, and another $50 million for defense of the officers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} stage, Aucouturier, Garin and Dortignac escaped {{in the last}} kilometres. Aucouturier signed first at the control post in Ville-d'Avray. From that point, the race was neutralised until the velodrome Parc-des-Princes, where the riders would ride the final kilometre. At the moment that the riders arrived in Paris, <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> rain. The organisers decided {{together}} with the cyclists to exclude the final kilometre from the race, and make the control post in Ville-d'Avray {{the end of the}} race. This made Aucouturier the winner of the stage. Maurice Garin finished second, which made him the overall winner.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill founded Geostar Corporation {{to develop}} a {{satellite}} position determination system {{for which he was}} granted a patent in 1982. The system, primarily intended to track aircraft, was called Radio Determination Satellite Service (RDSS). In April 1983 Geostar applied to the FCC for a license to broadcast from three satellites, which would cover the entire United States. Geostar launched GSTAR-2 into geosynchronous orbit in 1986. Its transmitter package permanently failed two months later, so Geostar began tests of RDSS by transmitting from other satellites. With his health failing, O'Neill became less involved with the company at the same time <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> run into trouble. In February 1991 Geostar filed for bankruptcy and its licenses were sold to Motorola for the Iridium satellite constellation project. Although the system was eventually replaced by GPS, O'Neill made significant advances in the field of position determination.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Xavier (RSMC Nadi Designation: 01F, JTWC Designation: 01P) was {{a strong}} {{pre-season}} cyclone that formed on October 20, 2006 {{to the north of}} the Santa Cruz Islands. During the next day it rapidly developed and was designated as Tropical Depression 01F later that day, before being designated as Tropical Cyclone Xavier while over Santa Cruz early on October 22. Later on October 22, Xavier intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, before passing over Tikopia early the next day. Xavier then reached its peak wind speeds of 175km/h (110mph 10-min), which made it a Category 4 cyclone early on October 24. Xavier stayed at its peak wind speeds until early the next day when <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> rapidly weaken, becoming a depression early on October 26. The remnants of Xavier persisted until October28 before dissipating. There were no casualties reported as a result of the storm and little impact reported in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.|$|E

5|$|The village hall {{is at the}} end of Church Lane, {{opposite}} The Rectory {{which is}} believed to have been built in 1529 by the rector, Sir John Barry, (Rector 1524–46). It has undergone substantial renovations including the addition of a clock tower for the Rev. W. P. Wait, which has since been removed and further alterations in about 1876 for Rev. J. Ellershaw. The building has an ornate south front with carvings of shields bearing the coat of arms of the St Loe family, who were once chief landowners in the area, alone or impaled with arms of Fitzpane, Ancell, de la Rivere and Malet. It is Grade II* listed. In 1945 <b>it</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> be used again as the rectory, for the parish. The parish is within the Benefice of Chew Stoke with Nempnett Thrubwell and forms part of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. The rectory was sold by the church in 2008 and is now a private dwelling.|$|E
