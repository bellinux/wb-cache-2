40|$|We {{represent}} here a 30 -year-old {{woman with}} cardiac leiomyosarcoma who developed thrombocytopenia and {{deep vein thrombosis}} {{a few days after}} the start of low molecular weight heparin. Thrombocytopenia improved after replacement of low molecular weight heparin with <b>hirudine.</b> We speculated that cardiac leiomyosarcoma is a predisposing factor for development of heparin induced thrombocytopenia...|$|E
40|$|As {{the result}} of these modifications, many of which in {{themselves}} may appear trifling, {{the course of events}} in the extracorporeal loop is greatly affected. White thrombi, it is true, are laid down in from 10 to 20 minutes, but the formation of fibrin sufficient to cause obstruction is prevented for 3 hours or more. Thus, the observations in normal animals tend to approach those described in Paper III, after the use of anticoagulants such as heparin and <b>hirudine.</b> The new technic offers certain advantages {{in the study of the}} details of the early stages of thrombosis...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of newly {{developed}} platelet aggregation inhibitors and anticoagulants are currently being investigated in clinical studies. Most of these new agents are targeted to haemostatic pathways that have recently {{been shown to be}} of importance in vivo and usually have a higher efficacy than the currently available anticoagulants. The new platelet aggregation inhibitors can be divided into thienopyridine derivatives (ticlopidine, clopidogrel) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban). The new inhibitors of fibrin synthesis can be divided into direct thrombin inhibitors (<b>hirudine,</b> melagatran, ximelagatran), specific factor Xa inhibitors (pentasaccharides: fondaparinux, idraparinux) and inhibitors of the tissue thromboplastin factor VIIa complex (recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c 2, inactivated factor VIIa, recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor). In some cases this also results in a (relatively modest) increase in the risk of bleeding. The clinical use of the new compounds is often much more convenient than that of the presently available anticoagulant...|$|E
30|$|Findings {{have shown}} that low {{temperatures}} induce reduction in its tolerance level to parasites. Hence, this predisposes the fish to infections which, depending on the intensity, may lead to serious pathological changes in the morphology of visceral organs, stunted growth, poor fish quality, and mortality of many which results in huge economic loss to the fish industry (Klinger & Floyd, 2002; Gophen, 2016). Tilapia zillii, a related species, {{has been known to}} be parasitized by different species of parasites, including nematodes, <b>hirudines</b> (Ejere et al., 2014), trematodes (Echi, Eyo, Okafor, Onyishi, & Ivoke, 2012; Ibrahim & Soliman, 2010), ciliophorans (Shulman, 1984), trypanosomes (Ahmed, Tawfif, & Abbas, 2000), and acanthocephalans (Bayoumy, Abd El-Hady, & Osman, 2006).|$|R
40|$|To the Editor, We {{are pleased}} by {{interest}} and valuable comments by authors. They correctly pointed out some unclarities in our letter, as some infor-mation were not presented due to limited extend of scientific letter format (1). We are glad to supplement this information here. The first remark {{was about the}} method used for blood sample collection. EDTA containing tubes were used for mean platelet volume and platelet count examination. All samples were processed in less than 2 hours. According to the literature (2) and our experience in such settings the mean platelet volume increase does not excess 10 %. Moreover, using a citrate can result in changes of mean platelet count (2). Samples for aggregometry were collected in <b>hirudine,</b> which seems to produce better results than citrate or lepirudine and is generally available for this method (3). Another remark concerned the potential bias caused by impact of comorbidities on mean platelet volume. In his letter a detailed summar...|$|E
