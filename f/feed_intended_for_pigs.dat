30|$|Aflatoxins {{are highly}} {{carcinogenic}} secondary metabolites produced by {{several members of}} Aspergillus section Flavi that contaminate an array of important food crops (Cotty et al. 1994). These mycotoxins are responsible for causing adverse health conditions in humans and other animals such as growth retardation, immune suppression, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death (Kensler et al. 2011). Aflatoxins are tightly regulated in the U.S. and European Union (EU), where the maximum allowable aflatoxin concentration in foods <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> human consumption range from 4 to 20  ng g− 1 (Henry et al. 1999). The maximum contamination level of <b>feed</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> non-dairy livestock in the U.S. is 300  ng g− 1 (Kensler et al. 2011). Regulation of mycotoxins is lacking in many developing nations where aflatoxin-related health problems are most severe, and approximately 4.5 billion people are chronically exposed (Williams et al. 2004). Efforts to control aflatoxin exposure in these areas are complicated for several reasons: (1) proper infrastructure is not in place; (2) testing and chemical decontamination are not economically feasible for many producers; and (3) many producers in high-exposure areas are subsistence farmers (Williams et al. 2004; Cotty et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|Providing {{supplemental}} feed is {{a popular}} management practice for quail (northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus and scaled quail Callipepla squamata) in Texas. It is common knowledge that non-target species, e. g., raccoons (Procyon lotor), are frequent visitors at <b>feeding</b> stations <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> quail. However, empirical data are scarce on seasonal visitation rates at such feeders, either by quail or by non-target species. The ecological efficacy and economic efficiency of a feeding program for quail depends on several variables; {{perhaps the most important}} of these is how much of the feed is consumed by quail versus various non-target species. I monitored species visitation seasonally at free-choice quail feeders with motion-sensing cameras at 4 sites in West Texas (Coke, Fisher and Stonewall counties). Quail feeders were monitored using active-infrared sensing camera systems and passive-infrared video systems, to compare data obtained via these 2 surveillance techniques. I tested 2 research hypotheses: 1) that quail feeders are visited by a wide range of non-target species; and 2) active-infrared surveillance will yield a more precise estimate of species visitation than estimates derived from passive video surveillance. Major findings included documentation of approximately 14 mammalian and 18 avian species that were recorded in a total of 6, 558 events. Data analysis yielded a chronology of feeding behavior by all visiting species. I found that species visitation at quail feeders varied according to season, with the greatest number of events occurring during the fall and the fewest during the winter. Feeder visitation also varied according to lunar phase, with the fewest events occurring during the new moon phase. I recorded the duration of each event monitored on videotape, a total of 29, 235 minutes, and determined that feeder visitation by raccoons comprised 43. 2 % of all time spent at quail feeders across all species.

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} species of the fungal genera Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium and fumonisin B 1 (FB 1), aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), and ochratoxin A (OTA) contamination from <b>feed</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> fish farms. A total of 60 samples were sampled from tilapia farms in the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The quantitative enumeration of fungi as colony-forming units per gram of feed (CFU/g) was performed using the surface spread method in different culture media. The results were expressed as fungal isolation frequency and relative density. Fungal total counts ranged from < 1 × 102 to 4.7 × 104 CFU/g. Fusarium counts were not observed. Among toxigenic genera, Aspergillus (68 %) was the most prevalent, followed by Penicillium species (60 %). Aspergillus niger aggregate (36 %), Aspergillus flavus (35 %), and Penicillium citrinum (71 %) were the most prevalent species. A high percentage of samples (98 %) were contaminated with FB 1 levels, while 55 % and 3.3 % were contaminated with AFB 1 and OTA, respectively. The simultaneous occurrence of these mycotoxins emphasizes the need for further research in the area to better assess the risk to the health of fish farms and their implications for the health of consumers of this meat.|$|R
40|$|Overview: Aflaloxins {{are highly}} toxic, cancer-eausing chemica 1 s {{produced}} by fungi {{belonging to the}} genus Aspergillus. Aspergillus jlavus {{is the most important}} causal agent of crop aflatoxin contamination. We developed a strategy for preventing aflatoxin con· tamination based on the use of naturaUy occurring isolates ofA jlaUlJS that Jack aflatoxinproducing ability (atoxigenic strains). The atoxigenic strains displace anatoxin producers during crop development and infection and thereby reduce contamination. Although gig. nmeant single-seasoo effects are achieved, the greatest potential is for long. term and area-wide influences. This chapter discusses the history of development and commercialization of atoxigenic strains. Aflatoxin Contamination Aflatoxins are highly toxic, cancer-causing chemicals produced by several fungal species within Aspergmus section F 1 avi. Presence of aflatoxins in human foods causes acute and chronic health effects (aflatoxicoses), ranging from immunesystem suppression, grolAlth retardation and cancer to death from acute poisoning (Wild and Turner, 2002). In developed countries, stringent government regulations limit the use of aflatoxin-contaminated crops in foods and feeds, and, as a result, commodities with aflatoxin content exceeding the maximum permissible level have significantly diminished cash value. In crops <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> human consumption, maximum permitted aflatoxin levels range from 2 ppb in the European Union to 20 ppb in the USA. As aflatoxins are readily transferred from animal feed to milk, similar stringent regulations are imposed on <b>feed</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> dairies (Wu, 2004).

Earlier, in 2007, contamination of pet food with ME and its related contaminants was associated with many clinical cases of canine and feline nephrotoxicity, {{and in some cases}} mortality. ME is a triazine compound that is often detected with other triazine analogs such as cyanuric acid.

The feed mixtures and drinking water were provided ad libitum. At the end of the experiment, chickens were slaughtered and the femur and the tibiotarsus from the right pelvic limb were collected and the following parameters were determined in wet tissue: dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) (N × 6. 25), fat, ash, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg); the content of organic matter was calculated. The resultant values were recalculated to 100 % of DM. Differences between males and females in the chemical composition of retrieved bones were investigated. The content of CP in wet tissue from both bones ranged from 354. 0 ± 11. 8 to 365. 1 ± 14. 3 g/kg being sig-nificantly lower (P < 0. 01) in the tibiotarsus. Differences between sexes were very small.

40|$|Objective—To {{investigate}} the infection of calves with Mycobacterium bovis through oral exposure and transmission of M bovis from experimentally infected white-tailed deer to uninfected cattle through indirect contact. Animals— 24 11 -month-old, white-tailed deer and 28 6 -month-old, crossbred calves. Procedure—In the oral exposure experiment, doses of 4. 3 X 106 CFUs (high dose) or 5 X 103 CFUs (low dose) of M bovis were each administered orally to 4 calves; as positive controls, 2 calves received M bovis (1. 7 X 105 CFUs) via tonsillar instillation. Calves were euthanatized and examined 133 days after exposure. Deer-to-cattle transmission was assessed in 2 phases (involving 9 uninfected calves and 12 deer each); deer were inoculated with 4 X 105 CFUs (phase I) or 7 X 105 CFUs (phase II) of M Bovis. Calves and deer exchanged pens (phase I; 90 days’ duration) or calves received uneaten feed from deer pens (phase II; 140 days’ duration) daily. At completion, animals were euthanatized and tissues were collected for bacteriologic culture and histologic examination. Results—In the low- and high-dose groups, 3 of 4 calves and 1 of 4 calves developed tuberculosis, respectively.

In contrast, blood meal and blood products of porcine origin are both authorised in aqua feed, whereas only porcine blood products are allowed to be used in <b>feed</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> other non-ruminants. Besides official methods (light microscopy and PCR), complementary methods are developed in order to refine the by-products identification. By-products derived from blood are one of these products for which additional information are needed. Indeed, these prohibited materials sometimes cannot be distinguished from those authorised (e. g. milk powder) using official methods. The aim of this work was to develop a fast and easy method to detect blood meal and blood products. This study was based on the detection of hemoglobin in animal feed by synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS). To achieve this goal, preliminary tests were carried out on reference material (hemoglobin and albumin purchased from Sigma Aldrich) in order to determine appropriate conditions (solvent) and parameters (offset values) for hemoglobin detection. Selected settings were then applied to analyse protein extracts of commercial feed material derived from blood. The results obtained on blood meal and blood products (hemoglobin powder and plasma powder) showed fluorescence spectral bands that characterise hemoglobin. In order to determine whether the method was fit for the purpose, real commercial compound feeds known to contain or to be free from blood products or blood meal were analysed.

Earlier this year, mad cow disease was found {{for the first time in}} a 12 -year old animal born and raised in the United States. In January 2002, we reported on the effectiveness of federal actions to prevent the introduction and spread of BSE in the United States and identified a number of areas where improvements were needed to strengthen FDA's oversight of firms in the feed industry. In February 2005, we issued a follow-up report that examined the effectiveness of FDA's actions since the 2002 report to ensure industry compliance with the feed-ban rule and protect U.

Our February 2005 report also noted that FDA had begun a small, discrete feed testing program in August 2003. We reported that we would provide information on this new feed testing program, which FDA described as a unique effort, once FDA provided us with data on the feed tests.

Blood meal and blood products of porcine origin are authorised in aquafeed, whereas only blood {{products are}} allowed {{to be used in}} <b>feed</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> other non-ruminant. The detection of the type of protein and the species of origin is therefore crucial to ensure feed safety. With the current official methods for the detection of PAPs, light microscopy and PCR, it is not always possible to specifically identify this type of protein source. The objective of our work was to set-up a routine mass spectrometry method for a qualitative detection of blood meal and hemoglobin powder of bovine and porcine origin in feed. The method was based on the detection of species-specific peptides biomarkers identified in a previous study by a non-targeted approach. All biomarkers were peptides of α and β hemoglobin subunits. Proteins were extracted using a TCA/acetone protein precipitation protocol followed by purification with a 2 -D Clean-Up Kit (GE Healthcare, USA). After an in-solution trypsin digestion step, analyses were performed by liquid chromatography (Acquity system, Waters, UK) coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Xevo TQS, Waters, UK) with electrospray ionisation. The acquisition and processing of data was carried out by MassLynx software (v. 4. 1, Waters) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) design was made using the open-source software Skyline ([URL] Reference hemoglobin powder was used to select MRM transitions for each peptide biomarkers and to optimise their collision energy.

40|$|Wildlife {{managers}} have fed elk in North America for nearly 100 years. Giving winter feed to elk can compensate for {{a shortage of}} natural winter range and may boost elk populations while also helping prevent commingling with livestock and depredation of winter <b>feed</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> livestock. In contrast to these benefits of supplemental feeding, there are economic and environmental costs associated with feeding, and elk herds that winter on feeding grounds have {{a higher risk of}} contracting and transmitting disease. Brucellosis is of primary concern now, and Chronic Wasting Disease may be in the future. Many see the discontinuation of winter-feeding programs as a necessary step for decreasing the risk of disease spread due to high animal densities associated with feeding during winter. My research evaluated the use of behavioral training to reduce reliance on supplemental winter feeding of elk, while minimizing population reductions and human-wildlife conflicts. My study was conducted at Deseret Land 2 ̆ 6 Livestock (DLL) in Rich County, UT, where managers at DLL have over 20 years of data on elk feeding during winters of varying intensities. I tested the effectiveness of range improvements, strategic cattle grazing, dispersed supplemental feeding, hunting, and herding to distribute and hold elk in desired areas during winter. I compared elk numbers on the feed ground during this study with historic data on DLL, and also contrasted elk responses with other comparable feed sites in Wyoming that served as controls. In 2 mild winters we completely eliminated elk feeding without incident and were able to reduce the quantity and duration of feeding during 1 severe winter. Since the conclusion of my study, DLL has further reduced quantity and duration of feeding during severe winters, and has completely eliminated feeding in light winters. Based on a Before After Control Impact (BACI) analysis, the reduction in the proportion of the elk population fed at the study site was significantly less than the proportion of the elk populations fed at the control sites in Wyoming (P = 0. 057). Based on these results, I anticipate wildlife managers can decrease dependence on costly supplemental winter feeding and reduce the risks of disease while keeping human-wildlife conflicts at a minimum. This research illustrates an adaptive method that can enable wildlife managers to keep elk populations in northern Utah at or near their current size, while constraining disease outbreak and transmission risks within 2 ̆ 2 acceptable 2 ̆ 2 levels...|$|R
40|$|Kokcisan ® 120 G is a <b>feed</b> {{additive}} <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> {{the control}} of coccidiosis, a debilitating protozoal infection in poultry. In common {{with a number of}} other coccidiostats, the additive is due for evaluation to comply with statutory requirements agreed at EU-level. The European Commission asked the EFSA to evaluate the product Kokcisan ® 120 G and advise the Commission on its efficacy and safety. Within EFSA this task was allocated to the Scientific Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP Panel). The data provided in the dossier proved insufficient to give conclusive answers to the several of the questions raised by the European Commission. Kokcisan ® 120 G containing 12 % salinomycin sodium (SAL-Na) as active substance, added as coccidiostat at a level of 60 mg SAL-Na kg- 1 feed for chickens for fattening, is as effective as another SAL-Na as seen in field trials. However, a full assessment of the efficacy was not possible, as no up-to-date floor pen studies have been carried out. Studies on the occurrence of coccidial resistance against SAL-Na from Kokcisan ® 120 G were not submitted, however the development of resistance against coccidiostats including SAL-Na is a well known phenomenon effectively counteracted in practice by rotation or shuttle programmes...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{the general}} {{rules for the}} {{marketing}} of feed are spread over several Directives according {{to the type of}} feed concerned. There is Directive 79 / 373 /EEC on compound feed covering also pet food where the rules for the circulation of this feed in the EU are laid down (e. g. labelling requirements). Directive 93 / 74 /EEC lays down the principles <b>for</b> feedingstuffs <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> particular nutritional purposes (dietetic feeds). Directive 96 / 25 /EC contains the general rules for the circulation and use of feed materials. Directive 82 / 471 /EEC lays down the marketing conditions for certain products, belonging to the category feed materials, used in animal nutrition (bio-proteins). Thus, the current rules are found in old Directives and some 50 amending or implementing acts. This has made existing legislation extremely scattered with many cross references and difficult to understand and implement in a uniform way. Feed legislation sets the rules for the different categories as of feed materials, dietetic feed, feed additives and medicated feed, differentiating between food producing animals and pets. Though horses might not be used for food production in all cases, feed legislation has to consider them as food producing animals because they enter to a significant extent the food chain. The main improvement of the proposal will be achieved by setting modern rules under one Regulation resulting in more legal clarity and a more homogenous market. In particular, the grey zone between feed materials, feed additives and veterinary drugs would be cleared. Further, the use of claims will be better regulated and thus enforceable for the control authorities. On <b>feed</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> particular nutritional purposes, the current system will be more or less retained. The proposal introduces a broad definition of labelling. Consequently, the required truthfulness of the information attributed to a product is not only limited to the sack label but as well to all other material supporting the sale. Additionally, it is highlighted that sales via the internet are covered by the marketing rules. Furthermore, proposal increases the accuracy of the indication of feed materials incorporated in compound feed for food producing animals by requiring the indication in descending order of weight. The exact percentage has to be indicated for raw materials in compound feed that are highlighted on the label. The proposal follows the philosophy that information needed by the feed user for an informed choice and safety relevant information must be provided unequivocally and in a harmonised way throughout the Community. Further labelling particulars can be given on a voluntary basis to fulfil special interest of customers, but then these have to be accurate and understandable for each target group, and the industry could label all details voluntarily. Stakeholders will be encouraged to develop EU codes for good labelling practice in the context of voluntary labelling provisions. The proposal is now in negotiation in the Council of the EU and the European Parliament for adoption. vo...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the toxigenic mycobiota and the occurrence of aflatoxins in shrimp <b>feed</b> products <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> shrimp cultivated in the coastal area of the state of Piau&# 237;, Brazil, in three farms ("A", "B" and "C"). The toxigenic capacity of the fungal species isolated was tested for aflatoxins (AF) and ochratoxin A production. The fungal counts of shrimp feed were similar for the "A" and "B" farms at all cultivation phases, collection sites, in closed and opened packages (1. 33 to 2. 66 CFU g- 1 log 10 - 1). The lowest fungal counts were found in feed from "C" farm (0. 65 CFU g- 1 log 10 - 1) from closed packages. Thirty-four strains of Aspergillus were detected with a greater prevalence of A. flavus. Two strains produced B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2 aflatoxins at concentrations from 0. 39 to 0. 42 ng g- 1; 0. 18 to 0. 27 ng g- 1; 1. 78 ng g- 1 and 0. 09 ng g- 1 respectively and were classified as atypical A. flavus. Two strains of A. niger aggregate were OTA producers. Fifteen samples (13. 88 %) presented AFB 1 contamination at levels ranging from 0. 25 ng to 360 ng g- 1. This study demonstrates the presence of toxigenic fungi in shrimp feed used at different phases of cultivation and farms. Atypical strains of A. flavus were isolated which produced AF B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2 in shrimp feeds. Only AFB 1 was detected in the analyzed fee...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} {{producers}} of mycotoxins are fungi {{of the genera}} Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium. Toxins are of extreme importance {{because it can be}} transmitted from animals to humans through milk and animal products, some of which are carcinogenic and teratogenic. Mycotoxins cause a health disturbance of all animals, but the effects are more noticeable in highly productive animals in the farm way of keeping considering the much greater consumption of concentrate feeds, although forages also can be contaminated with mycotoxins in a significant manner. Mycotoxicoses are the most com­mon seasonal illnesses, and are an important diagnostic problem in veterinary practice, because its characteristics often resemble diseases caused by pathogens or nutritional deficiency or imbalance. The degree of health disturbances depends on the amount of toxins in feed and the length of intaking as on types and categories of animals. The presence of mycotoxins in animal feed is inevitable and therefore testing of raw materials and products is necessary so that feed for humans and animals can be safe for use. Damages arising as consequences of mycotoxicosis in poultry and swine production, due to the direct loss because of animals lossor, more commonly, indirectly due to the fall productive and reproductive performances of animals, imposed the need for continuous monitoring of the hygienic quality of feed mixtures for feeding these animals. During a five year period (2007 - 2012) were analyzed a total of 104 samples from the territory of Republic of Serbia <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> nutrition of all categories of poultry and mixtures for the initial and final fattening broilers (50 samples) and laying hens (54). The analysis included 57 samples of <b>feed</b> mixtures <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> all categories of swine - feed mixture for young (20 samples) and the old categories (37 samples) and 196 of the samples, which are commonly used in formulating rations for listed species (maize, soybean and sunflower meal). For the analysis of the samples was used thin layer chromatography and Elisa test. The results were compared with current Regulations {{on the quality of the}} feed (Official Gazette of RS 41 / 09) in force since 1. 05. 2010. in the part where the maximum allowable quantities of hazardous substances (Article 99) gives the value of the maximum permitted levels of mycotoxins in animal feed. The number and types of mycotoxins vary depending on the feed, as well as on the year which can be directly related to climatic factors, and the average annual humidity. The fact that in the samples was not detected the presence of aflatoxin indicate that in our conditions toxin producing fungi do not find fertile ground for the production of toxins, as well as the absence of certain nutrients in the production of complete feed mixtures <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> and poultry, which are the traditional sources of aflatoxin (peanut oil meals). The results are encouraging given the fact a relatively small number of defective mixtures and nutrients. However, the fact that only a limited number of feed sam­ples we received for the analysis suggests further caution and constant monitoring of the presence of mycotoxins in animal feed.
