5|$|Natural lead {{consists}} of four stable isotopes with mass numbers of 204, 206, 207, and 208, and traces of five short-lived radioisotopes. The high number of isotopes is consistent with lead's atomic number being even. Lead has a magic number of protons (82), for which the nuclear shell model accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus. Lead-208 has 126 neutrons, another magic number, {{which may explain why}} lead-208 <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> stable.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> high.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellum}} of cartilaginous and {{bony fishes}} <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> large and complex. In {{at least one}} important respect, it differs in internal structure from the mammalian cerebellum: The fish cerebellum does not contain discrete deep cerebellar nuclei. Instead, the primary targets of Purkinje cells are a distinct type of cell distributed across the cerebellar cortex, a type not seen in mammals. In mormyrid fish (a family of weakly electrosensitive freshwater fish), the cerebellum is considerably larger {{than the rest of}} the brain put together. The largest part of it is a special structure called the valvula, which has an unusually regular architecture and receives much of its input from the electrosensory system.|$|E

5|$|The {{proportion}} of cell volume that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms {{the bulk of}} cell structure in bacteria, in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole. The cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a molecular mass of less than 300Da. This mixture of small molecules <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> complex, as the variety of molecules {{that are involved in}} metabolism (the metabolites) is immense. For example, up to 200,000 different small molecules might be made in plants, although not all these will be present in the same species, or in a single cell. Estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as E. coli and baker's yeast predict that under 1,000 are made.|$|E

Around 70% of Russia's developed oil fields are in the Khanty-Mansiysk region. Russia contains about 40% of the world's known resources of nickel at the Norilsk deposit in Siberia.

25|$|There {{are very}} few natural lakes in the region, these being found in {{adjoining}} areas of glacial till, drift and in moraines; the region <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> well drained, and there is rarely a place where even a pond can naturally form. There are also very few dams in that the valley walls and floors are very often fissured or crumbly, or very porous, providing very poor anchors for a dam or {{making it difficult to}} keep any kind of reservoir appropriately filled. There are no real waterfalls, but some very strong springs bear the name.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{tarantula}} hawks are nectarivorous. The {{consumption of}} fermented fruit sometimes intoxicates {{them to the}} point that flight becomes difficult. While the wasps tend to be most active in daytime summer months, they tend to avoid high temperatures. The male tarantula hawk does not hunt; instead, it feeds off the flowers of milkweeds, western soapberry trees, or mesquite trees (females feed on these same plants, as well). Male tarantula hawks have been observed practicing a behavior called hill-topping, in which they sit atop tall plants and watch for passing females ready to reproduce. Females are not very aggressive, in that they are hesitant to sting, but the sting <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> painful.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{himself did}} not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give {{knowledge}} a more solid basis, but as Richard J. Bernstein remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:Once we begin to question {{whether there is a}} common faculty of taste (a sensus communis), we are easily led down the path to relativism. And this is what did happen after Kant - so much so that today it <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} {{is located in}} the suburb of Blachernae, between the mid-12th century stretch of walls constructed by the Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180) and the earlier walls of Byzantine emperors Heraclius (r. 610–641) and Leo V the Armenian (r. 813–820). A small stretch of wall connects the structure to the east with the wall of Manuel Komnenos. The structure's outer wall itself <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> high, rising as high as 23 m above {{the ground in front of}} it, and is 11–20 m thick. Behind the outer curtain wall, the building consists of twelve three-storied chambers. Its outer face features two rectangular towers built side-by-side, with one shared wall. The twin towers are in turn supported by a massive buttress, which stands almost 8 m above the ground level and projects from 6.5–9 m in front of the towers themselves.|$|E
500|$|Fellow Lusophone {{countries}} Brazil and Timor Leste also {{reacted to}} the events, with Brazil's Ministry of External Relations expressing their [...] "preoccupation" [...] with the events and saying that it would call for an extraordinary meeting of the UNSC to discuss the issue. Timor Leste's President José Ramos-Horta said that [...] "the situation in Guinea-Bissau, which I have followed over the years, <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> complex, dangerous, because it can degrade into more violence, {{and the country is}} {{not in a position to}} afford that new setback in the peace process and its democratisation."

500|$|Rolling Stone writer Paul Nelson wrote: [...] "Red Headed Stranger <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> ambitious, cool, tightly controlled.... Hemingway, who perfected an art {{of sharp}} {{outlines}} and clipped phrases, {{used to say that}} the full power of his composition was accessible only between the lines; and Nelson, on this LP, ties precise, evocative lyrics to not quite remembered, never really forgotten folk melodies to create a similar effect, haunting yet utterly unsentimental. That he did not write much of the material makes his accomplishment no less singular." [...] Meanwhile, critic Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "Some of the individual pieces are quite nice, but the gestalt is the concept album at its most counterproductive—the lyrics render the nostalgic instrumental parts unnecessarily ironic and lose additional charm in narrative context." ...|$|E

500|$|Wolff summarizes: [...] "Cantata 161 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{delicate}} and jewel-like products of Bach's years in Weimar. The writing in up to ten parts <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> subtle. ... The recorders additionally contribute in no small way to the spiritualised emotion and positive feelings associated with the 'sweet hour of death. Jones writes: [...] "Bach's arrival at full maturity by about the middle of his Weimar period (1713–17) is attested by the stylistic and technical assurance, and the consistently high standard, of his writing at that time." [...] He counts the cantata as one of several that reached a level of mastery unsurpassed in later years, along with the Orgelbüchlein and the cantata Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis, BWV 21, among others.|$|E
500|$|Bob Strauss of the Los Angeles Daily News {{also wrote}} {{positively}} of Hurlbut's {{work in his}} review of Into the Blue, writing: [...] "The undersea photography, much of it shot amid schools of wild sharks, is exquisite..." [...] Strauss also commented positively on Hurlbut's work on the 2005 film The Greatest Game Ever Played, writing he [...] "does {{a great job of}} making golf look cinematic". Soren Andersen of The News Tribune wrote of Hurlbut's work on The Greatest Game Ever Played: [...] "Shot by cinematographer Shane Hurlbut, the picture <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> handsome, with its velvety green fairways and its burnished, candlelit interiors." [...] Joan E. Vadeboncoeur of The Post-Standard was critical of the film's script, but praised Hurlbut's work: [...] "Director Bill Paxton does have a splendid cinematographer, Shane Hurlbut, contributing beauty and atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the {{underlying}} equations governing plasmas are relatively simple, plasma behavior <b>is</b> <b>extraordinarily</b> varied and subtle: {{the emergence of}} unexpected behavior from a simple model is a typical feature of a complex system. Such systems lie in some sense on the boundary between ordered and disordered behavior and cannot typically be described either by simple, smooth, mathematical functions, or by pure randomness. The spontaneous formation of interesting spatial features {{on a wide range}} of length scales is one manifestation of plasma complexity. The features are interesting, for example, because they are very sharp, spatially intermittent (the distance between features is much larger than the features themselves), or have a fractal form. Many of these features were first studied in the laboratory, and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universe. Examples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include: ...|$|E
