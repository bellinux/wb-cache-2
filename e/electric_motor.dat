5|$|On 28 March 1961 {{the light}} was electrified, with mains {{electricity}} as the power source, and an intensity of 1,000,000cd. The drive was replaced with a 0.3 amp <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> At {{the same time the}} staff was cut from three lightkeepers to two.|$|E

5|$|In 1984 it {{was decided}} to {{preserve}} the two remaining engines and incorporate them as the central feature in the Visitor Centre, including a Museum in the old boiler house, which opened in 1988 and attracts over 30,000 visitors a year. The flywheel is now driven by an <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The pumping station is now a Grade II* listed building, while the gothic-style meter house is Grade II listed and used as a bat sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|It is {{reported}} that this {{problem with the}} CL contributed to the bankruptcy of the cable company in 1888. However, <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to electric traction. Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{electromagnetism}} are most visibly {{employed in the}} <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> operate {{through the}} {{interaction}} between an <b>electric</b> <b>motor's</b> magnetic field and winding currents to generate force.

5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>motors</b> {{have their}} {{greatest}} torque at startup, making them ideal for vehicles {{as they need}} the most torque at startup too. The idea of [...] "revving up" [...] so common with internal combustion engines is unnecessary with <b>electric</b> <b>motors.</b> Their greatest torque occurs as the rotor first begins to turn, which is why <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> do not require a transmission. A gear-down arrangement may be needed, but unlike in a transmission normally paired with a combustion engine, no shifting is needed for <b>electric</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For {{submerged}} propulsion, {{several different}} <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> were used. Early models used the VIIB configuration of two AEG GU 460/8-276 <b>electric</b> <b>motors,</b> totaling [...] with a max rpm of 296, while newer boats used two BBC GG UB 720/8, Garbe, Lahmeyer & Co. RP 137/c or Siemens-Schuckert-Werke (SSW) GU 343/38-8 <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> {{with the same}} power output as the AEG motors.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>motors</b> {{were several}} times more {{efficient}} than small steam engines because central station generation were {{more efficient than}} small steam engines and because line shafts and belts had high friction losses. [...] <b>Electric</b> <b>motors</b> allowed also more flexibility in manufacturing and required less maintenance than line shafts and belts. Many factories saw a 30% increase in output just from changing over to <b>electric</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
5|$|The AC <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> {{used in a}} VFD {{system is}} usually {{three-phase}} induction motor. Some types of single-phase motors or synchronous motors advantageous in some situations can be used, but three-phase induction motors are generally preferred as the most economical motor choice. Motors that are designed for fixed-speed operation are often used. Elevated-voltage stresses imposed on induction motors that are supplied by VFDs require that such motors be designed for definite-purpose inverter-fed duty in accordance with such requirements as Part 31 of NEMA Standard MG-1.|$|E
5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered flying controls were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E
5|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> was {{equipped}} with several hundred feet of cable carried on a reel. The cable attached to a specially designed electrical outlet box that was nearest to the fire. The box would be located next to the water plugs throughout the city districts in the manner previously mentioned. When the engine was tested, it gave very good results, {{and is now in}} use at the factory of the Crocker-Wheeler Electric Company, in Ampere, New Jersey. The company claimed that an electric fire engine of the same capacity as a steam fire engine would be more efficient.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>motors</b> convert {{electrical}} energy into mechanical motion, usually through {{the interaction of}} magnetic fields and current-carrying conductors. <b>Electric</b> <b>motors</b> are found in numerous diverse applications, such as fans, blowers, pumps, machines, household appliances, power tools, and disk drives. The very largest <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> with ratings in the thousands of kilowatts are used in such applications as the propulsion of large ships. The smallest motors move the dials in electric wristwatches.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the {{interior of}} a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for {{it led to}} Michael Faraday's invention of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting {{in a pool of}} mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet {{for as long as the}} current was maintained.|$|E
5|$|While driving, {{after the}} Volt battery {{has dropped to}} a {{predetermined}} threshold from full charge, a small naturally aspirated 1.4 L 4-cylinder gasoline fueled internal combustion engine (Opel's Family 0) with approximately , powers a 55kW generator to extend the Volt's range. The vehicle also has a regenerative braking system. The electrical power from the generator is sent primarily to the <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> with the excess going to the batteries, depending {{on the state of}} charge (SOC) of the battery pack and the power demanded at the wheels.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>motors,</b> {{when used}} in reverse {{function}} as generators, convert mechanical energy into electrical energy.
