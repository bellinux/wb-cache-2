The proposal was costed by Barnett at A$2 billion, however it soon emerged that no feasibility study or <b>detailed</b> <b>costings</b> had been done. Some experts put the cost as high as A$5 billion. The Prime Minister, John Howard, refused to commit federal funds to the project. He released the policy costings only {{a few days before the}} election, when a A$200 million error in the costings document was discovered. When the Gallop government was returned with its majority intact, Barnett accepted responsibility for the defeat and resigned the Liberal leadership. On 9 March 2005 Liberal MPs elected Matt Birney, the member for Kalgoorlie, as Barnett's successor.|$|E
5000|$|March Elm Road {{railway station}} is a {{proposed}} station in March, Cambridgeshire, which if successful, the Bramley Line will make as the southern terminus next to Elm Road Crossing. It {{was part of}} a branch of the Great Eastern Railway which ran from March to Watlington. The line closed in the 1960s, but a recent idea by the Wisbech and March Bramley Line to restore the line between Wisbech and March may see trains return to route in some form. However, the organisation would need to raise Â£10 000 to acquire the lease of the line and then set about repairing it to the required railways inspectorate standard. Additional funds to build this and other stations would then need to be raised by the small number of volunteers. No <b>detailed</b> <b>costings</b> for the additional work are available.|$|E

40|$|A blood {{transfusion}} {{is one of}} the most common hospital procedures, yet there is a lack of reliable information on the costs of administering blood. This thesis aims to fill this information gap, and considers the impact on total costs of alternative transfusion management strategies in the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom. A high user of {{blood transfusion}}, cardiac surgery, acts as a clinical exemplar. Comprehensive estimates of the costs of administering blood are first produced. The costs of administering blood add substantially to the costs of the blood products themselves, costs for red blood cells are 40 % higher when the costs of administration are added to red blood cell costs. These cost estimates were used to more accurately cost blood products transfused (compared to the costs of blood products only) in two economic evaluations assessing firstly, the cost-effectiveness of a restrictive versus a liberal red blood cell transfusion threshold after cardiac surgery, and secondly, the cost-effectiveness of introducing bedside tests of haemostatic function in cardiac surgery. Both economic evaluations showed little difference in costs or outcomes between the groups and uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness results. While a restrictive threshold reduces costs associated with transfusion compared to a liberal threshold, there is no evidence based on <b>detailed</b> and comprehensive <b>costings,</b> to suggest that a restrictive threshold saves the NHS money overall. Reliable resource use data are vital for economic evaluations, and a subgroup of patients in both economic evaluations enabled resource use data collected from alternative sources to be compared. There was strong agreement between primary (clinical trial) data and routine datasets for data available from both sources, however, primary data captured post-operative complications more comprehensively than routine datasets. This thesis provides hospital managers and health economists with accurate information on the costs of administering blood for budget impact assessments and economic evaluations. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study results}} from a {{perceived}} need for Higher Education providers of primary undergraduate initial teacher training (ITT) to be more accountable, within their institutions and externally to their funding body, for costs incurred. A survey of all undergraduate primary ITT courses within England and Wales revealed that very few course leaders {{had access to the}} necessary raw data or to any resultant financial information. Most courses generated sufficiently <b>detailed</b> <b>costings</b> to demonstrate course viability but not to assist with detailed course planning and management of resources. Using data obtained from a case study institution, 'back-flush' costing was employed to identify component costs in a form which allowed the development of a formulaic costing system. The viability of such approaches to costing is analysed and recommendations are made for changes to course, institutional and state funding body procedures to ensure that there can be rigorous accountability for the use of public funds...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{looks at}} the provision of sheltered housing for the elderly by local authorities in County Durham in 1976. Durham has high provision of such housing, around 14 % of the population aged sixty-five and over live in such dwellings. The aims of sheltered housing are given, followed by {{a description of the}} accommodation, wardens, alarm systems and, to a limited extent, tenants. Some of the problems and successes of sheltered housing are discussed and <b>detailed</b> <b>costings</b> of the major types of dwelling are provided to illustrate the discussion. Alternative forms of care for the elderly are then considered and costings given for these for elderly people requiring varying levels of domiciliary support and having different levels of income. The research {{looks at the}} provision of sheltered housing by housing associations, almshouses and charities in County Durham and discusses the alleged advantages of provision by such bodies. The thesis concludes with a consideration of the future of sheltered housing and looks at some of the factors which might be taken into account when policies for housing the elderly are being formulated...|$|E
40|$|Described are {{the results}} of a cost study of {{national}} rural health services carried out in Indonesia between November 1986 and March 1987. <b>Detailed</b> <b>costings</b> of government inputs to all public health services below the district hospital level were made for 41 subdistricts in five provinces that were representative of the different regions of the country. The total costs of services as well as the average costs for specific service functions were estimated for the whole country {{as well as for the}} different provinces. The results indicate a low overall level of government spending on rural primary health care. Regional differences in this respect were not significant, suggesting that the government policy of encouraging regional balance in allocations has been successful. The average costs for most services were much greater than the charges made to patients, and this provided information on the current level of government subsidies. There was a large variability in the average costs, indicating that the existing system is inefficient, that some districts were able to attain much higher levels of efficiency than others within the existing constraints, and that improvements in this respect are possible...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the face}} of the two key {{sustainability}} issues of global warming and depletion of non-renewable sources of energy, it has proven possible, and even relatively simple, to construct new houses that require little or no non-renewable energy for their operation. However, existing dwellings represent a much more difficult problem. The first difficulty lies in the issue of scale, for example in New Zealand about 20, 000 new dwellings are constructed each year, but the existing housing stock comprises around a million units. It would take fifty years for improved new houses to replace the existing ones, and the demolition of the existing dwellings would represent a considerable waste of resources. The second difficulty is the one of technology. It is possible to apply a range of technologies to reduce the energy demand of existing buildings. These include things like increased insulation, improved window glazing, solar water heating, improved lights and low energy appliances. The installation of some of these technologies, particularly those that involve alterations to he building fabric, can be very disruptive in an existing occupied home. In the light of these difficulties, the paper will discuss an alternative approach to achieving the zero energy retrofit of an existing house in New Zealand {{through the use of a}} roof-mounted photovoltaic system combined with non-invasive energy improvements. The paper gives <b>detailed</b> <b>costings</b> and measured performance data for the installation and will attempt to draw some policy conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Equipment in {{the process}} {{industry}} is often subject to decay and requires maintenance, repair and eventual replacement. The challenge of competition and the accompanying regulatory regime requires that actions be integrated and cost effective. Ansell and colleagues in 2001 explored an approach to the assessment of asset life of maintained equipment {{in the process}} industry using a semiparametric approach. Using stochastic dynamic programming techniques an approach to nd the optimal strategy was also developed by Ansell and colleagues. The approach was illustrated {{using data from the}} water industry. A major aspect in the development of optimal strategy for repair and replacement is the cost of these activities. Often the costs can only be ascertained roughly in terms of hours expended on the activity. <b>Detailed</b> <b>costings</b> are rarely available. The discount factor will depend on the interest rate in place. Generally a conservatively high level has been taken but with current low rates one needs to explore the sensitivity of solution to the discount factor. Also {{there is a need to}} explore the sensitivity of the solution to changes in the costs of the maintenance activities involved. In this paper we explore the stability of the results to changes in the relative costs. It is seen that two costs seem to be more important than the others; hence the accounting effort appears to be best directed towards these costs. One concern that arises from these results is the impact of the maintenance events. In past modelling the impact of maintenance has been assumed to have a xed effect. This was derived from study of data. It is felt that this assumption may be too simple and so a differing model is explored to examine this issue...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Postoperative oral {{nutritional}} supplementation {{has been}} shown to be of clinical benefit. This study examined the clinical effects and cost of administration of oral supplements both before and after surgery. METHODS: This was a randomized clinical trial conducted in three centres. Patients undergoing lower gastrointestinal tract surgery were randomized to one of four groups: group CC received no nutritional supplements, group SS took supplements both before and after surgery, group CS received postoperative supplements only, and group SC were given supplements only before surgery. Preoperative supplements were given from the time it was decided to operate to 1 day before surgery. Postoperative supplements were started when the patient was able to take free fluids and continued for 4 weeks after discharge from hospital. Data collected included weight change, complications, length of stay, nutritional intake, anthropometrics, quality of life and <b>detailed</b> <b>costings</b> covering all aspects of care. RESULTS: Some 179 patients were randomized, of whom 27 were withdrawn and 152 analysed (CC 44, SS 32, CS 35, SC 41). Dietary intake was similar in all four groups throughout the study. Mean energy intake from preoperative supplements was 536 and 542 kcal/day in the SS and SC groups respectively; that 2 weeks after discharge from hospital was 274 and 361 kcal/day in the SS and CS groups respectively. There was significantly less postoperative weight loss in the SS group than in the CC and CS groups (P < 0. 050), and significantly fewer minor complications in the SS and CS groups than the CC group (P < 0. 050). There were no differences in the rate of major complications, anthropometrics and quality of life. Mean overall costs were greatest in the CC group, although differences between groups were not significant. CONCLUSION: Perioperative oral nutritional supplementation started before hospital admission for lower gastrointestinal tract surgery significantly diminished the degree of weight loss and incidence of minor complications, and was cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|With {{the poll}} just days away, Geoff Anderson and Haydon Manning make their {{predictions}} AS MIKE RANN contemplates next Saturdayâs election {{he would be}} well aware that history is on his side. All of the other incumbent state Labor governments in Australia were returned to office after their initial term, and in two instances, Queensland and Victoria, the return was triumphant. Our view is that next Saturday this piece of history will be repeated, although not to the degree enjoyed by Premiers Beattie and Bracks. After giving due consideration to the âelectoral tea leavesâ - digesting the polls and observing the campaign - we believe that Premier Rann will join the second term club with a comfortably nett gain {{of four or five}} seats. But he may also face a more hostile upper house. The upper end of this prediction would see Labor with 28 seats, a couple better than Don Dunstan managed when returned to office in 1973 and one better than John Bannonâs 1985 win. A victory of these dimensions would allow Labor to speak in terms of a âRannslideâ. But we believe that a devastation of the Opposition similar to that enjoyed by Beattie in 2001 and Bracks in 2002 - or, for that matter, Dean Brown in South Australia in 1993 - is beyond Labor. Our reasoning is that electoral history and recent opinion polls suggest that a Labor victory will be achieved largely through a favourable flow of preferences rather than an overwhelming primary vote. The advent of Family First and the decline of the Democrats, however, have made the preference flow back to Labor less certain. Laborâs problem is that its first preference vote has been in steady decline since the 1970 s, hitting a low point of 30 per cent at the State Bank election in 1993. In 1997 Mike Rann helped lift Labor to a still less than impressive 35 per cent. At the following poll in 2002, facing a Liberal government in disarray, Laborâs vote climbed a mere 1. 7 per cent. The most recent statewide poll is the Sunday Mailâs telephone poll of 607 people conducted on 8 March. It reports the Liberal primary vote languishing on 33 per cent, with Labor still on a modest 40 per cent. Interestingly, the poll indicates Family First moving ahead to 5 per cent, the Democrats on 3 per cent and the Greens dropping back to around 2 per cent - results we suspect are around about the mark. Qualifying even further the prospect of a big win for Labor are polls looking at key marginals. Here the Liberals appear set to retain Hartley and, surprisingly, win Norwood. Yet with around 15 per cent of respondents âundecidedâ we are not about to draw much by way of conclusion. We believe Rann Labor will enjoy a statewide swing on primary votes of 4 to 5 per cent. Apart from delivering a comfortable win and a majority in its own right in the Assembly, this should see Labor take 5 seats in the Legislative Council, but Labor would remain well short of a majority in that chamber. Laborâs strident use of negative campaigning against Kerin risks seeming like massive overkill, and if that perception takes hold Labor may not hold as many swinging voters as would otherwise have been the case. Television and direct mail imagery attacking Kerin ventured into new territory this week when they set him up for physical ridicule; interested readers may observe the TV advertisement on the Labor Party website. Undoubtedly, negative advertising is effective in making a simple message stick; recall Laborâs attack on Hewson in 1993 and the Liberals effective dismissal of Latham in 2004. But there is always a risk that it might go too far for after all Kerin, while not widely perceived as âbetter premierâ material, is nonetheless viewed as a decent and honest politician. There is a risk that enough voters may regard him as a man deserving fairer treatment than is being meted out in some of Laborâs advertisements. The Liberal campaign Capturing front page headlines with a promise to top up the first home ownerâs grant by $ 3000, Kerin said his policy would âhelp eliminate stamp duty for most first home buyersâ. Treasurer Foley thrashed around trying to say the policy was too costly, but at a modest $ 77 m over three years it appeared that Labor were caught on the hop by an obvious vote winner. Kerin coupled that with a commitment to cut payroll tax, something that he conceded did not impact directly on many voters but was, he argued, âaggressiveâ and had the potential to create jobs. We can at least say the Liberals threw a few punches at the government during the last week. Alongside the policy to cut public service jobs by 4000, the payroll announcement should shore-up Liberal voters considering a protest vote against their preferred partyâs poor showing in opposition over the last four years. An understated Liberal launch way back in mid February was followed up by a more public launch, with candidates present, last Sunday, six days out from polling. This unusual approach to âthe campaign launchâ probably did no particular harm and perhaps helped underscore the Liberalâs underdog status, something that may garner some support from swinging voters worried about Labor winning by too much. It was certainly an old-fashioned affair, with lots of banner waving candidates and, in stark contrast to Laborâs launch, little else by way of props, physical or electronic. The foreign minister, Alexander Downer, warmed the party faithful with an address delivered with a touch of the âmongrelâ that Rob Kerin struggles to muster. Downer claimed for the Howard government the stateâs improved economy and trumpeted that âMike Rann is sometimes known as Media Mike. I think a better name for him would be expedient Mike. He stands for nothing and he achieves nothing. â Downer also took a swing at Rann for taking the credit for the economic benefits that are flowing from Howard government defence projects, suggesting that âthe only federal project Mike Rann has not claimed is the Baxter detention centreâ. Alas, Premier Rann is not confronting an opponent with Downerâs rhetorical flourish. But Kerin managed a little wit with his statement, âIâve always believed that people would eventually see through this shallow government and realise that itâs a kilometre wide but only a centimetre deep. â The able and knockabout Kerin hammered out his themes that the stateâs economy should be doing better, the health system remains a mess and honesty in government would be one of his priorities. But his statement that he truly believes âwe are in with a real chanceâ, is not sufficiently reassuring to prompt us to advise readers to lay a wager with Centrebet, even if the odds on a Liberal win are 12 to 1 ! Laborâs campaign With the formal launch of Laborâs campaign presidential politics in South Australia reached new heights. With a backdrop of four-metre high photos of the premier and a video presentation that made hagiography look respectable, the setting would not have been out of place at a US political convention. It also demonstrated the huge gulf between the two campaigns - in terms of money, organisation, focus on key messages, and style. Of course campaign launches are no longer the occasion when the election platform is laid out in its entirety. They are about key messages, about creating impetus in the final week when the less rusted on voters are starting to focus and come to a decision. In short, they are about presentation, which in this instance was highly professional and the message tightly focused. For Labor the centerpiece was the health system and a plan to rebuild the Flinders Medical Centre, which sits at the edge of Adelaideâs southern suburbs and a clutch of marginal seats. This was balanced by a pledge to return the privatised Modbury Hospital in the cityâs northeast to public sector management. This provided an opportunity to once again raise the privatisation bogey, which fell a bit flat on this occasion when Healthscope, the company that operates the hospital, cheerfully announced that they would be only be too pleased {{to get out of the}} contract, and in fact had asked to do so two years ago but were refused. Labor also had to admit that public sector management would be 5 per cent more expensive. Labor would also not have been happy to have to endure the factional brawling of their federal colleagues, which pushed state news down the list in the evening news bulletins. In fact the deputy premier made his feelings quite clear when he told the Sunday Mail that both he and the Premier were âpissed offâ at brawling factions. The other âproblemâ for Labor was the question of how they were going to fund their promises. At the time of writing Labor had not yet released any <b>detailed</b> <b>costings</b> and it appears that this will be held back until after the commencement of the electronic blackout. The Liberals suffered early from their announcement that they would cut public service jobs to create financial headroom. But to some extent it has given them some protection against the cry of âwhereâs the money coming from?â On the other hand, media questions to Mike Rann about costings produced one of the few images of a âtestyâ premier. However, the biggest talking point of Laborâs campaign remains their use of negative attack advertisements, which - as we noted earlier - have increased in number and become far more personal. The jury is still out on their effectiveness, although discussions with party professionals suggests that there are few doubts within Laborâs campaign team. What is more interesting is the frequency with which they are still being used, despite the clear lead Labor has over its opponents and the stratospheric advantage which Rann holds over Kerin. One explanation is that a large lead can also induce complacency and that the ads are part of a strategy to keep the pressure on voters to remember why they have switched to Labor and to keep them there. The results on Saturday will provide a few answers and perhaps create a template for future campaigns. In fact we believe that itâs quite likely that when commentators look back on Laborâs campaign in this election they will see it as marking a turning point in the way politics is conducted in South Australia. Certainly itâs been a basic rule of campaigning for decades that the leader needs to be up front. Politicians also learnt some years ago that people get their information from television and so thatâs where the advertising effort has to be focused. Even negative advertising is not new. But the intensity of that negative campaigning, the frequency and hard-edged content of the television advertising and the promotion of the leader to the point of adulation all suggest that we are seeing something different. â¢ Geoff Anderson and Haydon Manning teach in the School of Political Studies at Flinders University JOSTLING IN A NETHER WORLD, Geoff Anderson and Haydon Manningâs first South Australian election report for APO >> A BORING CAMPAIGN?, Geoff Anderson and Haydon Manningâs second South Australian election report for APO >> FAILING THE TEST WITH RAY AND THE LEADERS, Geoff Anderson and Haydon Manningâs third South Australian election report for APO >> Photo: Parliament of South Australi...|$|E
