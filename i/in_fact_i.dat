5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E
25|$|If P were false then I {{would know}} it; <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> {{do not know}} it; {{therefore}} P cannot be false.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're a rancher's {{clothes and}} I don't mind {{looking like a}} bushman. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> until <b>I</b> make Vancouver, the part will go all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry, my dear fellow," [...] I said sleepily, [...] "but do {{you know}} I thought <b>I</b> was <b>in</b> London--in <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> could swear that I have been there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! oh! Saskatchewan--hum--yes--outpost--wild boy--just so--keep him at it--ay, fit {{for nothing}} else. So," [...] said Mr Park, folding the paper, [...] "I find that Mr Grant has sent {{you to take}} the place of a young gentleman we {{expected}} to pick up at Norway House, but who is required elsewhere; and that he wishes you to see a good deal of rough life--to be made a trader of, <b>in</b> <b>fact.</b> <b>Is</b> that your desire?" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{statement}} “I’m {{a believer}} in social Darwinism,” {{did not come from}} me. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> had to look up the expression to learn what was being referred to. This attack appears to be calling me a Nazi, nothing less. I demand that Mr. Storr refer me to the original sources to which we assume he has referred. Until then, I’ll only say that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing that I would have expected from him.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009, after {{spending}} some time presenting on RTÉ Radio 1, {{it was announced that}} Fanning would be returning to RTÉ 2fm to present his evening weekday show in his old 19:00 slot. The return followed the failure by RTÉ 2fm in its attempts to target teenagers. Fanning claimed: <b>In</b> <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> so never moved that instead I brought the four people who were working with me for Radio One and their desks into 2FM! I never went over to Radio One, I did all my programmes from 2FM, I never moved. I was also doing 2FM every Sunday so I never left at all so I'm just back to my spiritual home Monday to Friday.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
6000|$|The {{contempt}} in it so nettled me <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>I</b> exclaimed: [...] "Possibly! But {{it seems}} odd that {{a lesson in}} consistency should come from YOU." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall take {{a younger}} man with me, in case {{anything}} happens. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> ma'am, <b>I</b> had thought of taking your son, if you can spare him." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> {{point of}} <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> met Strickland before I {{had been a}} {{fortnight}} in Paris.|$|R
500|$|Schulz complained {{amid the}} {{controversy}} about inaccurate reporting of his age. [...] "As a rule my age is generally given as twenty-five, when <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> am but twenty-three." [...] Schulz {{would have been}} 24 {{at the time of}} his comments.|$|E
500|$|Wanderone was a {{lover of}} animals, and was {{reported}} to have had dozens of cats and dogs simultaneously, and to have devoted {{a lot of time to}} finding homes for strays. [...] "I'm crazy about every living creature", he wrote in The Bank Shot. [...] "It doesn't matter what it happens to be. I even love insects; <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't swat a fly or a mosquito for a whole barrel of gold." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{performance}} {{in which the}} group received a request for early material, Ivey stated [...] "I'm still trying to work it out—how to follow God and still give you the old shit" [...] and introduced the group's Christian songs with self-deprecation, referring to the songs as [...] "the new, reborn, love-God Basehead stuff." [...] In a 1998 interview, Ivey stated [...] "I'm kind of wary of the Church. I know there's this whole Christian music market, but I don't think, theology-wise, I'm in agreement with {{a whole lot of}} Christians. [...] <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> don't know whether I like even being called a Christian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not to look at. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> Mary, <b>I</b> {{consider}} it a proof of your being a rational woman that you have not asked me whether it is pretty.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I expect I'd {{have been}} able to pull you out. Suppose I ought to say I'm sorry; but I'm not. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> Sadie, <b>I</b> don't quite understand--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know. She had a {{good deal}} to say for herself on that also. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> mother, <b>I</b> have taken a {{platform}} ticket for her meeting." ...|$|R
500|$|HELEN: I {{hear the}} fella owns {{a couple of}} racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.JERRY: Horses? They're like big riding dogs.ELAINE: What about ponies? What kind of {{abnormal}} animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...JERRY: I know, I hated those kids. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.MANYA: (angry) I had a pony.(The room goes dead quiet.)JERRY: Well, I didn't, uh, really mean a pony, per se...MANYA: When I {{was a little girl}} in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony... So, what's wrong with that? ...|$|E
500|$|The Waugh family {{connection}} with Midsomer Norton began when Dr Alexander Waugh, father of Arthur Waugh and grandfather of Evelyn Waugh and Alec Waugh moved to Island House, {{which had been}} built in the early 18th century, in The Island in the centre of the town in 1865. The family later moved to a house in Silver Street. As a boy, Evelyn Waugh spent his summer holidays in Midsomer Norton with his maiden aunts. He later described his visits there: “I suppose that <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> never spent longer than two months there in any year, but the place captivated my imagination as my true home never did.” ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1986, Danny Peary noted, [...] "It's hard {{to believe}} that in 1967 we {{actually}} waited in anticipation for this so-called James Bond spoof. It was a disappointment then; it's a curio today, but just as hard to get through." [...] Peary described the film as being [...] "disjointed and stylistically erratic" [...] and [...] "a testament to wastefulness in the bigger-is-better cinema," [...] before adding, [...] "It would have been a good idea to cut the picture drastically, perhaps down to the scenes featuring Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> recommend you see it on television when it's in a two-hour (including commercials) slot. Then you won't expect it to make any sense." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{understand}} it thus: “You have spoken as a conspirator; be so <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> and <b>I</b> will join you. Act on your principles, and realize {{them in a}} fact.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So beautiful, my dear lord," [...] {{she replied}} with gentle earnestness, [...] "so perfect, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> that <b>I</b> am almost afraid {{something}} must happen presently to upset it all." ...|$|R
5000|$|... (lines 8-14)--May the king, my lord, take {{cognizance}} of his servant and his city. <b>In</b> <b>fact</b> only <b>I</b> am cultivating: ah-ri-šu in Šunama, {{and only}} I am furnishing corvée workers.|$|R
500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And I was speaking in French; <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E
500|$|... was {{in trouble}} at that time {{because she had a}} couple of engagements that she didn't keep up. But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> didn't even know it when we were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. But {{they left}} soon after. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> now <b>I</b> tax myself, several homesteaders from hereabouts went. There's a boom over west, Pan, an' this here country is gettin' crowded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Napata? No, indeed. Yet, I {{have heard}} of such a place, the City of Gold they called it. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> once <b>I</b> visited it in my youth, over a hundred years ago." ...|$|R
5000|$|She later mused, [...] "I did not patent my idea. I’m a great believer {{that people}} should do it. <b>In</b> <b>fact</b> <b>in</b> 1971, <b>I</b> {{suggested}} {{that there could be}} a home laser light show, and I demonstrated it on television." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2000 Apple Records {{released}} a thirtieth anniversary {{edition of the}} album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: [...] "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort {{of getting out of}} the Beatles and just going my own way... it was a very happy occasion." [...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now." ...|$|E
500|$|Bughouse chess is {{controversial}} among chess teachers. While some instructors find beneficial learning outcomes for bughouse, most {{do not consider}} it {{to have a positive}} effect, especially for novice chess players. According to Susan Polgar, [...] "If your children want to play bughouse for fun, it is OK. But just remember that it is not chess and it has no positive value for chess. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> absolutely recommend no bughouse during a tournament." [...] Arguments supporting a negative view of bughouse include that it distorts typical chess pattern recognition and that it too heavily emphasizes tactical play at the expense of positional strategy. It also shares criticisms with speed chess in general, potentially encouraging a habit of moving too fast or playing unsoundly with the expectation that one's opponent will be moving quickly.|$|E
500|$|Often {{credited}} with using fighting and intimidation as a tactic, Shero never coached players to fight. He valued team toughness {{and insisted that}} players take the body and follow through with their checks. When it came to fighting Shero {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I swear I have never told a player to attack another player. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> have told my players if they ever hear me saying something like this, they can break a stick over my skull. I ask only that they play aggressively." [...] In an interview in the HBO documentary Broad Street Bullies Shero states that he had a team that liked fighting so he let them fight. Demonstrating his personal coaching philosophy that [...] "You have to learn to win with what you got or you don't win at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> if <b>I</b> were <b>in</b> your place, I think I'd be {{even more}} anxious. Meeting this Dunston Porter means so much to you," [...] went on the senator's son.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jefferson, though {{nobody had}} spoken, [...] "it was a daring thing. More, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> than <b>I</b> would have done. My partner has the cleanest kind of real hard sand in him." ...|$|R
50|$|James Joyce's work Finnegans Wake {{preserves}} {{something of}} the spirit of Hiberno-Latin <b>in</b> English. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> book <b>I,</b> chapter 7 of Finnegans Wake quotes bits of the Altus prosator in an untranslatable Latin passage full of toilet humour.|$|R
