30|$|Following the {{original}} approach of Olfe [46] and Modest [47] {{in case of}} radiative heat transfer, Sousa [45] made the SPH numerical modelling for the ballistic-diffusive heat conduction equation. In this method, the <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> inside the medium are split into two components: ballistic and diffusive. The ballistic component is determined from the prescribed boundary condition and/or nanoscale heat sources and it experiences only outscattering; the transport of the scattered and excited <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> inside the medium is treated as diffusive component.|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{resistance}} between a nanostructure and a half-body is calculated {{in the framework}} of particle-phonons physics. The current models approximate the nanostructure as a thermal bath. We prove that the multireflections of <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> in the nanostructure significantly increase resistance in contradiction with former predictions. This increase depends on the shape of the nanostructure and the <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> mean free path only.

50|$|In general {{there are}} two types of <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> in materials: phonons and {{electron}}s. The free electron gas found in metals is a very good conductor of heat and dominates thermal conductivity. All materials though exhibit heat transfer by phonon transport so heat flows even in dielectric materials such as silica. Interfacial thermal conductance is a measure of how efficiently <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> flow from one material to another. The lowest room temperature thermal conductance measurement to date is the Bi/Hydrogen-terminated diamond with a thermal conductance of 8.5 MW m−2 K−1. As a metal, bismuth contains many electrons which serve as the primary <b>heat</b> <b>carriers.</b> Diamond on the other hand is a very good electrical insulator (although it has a very high thermal conductivity) and so electron transport between the materials is nil. Further, these materials have very different lattice parameters so phonons do not efficiently couple across the interface. Finally, the Debye temperature between the materials is significantly different. As a result, bismuth, which has a low Debye temperature, has many phonons at low frequencies. Diamond on the other hand has a very high Debye temperature and most of its heat-carrying phonons are at frequencies much higher than are present in bismuth.|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{controversy}} on phonons or electrons being the most influenced <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> below the critical temperature of high-T_c superconductors can be resolved. Electrical and thermal properties of the same DyBa_ 2 Cu_ 3 O_ 7 -x monodomain have been measured for two highly different oxygenation levels. While the oxygenated sample DyBa_ 2 Cu_ 3 O_ 7 has very good superconducting properties (T_c= 90 K), the DyBa_ 2 Cu_ 3 O_ 6. 3 sample exhibits an insulator behavior. A careful comparison between measurements of the thermal diffusivity of both samples allows us to extract the electronic contribution. This contribution to the relaxation time of <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> is shown to be large below T_c and {{more sensitive to the}} superconducting state than the phonon contribution.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown the key role of the rigid unit modes, i. e. {{rotational}} motions between neighbouring SiO 4 tetrahedra, in glass and in béta-cristobalite due to the disorder generated by the large atomic amplitudes. They do not however reach a conclusion concerning heat conduction. To determine {{the nature of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> in the amorphous phase, we carry out an ultrashort timescale analysis of heat transfer in béta-cristobalite; the behaviour is comparable to that of amorphous silica, as shown by our density of states and heat flux autocorrelation function calculations. We prove that rigid unit modes can be identified as the <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> by showing that the thermal relaxation time is in very good agreement with the rigid unit mode relaxation time predicted in the literature. Finally, we provide thermal conductivity data for béta-cristobalite which are not available in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The value {{measured}} in the amorphous structure with the same chemical composition is often considered as a lower bound for the thermal conductivity of any material: the <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> are strongly scattered by disorder, and their lifetimes reach the minimum time scale of thermal vibrations. An appropriate design at the nano-scale, however, may allow one to reduce the thermal conductivity even below the amorphous limit. In the present contribution, using molecular-dynamics simulation and the Green-Kubo formulation, we study systematically the thermal conductivity of layered phononic materials (superlattices), by tuning different parameters that can characterize such structures. We discover {{that the key to}} reach a lower-than-amorphous thermal conductivity is to block almost completely the propagation of the <b>heat</b> <b>carriers,</b> the superlattice phonons. We demonstrate that a large mass difference in the two intercalated layers, or weakened interactions across the interface between layers result in materials with very low thermal conductivity, below the values of the corresponding amorphous counterparts...|$|R

40|$|Several novel {{laterally}} biased HELLISH (hot electron {{light emission}} and lasing in semiconductor heterostructure) devices have previously been reported and demonstrated. These {{light emitting devices}} are normally operated at high applied fields to <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> {{to a point where}} they can transfer into the quantum well via tunnelling or thermionic emission. However, it has been observed that, in most devices, light emission occurs at relatively low applied fields. In this region, the fields are too low for significant <b>heating</b> of <b>carriers.</b> Therefore, the mechanism for light emission in this region cannot be explained by hot electron effects.

40|$|No simple {{theoretical}} approach {{is able to}} provide the thermal behavior at <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> frequencies since individual phonon modes are excited.

40|$|There {{has been}} much recent {{interest}} in heat transport in nanostructures and, separately, in the structure, growth and properties of biological materials. The present work brings these topics together. Large reductions in thermal conductivity, in comparison to bulk materials, have been observed in materials structured at the nanoscale level. These reductions are attributed {{to a combination of}} classical and quantum size effects that manifest themselves when the characteristic length scales in the nanostructured material become comparable to, or shorter than, the mean free path of the <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> in the bulk material [1]. In semiconductors and insulators the primary (or only, in the case of insulators) <b>heat</b> <b>carriers</b> are the lattice vibrations (i. e. phonons) and most of the heat is carried by phonons with mean free paths in the range of 1 – 100 nm at room temperature [2]. Thus, size effects on heat transport become important in nanostructured materials. Biominerals (e. g. bones, shells, teeth) are known to exhibit excellent mechanical properties. They are natural composite materials with complex hierarchical structures, organized from the nanoscale up to the macroscale. The structure of elephant ivory has been described previousl...|$|R
