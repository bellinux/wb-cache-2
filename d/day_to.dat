Eight, thirty and twenty fullsibs progenies in three different maize varieties was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with replicate thrice in three rows of three meter length. Analysis of variance showed that Azam was highly significant for <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis, <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking and grain yield. Similarly, Pahari and Iqbal showed highly significant difference for <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis, <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking, <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity and grain yield.

Correlation of Azam showed that <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking observed highly significant while <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with anthesis to silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference. Correlations of Pahari showed that <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking; grain yield with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity observed highly significant but grain yield with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking observed significant difference. Correlation analysis of Iqbal showed that <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking showed highly significant while anthesis to silking interval (ASI) with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with anthesis to silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference. This was concluded that Azam shall be included in future maize breeding program because of their short duration between <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The main {{breeding}} {{objective in}} drylands was drought resistance and used criterion was grain yield in the stress condition. Traits that {{were correlated with}} the grain yield may be useful for indirect selection. Negative significant correlation was obtained only between <b>days</b> <b>to</b> heading and thousand kernel weight in facultative types. In the spring types of durum wheat, <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity, grain filling period, plant height and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> heading {{were the most important}} traits for increasing grain yield, respectively. In the facultative types, <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity, plant height, grain filling period and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> heading were important but in winter types only numbers of <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity had positive significant correlation with grain yield. Path coefficient analysis revealed a strong direct effect of <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity on grain yield. However, higher DM with higher DH may interact with hot and dry weather during critical reproductive stage thus reduce grain yield of durum wheat under cold dryland condition...|$|R

The results showed significant differences among the varieties (P ≥ 0. 01) for all the phenological stages including <b>days</b> <b>to</b> germination, <b>days</b> <b>to</b> rosette completion, <b>days</b> <b>to</b> initiation of stem elongation, <b>days</b> <b>to</b> flowering initiation, pod formation stage and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity. The spring varieties Sarigol (PF 7045 / 91), Hyola 42 and SYN 1 and autumnal varieties Alice, Eurol, Fornax, VDH 8003 - 98, Consul, Licord and Zarfam (Regent× Cobra), showed early maturity. On the other hand, Mohican, Olara, Colvert, L- 1 and Akamar were late mature varieties. In fact, the most prolific varieties, DP. 94. 8, Zarfam (Regent ×Cobra) Cocktail, Consul and SLM 046 (control variety) had the highest ability survive in the cold conditions and they completed their rosette stage sooner than the other varieties. There was positive and significant correlation between duration of pod formation stage and seed yield.
