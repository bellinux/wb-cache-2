Particular attention {{is given to}} how specific {{issues such as the}} adoption of computerized <b>administrative</b> <b>documents</b> and/or, more generally, the adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for administrative activities may affect the validity of computerized <b>administrative</b> <b>documents</b> by the Administration Judge. This study briefly examines the complex and multifaceted legal and regulatory framework concerning administrative procedures and digital administration, Law no. 241 / 1990 as amended in the following years, the Code of Digital Administration (Law Decree no. 82 / 2005) and the recently introduced legal provisions which have considerably encouraged the long-awaited creation of a “Digital Italy” (Law Decree no. 5 / 2012; Law Decree no. 83 / 2012 and Law Decree no. 179 / 2012). This paper analyzes the fundamental models for the implementation of administrative actions (ex parte and ex officio applications) and the specific features of their different steps (start of procedure, taking of evidence, participation of an individual to the electronic procedure, decision-making stage) in light of the use of information technologies. Particular attention is paid to the decision-making stage of an electronic proceeding, also to the purpose of investigating defects and jurisdictional validity of an electronic proceeding. In this respect the two methods for using the ICT were briefly examined, the one whereby the ICT role concerns the many operations and formalities aimed at the adoption of the final document, subject to the officer’s will to accept the administrative decision, and the one whereby the final document is adopted by means of a software program. The limits of the possibility to elaborate the content of <b>administrative</b> <b>documents</b> are also examined. Illegality aspects of <b>electronic</b> <b>administrative</b> proceedings and pathologies of automated <b>administrative</b> <b>documents</b> are specially investigated. Special attention is paid to formal defects and to those defects concerning the signature of <b>electronic</b> <b>administrative</b> documents: signature of an electronic document printed on paper; lack and disavowal of a signature. This research also examines the possibility to apply traditional legal defects (lack of jurisdiction, abuse of power, infringement of the law) to the specific area of computerized <b>administrative</b> <b>documents...</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>administrative</b> <b>document</b> in Yüan China {{was widely}} used among {{government}} organizations including those for religious affairs. The different official rank {{of the administration}} decided the different style, pattern {{and nature of the}} <b>administrative</b> <b>document.</b> The top Taoist management in Yüan China was Academy of Scholarly Worthies 集賢院, which operated three subsidiary bodies : the Taoist Administration (諸路道敎所), the Jiangnan Taoist Administration (江南諸路道敎所) and the Jianghuai-Jingxiang Taoist Administration (江淮荊襄道敎總攝所). They were respectively supported by Quanzhen, Xuan and Zhengyi sect of Taoism. Under the supervision of these administrations, there were lots of territorial Taoist registries such as Dao-lu si (道錄司), Dao-zheng si (道正司) and Wei-yi si (威儀司) throughout the empire. The Taoist administrations at all levels had their own official ranks correspond to the government organizations, which forms the applying basis of the <b>administrative</b> <b>document</b> in Taoist area. Official Permit over Chengtian Taoist Temple (承天觀公據) and Inscription of Decree on Hereditary Abbot of Lingying Taoist Temple (靈應觀甲乙住持劄付碑) are the detailed Taoist <b>administrative</b> <b>document</b> we have ever seen. By analysis of the content, we can see how the system of <b>administrative</b> <b>document</b> was used in Taoist area in Yüan China.

The right cannot be exercised if the document concerns the private or family lives of others, or if the document's confidentiality is safeguarded by specific legal provisions. Furthermore, the public body can refuse access if the document refers to discussions in the Cabinet, or if accessing the document can seriously hamper criminal or administrative violation investigations carried out by judicial, police, or military authorities.|$|R
