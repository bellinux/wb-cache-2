In all aspects of human life, especially in business activity, the application of ICT is so strong that in near future, the world will witness inevitability of this technology in most of the daily issues. Regardless of its technological advantages in the areas of increasing speed, accuracy, ease and dramatic reduction of transaction or processing costs, many challenges and application barriers are continuously faced by its users. Concerns such as users ’ privacy breaches, ensuring the accuracy, original identification of the buyers and sellers, confidentiality provision cause discomfort and distress an individual during cyberspace transaction or deal. And the achievement of the desired level of confidence in the abilities and capabilities of the other side and performance endanger the system. The increased level of awareness and the security culture of the cyberspace application enhance relative peace of an individual while being in the virtual space or in the process of e-commerce. The resulting comfort helps a person to identify and belief in the capabilities of the opposite side or system and their adherence to the commercial, behavioral, legal and technical principles connected to right deals.

These are the foundations which insure the internet organized activities, increasing the efficiency of transacting parties. For these transactions, system security must be provided and create the necessary ground for mutual trust between the parties, trust towards the system operation, as well as trust towards the relevant product, brand or service[1]. In Internet or electronic environment the trust concept is represented as ‘e-trust or <b>electronic</b> <b>trust</b> ’ formulation. The E-Trust, whose concept is the willingness of the truster (one party) to accept the risks and vulnerability against an internet vendor based on positive expectations about the characteristics and future behaviors of the trustee (other party), is created with difficulties for an online seller[1].

40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to investigate the relationship of online subcultures, <b>electronic</b> <b>trust,</b> electronic word-of-mouth, and purchase intention towards a special event within selected Facebook Pages. Background: Given the increasing impact of social media platforms in communications not only between consumers, but also consumers and companies, this study takes a deeper look at the influence that companies can exercise on consumer’s purchase intention for a special event through these platforms. The background is based on previous researches and existent theories related to products, which are tested for a special event. Method: In order to fulfill {{the purpose of this}} study  a cross-sectional design is applied. A deductive approach is followed, and a quantitative method is used through the application of questionnaires in order to collect the empirical data necessary to answer  the given research questions. The questionnaires were distributed to the selected sample, which is anyone who “likes” the following Facebook Pages: Sweden Rock Festival, Göteborg Horse Show, Hultsfred, and Swedish Speedway Grand Prix.

40|$|Advances in web-based {{oriented}} {{technologies and}} services are taking place with a considerable speed around the world. New technologies have significantly influenced trade, and converted traditional commerce to e-Commerce. Modern commerce enables people to conduct business in their offices or at homes, with minimal time, cost, error, and maximum efficiency. Customer trust, satisfaction and loyalty play vital roles in {{the success or failure}} of e-Commerce. It is also clear that loyal customers are one of the most important assets of firms, which results in long-term benefits. In this research, three problems were addressed. Firstly, companies easily lose their e-Customers in the competitive environment of today‘s business (Internet). Secondly, gaining loyal customers takes a long time, and is high in cost. Thirdly, there are inactive and nonprofitable customers in the database of online companies; converting inactive and nonprofitable customers to active and profitable customers by increasing their trust, satisfaction and loyalty. These three basic problems encourage us to study the nature of e-Loyalty formation in e-Commerce. The main aim of this study is to answer the question of how firms can increase <b>Electronic</b> <b>Trust</b> (e-Trust), Electronic Satisfaction (e-Satisfaction) and Electronic Loyalty (e-Loyalty) among their e-Customers. A review of literature and interviews with experts in this domain revealed that e-Satisfaction and e-Trust are two important factors that influence e-Loyalty. The significant aspect of this research is derived from the inclusion of a comprehensive conceptual framework with different aspects of technology, organization, and customers (three main entities in e-Commerce). Nine hypotheses display the relationships between technological, organizational, and customer factors with e-Satisfaction and e-Trust, which is significantly influence e- Loyalty. The data for this study were collected from e-Customers of the largest retail company in Iran in 2011, and statistical analyses were used to validate and ensure the reliability of the proposed model. The results showed the relationship between technological, organizational and customer factors with e-Satisfaction, e-Trust, and finally, e-Loyalty. The findings also revealed the fact that technological factor has the most effect on e-Satisfaction, e-Trust and e-Loyalty. Furthermore, Artificial Neural Fuzzy Interface System (ANFIS) was utilized to estimate e-Loyalty based on e- Satisfaction and e-Trust as assessment of the results. The outcomes showed a slight iii difference between the prediction of ANFIS and e-Loyalty data. The results of both methods (statistical analysis and ANFIS) confirm the reliability of the model. This research sheds some light on the formation of e-Loyalty in e-Commerce and can be useful for academics and practitioners...|$|E
