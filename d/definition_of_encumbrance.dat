The article introduces the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> and easement, all its properties and categories, because a proper understanding of all easement affections leads to better valuation. The basic principles of easement valuation focused on steps of easement valuation are also described in this article.

State registration <b>of</b> restrictions and <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> the rights on land spot is a mean {{to protect the}} rights of holders of material rights on land spot and people for whom those rights are encumbranced or restricted. The current legislation, unfortunately, does not regulate explicitly the registration restrictions and <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> land rights. The objective of this article is the analysis of existing system of state registration <b>of</b> restrictions and <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> land rights and provision of propositions for the improvement of national legislation in this area. Studying the legal nature of the categories <b>of</b> ?restrictions? and ?<b>encumbrances?</b> <b>of</b> land rights the author supports the position of scholars who consider them as different legal categories. <b>Encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> land rights arise from another person?s rights on land and are established to ensure the interests of third parties in this land spot, while restrictions of land rights ? is narrowing the limits of subjective law, which does not follow from the rights of another person. While studying the issue it is found out that only restrictions established by a contract or court decision and under paragraph 2 of the Article 111 of the Land Code of Ukraine should be registered. Besides, information about material rights for strange property that encumbrance land spots, and information about other <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> the rights on land spots are submitted to various sections of the State Register of the Rights on Real Estate. In the conclusion the author has stressed on the need to improve legislation in the sphere of state registration <b>of</b> restrictions and <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> land rights. Firstly, there is a need for a legislative <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> the concepts <b>of</b> ?restrictions? and ?<b>encumbrances?</b> <b>of</b> land rights; secondly, there should be a list <b>of</b> <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> land rights, which are subject to state registration. ???????? ?????? ???? ???????????????? ? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ?????, ??????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???? ?? ????????? ???????. ???????? ?????????? ??????? ????????????? ? ????????????? ???? ?? ?????. ?????????? ???? ??????????? ???? ?? ????????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ??????????????? ???????????...|$|R

In estimating the free residue in an estate, the surplus in value of immovable property over the amount of mortgage bonds thereon may be included in such estimate.|$|R
50|$|Clear {{title is}} the phrase used {{to state that}} the owner of real {{property}} owns it free and clear <b>of</b> <b>encumbrances.</b> In a more limited sense, {{it is used to}} state that, although the owner does not own clear title, it is nevertheless within the power of the owner to convey clear title. For example, a property may be encumbered by a mortgage. This encumbrance means that no one has clear title to the property. However, standard terms in a mortgage require the mortgage holder to release the mortgage if {{a certain amount of money}} is paid. Therefore, a buyer with enough money to satisfy both the mortgage and the current owner can get clear title.|$|R

If the lien is not redeemed, the investor would only receive 95% ownership of the property with the remaining 5% owned by the original owner. In practice, few investors will bid on liens for less than full right to the property or sale proceeds. Therefore, with multiple owners bidding on 100% encumbrance, the process then generally reverts to a tiebreaker method such as random selection. (States that use this method include Iowa) ...|$|R

Alternative AEDs feature compactness, high efficiency, modularity, and better electronic control by inverter, but advantages and limits must be evaluated. High torque/redundancy requirements need special designs. Two plant types are analyzed: mooring/anchor capstans and rudder steering gears. Commercial AEDs are considered, besides a new permanent-magnet linear motor under development suitable for rudder/fin direct drive application.
