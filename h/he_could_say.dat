25|$|Sampras did {{not compete}} in any tour {{events in the}} {{following}} 12 months, {{but he did not}} officially announce his retirement until August 2003, just prior to the US Open. He chose not to defend his title there, but his retirement announcement was timed so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> farewell at a special ceremony organized for him at the Open. At the time of his retirement, many regarded Sampras as the greatest player of all time.|$|E
25|$|Richard Blandy, a constable, gave {{evidence}} {{that he had been}} coming from Drury-Lane house and that as he came by the piazzas in Covent Garden he heard two pistol shots and then heard somebody say two people were killed. Approaching, he saw the surgeon had Hackman and a pistol in his hand. A Mr Mahon had given Blandy the pistol and asked him {{to take care of the}} prisoner and to take him to Mahon's house. The prisoner was bloody, wounded in the head, and very faint. When Blandy came to the corner by the Red Lion, the door was shut, and he was then asked to take the prisoner back to the Shakspeare tavern, where Mr Mahon was. Blandy searched the prisoner's pocket and found two letters, which he gave to Mr Campbell, master of the Shakspeare tavern. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> nothing else about the letters.|$|E
25|$|No other {{candidates}} were proposed and the Returning Officer called for Dyer {{to give a}} speech to the electors regarding what he would advocate for and his goals if he became the Member of Parliament for Bruce. However, before Dyer made his speech John Hardy stepped in and asked if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> some words as Henry Clapcott's representative, an action opposed by other electors. Hardy said that in reply to some observations by J. L. Gillies regarding the state of the province of Otago without a treasurer— he would then also like to nominate Marryatt—who was himself an elector for the by-election. The observations were concerning the fact that Clapcott would be forced to resign as Treasurer to take up his role as MP for Bruce. Marryatt had opposed the stepping in of Hardy, without a clue that he would be nominated for the role. Laughingly, J. L. Gillies seconded that nomination. However, Gillies said that an elector may only nominate one person for a role at an election. The Returning Officer then justified that an elector may nominate as many people as they like. Returning the compliment, Marryatt nominated Hardy for the role, seconded by George E. Brown. However, the Returning Officer took no notice of the nominations, stating that it was immature of the electors to make a joke on such a serious duty. Multiple electors then said that some fun at an election was expected, a stance which the Returning Officer disagreed with.|$|E

500|$|Lansford Hastings {{received}} death threats. An emigrant {{who crossed}} before the Donner Party confronted Hastings {{about the difficulties}} they had encountered, reporting: [...] "Of course <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> nothing {{but that he was}} very sorry, and that he meant well".|$|E
500|$|He started {{alongside}} Hall of Fame center Dave Cowens, {{who enjoyed}} playing with Washington, remarking, [...] "It's great fun, {{you can always}} hear him grunt when he's rebounding." [...] Auerbach said, [...] "Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> or do {{was going to change}} the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E
500|$|Brooks was {{fearful of}} the {{attention}} Oscar success would bring as he would be [...] "deprived of a low profile", finding it [...] "hard {{to work with the}} spotlight shining in your eyes." [...] He added: [...] "There's a danger of being seduced into being self-conscious, of being aware of your 'career'. That can be lethal." [...] He also grew more concerned of the [...] "threatening" [...] corporate influence into the film industry at the expense of [...] "the idea of the creative spirit". He channeled this ambivalence into Broadcast News. As a romantic comedy, Brooks felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> [...] "something new ... with that form" [...] adding [...] "One of the things you're supposed to do {{every once in a while}} as a filmmaker is capture time and place. I was just glad there was some way to do it in a comedy." [...] He cast William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks in the three main roles.|$|E

500|$|Comet was a pulp {{magazine}} which published five {{issues from}} December 1940 to July 1941. [...] It was edited by F. Orlin Tremaine, who had edited Astounding Stories, {{one of the}} leaders of the science fiction magazine field, for several years in the mid-1930s. [...] Tremaine paid one cent per word, which was higher than some of the competing magazines, but the publisher, H-K Publications, was unable to sustain the magazine while it gained circulation, and it was cancelled after less than a year when Tremaine resigned. [...] Comet published fiction by several well-known and popular writers, including E.E. Smith and Robert Moore Williams. [...] The young Isaac Asimov, visiting Tremaine in Comets offices, was alarmed when Tremaine asserted that anyone who gave stories to competing magazines for no pay should be blacklisted; Asimov promptly insisted that Donald Wollheim, to whom he had given a free story, should make him a token payment so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> he had been paid.|$|E
500|$|The police {{inspectors}} questioned Feletti, {{but each}} time they asked about {{anything to do with}} Mortara or his removal the monk said that a sacred oath precluded his discussing affairs of the Holy Office. When Curletti ordered him to hand over all files relating to the Mortara case, Feletti said that they had been burned—when asked when or how, he repeated that on Holy Office matters <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> nothing. Pressed further, Feletti said: [...] "As far as the activities that I carried out as Inquisitor of the Holy Office of Bologna, I am obliged to explain myself to one forum only, to the Supreme Sacred Congregation in Rome, whose Prefect is His Holiness Pope Pius IX, and to no-one else." [...] After the police searched the convent for documents relating to the Mortara case—they found nothing—the inquisitor was escorted to prison. The news that Feletti had been arrested caused the press storm surrounding Mortara, which had died down somewhat, to flare up again across Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Perence Shiri is {{a cousin}} of President Robert Mugabe. [...] He has called himself Black Jesus, because {{according}} to an anonymous claim on BBC Panorama documentary [...] "The Price of Silence", he [...] "could determine your life like Jesus Christ.

2500|$|At a July 27, 2009, press briefing, {{radio talk}} show host Bill Press asked Gibbs if there was {{anything}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> to make the issue go away. Gibbs answered, [...] "No. I mean, the God's honest truth is no," [...] because [...] "nothing will assuage" [...] those who continue to pursue what he called [...] "made-up, fictional nonsense" [...] despite the evidence that Obama had already provided.|$|E
2500|$|Furtwängler {{was famous}} for his {{exceptional}} inarticulacy when speaking about music. His pupil Sergiu Celibidache remembered that the best <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> was, [...] "Well, just listen" [...] (to the music). Carl Brinitzer from the German BBC service tried to interview him, and thought he had an imbecile before him. A live recording of a rehearsal with a Stockholm orchestra documents hardly anything intelligible, only hums and mumbling. On the other hand, a collection of his essays, On Music, reveals deep thought.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{story about}} a time he was sharing a room on tour with one of the Bedser twins. Returning to the hotel late one night, {{probably}} slightly worse for wear he approached reception to ask for his key. Now the touring England team were reported widely in the newspapers, and were recognisable to many people, and so he was not entirely surprised that before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> anything the receptionist, asked [...] "Bed, sir?" [...] Jack replied, [...] "No, Crapp", only for the receptionist to point him to the gents.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1951, the American diplomat Averell Harriman went to Iran to {{negotiate}} an Anglo-Iranian compromise, asking the Shah's help; his reply was that [...] "in {{the face of}} public opinion, {{there was no way}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> a word against nationalisation". Harriman held a press conference in Tehran, calling for reason and enthusiasm in confronting the [...] "nationalisation crisis". As soon as he spoke, a journalist rose and shouted: [...] "We and the Iranian people all support Premier Mosaddegh and oil nationalisation!" [...] Everyone present began cheering and then marched out of the room; the abandoned Harriman shook his head in dismay.|$|E

Hopefully this win and everything getting ready to start with the Chase is going to put all the pieces together, and I think everybody has been working hard to do that." [...] In regards to the double burnout he did with Tony Stewart following the race, he said he [...] "wanted him to go on a victory lap with so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to all the fans here at Bristol but that was pretty cool doing some burnouts with him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brian, MI-13, and S.H.I.E.L.D. began {{investigating}} a suspected return of Mys-Tech {{but he was}} swiftly beaten down and captured by Death's Head II. This was actually a ruse by Death's Head II to plant a tracking device and find out why the Psycho-Wraiths wanted the captain (he didn't bother to tell Brian). The Prime Wraith wanted the hero {{to be part of}} six living batteries for a monotrace core, opening a portal to Hell for Mephisto's armies (led by the brainwashed hero Killpower) to ravage the Earth. Captain Britain was freed and fought to hold back the demons, and tried to find a solution other than killing Killpower. [...] "We're heroes, we don't --" [...] was all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> before Killpower was gunned down by the anti-heroes Major Hauer, Death's Head, and Colonel Liger. Afterwards, on a whim Captain Britain placed a union flag on top of a damaged Big Ben, deciding that surviving the battle gave them [...] "the right to celebrate a little" ...|$|E
2500|$|Chief American Horse was a {{delegate}} to many peace conferences in Washington. During the tumultuous times from 1865 to 1877, [...] American Horse advocated yielding {{to the government}} at any cost, being no doubt convinced of the uselessness of resistance. This quelled the people {{for the time being}} and up to the killing of Crazy Horse. [...] In the crisis precipitated by this event, American Horse was again influential and energetic in the cause of the government. [...] From this time on he became an active participant in the affairs of the Teton Sioux. [...] He was always noted for his eloquence, which was nearly always conciliatory, yet <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> very sharp things of the duplicity of the whites. [...] He had much ease of manner and was a master of repartee. [...] I recall his saying that ”if you have got to wear golden slippers to enter the white man’s heaven no Indian will ever get there, as the whites have got the Black Hills and with them all the gold.” “His record as a councilor of his people and his policy in the new situation that confronted them was manly and consistent.” ...|$|E

However, after a talk with her dad she thinks that Oliver will move on and so will Lilly but when Lilly announces that she {{is in love with}} Oliver, Miley ends up telling her the truth. Lilly and Miley hatch a plan to get Oliver back but only to find out that he was practicing saying [...] "I love you" [...] so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> it to Lilly. They both say that they love each other in the end of the episode. (It is mentioned in this episode that neither Oliver nor Miley have romantic feelings for each other). However, Oliver did used to have romantic feelings towards Hannah Montana before he knew she was Miley. Miley,at first, didn't want to tell him who she was, just in case he had romantic feelings for her as Miley, but when she eventually told him, he saw her as just a friend.|$|E
