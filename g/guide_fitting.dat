40|$|Internal {{fixation}} {{techniques are}} in common used to stabilize vertebral fractures and correct severe scoliosis. Consolidation of injured vertebrae with neighbouring intact vertebra {{is the goal}} in the former case whilst fusion of the vertebrae in a corrected position is aimed at in the latter case. Degenerative spine diseases are not considered in this paper. Classical instrumentation consists of rods (e. g., Cotrel-Dubousset, Harrington, Luque-Galveston) attached to the bone by means of hooks or wires. More recently, transpedicular screws are introduced as an alternative bone/implant interface. Comparing the results of several studies, the posterior pedicle screw based devices demonstrate the ability to produce the most rigid constructs. However, the insertion of pedicle screws implicates a relatively high complication risk and its success strongly depends {{on the experience of}} the surgeon. Incorrect drilled holes or malplacement of the screws can result in nerve root injuries and fracture of the pedicle. Studies reported complication ratios up to 30 % with substantial neurological implications. A certain degree of automation of the critical actions may be necessary to enhance the safety of pedicle screw insertion. Two techniques of computer assisted spine surgery are compared. Both techniques permit a computer assisted surgical planning based on CT images. During operation the first system permanently observes the position of the drill relative to the spine and informs the surgeon on the deviation of the actual drill path to the planned drill path. The second system uses a pre-operative surgical planning to design and construct a mechanical drill <b>guide,</b> <b>fitting</b> perfectly on the patient's spine. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Most reports {{regarding}} infrainguinal bypass {{surgical procedures}} demonstrate benefits well but pay {{less attention to}} adverse outcomes and consequences of failure for the patient. For a wider scope of infrainguinal bypass surgical procedures, we evaluated patient-oriented outcomes of limb loss occurring after failed infrainguinal bypass operations. Methods: Eighty-one patients with vascular amputations were identified in a retrospective study. Follow-up was complete {{with a mean of}} 3. 6 years. Life-table and multivariate analyses were used to assess factors influencing the desired outcome goals of rehabilitation. Mortality rates, social function, risk of contralateral amputation, and the ability to walk were used to measure the late outcome. Results: The long-term survival rate was poor (72 % at 1 year; 53 % at 3 years) and was not related to traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis. Moreover the risk for contralateral amputation was 10 % per year. One year after amputation 81 % (47 of 58) of the surviving amputees were walking independently, and 73 % (42 of 58) were living at home, 32 with their spouse. At 3 years these results were 73 % (27 of 37) and 78 % (29 of 37), respectively. In addition, the level of self-care changed significantly (p < 0. 001) after amputation. Advanced age (older than 65 years), self-care performance, and living with someone were important predictors of late outcome. Conclusions: It is possible for a high percentage of patients with vascular amputations to return home successfully, either walking or in a wheelchair. Moreover this result can be predicted based on preoperative clinical variables. These data may be helpful to <b>guide</b> <b>fitting</b> of prosthetic devices, planning of discharge home, and use of health care resources. (J VASC SURG 1995; 21 : 613 - 22. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel {{probabilistic}} approach for fitting a sta-tistical model to an image. A 3 D Morphable Model (3 DMM) of faces is {{interpreted as a}} generative (Top-Down) Bayesian model. Random Forests are used as noisy detectors (Bottom-Up) for the face and facial landmark positions. The Top-Down and Bottom-Up parts are then combined us-ing a Data-Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method (DDMCMC). As core of the integration, we use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm which has two main advantages. First, the algorithm can handle unreliable de-tections and therefore does not need the detectors to take an early and possible wrong hard decision before fitting. Second, it is open for integra-tion of various cues to <b>guide</b> the <b>fitting</b> process. Based on the proposed approach, we implemented a completely automatic, pose and illumina-tion invariant face recognition application.

To test {{the usefulness of the}} method in refining atomic structures within cryoEM density we incorporated it into our flexible fitting protocol (Flex-EM). Our benchmark includes 13 pairs of protein structures in two conformations each, one of which is represented by a corresponding cryoEM map. Refining the structures in simulated and experimental maps at the 5 - 15 Å resolution range using rigid bodies identified by RIBFIND shows a significant improvement over using individual SSEs as rigid bodies. For the 15 Å resolution simulated maps, using RIBFIND-based rigid bodies improves the initial fits by 40. 64 % on average, as compared to 26. 52 % when using individual SSEs. Furthermore, for some test cases we show that at the sub-nanometer resolution range the fits can be further improved by applying a two-stage refinement protocol (using RIBFIND-based refinement followed by an SSE-based refinement).

The hENM segments electron density maps into meaningful protein subregions Chennubhotla & Bahar 2006, and finds a simplified representation of the map in each level of the hierarchy. When implemented on maps in the 2010 Cryo-EM Modeling Challenge, hENM segmented the molecules into individual proteins and regions without manual input. For example, hENM identified the apical and equatorial domains of the 14 groEL proteins in the 23. 5 A groEL-groES map (EMD: 1046). These results suggest that hENM {{could be applied to}} segment density maps which otherwise would require manual curating.

Such designs, called dis-tributed ILP, require that a program be correspondingly par-titioned to execute on sucn an architecture. The quality of this partition is important as it greatly influences the ulti-mate performance of the system. The search space of possi-ble partitions is exponentially large, necessitating a heuristic search. In practice, simulation is much too slow to use as a guide for the heuristic, and an analytical model is more ap-propriate. In this paper we develop a framework for constructing models of distributed ILP systems and present an analyti-cal model for one such system: WaveScalar.

The predictions of the resulting model show a-. 85 correlation with actual performance.

The approach is based on a probabilistic deformable surface registration framework coupled with a bone binding energy. The former makes soft assignments between the model and the observations while the latter <b>guides</b> the skeleton <b>fitting.</b> The main benefit of this strategy lies in its ability to handle outliers and erroneous observations frequently present in multi view data.
