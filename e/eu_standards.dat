5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E

25|$|When Portugal {{emerged from}} years of {{dictatorship}} and the Carnation Revolution's turmoil in 1974, the level of access to services, the technologies used and the service quality were far from optimal. In particular, most municipal wastewater was discharged without any treatment at that time. However, substantial improvements have been achieved since then, in particular after Portugal's adhesion to the European Community (now the European Union) in 1986 which was accompanied by the gradual introduction of <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> and financing by the European Investment Bank, the introduction of multi-municipal utilities and the holding company Águas de Portugal in 1993, {{and the creation of}} a regulatory agency for the sector in 2000.|$|E
25|$|The late 20th century {{saw another}} period of {{domestic}} upheaval {{with the military}} coup known as the Carnation Revolution. Eventually military rule gave way to Portugal's transition to democracy which led to Portugal's entry into the European Union in 1986. Admission into the EU has had an immense impact on the Portuguese wine industry. In order to comply with <b>EU</b> <b>standards,</b> many of the country's monopolistic legislation that unfairly benefited co-operatives were overturned. Smaller growers and wine producers received {{millions of dollars of}} subsidies and grants from the EU to improve their vineyards and winemaking facilities. The stability brought by democracy and the European Union also encouraged more foreign investments, which brought expansions and upgrades of winemaking technology and know how to Portugal. The Portuguese appellation system of Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) was also upgraded to be more in line with its French, Italian and Spanish counterparts.|$|E

25|$|The lack of {{wastewater}} treatment {{in some cities}} and towns discharging wastewater into sensitive areas is another matter of concern. In January 2008 the European Commission sent France a final warning alerting it {{that it will be}} taken to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for the second time and possibly face fines unless it quickly brings its waste water treatment up to <b>EU</b> <b>standards.</b> France is not complying with the 1991 EU directive on urban waste water treatment. The deadline for treating all wastewater covered by the directive was 31 December 2000. In 2004 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) condemned France for failing to designate eleven areas as sensitive and for inadequate treatment facilities in a number of settlements which discharge their waste waters into these areas. The ECJ also found that 121 settlements breached the directive by discharging their waste waters into previously designated sensitive areas. In 2006 France designated the eleven areas as sensitive. However, 140 settlements – including the city of Paris – continue to discharge into these sensitive areas. With regard to the 121 settlements discharging into the previously designated sensitive areas France proceeded to rearrange them into 164 settlements, resulting in some settlements no longer meeting the threshold level of 10,000 residents at which the directive applies. The Commission considers such rearranging of settlements to avoid compliance with the directive unacceptable. In November 2009 it referred the matter to the ECJ.|$|E

2500|$|The UK {{has about}} 73,000 goats, mostly as milk producers; this number is {{relatively}} small by <b>EU</b> <b>standards.</b> [...] Venison production in the UK is mainly from red deer, with a few fallow deer as well, but {{there are only about}} 300 venison-producing farms. As noted above, there are about 26,500 farms with chickens. [...] However, more than half the UK's eggs come from fewer than 400 flocks, mostly with more than 50,000 birds each. [...] Other livestock and poultry farmed on a smaller scale include game birds, ducks, geese, turkeys, ostriches and rabbits. In this way, the UK produce annually 22 millions turkeys.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- An {{investigation}} on quality parameters of honey collected from mustard, litchi and sundarban (multiflora) flora of Bangladesh was undertaken {{to compare with}} European Union (<b>EU)</b> quality <b>standard</b> viz., moisture content, electric conductivity, specific rotation, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content, invertase content, antibiotic content and sulfonamides content. Sundarban honey (multifloral) (17. 7 g/ 100 g) and mustard honey (19. 5 g/ 100 g) were found in standard moisture condition and the litchi honey was found above the limit of <b>EU</b> <b>standard</b> (20 g/ 100 g). All the honey samples {{were found in the}} <b>EU</b> <b>standard</b> limit in terms of electrical conductivity and specific rotation. The HMF content was found higher (200. 5 mg/kg) in sundarban sample and no HMF was observed in the litchi honey. Highest invertase activity (99 IU/kg) was found in the litchi honey where as mustard and sundarban honey showed very low invertase activity with 2. 0 IU/kg and 0. 0 IU/kg respectively which was far below than <b>EU</b> <b>standard</b> (50 IU/kg). All the samples had shown negative reaction with tetrasensor and sulfasensor. So, it may be concluded that the honey from sundarban was highly overheated. On the other hand, the mustard and litchi honey were overheated and not heated respectively. Sundarban and mustard honey had failed to reach the quality <b>standard</b> to the <b>EU.</b> But litchi honey was found to met the all the EU quality requirements except the moisture content...|$|R

2500|$|Thujone, once widely {{believed}} to be an active chemical in absinthe, is a GABA antagonist; and while it can produce muscle spasms in large doses, {{there is no direct}} evidence to suggest it causes hallucinations. Past reports estimated thujone concentrations in absinthe as being up to 260mg/kg. More recently, published scientific analyses of samples of various original absinthes have disproved previous estimates, and demonstrated that only a trace of the thujone present in wormwood actually makes it into a properly distilled absinthe when historical methods and materials are employed to create the spirit. [...] As such, most traditionally crafted absinthes, both vintage and modern, fall within the current <b>EU</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Johnson made {{no major}} {{changes to the}} mayoral system as {{developed}} by Livingstone. He did, however, reverse a number of measures implemented by Livingstone's administration, ending the city's oil deal with Venezuela, abolishing The Londoner newsletter, and scrapping the half yearly inspections of black cabs, although the latter were reinstated three years later. Abolishing the western wing of the congestion charging zone, he cancelled plans to increase the congestion charge for four-wheel drives. He was subsequently accused of failing to publish an independent report on air pollution commissioned by the Greater London authority. [...] The report, available in 2013, showed London had been in breach of levels of diesel nitrogen dioxide levels since 2010 in areas affecting 433 primary schools. Poor areas, such as Newham, Hackney, and Tower Hamlets, were on average more polluted than more affluent areas and nearly 6,000 Londoners die annually from nitrogen dioxide levels above <b>EU</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In farms using cages for egg production, {{there are}} more birds per unit area; this allows for greater {{productivity}} and lower food costs. [...] Floor space ranges upwards from 300cm2 per hen. <b>EU</b> <b>standards</b> in 2003 called for at least 550cm2 per hen. In the US, the current recommendation by the United Egg Producers is 67 to 86 in2 (430 to 560cm2) per bird. The space available to battery hens has often been described as less than {{the size of a}} piece of A4 paper. Animal welfare scientists have been critical of battery cages because they do not provide hens with sufficient space to stand, walk, flap their wings, perch, or make a nest, and it is widely considered that hens suffer through boredom and frustration through being unable to perform these behaviours. [...] This can lead {{to a wide range of}} abnormal behaviours, some of which are injurious to the hens or their cagemates.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2013, the Turkish {{parliament}} {{passed a}} law that permits use of the Kurdish language in the courts, albeit with restrictions. The law was passed by votes of the ruling AKP and the pro-Kurdish rights opposition party BDP, against criticism from the secularist CHP party and the nationalist MHP, with MHP and CHP deputies nearly coming to blows with BDP deputies over the law. In spite of their support in the parliament, the BDP was critical of the provision in the law that the defendants {{will pay for the}} translation fees and that the law applies only to spoken defense in court but not to a written defense or the pre-trial investigation. According to one source [...] the law does not comply with <b>EU</b> <b>standards.</b> Deputy prime minister of Turkey Bekir Bozdağ replied to criticism of the law from both sides saying that the fees of defendants who does not speak Turkish will be paid by the state, while, those who speak Turkish yet prefer to speak in the court in another language will have to pay the fees themselves.
