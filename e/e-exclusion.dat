40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the {{connections}} between integration policies, language skills, <b>e-exclusion</b> and library services. With {{the increasing number of}} web based community services citizens need good computer skills and knowledge of the Internet. The <b>e-exclusion</b> in today’s information society affects immigrants more than other citizens. Two courses with the title Library Services in Multicultural Communities have been given at Stuttgart Media University during 2009. One was part of an International Summer school in the spring of 2009. The other one was given this semester and included a study tour to The Netherlands and participation in an international seminar. During these courses many good examples have been presented of how to provide good library services in the age of intercultural mobility. This paper and presentation will analyze and reflect on the discussion and results of the course, focusing on trends, best practices and experiences of libraries regarding the connections between language ability, e-inclusion and integration...|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of Information and Communication Technologies one can observe the phenomenon of <b>e-exclusion</b> of certain social groups. Among them there are the persons in late adulthood who for various reasons do not use computers or the internet. The causes {{of this can be}} located in the low financial status of this social group. At the same time, the argument is raised that the more important problem is the lack of motivation and the number of obstacles that seniors face in their access to ICT. The paper presents the conclusions from the research conducted with the Avec Association and the Games and Innovation in Education Research Team - Edutainment (Zespół Badawczy Gier i Innowacji w Edukacji - Edutainment). This encompasses, on the one hand, problems pertaining to seniors’ motivation, the obstacles that they face, their perception of the virtual world, and on the other, the description of the search for new educational methods that may make it possible to increase the effectiveness of computer skills training course...|$|E
40|$|The Economic Impact of Digital Technologies {{offers a}} profoundly {{illuminating}} examination of ICT transformations in Europe and its {{critical role in}} greater social inequality. It presents scholars and policy makers with original and practical tools to benchmark and assess the ICT diffusion and inclusion process. The core message of book is that a coherent European strategy for embedding ICT technologies in society is long overdue. Social differences in ICT use persist and are in some cases widening, yet despite this fact there is a dearth of research on remedying digital inequalities. This is of particular importance given that relative levels of ICT use, investment and research can often explain variations in economic performance between industrialised countries. The purpose of this book is {{to fill the gap}} in the literature by presenting key evidence on the economic benefits (and costs) deriving from investment in an inclusive information society. The authors propose indicators and indexes of digital development and e-Inclusion (and its flip-side <b>e-exclusion)</b> to assess the relationship between inclusive ICT and wider economic and social performance in Europe. Presenting the methodology to monitor countries' performance and ICT use, together with original measures and policy suggestions, this book will be indispensable to policymakers, scholars and postgraduate students in a variety of areas including economic growth, innovation, industrial and organizational studies, information and technology, European studies, and public and social policy...|$|E
