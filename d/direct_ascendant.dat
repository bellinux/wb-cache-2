6000|$|On the whole, the Stevensons may be {{described}} as decent, reputable folk, following honest trades--millers, maltsters, and doctors, playing the character parts in the Waverley Novels with propriety, if without distinction; and to an orphan looking {{about him in the}} world for a potential ancestry, offering a plain and quite unadorned refuge, equally free from shame and glory. John, the land-labourer, is the one living and memorable figure, and he, alas! cannot possibly be more near than a collateral. It was on August 12, 1678, that he heard Mr. John Welsh on the Craigdowhill, and [...] "took the heavens, earth, and sun in the firmament that was shining on us, as also the ambassador who made the offer, and the clerk who raised the psalms, to witness that I did give myself away to the Lord in a personal and perpetual covenant never to be forgotten"; and already, in 1675, the birth of my <b>direct</b> <b>ascendant</b> was registered in Glasgow. So that I have been pursuing ancestors too far down; and John the land-labourer is debarred me, and I must relinquish from the trophies of my house his rare soul-strengthening and comforting cordial. It is the same case with the Edinburgh bailie and the miller of the Canonmills, worthy man! and with that public character, Hugh the Under-Clerk, and more than all, with Sir Archibald, the physician, who recorded arms. And I am reduced to a family of inconspicuous maltsters in what was then the clean and handsome little city on the Clyde.|$|E

50|$|The <b>direct</b> <b>ascendant</b> of the 4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division was the 17th Tank Corps, {{initially}} {{formed in}} 1942, which commenced its combat history on 26 June 1942 {{just prior to}} the Battle of Voronezh (1942), deployed {{to the west of the}} city. For distinction in combat in the Middle Don Operation (17-30 December 1942), the Corps was renumbered as the 4th Guards Tank Corps in January 1943. It received the honorific Kantemirovsky after Kantemirovka, the village which was liberated by tank subunits as their baptism of fire.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDémonette is a lexical {{database}} whose vertices (lexical entries) and edges (morphological {{relations between}} the vertices) are annotated with morpho-semantic information. It results from an original design incorporating two radically different approaches: Morphonette, a resource based on derivational analogies and DériF, an analyzer based on linguistic rules. However, Daemonette {{is not a simple}} merger of two pre-existing ressources: its architecture is fully compatible with the lexematic approach to morphology; its contents can be extended using data from various other sources. The article presents the Démonette model and the content of its current version, including 31, 204 verbs, action nouns, agent nouns and property adjectives, where morphological links between both <b>direct</b> <b>ascendants</b> and indirectly related words have bi-oriented definitions. Finally, Démonette is assessed with respect to Verbaction with a recall of 84 % and a precision of 90 %...|$|R

40|$|Os pequenos sistemas de abastecimento de Ãgua no semiÃrido cearense apresentam uma deficiÃncia no que diz respeito Ã qualidade. O tratamento da Ãgua nestas comunidades nÃo estÃ sendo bem eficiente, jÃ que nÃo hÃ uma metodologia para escolha da tecnologia apropriada para o tratamento de Ãgua em funÃÃo da qualidade da Ãgua bruta. Tendo em vista essa problemÃtica, foi desenvolvido um modelo simplificado de escolha de tecnologia de tratamento de Ãgua para pequenas comunidades, utilizando o Excel 2007. O modelo tem duas etapas: Na primeira, encontram-se os critÃrios de exclusÃo, parÃmetros tais como a dureza, os cloretos, o flÃor, dentre outros. Devido seu tratamento ser tecnicamente inviÃvel em pequenas comunidades rurais, nÃo foram considerados no resultado do modelo. A segunda etapa Ã a de seleÃÃo das tecnologias de tratamento de Ãgua propriamente dito, onde ao se selecionar o manancial e algumas de suas caracterÃsticas, o modelo serÃ capaz de trazer o melhor sistema para um tratamento eficiente. Juntamente com o resultado do modelo, encontram-se os dimensionamentos hidrÃulicos e as plantas das estaÃÃes de tratamento de Ãgua propostas. As tecnologias usadas foram o Ciclo Completo, a FiltraÃÃo Direta Ascendente, a Dupla FiltraÃÃo e a OxidaÃÃo seguida de FiltraÃÃo rÃpida Ascendente. Os critÃrios de seleÃÃo foram definidos atravÃs de revisÃo bibliogrÃfica, com exceÃÃo dos critÃrios para escolha da tecnologia para remoÃÃo de ferro, que foram encontrados em corridas experimentais {{realizadas}} na instalaÃÃo piloto existente na ETA GAVIÃO. The {{water supply}} systems in CearÃ semiarid are deficient {{with regard to}} water quality. The water treatment in communities are not being very efficient, {{since there is no}} standardization of water treatment plants in relation {{to the quality of the}} raw water that is captured. Therefore, it was developed a simplified model of choice selection of water treatment technologies for small communities, which was developed using Excel 2007, where you can make a correct choice of the treatment plant that will supply water to a location. The model consists of two steps. In the first stage are the criteria for exclusion, since it is a simplified model and parameters such as hardness, chloride, fluoride, among others need to be well analyzed, due to their treatment are not feasible for small rural communities and are not in the model&# 8223;s result. The second step is the selection of technologies for water treatment itself, on which selecting the source and its characteristics, the model will be able to bring the best result for an effective treatment. In addition to the model&# 8223;s results are the hydraulic design and the plant water treatment plants chosen. The technologies used were the Complete Cycle, the <b>Direct</b> <b>Ascendant</b> Filtration, the Double Filtration and Oxidation followed by rapid Ascendant Filtration. The selection criteria were included by a bibliographic review of established authors in water treatment and the criteria for choosing the technology that removes iron were developed in the pilot plant at ETA GAVIÃO...|$|E
