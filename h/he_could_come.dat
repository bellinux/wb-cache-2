5|$|Jones was {{not alone}} in his wish to get more screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped that knowing Clark's secret would allow the character to be written into more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville, and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross was the best thing, he does feel that his exit could have gone better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had.|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day, Liz {{goes to her}} dentist {{appointment}} and tells the receptionist {{that she did not}} sign the waiver. After her surgery, Liz reassures the dental staff that the anesthesia is having no effect on her and can take herself home. In the lobby, Liz sees her former boyfriends Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), and Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), and is moved that they came back so that she not be alone on Valentine's Day. Liz is hallucinating, however, and the people she sees as Drew, Dennis, and Floyd are actually the three Jamaican women who are dental assistants at the oral surgeon's office. One of them calls Jack, Liz's boss, asking if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> pick up Liz and take her home. Jack had just spent the night with Avery, who thinks that the phone call was made up by Jack as an excuse to end the date, but when he invites her to come along, she is impressed by his kindness to Liz.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the film}} is of course fictional and Hertzfeldt has never done {{advertising}} work, he received many offers to do television commercials after Billy's Balloon drew international attention. In appearances Hertzfeldt has often told the humorous story of how he was tempted to produce the worst possible cartoons <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up with for the companies, make off with their money, {{and see if they}} would actually make it to air. Eventually this became the germ for Rejecteds theme of a collection of cartoons so bad they were rejected by advertising agencies, leading to their creator's breakdown and ultimately the cartoons' metaphysical crisis.|$|E

25|$|Despite his sacking Taylor {{remained}} {{friendly with}} the band and he asked if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to Paris too. He dressed up for the sound check in his trademark black leather stage gear, and added a {{chain around his neck}} with a Joan of Arc medallion, which he had bought on arrival at Calais. One version of the story says he gave such an extraordinary performance at the sound check, that the organizers decided to put Taylor {{at the top of the}} bill for both shows. As a result of his performance at those two shows, Eddie Barclay signed him to a six-year record deal on the Barclay label.|$|E

When the Frenchman viewed the heaped-up corpses of his familiars and friends, he asked Menéndez to send a gentleman to Ribault to inform him of what had occurred; and he even requested Menéndez to go in person to treat about securities, as the Captain-General was fatigued. Menéndez told him to tell Ribault that he gave his word that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> in safety with five or six of his companions.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than simply}} sneaking Jim {{out of the}} shed where he is being held, Tom {{develops}} an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read, including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep {{and returned to the}} Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck is rewarded six hundred dollars for saving the aunts from the con men. Huck gives most of it to Jim for his family. Huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.|$|E

She recalled: [...] "I once received a letter from someone who said they were to attend the Academy of Arts, and that I should wait for him; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> back and marry me!

[...] "Marion realized that his knee was weak and {{did not feel that}} it was coming around," [...] Brown said at the time.

[...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head.

500|$|The {{album is}} named after an {{incident}} at The Pump Room restaurant in Chicago, Illinois. Collins, entering the restaurant with former Led Zeppelin lead vocalist Robert Plant, was denied admittance {{because he did not}} meet the restaurant's dress code of [...] "jacket required" [...] for dinner while Plant was allowed in. Collins was wearing a jacket and argued about it. The maître d'hôtel argued that the jacket was not [...] "proper". Collins {{said in an interview with}} Playboy that he was, at that point, never so mad in his life. After the incident, the singer often appeared on shows such as Late Night with David Letterman and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, denouncing the restaurant and telling his story. The management of the restaurant later sent him a complimentary sport coat and an apology letter, stating that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to the restaurant wearing whatever he wanted.|$|E
500|$|Although Sakura is {{the most}} {{recurring}} female character in Naruto, Masashi Kishimoto did not originally intend for Sakura to be the heroine of the series. Kishimoto attributes this to his being unable to draw good heroine characters and fashioned Sakura as a girl who cannot understand men, {{the best example of}} a heroine <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up with. Sakura's creation is a result of Kishimoto's desire to make a somewhat irritating character who was well-intentioned. Despite these elements, Kishimoto is fond of Sakura, as he feels that many of her personality traits are common among all people, thus giving her a sense of real humanity. When asked in an interview if there is something about Sakura's background that was never revealed, Kishimoto explains that he has never thought of Sakura as she is a [...] "normal girl." [...] Kishimoto has often been asked by readers about why he did not show Sakura's parents until the film [...] In response, he said this would not be entertaining as Sakura does not belong to any clan unlike other characters so her parents were civilians.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Broderick {{provided}} the speaking voice of Adult Simba. [...] The first actor {{to be assigned}} to The Lion King, Broderick learned of the role {{while he was on}} vacation in Ireland, where he received a telephone call from his agent informing him that the directors were interested in casting him as Simba. At the time, Broderick was well known for portraying the title character in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). [...] The directors decided to cast him as Simba because they felt that he was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role; according to producer Don Hahn, Broderick's voice resembled [...] "the kind of character who could be irresponsible and likeable, but you also felt that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> back in a very heroic way." [...] Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who was starring as Randy Taylor on the television sitcom Home Improvement at the time, was cast as the speaking voice of Young Simba. [...] His appearance and personality would later serve as creative inspiration for supervising animator Mark Henn.|$|E

500|$|The main {{theme and}} {{selected}} tracks for [...] "Episode Prompto" [...] were composed by Naoshi Mizuta, {{who had previously}} composed music for Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIII-2. While he had previously been told to compose his themes based on specific scenes within the game or on developer requests, Mizuta was instead given a comprehensive description of Prompto's backstory and life history. Mizuta built up his musical image from there; {{a central part of}} the DLC was showing Prompto's more serious side as opposed to his role in the main game as a mood maker. Mizuta was purposely not told what type of sound the team wanted, with them instead waiting to see what ideas <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up with. For Episode Ignis, three new pieces were composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, who had worked with Square Enix staff on the music of games including Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross and Xenogears. Final Fantasy XV was his first Final Fantasy project. The songs were performed by the Brussels Philharmonic Orchestra. The multiplayer expansion Comrades had its theme song composed by Uematsu. Titled [...] "Choosing Hope", the theme was sung by Japanese vocalist Emiko Suzuki.|$|E
500|$|Robinson was {{the modern}} {{definition}} of a boxer puncher. He was able to fight almost any style: <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> out one round brawling, the next counterpunching, and the next fighting on the outside flicking his jab. Robinson would use his formless style to exploit his opponents weaknesses, he also possessed great speed and precision. He fought in a very conventional way with a firm jab, but threw hooks and uppercuts in flurries in an unconventional way. He possessed tremendous versatility—according to boxing analyst Bert Sugar, [...] "Robinson could deliver a knockout blow going backward." [...] Robinson was efficient with both hands, and he displayed a variety of effective punches—according to a TIME magazine article in 1951, [...] "Robinson's repertoire, thrown with equal speed and power by either hand, includes every standard punch from a bolo to a hook—and a few he makes up {{on the spur of}} the moment." [...] Robinson commented that once a fighter has trained to a certain level, their techniques and responses become almost reflexive. [...] "You don't think. It's all instinct. If you stop to think, you're gone." ...|$|E
500|$|August Strindberg was {{familiar}} with Either/Or and this book made him [...] "forever a champion of the ethical as juxtaposed to the aesthetic life conception and he always remained faithful {{to the idea that}} art and knowledge must be [...] to life, and that life itself must be lived as we know best, chiefly because we are part of it and cannot escape from its promptings." [...] Strindberg was obviously attracted to Either/Or Part II where Kierkegaard developed his categorical imperative. He wrote the following in Growth of a Soul published posthumously in 1913 about Kierkegaard’s Either—Or: [...] "it was valid only for the priests who called themselves Christians and the seducer and Don Juan were the author himself, who satisfied his desires in imagination". Part II was his [...] "Discourse on Life as a Duty, and when he {{reached the end of the}} work he found the moral philosopher in despair, and that all this teaching about duty had only produced a Philistine." [...] He then states that Kierkegaard's discourses might have led him closer to Christianity but he didn't know if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> back to something [...] "which had been torn out, and joyfully thrown into the fire". However, after reading the book he [...] "felt sinful". Then another writer began to influence his life. This is how he described Either/Or: ...|$|E

500|$|On 20 April 1972, Sellers {{reunited with}} Milligan and Harry Secombe to record The Last Goon Show of All, which was {{broadcast}} on 5 October. In May 1973, with his third marriage failing, Sellers {{went to the}} theatre to watch Liza Minnelli perform. He became entranced with Minnelli and the couple became engaged three days later, despite Minnelli's current betrothal to Desi Arnaz, Jr., and Sellers still being married. Their relationship lasted a month before breaking up. By 1974, Sellers's friends were concerned {{that he was having}} a nervous breakdown. Directors John and Roy Boulting considered that Sellers was [...] "a deeply troubled man, distrustful, self-absorbed, ultimately self-destructive. He was the complete contradiction." [...] Sellers was shy and insecure when out of character. When he was invited to appear on Michael Parkinson's eponymous chat show in 1974, he withdrew the day before, explaining to Parkinson that [...] "I just can't walk on as myself". When he was told <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> on as someone else, he appeared dressed {{as a member of the}} Gestapo. After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character, he stepped out of the role and settled down and, according to Parkinson himself, [...] "was brilliant, giving the audience an astonishing display of his virtuosity". In 1974, Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long-dead music hall comic Dan Leno, who advised him to return to the role of Clouseau.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} control the oceans, Lord Cutler Beckett executes anyone {{associated}} with piracy by ordering Davy Jones to destroy all pirate ships in the seas. Condemned prisoners sing [...] "Hoist the Colours" [...] to compel the nine Pirate Lords to convene at Shipwreck Cove to hold the Brethren Court. Because Captain Jack Sparrow, Pirate Lord of the Caribbean Sea, never named a successor before being killed, Captain Barbossa, along with Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Tia Dalma, and {{the crew of the}} Black Pearl, plot to rescue Jack from Davy Jones' Locker. Traveling to Singapore, the crew meet Captain Sao Feng (Pirate Lord of the South China Sea), who owns navigational charts to the Locker and quickly gains an unpredictable interest in Elizabeth. Beckett's soldiers invade, but the crew escape. Feng and Turner make a deal to give Jack to Feng, so he in turn can use the Pearl to rescue his father Bootstrap Bill Turner from the Flying Dutchman. The crew travels to the locker and rescues the marooned Jack. They find themselves trapped, encountering dead souls, including Elizabeth's father Governor Swann who was executed by Beckett. Tia Dalma reveals that the Goddess [...] "Calypso" [...] charged Davy Jones with the job to guide the souls of those who died at sea to the next world. Once every ten years <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> ashore to be with the woman he loved. But he corrupted his purpose and was cursed to become a monster.

500|$|Smith {{worked on}} the Zuninos' farm and began {{studying}} the Italian language, which he realised he had to learn if he was to travel through enemy territory to the Allied lines. After a month, the local partisan commander, Antonio Bozzano (nicknamed [...] "Barbetta" [...] because of his beard), came to meet Smith, {{and asked him to}} join his ranks. Smith accompanied Barbetta to his headquarters, about [...] away in a village called Piancastagna. When Barbetta asked his rank, Smith said he was a captain. [...] "Oh well," [...] Barbetta replied, tapping him on the shoulder; [...] "you are now a major. I make you a major." [...] Smith realised that Barbetta had given him this [...] "promotion" [...] in the hope of elevating his own reputation in the resistance movement—"none of the other regiments in the area could boast an Inglesi pilote and a majore to boot", he explained in his memoirs. Smith got on well with Barbetta, and took part in sabotage operations for about three months during late 1944. Meanwhile, he became proficient in Italian. After the Germans pulled out of their local garrison at Sassello in October 1944, Smith told Barbetta {{that he was going to}} attempt to return to the Allied lines. The partisans tried to talk him out of it, telling him it was too risky, but when Smith insisted, they gave him letters to take with him, endorsing him to other Italian partisan groups he might encounter on his way. A British Army corporal known to Smith as [...] "Bill", who had been hiding in a nearby village, asked if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> as well, and Smith agreed.|$|E
