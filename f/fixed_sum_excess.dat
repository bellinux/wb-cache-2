40|$|We {{examine the}} impacts on child support {{payments}} of explicitly indexing orders to noncustodial parents' incomes by expressing orders {{as a percentage}} of income rather than as a <b>fixed</b> <b>sum.</b> Using data collected from 21 counties in Wisconsin, we find that payments on behalf of percentage-expressed orders increase much faster than would be expected were orders expressed as a <b>fixed</b> <b>sum,</b> after controlling for differences between cases with the two award types. Collections on behalf of percentage-expressed orders increase relative to fixed-sum orders because of large increases over time in the amount of the obligation; in comparison, fixed-sum obligations are extremely stable. ...|$|R

5000|$|A pension is a fund {{into which}} a {{sum of money}} is added during an employee's {{employment}} years, and from which payments are drawn to support the person's retirement from work {{in the form of}} periodic payments.

40|$|This {{paper will}} only analyze one issue; namely whether the {{inclusion}} of penalty clauses or <b>fixed</b> <b>sums</b> into a contract is governed by the Convention of International Sale of Goods (CISG) 1 and, therefore, falls inter alia under Article 74. In essence, a penalty clause or <b>fixed</b> <b>sum</b> is a pre-determined amount of money which becomes due {{in the event of}} a breach of contract. The word “penalty” is used in this paper to describe the fact that the amount due is greater than the actual damage. The main reasons to include penalty clauses in contracts are to “reduce legal costs, [to provide] time for producing evidence, and [to mitigate] the risk of losing litigation or arbitral proceedings due to the required level of proof not being met...|$|R

Moreover, the consistorial advocates are pledged to defend the poor free of charge in case of need.|$|R
6000|$|Restrictions on {{importation}} do, however, tend to keep {{down the}} value and price of our remaining imports, and {{to keep up the}} nominal or money prices of all our other commodities, by retaining a greater quantity of money in the country than would otherwise be there. From this it obviously follows, that if the restrictions were removed, we should have to pay rather more for some of the articles which we now import, while those which we are now prevented from importing would cost us more than might be inferred from their present price in the foreign market. And general prices would fall; to the benefit of those who have <b>fixed</b> <b>sums</b> to receive; to the disadvantage of those who have <b>fixed</b> <b>sums</b> to pay; and giving rise, as a general fall of prices always does, to an appearance, though a temporary and fallacious one, of general distress.
