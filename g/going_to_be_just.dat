[...] Wilson {{said that before}} its final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by unnamed members of the group. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's {{not going to be}} too long a record, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." [...] Love was worried that the [...] "track itself was already so avant-garde, especially with the theremin, [...] I wondered how our fans were going to relate to it." [...] Shortly before the single's release, Wilson suggested: [...] "It's still sticking pretty close to that same boy-girl thing, you know, but with a difference.

500|$|The first Beach Boy to hear [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in a semi-completed {{form was}} Carl Wilson, who had {{previously}} participated in rough guide vocals with Brian for the initial February mix. Following a performance with the touring group in North Dakota, he remembered: [...] "I came back up into my hotel room one night and the phone rang. It was Brian on the other end. He called me from the recording studio and played this really bizarre sounding music over the phone. There were drums smashing, that kind of stuff, and then it refined itself {{and got into the}} cello. It was a real funky track." [...] In 1976, Brian revealed that before the final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by members of the group, whom Brian declined to name.

500|$|While Mr. Eko {{was created}} as a more passive character, the idea changed when the {{producers}} first saw Akinnuoye-Agbaje play the character. Akinnuoye-Agbaje explained: [...] "once they saw me on the screen without a shirt, all 6 foot 2 and using a stick beating three guys up, they knew this guy wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> a passive priest". Eventually, Cuse and Lindelof decided to combine their original idea for the character with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's character on Oz. Originally, the character was named [...] "Emeka", and later [...] "Omecca", but after Akinnuoye-Agbaje was cast, the name was changed to [...] "Eko", {{in order to be}} consistent with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's own Nigerian tribal lineage. Eko refers to the City of Legos (Lagos) in Nigeria, coming from Eleko, Lord of Lagos. Adding [...] "Mr." [...] in front of the character's name was also a suggestion made by Akinnuoye-Agbaje. While at first Cuse and Lindelof thought this was [...] "the silliest thing in the world", they changed their minds after repeating the name a few times, realizing there [...] "was something really cool about it". The character first appeared in [...] "Adrift", where he was only shown briefly, knocking down three of the show's main characters with a stick. Akinnuoye-Agbaje was given the stick and told to [...] "knock those three guys out". Akinnuoye-Agbaje felt [...] "there's no better way to make an entrance". The religious scripture on the stick was a suggestion of Akinnuoye-Agbaje.|$|E

At that time, there were rumors to include a major Star Wars-themed expansion to Disney's Hollywood Studios. When asked whether or not Disney has an intellectual property franchise that's comparable to Harry Potter at Universal theme parks, Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger mentioned Cars, Disney Princesses, and promised that Star Wars, [...] "is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> that."

Edwards proposed one public school system for all, arguing that [...] "None of us believe that the quality of a child's education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of their community." [...] He appealed {{for the end of the}} two economies, [...] "one for people who are set for life, they know their kids and grandkids are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> fine, and then one for most Americans, people who live paycheck to paycheck." [...] Edwards also stated how the Democrats expected to pay for their agenda: [...] "We're going to roll back – we're going to roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. And we're going to close corporate loopholes. We're going to cut government contractors and wasteful spending. We can move this country forward without passing the burden to our children and our grandchildren." ...|$|E

On August 13, 2017, Trump told Fox News that he was [...] "seriously considering a pardon" [...] for Arpaio. Days after being criticized for his comments following the Charlottesville rally, Trump {{announced that he would}} be holding a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. [...] The Mayor of Phoenix, Greg Stanton, repeatedly called for the rally to be postponed in light of Charlottesville, and stated that Trump should apologize having [...] "inflamed racial tension across the country {{as a result of this}} failure of moral leadership." [...] Stanton specifically urged that Arpaio not be granted a pardon and stated that an announcement at the rally would make it [...] "clear that [...] true intent is to inflame emotions and further divide our nation." [...] During the rally, Trump asked rhetorically whether [...] "Sheriff Joe [...] convicted for doing his job" [...] and declared that Arpaio [...] "should have had a jury"; these comments were greeted with strong approval by the attendees. [...] The rally's tone was described as [...] "angry" [...] (NPR's Domenico Montanaro described it as [...] "incendiary," [...] stating that Trump had [...] "ripped at cultural divides [...] played to white grievance"), but he stopped short of issuing the pardon; Trump made his intention clear, however, stating that [...] "I'll make a prediction.
