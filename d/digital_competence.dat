40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine how policy {{documents}} in Norway the last ten years have interpreted ICT and <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> in teacher education and in school. Norway implemented in 2006 a new national curriculum which increased the status of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> to be the fifth basic skill in the Norwegian elementary school (stage 1 - 13). This was a historic event and never before has <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> achieved such status in curricula, neither nationally nor internationally. The same has newly happened with the new General Plan for Teacher Education where <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> has become the fifth basic skill in all subjects. However, both teacher educators and teachers lack sufficient <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> to fulfil these ambiguous policy goals and therefore the article suggest how a model of <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> can bridge some of the gap between the intentions in the policy documents and the teachers/teacher educators’ practise. At the same time the article attempts to elaborate our perception of the concept <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> in an educational discourse and how one can define <b>digital</b> <b>competence</b> in light of a Scandinavian educational perspective.

40|$|During recent years, {{blogging}} {{has become}} established {{as an important}} part of Norwegian girls’ digital media culture. Girls who blog are often trivialized in the Norwegian public sphere; the activity itself is frequently the subject of heated debate but we seldom hear about the experiences tied to the blogging of these girls. This dissertation acknowledges, documents, and theorizes girls’ experiences of participation in mainstream blogging in Norway that is competitive, body-focused, and commercialized. This work emphasizes girls’ perspectives in order to address some of the gaps in the literature that often fails to shed light on girls’ experiences of identity performances online and their meaning making of <b>digital</b> <b>competences.</b> Combining qualitative in-depth interviewing, ethnographic analyses of blogs, and critical discourse analysis of Norwegian press coverage in a longitudinal design, I investigate how girls perform blogging selves over time, which <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> they find meaningful for participation in mainstream blogging, and how they are positioned in the press commentary via the identity label of “pink blogger”. Drawing on a combination of theoretical frameworks and methods, I strive for a holistic investigation of girls’ experiences that takes into consideration both the realities of everyday interactions with the mainstream blogging community and the audience, and of the wider cultural contexts and gendered discourses that frame, regulate, and discipline these everyday interactions. According to my findings, girls in mainstream blogging are trivialized in the press commentary as superficial, body-obsessed, and commercial pink bloggers. In contrast to these homogenizing and fixed implications of the pink blogger label, I argue that girls perform identity in blogs in various ways, picking up strategies of performing the blogging self according to goals that often change, and identifying with these performances to varying degrees. Similarly, the meanings the girls tie to <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> are varied, both aligning and contrasting with what is documented as beneficial in the literature. While girls are undoubtedly agents in performing identity and developing <b>digital</b> <b>competences,</b> the identity performances and development of <b>digital</b> <b>competences</b> are also clearly framed by the norm of competitiveness, body focus, and commercialization of the mainstream blogging community {{as well as by the}} wider cultural contexts and gendered discourses beyond this community, including the pink blogger label and the normative ideal of the gender equal, socially engaged Nordic Girl...|$|R

This subject is conducted fully online at the UOC, and learners are required to engage in a collaborative project organized in 4 phases: starting, structuring, developing and concluding. Based on an evaluation research approach, quantitative and qualitative data from a survey have been triangulated. The results support the pedagogical methodology which forms the basis of this subject and indicates that collaborative projects facilitate the acquisition of <b>digital</b> <b>competences,</b> highlighting those linked to digital teamwork and digital attitude.
