5|$|Dönitz {{contacted}} the British {{commander of the}} city of Flensburg, asking him for permission to conduct a formal state funeral, which was approved. That funeral, the last such of the Third Reich, was held on 16 May 1945 with Dönitz, Adolf Hitler's successor as Head of State, delivering the eulogy. In advance, Dönitz had ordered a board of inquiry and court martial to clarify the circumstances of the shooting. During the court martial, Gottlob stated that, in accordance with his orders, he had asked for the password three times without receiving a response <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>person,</b> whom he could not visually identify in the darkness. Without aiming he had fired his rifle from the hip. The chain of events was confirmed by the watch leader. The court ruled that Gottlob was not guilty and cleared him of any fault.|$|E

5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent {{on a piece of paper}} and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>person,</b> and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedure}} for applying for {{an order for}} review of detention differs from that for obtaining a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court. The {{procedure for}} doing so is set out in Order 54 of the Rules of Court. An application {{must be made to}} the High Court by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an affidavit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> being restrained which shows that the application is being made at his or her instance and explaining the nature of the restraint.

25|$|Methods used in {{laboratory}} diagnosis include culturing of nasopharyngeal swabs on a nutrient medium (Bordet-Gengou medium), {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), and serological methods (e.g. complement fixation test).

25|$|Although {{the word}} hooponopono was not used, early Hawaiian historians {{documented}} {{a belief that}} illness was caused by breaking kapu, or spiritual laws, and that the illness could not be cured until the sufferer atoned for this transgression, often {{with the assistance of}} a praying priest (kahuna pule) or healing priest (kahuna lapaau).

25|$|The helper-therapy {{principle}} {{proposes that}} there are four significant benefits to those who provide peer support: (a) increased sense of interpersonal competence {{as a result of}} making an impact on another person's life; (b) development of a sense of equality in giving and taking between himself or herself and others; (c) helper gains new personally-relevant knowledge while helping; and (d) the helper receives social approval <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> they help, and others.|$|E

The month the two were married Biryukova reported him to the police in Redmond for allegedly assaulting her and got a no-contact order; she nevertheless visited him regularly in jail in Issaquah, where he was when she gave birth, under assumed names. Both claimed to investigators they did not live together despite giving them the same address; Biryukova {{said at one point}} she did not even know who the father was even though his name was on the child's birth certificate.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} ORS are unknown. It {{is thought that}} {{significant}} negative experiences may trigger the development of ORS. These have been considered as two types: key traumatic experiences related to smell, and life stressors present when the condition developed but which were unrelated to smell. In one review, 85% of reported cases had traumatic, smell-related experiences, and 17% of cases had stress factors unrelated to smell. Reported smell-related experiences usually revolve around family members, friends, co-workers, peers or other people making comments about an odor <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>person,</b> which causes embarrassment and shame. Examples include accusation of flatulence during a religious ceremony, or being bullied for flatulence such at school, accidental urination in class, announcements about a passenger needing to use deodorant over speaker by a driver on public transport, sinusitis which caused a bad taste in the mouth, mockery about a fish odor from a finger which had been inserted into the person's vagina {{in the context of}} a sexual assault, and revulsion about menarche and brother's sexual intimacy. It has been suggested that a proportion of such reported experiences may not have been real, but rather early symptom of ORS (i.e. referential thoughts). Examples of non smell-related stressful periods include guilt due to a romantic affair, being left by a partner, violence in school, family illness when growing up (e.g. cancer), and bullying.|$|E

500|$|Mr Justice Abbott {{addressed}} the court: [...] He {{then went on}} to direct the jury at length, commenting at one point that these disturbances [...] "seem to have been the necessity of an advance in the wages of husbandry; but the circumstances of some among the offenders do not correspond with the supposition of such an object". He was probably referring to John Dennis, licensed victualler of Littleport. He outlined the three capital offences that would be presented, namely burglary, robbery <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> and stealing in a dwelling house. He defined burglary as breaking into a house at night with intent, robbery <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> as extortion by violence or threat thereof, and stealing in a dwelling house as an actual act of stealing, not just the threat. He reminded the jury that when offences are carried out by a mob, it is the whole mob that is guilty, not just the person doing the deed. He closed: The court adjourned until the following day.|$|E
