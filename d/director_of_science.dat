25|$|Wilford's {{professional}} career began in 1956 at the Wall Street Journal, {{where he was}} a general assignment reporter and (after a two-year military tour of duty) a medical reporter. In 1962, he joined Time to work as a contributing science editor, then moved in 1965 to The New York Times to be a science reporter. While at the NYT he also worked as assistant national news editor (1973–1975) and <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> news (1975–1979).|$|E

25|$|The Study of Chemical Composition: An Account of its Method and Historical Development with Illustrative Quotations (1904) (reprinted in 2014.) and The Experimental Basis of Chemistry: Suggestions for a Series of Experiments Illustrative of the Fundamental Principles of Chemistry {{published}} posthumously in 1920. She {{had planned}} {{that the book}} should be 20 chapters but had only completed ten chapters at her death. The book was later edited for publication by colleagues and friends including Mary Beatrice Thomas, <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> Studies at Girton College.|$|E
25|$|In June and July 1994 – {{after three}} days of {{brainstorming}} with John Gage (the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> for Sun), Gosling, Joy, Naughton, Wayne Rosing, and Eric Schmidt – the team re-targeted the platform for the World Wide Web. They felt that with the advent of graphical web browsers like Mosaic the Internet could evolve into the same highly interactive medium that they had envisioned for cable TV. As a prototype, Naughton wrote a small browser, WebRunner (named after the movie Blade Runner), renamed HotJava in 1995.|$|E
25|$|While {{the initial}} {{consolidation}} of Air Force laboratories reduced overhead and budgetary pressure, another push towards a unified laboratory structure {{came in the}} form of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Section 277. This section instructed the Department of Defense to produce a five-year plan for consolidation and restructuring of all defense laboratories. The currently existing laboratory structure was created in October 1997 through the consolidation of Phillips Laboratory headquartered in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Wright Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, Rome Laboratory (formerly Rome Air Development Center) in Rome, New York, and Armstrong Laboratory in San Antonio, Texas and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR). The single laboratory concept was developed and championed by Maj Gen Richard Paul, who was <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> & Technology for AFMC and Gen Henry Viccellio Jr, and then became the first Commander of AFRL.|$|E

25|$|Frédéric Mion, the <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sciences</b> Po, stated his {{intention}} to create a campus comparable in quality and capacity to Sciences Po’s most prominent international partner universities such as Columbia University, the London School of Economics and Hong Kong University.|$|R
25|$|In February 2016, the Court of Audit {{noted that}} reforms {{had been made}} but stated that greater {{transparency}} was still needed. Frédéric Mion, <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sciences</b> Po since 2013, defended the university’s record and asked the judges to write their report again.|$|R
500|$|Science Gallery London {{is set to}} open in 2016 on King's Guy's Campus. It is {{a public}} science centre where 'art and science collide', and {{is a part of}} Global Science Gallery Network. A {{flagship}} project for 'Culture at King’s College London', Science Gallery will include [...] of public space and a newly landscaped Georgian courtyard. There will be exhibition galleries, theatres, meeting spaces and a café; while unlike other science centre, it will have no permanent collection.

500|$|Lockheed, {{having been}} {{absent from the}} fighter {{aircraft}} industry for 10 years, was not approached by DARPA in 1974. Ed Martin, Lockheed California Companies <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>science</b> and engineering, {{became aware of the}} research into stealth during his work at the Pentagon and Wright-Patterson AFB. Martin and Ben Rich, who at that time had recently become Skunk Works' president, briefed Clarence [...] "Kelly" [...] Johnson on the program. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) gave Skunk Works permission to discuss with DARPA on the stealth characteristics of the A-12 and D-21. On behalf of the company, Rich and Martin formally requested permission from DARPA to participate in the program, but the agency initially refused because there were insufficient funds; after much debate, Lockheed was allowed entry, albeit without a government contract.|$|E
2500|$|However, Edwards's results {{came from}} {{analysis}} of the same data used for the 2004 CDC report. [...] When he wrote to the CDC's associate <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>science,</b> questioning the report's conclusions and methodology, he received a belated reply: [...] "We have examined CDC's role {{in the study and}} have found no evidence of misconduct." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{path to a}} {{consolidated}} Air Force Research Laboratory {{began with}} the passage of the Goldwater–Nichols Act which was designed to streamline the use of resources by the Department of Defense. In addition to this Act, the end of the Cold War began a period of budgetary and personnel reductions within the armed forces in preparation for a [...] "stand-down" [...] transition out of readiness for a global war with the Soviet Union. Prior to 1990, the Air Force laboratory system spread research out into 13 different laboratories and the Rome Air Development Center which each reported up two separate chains of command: a product center for personnel, and the Air Force Systems Command <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Science</b> & Technology for budgetary purposes. Bowing to the constraints of a reduced budget and personnel, the Air Force merged the existing research laboratories into four [...] "superlabs" [...] in December 1990. During this same time period, the Air Force Systems Command and Air Force Logistics Command merged to form Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) in July 1992.|$|E
