5|$|Gallium is {{predominantly}} used in electronics. Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, {{is used in}} microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Semiconductive gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and diode lasers. Gallium is also used {{in the production of}} artificial <b>gadolinium</b> gallium garnet for jewelry.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is an {{essential}} cofactor for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means {{that it may be}} substituted with cerium, praseodymium, or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, europium, or <b>gadolinium</b> giving no side effects other than slower growth.|$|E
5|$|Magnets {{are made}} of heavy metals such as manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, niobium, bismuth, praseodymium, neodymium, <b>gadolinium,</b> and dysprosium. Neodymium magnets are the strongest type of {{permanent}} magnet commercially available. They are key components of, for example, car door locks, starter motors, fuel pumps, and power windows.|$|E
5|$|Reaction with excess {{fluorine}} {{produces the}} stable white tetrafluoride CeF4; the other tetrahalides are not known. Of the dihalides, only the bronze diiodide CeI2 is known; like the diiodides of lanthanum, praseodymium, and <b>gadolinium,</b> {{this is a}} cerium(III) electride compound. True cerium(II) compounds are restricted to a few unusual organocerium complexes.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{decay mode}} for {{isotopes}} lighter than 153Eu is electron capture, {{and the primary}} mode for heavier isotopes is beta minus decay. The primary decay products before 153Eu are isotopes of samarium (Sm) and the primary products after are isotopes of <b>gadolinium</b> (Gd).|$|E
5|$|The tetrafluoride, PrF4, is also known, and is {{produced}} by reacting a mixture of sodium fluoride and praseodymium(III) fluoride with fluorine gas, producing Na2PrF6, following which sodium fluoride {{is removed from the}} reaction mixture with liquid hydrogen fluoride. Additionally, praseodymium forms a bronze diiodide; like the diiodides of lanthanum, cerium, and <b>gadolinium,</b> it is a praseodymium(III) electride compound.|$|E
5|$|A synthetic, {{radioactive}} element, curium is a hard, dense metal with a silvery-white {{appearance and}} {{physical and chemical}} properties resembling those of <b>gadolinium.</b> Its melting point of 1340°C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637°C), plutonium (639°C) and americium (1173°C). In comparison, <b>gadolinium</b> melts at 1312°C. The boiling point of curium is 3110°C. With a density of 13.52 g/cm3, curium is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45 g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8 g/cm3), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of curium, the α-Cm is more stable at ambient conditions. It has a hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters a = 365 pm and c = 1182 pm, and four formula units per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum. At pressures above 23 GPa, at room temperature, α-Cm transforms into β-Cm, which has a face-centered cubic symmetry, space group Fmm and the lattice constant a = 493 pm. Upon further compression to 43 GPa, curium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Cm structure similar to that of α-uranium, with no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa. These three curium phases are also referred to as Cm I, II and III.|$|E
5|$|Curium has {{peculiar}} magnetic properties. Whereas {{its neighbor}} element americium shows no deviation from Curie-Weiss paramagnetism {{in the entire}} temperature range, α-Cm transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 65–52 K, and β-Cm exhibits a ferrimagnetic transition at about 205 K. Meanwhile, curium pnictides show ferromagnetic transitions upon cooling: 244CmN and 244CmAs at 109 K, 248CmP at 73 K and 248CmSb at 162 K. The lanthanide analogue of curium, <b>gadolinium,</b> {{as well as its}} pnictides, also show magnetic transitions upon cooling, but the transition character is somewhat different: Gd and GdN become ferromagnetic, and GdP, GdAs and GdSb show antiferromagnetic ordering.|$|E
5|$|Devices {{that must}} {{withstand}} extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as <b>gadolinium</b> gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E
5|$|Europium {{was first}} found in 1890 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who {{obtained}} basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not {{accounted for by}} samarium or <b>gadolinium.</b> However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and {{who was able to}} isolate it in 1901; he then named it europium.|$|E
5|$|High thorium {{concentrations}} {{are needed}} in nuclear applications; particularly, concentrations of atoms with high neutron capture cross-sections must be very low (for example, <b>gadolinium</b> concentrations must be lower than one part per million by weight). Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective complexation of Th4+ is used. For example, following alkaline digestion {{and the removal of}} phosphate, the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium, uranium, and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with tributyl phosphate in kerosene.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with magnetic data, electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature. There {{is a significant}} increase in resistivity over time (about 10 µΩ·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of curium {{is similar to that of}} <b>gadolinium</b> and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, polonium and thorium.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium {{aluminium}} garnet (Al5Lu3O12) {{has been}} proposed {{for use as a}} lens material in high refractive index immersion lithography. Additionally, a tiny amount of lutetium is added as a dopant to <b>gadolinium</b> gallium garnet (GGG), which is used in magnetic bubble memory devices. Cerium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography (PET). Lutetium aluminium garnet (LuAG) is used as a phosphor in LED light bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a silvery-white metal with {{a slight}} golden tinge that takes a high polish. It {{is one of only}} four {{elements}} that are magnetic at or near room temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and <b>gadolinium.</b> Its Curie temperature is , meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352nm, giving an atomic radius of 0.124nm. This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70GPa. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.|$|E
5|$|The {{similarities}} of yttrium to the lanthanides are {{so strong}} that the element has historically been grouped with them as a rare-earth element, and is always found in nature together with them in rare-earth minerals. Chemically, yttrium resembles those elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table, scandium, and if physical properties were plotted against atomic number, it would have an apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing it between the lanthanides <b>gadolinium</b> and erbium.|$|E
5|$|Nickel {{is one of}} four {{elements}} (iron, cobalt, nickel, and <b>gadolinium)</b> {{that are}} ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, 9% in plating and 4% in other applications, including the fast-growing battery sector. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.|$|E
5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to <b>gadolinium,</b> prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E
5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). <b>Gadolinium</b> can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} never {{found in nature}} in pure form, but it is found in small {{quantities}} in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and <b>gadolinium.</b> In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5mg/kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by moles. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 parts per million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 parts per million. Thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for promethium.|$|E
25|$|The drugs {{hydroxyurea}} and Motexafin <b>gadolinium</b> {{interfere with}} the action of this enzyme.|$|E
25|$|Chelate {{complexes}} of <b>gadolinium</b> {{are often}} used as contrast agents in MRI scans. Auranofin, a chelate complex of gold, {{is used in the}} treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} <b>gadolinium</b> gallium garnet, 32(GaO4)3 which is {{synthesized}} {{for use as}} a substrate for liquid-phase epitaxy of magnetic garnet films for bubble memory and magneto-optical applications.|$|E
25|$|MRI with <b>gadolinium</b> {{enhancement}} is {{the most}} useful neuroimaging test. This may show enhancement of the pia mater or white matter lesions that may resemble the lesions seen in multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Meningiomas are visualized readily with {{contrast}} CT, MRI with <b>gadolinium,</b> and arteriography, all {{attributed to}} the fact that meningiomas are extra-axial and vascularized. CSF protein usually is elevated if lumbar puncture is attempted.|$|E
25|$|Doping {{these with}} other {{lanthanide}} elements produces phosphors. As an example, <b>gadolinium</b> oxysulfide, Gd2O2S doped with Tb3+ produces visible photons when irradiated with high energy X-rays {{and is used}} as a scintillator in flat panel detectors.|$|E
25|$|Normally, <b>gadolinium</b> {{enhancement}} {{is used to}} show BBB disruption on MRIs. Abnormal {{tight junctions}} are present in both SPMS and PPMS. They appear in active white matter lesions and in gray matter in SPMS. They persist in inactive lesions, particularly in PPMS.|$|E
25|$|She {{performed}} numerous {{experiments in}} mineralogy, including {{the discovery of}} an insoluble residue of the rare mineral samarskite. This was later determined by other scientists to yield samarium and <b>gadolinium.</b> In 1879 she was recognized by the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers as their first female member.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exceptions}} of La, Yb, and Lu (which have no unpaired f electrons), the lanthanides are strongly paramagnetic, {{and this is}} reflected in their magnetic susceptibilities. <b>Gadolinium</b> becomes ferromagnetic at below 16°C (Curie point). The other heavier lanthanides – terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, and ytterbium – become ferromagnetic at much lower temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{poisoning}} is long-term repeated or {{continuous exposure}} to a poison where symptoms do not occur immediately or after each exposure. The patient gradually becomes ill, or becomes ill after a long latent period. Chronic poisoning most commonly occurs following exposure to poisons that bioaccumulate, or are biomagnified, such as mercury, <b>gadolinium,</b> and lead.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>gadolinium</b> {{agents have}} proved useful for {{patients}} with renal impairment, in patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis {{there is a risk}} of a rare but serious illness, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, which may be linked to the use of certain gadolinium-containing agents. The most frequently linked is gadodiamide, but other agents have been linked too. Although a causal link has not been definitively established, current guidelines in the United States are that dialysis patients should only receive <b>gadolinium</b> agents where essential, and that dialysis should be performed as soon as possible after the scan to remove the agent from the body promptly. In Europe, where more gadolinium-containing agents are available, a classification of agents according to potential risks has been released. Recently, a new contrast agent named gadoxetate, brand name Eovist (US) or Primovist (EU), was approved for diagnostic use: this has the theoretical benefit of a dual excretion path.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} {{majority}} of grown diamond substitutes, the idea of producing single-crystal cubic zirconia arose in the minds of scientists seeking a new and versatile material for use in lasers and other optical applications. Its production eventually exceeded that of earlier synthetics, such as synthetic strontium titanate, synthetic rutile, YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) and GGG (<b>gadolinium</b> gallium garnet).|$|E
25|$|There are two independent, {{fast-acting}} safety {{shutdown systems}} as well. Shutoff rods are held above the reactor by electromagnets, and drop under gravity {{into the core}} to quickly end criticality. This system works even {{in the event of}} a complete power failure, as the electromagnets only hold the rods out of the reactor when power is available. A secondary system injects a high-pressure <b>gadolinium</b> nitrate neutron absorber solution into the calandria.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the time}} that ion-exchange methods and elution were available, the {{separation}} of the rare earths was primarily achieved by repeated precipitation or crystallisation. In those days, the first separation was into two main groups, the cerium-group earths (scandium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium) and the yttrium-group earths (yttrium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium). Europium, <b>gadolinium,</b> and terbium were either considered as a separate group of rare-earth elements (the terbium group), or europium was included in the cerium group, and <b>gadolinium</b> and terbium were included in the yttrium group. The reason for this division arose from the difference in solubility of rare-earth double sulfates with sodium and potassium. The sodium double sulfates of the cerium group are difficultly soluble, those of the terbium group slightly, and those of the yttrium group are very soluble. Sometimes, the yttrium group was further split into the erbium group (dysprosium, holmium, erbium, and thulium) and the ytterbium group (ytterbium and lutetium), but today the main grouping is between the cerium and the yttrium groups.|$|E
25|$|All the {{trivalent}} lanthanide ions, except lanthanum and lutetium, have unpaired f electrons. However, {{the magnetic}} moments deviate considerably from the spin-only values because of strong spin-orbit coupling. The {{maximum number of}} unpaired electrons is 7, in Gd3+, with a magnetic moment of 7.94 B.M., but the largest magnetic moments, at 10.4–10.7 B.M., are exhibited by Dy3+ and Ho3+. However, in Gd3+ all the electrons have parallel spin and this property {{is important for the}} use of <b>gadolinium</b> complexes as contrast reagent in MRI scans.|$|E
25|$|For the {{elements}} up to 92 (uranium), naming elements after people was discouraged. The two exceptions are indirect, {{the elements}} being named after minerals that were themselves named after people. These were <b>gadolinium</b> (found in gadolinite, {{named after the}} Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin) and samarium (the mineral samarskite was named after a Russian mining engineer, Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets). Among the transuranium elements, this restriction was relaxed, there followed curium (after the Curies), einsteinium, fermium (Enrico Fermi), mendelevium (Dmitri Mendeleev), nobelium, and lawrencium (after Ernest Lawrence).|$|E
25|$|In 1881, the German {{physicist}} Emil Warburg put a {{block of}} iron into a strong magnetic field {{and found that it}} increased very slightly in temperature. Some commercial ventures to implement this technology are underway, claiming to cut energy consumption by 40% compared to current domestic refrigerators. The process works as follows: Powdered <b>gadolinium</b> is moved into a magnetic field, heating the material by 2 to 5°C (4 to 9°F). The heat is removed by a circulating fluid. The material is then moved out of the magnetic field, reducing its temperature below its starting temperature.|$|E
