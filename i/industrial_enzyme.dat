CTec 2.0 and LLC 4 are liquid enzymes, and # 7 is solid enzyme. The liquid enzyme {{was taken as}} water and {{the mass of the}} total liquid of the saccharification process was calculated. The # 7 enzyme is the solid enzyme produced by the adsorption of the liquid enzyme onto the solid bran particles and dried for the purpose of long-term storage. There is no need for the extraction step because the bran is hydrolyzed very quickly when the enzyme is put into the hydrolysis system and the cellulase enzyme adsorbed on the bran is releases into the hydrolysate. The filter paper activity was determined according to the NREL protocol LAP- 006 (Adney and Baker 1996). The cellobiase activity was determined using the method of Ghose (1987). The total protein concentration was determined by Bradford method using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as protein standard (Bradford 1976).
