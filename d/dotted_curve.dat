40|$|This {{research}} is conducted {{to study the}} effects of variables on polyhydroxybutyrate(PHB) production in 20 L batch stirred tank fermentations by using Cupriavidus necator. It consist of three major phases starting with scale up process, followed by fermentation process and mathematical analysis. The fermentation process is scaled up from the optimum condition in 500 mL shake flask to 20 L stirred tank bioreactor by approximating the set point values of air flowrate and agitation speed which gives the same dissolve oxygen tension (<b>DOT)</b> <b>curve</b> versus time. The closest <b>DOT</b> <b>curve</b> pattern to that of the optimum condition in 500 mL shake flask is achieved by the combination 230 RPM agitation speed and 10 L/min compressed air flowrate. This experiment is followed with fermentatin process involving the manipulation of the parameters agitation speed, temperature and initial glucose concentration. The 23 factorial experiment method is used to design the experiment around the set points of agitation speed and air flowrate which gave the optimum <b>DOT</b> <b>curve.</b> Among the experimental points, it is found that the highest yield of PHB is produced in condition of 210 RPM agitation speed, 32 ! temperature and 23 g/L initial glucose concentration. This experiment was followed by mathematical analysis using Yates’ Method to study the main effect and interactive effect of changing the level of experimental variables. The calculation proved that temperature has the biggest main effect on PHB production while the biggest interactive effect is from the combination of agitation speed and initial glucose concentration...|$|R

In order to overcome the problem original images are compensated for dot gain. The compensation is usually done by using a <b>dot</b> gain <b>curve</b> for each colour separation. In this paper we firstly show that using only one <b>dot</b> gain <b>curve</b> works well for black, but not for any of the other three colours, i. e. cyan, magenta or yellow. We also present a new approach to calculate colour values where three different curves are used for each colour separation. In order to evaluate the proposed approach we compare the results of our method with the results when only one <b>dot</b> gain <b>curve</b> is used for each colour, both for Murray-Davies and Yule-Nielsen models. In the case of only one <b>dot</b> gain <b>curve</b> for each separation we use the curve that gives a minimized ∆ELab using least squares method.

30|$|When {{the initial}} failure size {{interval}} ranges from 0.1 to 0.5, the mitigation strategies are more effective. When the <b>dotted</b> <b>curves</b> are {{compared with their}} solid counterparts, the indices on the <b>dotted</b> <b>curves</b> are reduced for the same initial failure sizes and the curves follow a more continuous second-order failure transition characteristic. The nodes infected ratio in Scenario 3 exhibits a second-order transition characteristic, which can be ascribed {{to the fact that}} bidirectional interdependencies have become unidirectional interdependencies and the operation of the cyber layer nodes does not depend on the states of the coupled physical layer. This phenomenon illustrates that, in interdependent networks, the interdependencies are the corridors through which the failures develop between the layers and exacerbate the propagation size of cascading failures. Meanwhile, the difference between the physical layer load shedding ratio and that in the benchmark scenario is the largest in this scenario. For the initial failure size that ranges from 0.05 to 0.2, the physical layer load shedding ratio decrease from more than 0.5 to less than 0.4. The application of UPFC expands the controllable variables in security control and improves the physical layer’s operation limit.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the color}} {{prediction}} models use single <b>dot</b> gain <b>curve,</b> few assume that dot gain changes when ink superposition happens, but still, use single <b>dot</b> gain <b>curve</b> for each ink to compensate the effective ink coverage. Considering the fact that optical dot gain {{is the effect of}} light scattering in paper, it is reasonable that light with different wavelength might produce different optical dot gain for each ink. In this study, for each primary ink we utilized three different curves obtained by CIEX, Y and Z, which approximately stand for three special wavelength bands, to calculate color coordinates. In addition, we noticed that <b>dot</b> gain <b>curves</b> obtained from the print samples with single ink printed on paper do not work well for the prints where ink is printed on another, or others. Therefore, <b>dot</b> gain <b>curves</b> for different ink superposition situations are optimized by matching the calculated tri-stimulus values of training patches to their measurement counterpoints. For each ink, dividing the dot gain into several dot gain actions responding to different ink superposition situations, we got the final dot gain as a group of multiple curves that takes into account all possible 'dot gain actions' with certain probability coefficients...|$|R

30|$|The plot in Fig.  2 is qualitatively {{similar to}} the stress–{{displacement}} plots in (Koyama et al. 2008; Malama and Kulatilake 2003). The displacement values represented by the solid line in Fig.  2 contain both the deformation (closure) of the fracture and the deformation (compression) of the bulk rock. As mentioned in (Koyama et al. 2008), the rightmost part of the solid curve corresponds to the elastic deformation of the bulk rock and is therefore linear in this simulation. The linear component of the deformation is plotted as a dashed line with triangular markers in Fig.  2. We now follow the procedure described in (Koyama et al. 2008) to extract the fracture deformation curve from these simulation data. Shifting the solid line leftwards so that it now passes through the origin produces the dashed line with square markers in Fig.  2. Shifting the dashed straight line with triangular markers leftwards, so that it now passes through the origin, produces the other dashed line with square markers in Fig.  2. Subtracting one dashed line with square markers from the other produces the dotted line, which is the fracture deformation curve.
