The remaining fibres which did not react with either anti-ALD or anti-I formed 58 % of the fibre population and reacted with an antiserum specific for fast myosin.

40|$|Sediment {{dissolved}} {{organic carbon}} (DOC) fluxes were determined in the oxygen minimum zone along the north-western Mexican margin using five different methods: in situ benthic chambers, on-deck incubations, slicing, dialysis sampling (peepers), and sipping. For {{each of the five}} methods, replicates (n 5 6 – 12) were made. Directly determined fluxes (whole-core incubations and benthic chambers) and calculated fluxes (sliced and dialysis-sampled cores) agree well (0. 41 6 0. 09, 0. 36 6 0. 04, 0. 25 6 0. 05, and 0. 25 6 0. 05 mmol C m 22 d 21, respectively). On the Mexican margin, the DOC flux was 8 % of the sedimentary carbon input, suggesting that it is a significant component to the local carbon budget. Extrapolations of this flux to the total <b>global</b> <b>margin</b> suggest that shelf and slope sediments contribute 96 Tg C yr 21. The residence time of oceanic DOC based on this flux is consistent with measurements of the deep-water DO 14 C age. Profiles were also constructed from sip-isolated pore waters and yield consistently lower DOC profile gradients and DOC fluxes (0. 06 6 0. 02 mmol C m 22 d 21). We propose that the consistently observed discrepancy between sip-isolated profiles and other isolation techniques is a result of sampling different reservoirs of pore water present in the heterogeneous sediment matrix. Oceanic nutrient budgets are influenced by the tight cou-pling between benthic and overlying water processes. Ex-amples include relationships between benthic biomass growth and production and the resulting oxygen demand (Rowe et al. 1991; Sayles et al. 1994), ammonium excretion (Henrickson et al. 1993), and particle input. The composi-tions of seawater solutes are, therefore, greatly influenced by sedimentary degradation and dissolution (Martin et al. 1991). This link between benthic and water column processes can also be extended to the cycling of organic matter.

40|$|Noting {{the role}} {{of power in the}} context of the {{globalisation}} politics of increasing consolidation of resources in the hands of the resource-rich, this article advances the culture-centred approach for public relations scholarship and practice. Drawing from postcolonial and subaltern studies theories, the culture-centred approach advances the concepts of contextual meanings and theorising from below that dialogically engage the voices of the grassroots, resisting the top-down Eurocentric production of knowledge that underlies the conceptualisations of democracy, capitalism, and civil society, three key conceptual threads constituting the theorising and practice of public relations. Our culturally centred theorising calls for a journey in solidarity for the researcher/practitioner with marginalised publics to co-construct meanings that challenge the hegemony of dominant structures, seeking to invert the top-down logics of power that perpetuate neoliberal hegemony, albeit under the name of democracy promotion, nation building, civil society promotion, etc. Culturally centred readings of public relations de-centre the taken-for-granted assumptions of Eurocentric practices and the power embodied in these practices, which are often framed in the language of altruism.

Methods: About 1, 565 adult outpatients with major depressive disorder receiving agomelatine completed the clinician-rated 16 -item quick inventory of depressive symptoms, Clinical Global Impression, and Multidimensional Assessment of Thymic States (MAThyS) rating scales at inclusion, Week 2 and Week 6. The MAThyS includes a 20 -item self-rated visual analog scale (from inhibition [0] to activation [10], with [5] representing the usual state) leading to five a priori dimensions (emotional reactivity, cognitive speed, psychomotor function, motivation, and sensory perception). Results: All MAThyS dimension scores increased from inclusion to Week 2 and from inclusion to Week 6 (P< 0. 001). Improvement was around 2 points (out of 10) for motivation, 1. 5 points for psychomotor function, and 0. 5 points for other dimensions. Motivation showed a trend to being more severely impaired at inclusion in future nonresponders (t= 1. 25, df= 1, 563, P= 0. 10). Its improvement at Week 2 was the most discriminating MAThyS dimension between future responders and nonresponders, and represents {{the best predictor of}} future response, with the highest area under the receptor operating characteristic curve (area under curve = 0. 616, 95 % confidence interval [0. 588 – 0. 643], P< 0. 001). Finally, improvements in motivation correlated the most strongly with clinician-rated 16 -item quick inventory of depressive symptoms improvement (r=- 0. 491, df= 1, 563, P< 0. 001).

40|$|The Mediterranean back-arc basins, once opened, {{are often}} rapidly {{submitted}} to inversion along the complex Eurasian-African convergent border. Along their continental margins, these small basins consist of heterogeneous systems that juxtapose lithospheres with different nature, mechanical behavior and structural inheritance. In this study, {{we focus on}} the northern Ligurian margin to examine how such complex systems might deform when they are submitted to compressive stress. The northern Ligurian margin, of Oligo-Miocene age, has been undergoing contraction over at least the last 6 Ma. Below the margin, active thrust faults responsible for the regional uplift of the continental edge have been proposed in previous works, but have never been imaged. Seaward of the margin, no recent or active crustal compressional structure has been identified so far in the oceanic domain, although seismicity extends as far as midway through the basin. We use seismic reflection data, including 72 - and 12 -channel high-resolution acquisitions (MALISAR, 2006 and FABLES, 2012) and 96 -channel deep-penetrating ones (MALIS, 1995), to image the Ligurian margin and the adjacent oceanic domain. In the seismic lines, the Messinian event, well dated over the Mediterranean (5. 96 - 5. 32 Ma) and well identified in the seismic stratigraphy, allows us to quantify the vertical deformation over the last 5. 3 Ma. The seismic reflection data set is interpreted together with 3 D-velocity-depth models deduced from wide-angle seismic data (GROSMARIN, 2008). Below the margin, the contraction is characterized by folds, south verging thrusts, tilted crustal blocks, and by a <b>global</b> <b>margin</b> uplift that exceeds 1500 m. Within the adjacent oceanic domain, noticeable deformation is restricted to large, SW-NE elongated salt walls located 10 to 40 km from the margin toe, over a 70 km length. We interpret them as resulting from combined deep-seated crustal and thin-skinned deformations. However, although the salt walls are well expressed in the seafloor morphology, their seismic images do not reveal any significant vertical throw across their trace, and the amount of deformation gradually disappears toward the structure ends. This suggests that the post-Messinian deformation taken along these features is moderate, compared to the margin. The synchronicity of the crustal deformation in the oceanic and the continental domains supports the idea that the lower deformation amounts observed within the deep basin are related to different mechanical behaviours within the continental margin and the adjacent oceanic domain, rather than the result of a recent basinward propagation of the deformation. Thermo-mechanical models suggest that mainly two factors could control the focused deformation along the margin: (1) the locus of highest topographic gradient of the main crustal interfaces, (2) the thermal contrast between the subsiding cooling oceanic domain and the uplifting warming margin. According to these models, the continental versus oceanic nature of the lithospheres would be of second order in the localization of the deformation...|$|E

First, a sufficient condition is proposed which indicates that the global optimal effect {{can be achieved by}} the fuzzily combined local optimal controllers. Based on this sufficient condition, we derive a local concept approach to designing the optimal fuzzy controller by applying traditional linear optimal control theory. The stability of the entire closed-loop continuous fuzzy system can be ensured by the designed optimal fuzzy controller. The optimal feedback continuous fuzzy system can not only be guaranteed to be exponentially stable, but also be stabilized to any desired degree. Also, the total energy of system output is absolutely finite. Moreover, the resultant feedback continuous fuzzy system possesses an infinite gain margin; that is, its stability is guaranteed no matter how large the feedback gain becomes. Two examples are given to illustrate the proposed optimal fuzzy controller design approach and to demonstrate the proved stability properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{volume and}} interplay of mass-transport (MTD) and turbidite-system {{deposits}} varies on different continental margins depending on local and external controls such as active-margin or passive-margin tectonic setting and climatic and/or sea-level change. Erosion and breaching of local grabens at the shelf {{edge of the}} southern Bering Sea produce giant, gullied canyons and MTD sheets that dominate the basin-floor deposition and disrupt development of turbidite systems. In contrast, external controls of great earthquakes (> 8 M w) along the Pacific active tectonic continental margins of Cascadia and northern California cause seismic strengthening of the sediment, which results in minor MTDs compared to turbidite-system deposits. Messinian desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea caused a deeply eroded Ebro subaerial canyon and an unstable central segment with an MTD sheet, whereas other stable Ebro margin segments have only turbidite systems. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the delta-fed Mississippi Fan and intraslope mini-basins contain MTDs and turbidites that are equally intermixed from the largest scales with MTD sheets hundreds of kilometers long to the smallest scales with beds centimeters thick. In the Antarctic Wilkes Land <b>margin,</b> <b>global</b> climate cooling caused a late Oligocene to middle Miocene time of temperate continental ice sheets that resulted in massive deposition of MTDs on the margin, whereas later polar ice sheets favored development of turbidite systems.

This study reports new stratigraphically-constrained LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb data from Precambrian rocks exposed in the westernmost {{part of the}} Alxa Block, to constrain their ages and provenance. Ages obtained for a granitic gneiss from the Longshoushan Group are mainly discordant yielding an upper intercept near 1200 Ma and a lower intercept between ∼ 350 and ∼ 310 Ma, indicating the protolith for the granitic gneiss intruded during the Mesoproterozoic, and the gneissic fabric formed in late Paleozoic associated with the accretion of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Detrital zircons of a meta-sandstone from Pre-Sinian strata yielded predominant Mesoproterozoic ages with bimodal peaks at ∼ 1166 Ma and ∼ 1375 Ma. These ages are interpreted as tectonic events associated with the long-lived accretion and collision processes coeval with the amalgamation of the Rodinia supercontinent. The youngest concordant zircon age of 968 ± 70 Ma constrains its maximum depositional age to the Stenian-Tonian boundary. Two metasedimentary rocks from the Sinian strata share similar age patterns, yielding an earliest Paleoproterozoic peak at ∼ 2469 – 2460 Ma, and two Tonian peaks at ∼ 992 – 978 Ma and ∼ 826 – 807 Ma. The youngest detrital zircon ages constrain their maximum depositional age to be latest Neoproterozoic. The detrital age patterns, as well as zircon morphology, indicate that the protoliths for these metasedimentary rocks were probably deposited in collision-related foreland basins. Our new data combined with published data indicate that the Alxa Block is not a uniform early Precambrian craton like the North China Craton, but a Precambrian composite ribbon continent which originally detached from a main cratonic accretionary and collisional margin. The Alxa Block, like the South China Craton, underwent a multi-stage tectono-thermal evolution related to the assembly of Rodinia and Gondwana supercontinents during <b>global</b> plate <b>margin</b> reorganization. Current data support a close affinity of the Alxa Block to the SCC during the Precambrian. During the Paleozoic, the Alxa ribbon continent behaved as a backbone to the Paleo-Asian Ocean to the north, on which early Paleozoic-Permian magmatic arcs were built forming the southernmost segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} different explanations-initial conditions, {{openness to}} trade and FDI, and institutions-of the Mauritian growth experience since the mid- 1970 s. We show that arguments based on openness to trade and FDI are either misleading or incomplete, and the transmission mechanism insufficiently identified. However, even when correctly articulated, openness {{appears to be}} a proximate rather than an underlying explanation for the Mauritian experience. The institution-based explanation offers greater promise. Ultimately, however, the econometric results indicate that existing explanations may be incomplete. Some idiosyncratic factors, particularly Mauritian diversity and the responses to managing it, may provide the missing pieces in the story of Mauritius''s success.

40|$|The government’s strong {{monetary}} and fiscal policy framework, {{as well as}} the structural reforms introduced, have enabled the Canadian economy to respond flexibly to recent shocks and laid a solid foundation for recovery. Macroeconomic policies should remain supportive, with fiscal policy continuing to focus on sustained debt reduction and structural reforms geared toward boosting productivity. Canada’s commitment to exchange rate flexibility has been helpful in facilitating the adjustment of global macroeconomic imbalances. Ensuring that regulatory and other policies support productivity, growth remains a key long-term challenge.
