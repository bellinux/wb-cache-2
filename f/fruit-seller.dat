60|$|At Meran, under Schloss Tirol, {{people were}} {{streaming}} across the meadows {{into the open}} theatre. Here were tall fellows in mountain dress, with leather breeches, bare knees, and hats with eagles' feathers; here were <b>fruit-sellers,</b> burghers and their wives, mountebanks, actors, and every kind of visitor. The audience, packed into an enclosure of high boards, sweltered under the burning sun. Cousin Teresa, tall and thin, with hard, red cheeks, shaded her pleasant eyes with her hand.|$|R
60|$|The {{evening of}} such a day, {{in a city with}} the habits of Venice, was not likely to be spent in the dulness of retirement. The great square of St. Mark was again filled with its active and motley crowd, and the scenes already {{described}} in the opening chapters of this work were resumed, if possible, with more apparent devotion to the levities of the hour, than on the occasion mentioned. The tumblers and jugglers renewed their antics, the cries of the <b>fruit-sellers</b> and other venders of light luxuries were again mingled with the tones of the flute and the notes of the guitar and harp; while the idle and the busy, the thoughtless and the designing, the conspirator and the agent of the police, once more met in privileged security.|$|R

6000|$|J----- and I now wandered by {{ourselves}} along a circular line of quays, having, {{on one side}} of us, a thick forest of masts, while, on the other, was a sweep of shops, bookstalls, sailors' restaurants and drinking-houses, <b>fruit-sellers,</b> candy-women, and all manner of open-air dealers and pedlers; little children playing, and jumping the rope, and such a babble and bustle as I never saw or heard before; the sun lying along the whole sweep, very hot, and evidently very grateful to those who basked in it. Whenever I passed into the shade, immediately from too warm I became too cold. The sunshine was like hot air; the shade, like the touch of cold steel,--sharp, hard, yet exhilarating. From the broad street of the quays, narrow, thread-like lanes pierced up between the edifices, calling themselves streets, yet so narrow, that a person in the middle could almost touch the houses on either hand. They ascended steeply, bordered on each side by long, contiguous walls of high houses, and from the time of their first being built, could never have had a gleam of sunshine in them,--always in shadow, always unutterably nasty, and often pestiferous. The nastiness which I saw in Marseilles exceeds my heretofore experience. There is dirt in the hotel, and everywhere else; and it evidently troubles nobody,--no more than if all the people were pigs in a pigsty. [...] .|$|R
50|$|Vasu and {{the other}} trapped macaques are {{released}} in a forest far away from Jaipur, where they meet many other macaques that have been similarly caught and released from Delhi. While in the city, Vasu's 50-member troop is left with newly recruited Zamir as the only powerful male being capable enough to be the leader. A new day starts and Zamir already has plans for the highest job. But for that, he must prove it. He has to find a source of food for his troop. He leads the troop towards the city's fruit market, being unaware it's {{the area of the}} formidable Fang. Yet early in the morning, either Fang nor any of the <b>fruit-sellers</b> are seen in the market as the market hasn't opened yet. At the Galta temple, members of the Galta Gang have now stopped any further investigation about Kavi, and are instead roaming in the city, facing the monkey catcher Dhanna Lal and his team. Meanwhile, in the forest, Vasu and his fellows find a road and start going along its ends, in the hopes of returning to the city and reuniting with the separated troop. In the city, Zamir finds no food available to loot as he leads the troop to a gem store where they once again find nothing edible and only beautiful gems. At the same time the Galta Gang takes shelter in a busy Hanuman temple amidst the city, where the gang is free from all the dangers of the monkey catching team as in a Hanuman temple, monkeys are respected and devotees would oppose their catching. The devotees present at the temple also offer fruits to the gang, although Binita is interested in stealing away sandals of devotees. Meanwhile, at the gem store, Zamir flees away with his troop after creating all the chaos, leaving Fang and his troop at the scene. Zamir now tries his luck in a hotel, and succeeds as he finds the food store of the hotel, where plenty of food items are stored. Zamir's troop members eat away everything present, and happily accept Zamir as their new leader. Zamir acts like humans by celebrating the victory with alcohol drinks. At 'Help In Suffering', the team on duty gets a call regarding an injured macaque, putting Suresh Valmiki in fear as he assumes it might be Kavi. The team rushes towards the site, finds a macaque and quickly returns to the base. At the base it's revealed that the macaque they bought was an injured female along with a newborn baby. The female was left alone and separated by her troop. Suresh is happy to see it's not Kavi. But Kavi is finally seen in the city, where he meets none other than Zamir. Being away from the Galta Gang for months, Kavi is unaware of the fact that Zamir is no more a part of the gang and has a troop of his own. Zamir seems happy to see Kavi, and happily recruits the young macaque in his newly acquired gang.|$|R
50|$|Through 'Micro-Finance Program for Flood Affected People', 6 {{different}} people shortlisted by Al-Khidmat Foundation, {{were provided with}} the basic elements necessary to resume their business activities so they may start supporting their families again. In this regard, a Taxi Driver whose taxi was damaged due to water from severe flood was {{given the opportunity to}} repair his taxi and buy new engine for it, as his entire family was solely dependent on the earnings coming from that taxi. Among others was also an owner of a small electric store, whose shop was washed away in flood and he had lost all his equipment and instruments in the water. New equipment and other electric store items were bought for him too so that he may start his business again and stand on his own feet. Similarly a crockery store owner, whose utensils were all lost in the flood, was bought new crockery items for his shop to lay a foundation for him to start earning again. Also a Milk-man was helped by buying him 3 milk cartons and 80 liters of milk to revive his business. A <b>fruit-seller</b> who had lost everything in the floods was bought fruit items and the food stall to help him set up his fruit shop again. In this regard, an independent electrician was helped too by providing him his necessary electric items (electric board, instruments etc.) to facilitate a fresh start of his professional activities.|$|E
40|$|Never have culture, aesthetics, and {{politics}} become more intertwined {{than during the}} current uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. The regions Hip Hop musicians have not only joined in the protests, but also have planted the seeds of revolt. Twenty-one year old Tunisian rapper Hamada Ben Amor, or El General, released his incendiary rap song 'Rais Lebled' “Oh President of the Country,” {{a few days before}} the Tunisian revolt, around the time when Tunisian <b>fruit-seller</b> Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire. The song directly addressed then-Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, inspiring thousands of young Tunisians to take to the streets and launching an unprecedented wave of protests in the Arab world. The mushrooming of social networks on Facebook and Twitter was by far the most instrumental factor in the escalation of events. Hundreds of thousands joined Facebook groups where circulation of such videos like Ben Amor's hip-hop songs took place. ...|$|E
40|$|On 14 th January 2011, President Ben Ali {{was forced}} to flee Tunis after twenty-three years in power. The {{revolution}} began in December 2010 with the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a young <b>fruit-seller</b> who was acting in protest against the repressive and corrupt regime. The overthrow of the dictatorship went on to influence uprisings across the Arab world, and these became known in the West as the ‘Arab Spring’. Since 2011 Tunisia has witnessed a surge in creative production, {{and the role of}} art itself has been an important feature of the country’s political revolution. This thesis seeks to open up a new field by focusing on the literary output of two female travel writers of Tunisian origin, Colette Fellous and Dora Latiri, who both produced works of travel literature based on their journeys back to their homeland {{in the wake of the}} revolution. Fellous and Latiri have spent most of their adult lives living in Europe, having been exiled from Tunisia when they were young women. In Latiri’s 'Un amour de tn: Carnet d’un retour au pays natal après la revolution', photographs are woven into a fragmented and very personal narrative which highlights not only visions of contemporary Tunisia, but also the narrator’s difficult memories of her childhood. 'La Préparation de la vie' by Fellous similarly charts the narrator’s journey back to post-revolutionary Tunisia and brings to light the little-known phenomenon of the exile of Jewish communities from the country following the Arab-Israeli Six Day War in 1967. Both writers are haunted by feelings of dislocation from Tunisia yet seem compelled to keep returning to it. The literature of these writers has an intricate relationship to many contemporary debates related to cultural identity. I will draw on postcolonial theory to explore and compare the different ways in which Fellous and Latiri represent their journeys back to Tunisia, analysing how the genre of the travel narrative incorporating photos enables them to articulate their complex relationships to it as their homeland and their identities as Tunisian women. The aim of this dissertation is to illuminate the identity dilemmas that arose out of the specific problems that the writers encountered when they responded to their exile from Tunisia. We need narrative- the very process of putting a story together- to make identity meaningful and comprehensible. By addressing these two recent life-narratives that have come out of the immediate wake of the 2011 revolution, we can begin to map the ways in which Tunisian women, writing from the margins of the Tunisian nation, are contributing to debates about identity at this pivotal moment in the country’s history...|$|E
