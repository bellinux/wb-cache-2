Foram aplicados os herbicidas {{trifluralin}} e EPTC em pré-plantio com incorporação e chloroxuron, DCPA, <b>diphenamid,</b> pendimethalin e diuron em pré -emergência. Houve maior incidência de gramíneas que foram controladas por todos os herbicidas, exceto chloroxuron, sendo o controle pelo EPTC de 83 % e pelos demais, acima de 90 %. Para as dicotiledóneas, o controle foi na seguinte ordem decrescente: pendimethalin, chloroxuron, diuron, trifluralin, EPTC, DCPA e <b>diphenamid.</b> O EPTC afetou a germinação de bulbos, causando, também, retenção de crescimento e atraso no ciclo. No florescimento, as hastes florais foram colhidas, medidas e pesadas, verificando-se redução significativa de peso de matéria fresca com o tratamento EPTC para o cultivar Spick and Span, e com trifluralin, EPTC, chloroxuron e pendimetha lin para o White Friendship. The {{weed control}} by herbicides {{and their effects}} on gladioli was evaluated on a field experiment on sandy-loam soil on CV Spick and Span and White Friendship. Trifluralin and EPTC were applied pre-plant incorporated and chloroxuron, DCPA, <b>diphenamid,</b> pendim et halin and diuron in pre-emergence. Grass species were predominant {{in the area and}} were controled by all herbicides except chloroxuron. Control by EPTC was of 83 % and over 90 % by all others. The broadleaves were controled in the following decrescent order: pendimethalin, chloroxuron, diuron, trifluralin, EPTC, DCPA and <b>diphenamid.</b> Only EPTC affected the sprouting of bulbs, causing also growth retention and delaying of flower set. The flowers stems were cut off a the opening of the first flower, measured and weighted. EPTC caused significant reduction in weight of CV Spick and Span and trifluralin, EPTC, chloroxuron and pendimethalin of CV White Friendship...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to determine the}} best chemical weed control method for us in establishing new plantings of ground covers. Varying levels of herbicides, different mulches, and activated carbon as a protectant were tested at Newark, Delaware during 1969 and 1970. The experimental design was a split plot, and was replicated three times. The ground cover plants studied were Aiuga reptans, Hedera helix, Pachysandra terminalis, and Vinca minor. Herbicides studied were simazine (4 lbs. /A), dichlobenil (6 lbs. /A), <b>diphenamid</b> (6 lbs. /A), simazine (2 lbs. /A) combined with <b>diphenamid</b> (4 lbs. /A), and dichlobenil (4 lbs. /A) combined with <b>diphenamid</b> (4 lbs. /A). Mulches studied were licorice root (on-inch depth) and “FoliCote” (diluted in ater at a ratio of one to five). On half of all plant material was root-dipped in activated carbon. Herbicide toxicity to the ground cover was rated by a standard visual evaluation on a scale from one to five. Weed infestation was determined as stand (number of plants) and vigor (dry weight in grams). Growth of ground cover plants was measured by using a grid, and the percentage of ground covered by the plants within this grid was estimated. The stand (number of plants) and the vigor (fresh weight in grams) of the ground cover plants was also determined. With no mulch, weed control studies indicated that dry weight production of Panicum dichotomiflorum (fall panicum) was significantly reduced by the simazine-diphenamid and the dichlobenil-diphenamid herbiced treatments. Also with no mulch, the stand and vigor of Portulaca oleracea (purslane) was significantly reduced by simazine (4 lbs. /A), <b>diphenamid</b> (6 lbs. /A), and the simazine-diphenamid combination. The no mulch-herbicide treatments were not effective in controlling Eragrostis cilianesis (stinkgrass) and Amaranthus retroflexus (redroot pigweed). However, studies indicated that weed control of all weed species was significantly improved when licorice root mulch was applied to a one-inch depth over all herbicide treatments. Herbicide injury studies indicated that activated carbon did detoxify all herbicides tested. Plants root-dipped in activated carbon showed less herbicide injury, greater fresh weight, and more growth (percentage of ground covered) than those plants that were not so treated...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{persistence}} of DCPA, trifluralin, <b>diphenamid,</b> diuron, and prometryne was studied in three soils which were {{located at the}} Kula, Poamoho, and Waimanalo Experiment Stations. The order of decreasing persistency was diuron, prometryne, trifluralin, DCPA, and <b>diphenamid.</b> Diuron and prometryne activities were recorded {{for at least six}} months and diuron phytotoxicity was noted in the Poamoho plot, one year after application. Degradation was faster when the herbicides were applied the second time in the same plots. For example, DCPA was inactivated between 60 - 80 days after application in the Poamoho soil, in the second application, inactivation took place in 40 - 60 days. This indicated that herbicide accumulation or build up was not an important factor in successive croppings. Tilling the soil did not seem to affect inactivation with the exception of prometryne. The bio-assay plants in the prometryne plots showed less phytotoxic symptoms than those grown in soils from untilled areas. Inactivation was most evident in the Waimanalo soil which has montmorillonite as one of the predominant clays. Adsorption and micro-degradation appeared to be the dominant factors in degradation. Inactivation was not related to herbicide solubility, even under high rainfall conditions. Photo-decomposition and volatilization were minimized by rainy periods soon after application. The data indicated that sensitive crops like lettuce could be resown in soil treated with <b>diphenamid,</b> DCPA, and trifluralin at 20 to 40, 20 to 60, and 40 to 80 days, respectively. A phytotoxicity study at Poamoho and Waimanalo indicated that more variations existed in toxicity symptoms between lettuce and cucumber than between soil types of the two locations. Subjective rating of the bio-assay crops (lettuce and cucumber) appeared to be a satisfactory method of evaluating phytotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{petroleum}} mulches on plant response to herbicides were {{studied at the}} Farmington Field Station. The herbicides were applied to the soil preemergent and by incorporation at one-half, normal and double the recommended rates with asphalt overlay. The herbicides and crops used were : Atrazine and Ramrod on sweet corn, PEBC and <b>Diphenamid</b> on tomatoes and EPTC and Trifluralin on snap beans. Germination, overall crop rating, grass and broad leafed weed control and yields were measured. Data recorded from these trials showed that herbicides are as effective under the asphalt when compared to plots with herbicide but no asphalt. Considering all herbicides and conditions, overall crop growth and weed control were not increased or decreased by the asphalt mulch. Germination and yield were not affected by the interaction of herbicides with the asphalt overlay on the three crops...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{homogeneous}} and heterogeneous degradations of <b>diphenamid</b> (DPA) in {{aqueous solution}} were conducted by direct photolysis with UVC (254 nm) and by photocatalysis with TiO 2 /UVA (350 nm), and the experimental results were compared. It {{was found that the}} homogeneous photolysis by UVC irradiation alone was quite efficient to degrade DPA up to 100 % after 360 min, but was very inefficient to mineralize its intermediates in terms of dissolved organic carbon reduction of only 8 %. In contrast, the heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO 2 /UVA showed relatively a lower degree of DPA degradation (51 %), but a higher degree of its mineralization (11 %) after 360 min. These results reveal that the photocatalysis process has relatively poor selectivity to degrade different compounds including various intermediates from the DPA degradation, which is beneficial to its mineralization. In addition, over 20 intermediates were identified by LC-MS and 1 H NMR analyses. Based on the identified intermediates, the reaction mechanisms and the detailed pathways of the DPA degradation by photolysis and photocatalysis were proposed, and are presented in this paper. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The photocatalysed {{degradation}} of various selected pesticide derivatives, namely N,N-Dimethyl-α-phenyl benzene acetamide (<b>Diphenamid)</b> [1], 1, 2 -diethyl phthalate (DEP) [2], 5 -bromo- 3 -sec. butyl- 6 -methyl uracil (Bromacil) [3], 3 -tert-butyl- 5 -chloro- 6 -methyluracil (Terbacil), 2, 4, 5 -tribromoimidazole (TBI) [4], Methoxychlor, Chlorothalonil and Disulfoton [5] {{as well as}} that of two selected priority organic pollutants, namely benzidine and 1, 2 -diphenyhydrazine (DPH) [6], has been investigated in aqueous suspensions of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) under a variety of conditions. The degradation was studied by monitoring the change in substrate concentration employing UV spectroscopic analysis or HPLC technique and the decrease in total organic carbon (TOC) content, respectively, as a function of irradiation time. The degradation kinetics was studied under different conditions such as reaction pH, substrate and photocatalyst concentration, type of photocatalysts and the presence of alternative additives such as H 2 O 2, KBrO 3 and (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8 besides molecular oxygen. The degradation rates and the photonic efficiencies were found to be strongly influenced by the above parameters. A toxicity test was performed for irradiated samples of few selected systems measuring the luminescence of bacteria Vibrio fischeri after 30 minutes of incubation...|$|E
