5|$|The club's {{supporters}} {{have been involved}} in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 Juventus supporters were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters, and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990–91 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990. Twenty-seven <b>fans</b> <b>were</b> arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial.

25|$|Of {{the many}} {{communities}} that {{were affected by}} the disaster, the Caraballeda <b>fan</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the most}} hard-hit.

Second, it lies {{at the mouth of the}} Quebrada San Julián (Saint Julian Ravine), and this watershed produced very large boulders and a massive inundated area.

5|$|A 1997 {{match against}} Coleraine was {{abandoned}} when Linfield fans hurled bottles onto the pitch after two Linfield players were sent off. In May 2005 there were disturbances in Dublin at the Setanta Cup final between Linfield and Shelbourne. In the same month, Linfield <b>fans</b> <b>were</b> banned from travelling to the Oval for a match against Glentoran, allegedly {{as a result}} of disturbances involving both sets of fans the previous month. However, Glentoran denied this was the reason behind the ban, citing health and safety regulations that forced them to close the away stand. In 2008, three Linfield <b>fans</b> <b>were</b> charged in a Dublin court with public order offences at a Setanta Cup match against St Patrick's Athletic, but were released. In November of the same year, Linfield player Conor Hagan was struck by a rocket that was fired from Cliftonville supporters in the crowd following Linfield's 2–1 defeat, and the following month riot police were called into Glentoran supporters in the Boxing Day match after Linfield had taken a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Although the two clubs {{claimed to}} have sold most of the 42,000 tickets {{allocated}} to them, only about 25,000 <b>fans</b> <b>were</b> said to have travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom, with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game. According {{to the head of}} the Russian national tourist office, Mikhail Ignatiev, many <b>fans</b> <b>were</b> put off by the cost of travel and accommodation. Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were full on the night of the game. As some fans looked to offload tickets to the match, The Moscow Times reported that the black-market price dropped from a high of €2,000 (£1,600) to around €500 (£400), while Russian TV channel Sport-1 was reporting prices as low as £300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow. Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan and Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of works {{featuring}} LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT fans.

However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian <b>fans</b> <b>were</b> not regarded as a unified interest group.
