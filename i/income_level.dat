5|$|The {{number of}} the members was not fixed; it varied from over 200 (with 289 in 1782 and 213 in 1817) to as low as 41 (in 1834); in most years the Sejm had {{averaged}} 60 to 80 deputies. They were composed of clergy, nobility (either titled or above a certain, relatively high, <b>income</b> <b>level),</b> two deputies {{from the city of}} Lviv representing the burghers and later, chancellor of the University of Lwów. The members were not elective, holding the mandates due to their offices, titles or wealth. This made the Sejm not representative, and rather conservative.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} phase, {{starting}} in June 2012, {{half of the}} funds from energy and food subsidies will be re-allocated {{to the people and}} the remaining 50% will go to the industrial sector. If approved by the Parliament, the government will pay an extra cash handout of 280,000 rials/month to 80% of the general population (i.e. people earning less than $2000/month, which is a comfortable <b>income</b> <b>level</b> in Iran). In July 2012, it was announced that implementation of the second phase was suspended awaiting further adjustments by the government and because of raising inflation (around 22% as of April 2012). Finally, in fall 2013, the parliament approved a plan to drop 22 million Iranians—the top 30 percent of earners—from the subsidy system instead. Yet, it was reported in 2014 that out of Iran’s population of 77 million, 73.6 million registered to receive the cash hand-outs.|$|E
5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of the poverty line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any <b>income</b> <b>level.</b> Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The {{economical}} situation Tubas {{during the}} 199399 period was prosperous, however {{since the start}} of the Second Intifada in 200001, Tubas' <b>income</b> <b>level</b> has decreased by roughly 40%. Prior to the Intifada, the average household income was 2,500 NIS, receding to about 1,500 NIS. A major factor that has resulted from the conflict was the confiscation of agricultural land located within the city's or its governorate's jurisdiction by Israeli settlements or military authorities. According to the PCBS, in 1999, approximately 52% of the citizens were within the working age (15-64). Of the city's labor force, 48% are females. The unemployment rate increased dramatically from 20% in 1999 to 70% after the year 2000. Prior to the Intifada, 35% of the total labor force worked in Israel.|$|E

25|$|Generally, the {{well-being}} {{of those who are}} employed is higher than those who are unemployed. Employment itself may not increase subjective well-being, but facilitates activities that do (such as supporting a family, philanthropy, and education). While work does increase well-being through providing income, <b>income</b> <b>level</b> is not as indicative of subjective well-being as other benefits related to employment. Feelings of autonomy and mastery, found in higher levels in the employed than unemployed, are stronger predictors of subjective well-being than wealth.|$|E
