5|$|In mid-2006, an RAAF F-111 {{was chosen}} to scuttle the North Korean ship Pong Su which had been {{involved}} in one of Australia's largest drug hauls in recorded history. The ship <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> Snails Bay, off Birchgrove, while the government considered its fate, and it was decided in March 2006 it would be scuttled by air attack. The Pong Su was sunk on 23 March 2006 by two GBU-10 Paveway II laser-guided bombs.|$|E
5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of}} the Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|The paratroopers' first {{assault on}} the palace met with {{surprising}} resistance. The Presidential Guardsmen who stood between the rebels and Diệm were estimated at between 30 and 60, but they managed to repel the initial thrust and kill seven rebels who attempted to scale the palace walls and run across the grass. The rebels cordoned off the palace and held fire. They trucked in reinforcements and the attack restarted at 7:30, but the Presidential Guard continued to resist. Half an hour later, the rebels brought in five armored vehicles and circumnavigated the palace. They fired at the perimeter posts, and mortared the palace grounds. However, the exchange had petered out by 10:30. In the meantime, the rebels had captured the national police offices, Radio Saigon and the barracks of the Presidential Guard. They had also put most of the Saigon-based generals under house arrest, meaning that Diệm's saviours {{would have to come}} from outside Saigon. However, the rebels also suffered a setback when Hong was killed during the battle for the police headquarters. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> his jeep behind the frontline when he was hit by stray gunfire.|$|E

25|$|Carlson {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in Adelaide and almost {{died at the}} age of six following an incident with a train. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a cart beside a shop when the horse became uncontrollable and backed onto railway tracks, just as a train was approaching. The train ran over the cart and Carlson was thrown out upon impact. With only a minor scalp wound, Carlson was later found safe under the train after it had stopped.|$|E
25|$|Jack Wrather, a local millionaire, {{had fallen}} in love with the ship because he and his wife, Bonita Granville, had fond {{memories}} of sailing on it numerous times. Wrather signed a 66-year lease with the city of Long Beach to operate the entire property. He oversaw the display of the Spruce Goose, on long-term loan. The immense plane, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a hangar in Long Beach for decades unseen by the public, was installed in a huge geodesic dome adjacent to the liner in 1983, attracting increased attendance.|$|E
25|$|More than 20 {{additional}} {{people were}} injured in the explosion, {{one of whom was}} Addie Mae's younger sister, 12-year-old Sarah Collins, who had 21 pieces of glass embedded in her face and was blinded in one eye. In her later recollections of the bombing, Collins would recall that in the moments immediately before the explosion, she had observed her sister, Addie, tying her dress sash. Another sister of Addie Mae Collins, 16-year-old Junie Collins, would later recall that shortly before the explosion, she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the basement of the church reading the Bible and had observed Addie Mae Collins tying the dress sash of Carol Denise McNair before she had herself returned upstairs to the ground floor of the church.|$|E

25|$|The two McLaren {{drivers were}} the first two drivers out on the track for the initial fuel burning phase, and initially, Alonso was the fastest on the track. After {{the first set of}} pit stops it looked like Alonso was going to take the pole. On the last set of laps, Alonso was on a faster time than he was before, but Räikkönen was on a faster. Both of them {{completed}} their laps and Räikkönen came out on top, despite an error coming out of the final corner. Hamilton who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> fourth did not look like he was very competitive during qualifying. In the last few seconds of the session he set the fastest lap and put himself on pole position, and {{he was the only one}} to break into the 1 minute 19 second margin.|$|E
25|$|After Penny’s autopsy {{revealed}} {{that she had}} ingested a lethal amount of liquid nicotine, Grissom and his team noted that there were traces of glue {{on the model of}} Penny’s back, and on the chair that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in.</b> This led them to believe that the killer had assumed that Penny would have died in her chair from her poisoned cherry brandy, not expecting her to go into convulsions. As Penny stood up in her spastic fits, the killer revealed herself, previously hiding behind Penny, and threw Penny through the window. With the miniature already made to depict Penny dead in her chair, the killer showed signs of obsessive habits, having to fix the model by rearranging it to match the actual death scene before it could be seen by anybody else. This explained why the miniature was not at the scene of death as the first one had been. A camera from Penny Garden's neighborhood showed Ernie Dell (Natalie's foster father) delivering the miniature wearing a jacket with a train symbol on the back.|$|E
25|$|On September 17, 1948, Bernadotte came to Jerusalem in a {{car with}} General Åge Lundström on his way to meet Israeli {{official}} Dov Yosef, who was then the military governor of the Israeli-controlled portion of Jerusalem's New City. Bernadotte's car was stopped by an Israeli Army Jeep at a roadblock in the Katamon neighborhood. Cohen ran from the Jeep pointed a gun inside the car and shot at Bernadotte and the others {{in the back seat of}} the car at point-blank range, riddling him with bullets. Bernadotte had been hit six times, killing him almost instantaneously. The car was driven at full speed to Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus, but doctors there were unable to do anything for Bernadotte, who was bleeding profusely from his wounds. French Army Colonel André Serot, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the back seat next to Bernadotte, was also killed. The tires of the other vehicles in Bernadotte's convoy had been shot out, and the hit team fled to Shaarei Pina, where they were hidden by haredi supporters of Lehi, before moving on to Tel Aviv in a furniture truck.|$|E

500|$|Markley {{continued}} his playboy lifestyle at a beach house he purchased in Los Angeles. He produced Jim Stallings' (J. J. Light) European hit [...] "Heya" [...] and the {{album of the}} same name before vanishing from the music business. According to various accounts by band members and Fowley, in 1972 Markley had evaded imprisonment and kept a low-profile after an incident involving two underage girls. Markley sporadically contacted his former bandmates; however, Fowley recollected a conversation with Stallings in 1992: [...] "He [...] told me that Bob <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> this rowing boat on a lake near Las Vegas - he was like a recluse. It got loose from its moorings and he drifted off alone for a day and a half. He was already pretty messed up, but he got very badly dehydrated. When they eventually found him he was taken to some hospital and placed on a life-support system, unable to speak or think". Markley died on September 9, 2003 in a hospital in Gardena, California; he was 68.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Parkes, Lord Wilton and William Rathbone {{were the}} first to reach Huskisson. They found that a wheel had passed over his right calf and thigh, leaving his knee itself untouched. A flap of skin on his upper leg had been cut back, exposing the muscles, and the exposed arteries had not been severed but were flattened, pulsing with Huskisson's heartbeat. The damaged leg shook uncontrollably. Observers noted that Huskisson {{did not appear to be}} in pain, and instead lay {{watching}} the leg shake. Huskisson shouted [...] "This is the death of me". Parkes attempted to reassure him, but Huskisson replied [...] "Yes, I am dying, call Mrs Huskisson". A man threw his coat over William Huskisson's leg to spare Emily Huskisson from seeing the extent of his injuries, and she was helped from the carriage in which she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting.</b> <b>In</b> hysterics, she attempted to throw herself onto Huskisson, but was restrained by fellow passengers as Lord Wilton applied a makeshift tourniquet he had made using handkerchiefs and an elderly passenger's walking stick. Other passengers ripped the door of a nearby railway storeroom from its hinges, to serve as a makeshift stretcher. Huskisson was lifted onto the door, shaking his head and saying [...] "Where is Mrs Huskisson? I have met my death, God forgive me." [...] (Garfield, writing in 2002, gives his words as [...] "This is my death, God forgive me".) ...|$|E

So in the end a 40 Watt light bulb was built inside the box holding the pads, electronic circuitry and relays, to heat up the unit when the instrument <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a car and then put on a stage in a relatively warm, damp environment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{body of the}} air hostess {{was found}} in the cockpit rather than near the hostess's seat {{at the rear of the}} {{passenger}} cabin. The Chief Pilot of Queensland Airlines suggested the pilot would have examined the waybill and would have been aware the aircraft was tail-heavy. [...] It was likely he asked the air hostess to sit in the cockpit during the take-off to eliminate the tail-heaviness. [...] The Chief Pilot told the inquest the loading chart indicated that if the air hostess <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the cockpit the aircraft's centre of gravity would have been within the approved limits.|$|E
2500|$|On February 20, 2010, Haltzman, Robbins' counsel, told MSNBC Live that Robbins <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> {{his home}} eating [...] "Mike and Ike" [...] candy {{in front of}} his school-issued laptop. [...] The {{attorney}} said that the vice-principal had accused Robbins of taking illegal pills after seeing him eating the candy in a webcam image. [...] Michael Smerconish, a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist who reviewed the photo, said that it did in fact appear to be the same size and shape as Mike and Ike candy. [...] Haltzman said that his client's laptop had not been reported stolen or lost. [...] The lawyer also raised questions as to who in the school system decided when to activate each student's webcam, and for what reasons.|$|E
