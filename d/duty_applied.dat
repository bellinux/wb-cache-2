25|$|One of the {{foundations}} of the campaign was the knowledge that certain aspects of the law on council budgeting in 1985 were not entirely clear. What was clear was that all local authorities had a duty to set a budget and therefore an annual rate or precept, under sections 2 and 11 of the General Rate Act 1967. Precepting authorities had the additional responsibility to set their budgets and precepts at least 21 days {{before the start of the}} new financial year; as the local government financial year began on 1 April, 21 days before that was 10 March. No such <b>duty</b> <b>applied</b> to rate-making authorities. In practice most set a budget and a rate some weeks before the new financial year, but not all did; some authorities routinely made their rates after the beginning of a financial year. The General Rate Act, section 2(1), also provided that the rate had to be sufficient to meet all estimated expenditure not met by other sources, thereby making any deficit budget illegal.|$|E

However, the obligation still applies to those public authorities in Wales to which the NERC Act <b>duty</b> <b>applied.</b> It also requires those bodies to have regard to the lists of habitats and species of 'principal importance' published as a result of Section 7 of the Environment (Wales) Act.

50|$|In 1979 Feigenbaum became {{involved}} in a dispute with the U.S. Customs Service about whether 20% <b>duty</b> <b>applied</b> to 'gold' stamps of Staffa imported into the United States. The stamps were to commemorate the United States Bicentenary and were in sets of up to 13 priced at $20 each, the total retail price of the stamps being $5.2 million. Feigenbaum argued that as Staffa had a legitimate mail service the stamps were not liable for the duty. However, the mail service at Staffa, a remote uninhabited Scottish island, actually amounted {{to no more than}} a mail box on a jetty where letters could be mailed back to the mainland, weather permitting. As no-one lived on Staffa and visitors were invariably from the mainland in the first place, it was doubtful whether the mail service amounted to anything more than a tourist curiosity. Feigenbaum had the right to produce stamps marked Staffa in return for a fee paid to the island's owner, who operated the postal service.|$|E

50|$|Following Holland's example, {{stamp duties}} were adopted in 1694, being {{extended}} in 1698 and large amounts {{were added to}} the excise. Breweries and distilleries were placed under charge and important commodities such as salt, coal, malt, leather and glass were included as taxable articles, the two latter being later removed. Similarly, customs rates were also increased. In 1698 the general 5% duty was raised to 10%. French goods became liable to surtaxes, first at 25%, then 50%, whilst goods from other countries were charged at a lesser amount. Moreover, spirits, wines, tea and coffee were taxed at special rates.The expansion of the fiscal system may be best realised from the fact that, during the comparatively short reign of William III (1689-1702), the land tax produced £19,200,000, customs raising £13,296,000, and excise £13,650,000, or approximately £46 million when added together. In the last year of the reign, returns from these taxes were respectively - land tax (at 2s.), £990,000, customs £1,540,000, excise £986,000, or a total exceeding £3.5 million. The removal of regular export <b>duty</b> <b>applied</b> to domestic woollen manufactures and corn only, both cases additionally being due to special reasons of policy.|$|E

40|$|The {{fiduciary}} obligation is an accepted equitable doctrine within Australian law. Its role within the corporate field, as a <b>duty</b> <b>applied</b> to directors and {{owed to the}} company, is also well accepted. This thesis examines {{the role of the}} {{fiduciary obligation}} in general, and specifically in relation to directors. The examination begins with the development of the fiduciary obligation in equity, and addresses the difficulty of developing a doctrinal definition for the obligation. This is useful when analysing the most recent High Court decisions on this obligation, and applying the obligation to directors within corporate law, particularly in light of inconsistent use of language in that field. The thesis clarifies the content of the obligation, and recognises exceptions to the default position that fiduciary obligations are owed to the company. The thesis proposes a definition of a closely held company, which encompasses these exceptions, and recognition of the relationship between directors and shareholders in a closely held company as subject to fiduciary obligations. Finally, the thesis makes recommendations as to the method of recognising this relationship at law within Australia, to provide greater clarity to both directors and shareholders. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Czech Republic joined the European Union in 2004. The EU begun the integration to achieve {{political power and}} economic prosperity. To achieve that prosperity could be complicated due to obstructions of free movement of products created by demands on administration of excise duties.

The aim of this publication is to describe the EU legislation of excise duty {{as well as to}} identify and describe problems arising from that particular area of law. I also paid attention to problems concerning implementation of the EU legislation into Member States law including Czech Republic. In the first chapter we can find a definition of a tax, its characteristics and classification from different points of view, after that also more detailed description of features of an indirect taxation. In the second chapter I have attempted to define the concepts of coordination, harmonization and competition in tax field and then evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in comparison.
