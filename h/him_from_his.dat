5|$|Although Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, was {{of royal}} blood, he was {{commonly}} {{viewed as a}} criminal, prone to violence and stupidity. A proven enemy of the Nevilles, Exeter bore a grudge particularly against Warwick for displacing <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hereditary role of Lord High Admiral in 1457. Nonetheless, when Warwick joined the Lancastrians, Exeter obeyed Margaret and served under the Earl during the invasion of England. Although he supported the Lancastrian cause, Exeter had family ties to the House of York; he was husband to Anne of York, Edward's sister.|$|E

5|$|During the Red Scare, {{psychology}} professor Harry C. Steinmetz {{was accused of}} being a Communist.

He attempted to be reinstated but never was even after the legislation that had been developed during the Red Scare was later deemed unconstitutional.|$|E

5|$|Ecgric's successor, Anna, {{acted as}} a {{challenge}} to the increasing power of Penda throughout his reign. In 645, after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife, who was Penda's sister, Penda drove <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> kingdom and into exile. Anna was strong enough to offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court: whilst there he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to his throne.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E

5|$|Holt {{tractors}} {{were widely}} used as artillery tractors during World War I and their capabilities and reliability had become well-known.

5|$|In Chains of Olympus, Kratos was {{reluctant}} to help the gods when Helios was kidnapped, and openly abandoned them when Persephone offered {{him a chance to}} be reunited with his daughter.

Knowing that while intervention would save Calliope, it would separate <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> family forever, a bitter Kratos killed Persephone, imprisoned Atlas, and freed Helios.|$|E

5|$|In September, Randy Orton, who at {{the time}} was injured, made an {{appearance}} on Raw, where he criticized all the champions, mocking Rhodes and DiBiase for allowing their title belts to be stolen by Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG). The two responded by assaulting Cryme Tyme and introducing Manu (son of Afa the Wild Samoan) as their new member at Unforgiven. This did little to impress Orton, so later that evening Rhodes, DiBiase, and Manu assaulted World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk as Orton confronted him backstage. This allowed Orton to punt Punk in the head, removing <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> championship match, and gaining Orton's respect.|$|E
5|$|In al-Karak, an-Nasir Ahmad had Tashtamur and Qutlubugha {{executed}} for unclear reasons. The move to execute them appalled the public, with whom an-Nasir Ahmad was steadily losing credibility with. The executions {{were seen as}} a testament of an-Nasir Ahmad's ingratitude {{to the men who}} had supported him and virtually installed him as sultan. Historian Joseph Drory argues that it was because Tashtamur and Qutlubugha compelled him to assume the sultanate and remove <b>him</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> self-imposed isolation in al-Karak that made an-Nasir Ahmad resentful toward them.|$|E
