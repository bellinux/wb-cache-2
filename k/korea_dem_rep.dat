40|$|During the 1990 s, {{whenever}} inflation accelerated in the Congo (<b>Dem.</b> <b>Rep.)</b> {{the domestic}} currency was abandoned {{in favour of}} dollar holdings. The increased demand for dollars resulted in a higher relative price of the latter or greater depreciation of domestic currency, which {{is the essence of}} exchange rate overshooting. In demand terms, there was a greater preference for foreign currencies than for goods. Unlike the Dornbusch model, the 1990 s exchange rate overshooting associated with dollarisation in Congo assumes no price rigidity. It suggests, instead, that both prices and the exchange rate did adjust speedily to changes in the money supply. hyperinflation; dollarisation; exchange rate overshooting; local currency; foreign currency; currency notes; bank deposits; broad money; velocity of circulation; Congo; inflation; money supply changes. ...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{the northwestern}} Congo Basin—a crucial region {{as far as}} the {{so-called}} ‘Bantu expansion‘ is concerned—represents almost a white spot on the archaeological map of Central Africa. This paper aims at providing the outline of a settlement history of the region. It is based on a survey of about 120 sites along the rivers Ubangi, Sangha, Ngoko and Likwala-aux-Herbes (<b>Dem.</b> <b>Rep.</b> of the Congo, Rep. of the Congo, Cameroon and Central African Republic) carried out in 1985 and 1987 by a team of archaeologists under the direction of Manfred Eggert. An analysis of the ceramics encountered in this region is part of my Ph. D. dissertation supervised by Hans-Peter Wotzka at the University of Cologne. The sequence reaches back to the first settling of the rain forest by sedentary populations {{in the second half of}} the 1 st millennium BC. The research area is of special importance in that it represents a North to South transect from the savannahs north of Bangui in the Central African Republic into the heart of the rainforest to south of Mbandaka in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This paper will present not only a general outline of some major ceramic groups in the research area but contribute new data on the distribution of roulette-decorated pottery as well. Moreover, it will be shown that the introduction of this distinctive type of decoration can hardly be considered a fundamental change but is rather inscribed as a development based upon older ceramic groups and forms, like in the east African Great Lakes region...|$|R
40|$|Radioimmunoassay of serum {{thyrotropin}} {{was performed}} in 185 patients, 4 - 30 yr old, living in Brussels (control group), in the nongoitrous (southwest) and in the goitrous (north) areas of Idjwi Island (<b>Dem.</b> <b>Rep.</b> of the Congo). Both these regions in Idjwi Island have a severe and quite similar iodine deficiency. The serum TSH level was higher in the inhabitants of Idjwi Island than in the Belgian controls; it was still higher in the goitrous area (in both goitrous and nongoitrous subjects) than in the nongoitrous area. No difference was observed in the 3 areas {{as a function of}} age, size of the thyroid, or its nodularity. There was a significant correlation between the TSH level and the plasma [l 27 I]PBI in the goitrous area. There was no correlation between the TSH level, the 6 -hr thyroidal radioiodine uptake, the [125 I]PBI estimated at the time of equilibrium in isotopic distribution and the organic exchangeable iodine pool of the thyroid in all 3 areas. The results observed in southwest Idjwi show that the human thyroid is capable of adapting itself adequately to a very severe iodine deficiency under the influence of an increased thyrotropic stimulation without clinical evidence of thyroidal hyperplasia. The higher serum TSH level observed in north Idjwi suggests that thyrotropic hyperstimulation is responsible for endemic goiter in Idjwi Island. In this island, the serum TSH level seems to be more closely related to the geographic environment than to the age of the subjects or the individual size of the thyroid. © 1971 by The Endocrine Society.

40|$|Crepidorhopalon perennis is a metallophyte {{critically}} {{endangered by}} mining activities and currently known from only one site on copper-rich soils in Katanga (<b>Dem.</b> <b>Rep.</b> Congo). It {{is closely related}} to the annual C. tenuis, also a rare metallophyte, but with a broader geographical range. We investigated the variation in morphometric traits and ecological niches (based on edaphic conditions and pollinator assemblages) of C. perennis and C. tenuis, to evaluate the risk of inter-specific competition, and their potential for hybridization to ascertain if C. perennis might be at risk of genetic swamping by its more widespread congener. We examined whether species were found under sympatric or parapatric settings with opportunity for hybridization (or gene exchange). Such knowledge is essential for implementing restoration management protocols, including the introduction of C. perennis into substitution sites where C. tenuis might be already present. Fourteen morphological characters and 11 soil variables were measured and visiting pollinator species were identified at the site where the two species co-occur. Our results show that the two species can be distinguished based on their morphological traits, show niche overlap based on edaphic properties, and share the same pollinator assemblage. In addition, no morphologically intermediate individuals could be detected, suggesting no hybridization, and that the two species may be reproductively isolated. We conclude that C. perennis conservation and restoration operations can be realized in substitution sites where C. tenuis may be present, with the need, however, to evaluate the potential effect of sharing a pollinator assemblage on reproductive success of both species. © 2011 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2011 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

40|$|According to FAO, roughly {{one-third of}} food {{produced}} {{for human consumption}} is lost throughout the Food Supply Chain (FSP). This Food Wastage (FWa) could be divided in Food Loss (FL – decrease in mass or in nutritional value of food for human consumption), meanwhile Food Waste (FW – food discarded because left to spoil or expired). FAO suggest to start analysis of FWa from harvesting, but several authors suggest to start from sowing because FWa can also occur between sowing and harvesting. For this reason, to limit FWa {{it is important to}} adopt the better agricultural practices (seed quality, appropriate organic and synthetic fertilizers, type of rotation, multiple cropping, pruning, and pesticide control). Each item of FWa – according to FAO including only edible part losses – could be further divided in unavoidable, not economically avoidable and economically avoidable. Besides the efforts to reduce last one, it is also important trying to recycle unavoidable and not economically avoidable losses (i. e. as animal feeds or composting). In all these aspects there are great differences between Developed Countries and Developing Countries, mainly justified by available structures and infrastructures. Therefore we have carried out some experiences on FWa reduction in <b>Dem.</b> <b>Rep.</b> of Congo and India. Within established women groups, the following activities have been made: i) planting improved seeds of rice in India has almost doubled the grain yield without any other change; ii) constructing warehouse in common to contain hand-crafted silos for cereals, in order to avoid insect attack, resulted feasible and very effective; iii) drying or frying with palm oil fresh vegetables allows prolonged storage. To conclude, acting to reduce production of FWa to obtain maximum potential yield, as well as reducing the post-harvest losses, recycling FWa as animal feed, composting and anaerobic digestion, limits the need for food production rise. However, uncertainties remains about the actual extent of FWa; difficult is therefore the estimating the amount of its reduction...|$|R
40|$|Two active {{volcanic}} areas {{situated in}} immature {{portions of the}} East African Rift System (EARS) : the Lake Kivu (<b>Dem.</b> <b>Rep.</b> of Congo) and Lake Natron (Tanzania) regions, which {{are located in the}} western and eastern branch, respectively, are still poorly known. Both areas indeed lack of ground-based networks, due to security problems or difficult field accessibility. The Lake Kivu area includes two volcanoes erupting frequently: the Nyamulagira and Nyiragongo volcanoes. The SAR database covering these volcanoes in- cludes data from JERS, ERS- 1 & 2, ENVISAT, ALOS, RADARSAT- 1 & 2 satellites back from year 1996. SAR Interferometry (InSAR) is thus applied to study the ground de- formations. MT-InSAR approaches, such as the ”‘StaMPS”’ method, are used to give us new complementary information to better constrain the previous established eruption models, or gain new insights on eruptions missed by the conventional InSAR, as well as on magmatic and tectonic activity. When enough constrains are available, the ground displacements are modeled using a 3 D-Mixed Boundary Elements Method combined with a neighborhood algorithm. Hence, the 1996, 2002, 2004 and 2010 eruptions of Nyamu- lagira are modeled. The modeling results, coupled with the StaMPS MT-InSAR results, bring new insights concerning the magma plumbing system of this poorly known volcano and its eruptive mechanisms. The collapse of the eastern flank of Nyamulagira, along the NNW-trend fractures network linking Nyamulagira and Nyiragongo volcanoes, can also be identified. InSAR also captures the ground displacements associated with the January 2002 Nyiragongo eruption. The modeling of this major event evidences a deep magma intrusion beneath the Lake Kivu. Such intrusions should be taken into account for hazard assessment. The magma could indeed finds its way to the Lake Kivu floor, as evidenced by the presence of several old phreato-magmatic cones, and causes a lake overturn. The low dikes overpressures found in the North Kivu and Lake Natron areas indicate that, although the rift is considered as immature, the rift extension is driven by the supply of magma from depth, rather than by the tectonics. A new criterion to identify the rifting stage is found to be the stress state. In {{the southern part of the}} rift, tectonic activity dominates, indicating that the tectonics is probably driving the rift opening there...|$|R
