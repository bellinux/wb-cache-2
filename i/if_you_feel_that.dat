500|$|The relegation of fighter {{units to}} what {{appeared}} to be strategically unimportant ground attack missions led to a crisis in morale that precipitated the so-called [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] in April 1945, when eight of Cobby's senior pilots, including Australia's leading ace in the war, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, tendered their resignations in protest. Although one of the [...] "mutineers", Group Captain Wilf Arthur, had earlier voiced his concerns to Cobby and his headquarters staff regarding the efficacy of 1st TAF's tasking, the AOC was taken aback by the resignations. He spoke to the officers individually and as a group, asking them, [...] "Is this something against me, or having a go against me in this, because if so, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I have fallen down in my job, I will straight away ask to be recalled," [...] to which they replied, [...] "It {{has nothing to do with}} you." [...] Cobby reported the incident to his immediate superior, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, who informed the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, and the Allied Air Forces Commander, Lieutenant General George Kenney. All made their way to Morotai and interviewed the pilots involved, and all concluded that Cobby should be relieved of his command.|$|E
2500|$|Jon Nelson {{also has}} criticized Morey for {{incorrect}} quotes. Nelson {{notes that in}} Morey's The New Atheism (1986) he quoted Nicholas Capaldi's book The Art of Deception {{as an example of}} atheist deception, but the [...] "problem is that Capaldi never says this (or anything like it) on this or on any other page. Morey has numerous other false quotes attributed to Capaldi, such as: 'Refuse to be convinced. Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> he has a good argument and that your case is weaker, refuse to be convinced of your opponent's case'. Nowhere does Capaldi advocate, as Morey accuses him of doing, that atheists should 'use any invalid or deceptive argument as long as it helps him (to) win his case.'" [...] Nelson goes on to say that, [...] "However, Morey has an 'out'. There are no actual quotation marks on these alleged quotes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matilda told Maud {{she refused}} to [...] "have my {{daughter}} be a darned fool and marry an actor". [...] Maud retorted, [...] "All right, mother, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> way about it, good bye." [...] After her mother requested clarification, she said, [...] "I'm going to marry Frank, so, naturally you don't want a darned fool around the house." [...] Upon recognizing that Maud would marry Frank {{whether or not she}} supported her, Matilda laughed and acquiesced. [...] On November 9, 1882, Maud and Frank were married by W. H. Hawley, the minister of Fayetteville Baptist Church. [...] The wedding ceremony was held in the parlor of Matilda's home, which was packed with people. [...] Many relatives and friends of Matilda attended the wedding, including Maud's three sisters and women's rights activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her husband Henry Stanton. [...] Frank's parents, Benjamin and Cynthia, and his sisters, Hattie and Mattie, also attended the wedding. [...] The parlor was so crowded that the hired string quartet had to play upstairs. [...] The local paper praised the marriage ceremony as [...] "one of equality". [...] Whereas most marriages of the era had the bride's wedding vows include a pledge to obey her husband, the local paper said [...] "the promises required of the bride [...] precisely the same as those required of the groom". [...] The couple honeymooned in Saratoga Springs, New York, whereupon they passed Thanksgiving with their relatives.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, not so," [...] she said. [...] "Come {{with me to}} her now: <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>that,</b> {{she will}} be kind to you--how should it be otherwise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --And {{why were}} you shocked, Cranly pressed on in the same tone, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> sure <b>that</b> our {{religion}} is false and that Jesus was not the son of God? ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{accepted}} his banishment. [...] "All right. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> way I'll ride. But I'd {{like to do}} something for you before I go. I'll pile up some wood--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{all this}} rather gets past me," [...] he said. [...] "Personally, I've always admired the thing. Dashed ripe bit of work, I've always considered. Still, of course, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> way--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Our {{acquaintance}} is short, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I'm {{too much}} of a stranger, I might perhaps be able to throw some light on any points that you're puzzled about. I've had a pretty extensive experience in these matters." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We can {{all call}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> way about it," [...] {{answered}} our hero. [...] "I rather {{think some of}} you were smitten pretty badly." [...] And at this sally {{there was a general}} laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} would be very much use if I did," [...] she said. [...] "One can't go sailing always--and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> that is a pity, you can think of the rain and the wind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are what}} you choose to be. If {{you want to keep}} in the church, then you must keep in the church. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the Christian {{doctrine}} is alive, then it is alive so far as you are concerned." ...|$|E
6000|$|She took a salted almond from {{a silver}} dish {{by his side}} and smiled sweetly upon him. [...] "Dear me!" [...] she said, [...] "how fierce! Don't attempt it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>that,</b> please! What {{have you been doing}} since I saw you last?--losing your money or your temper, or both?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, gentlemen," [...] he panted, [...] "I {{will come}} with you. To your room, Mr. Ward Mortimer, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please! I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I owe <b>you</b> an explanation." ...|$|R
2500|$|Manson has {{commented on}} the subject of children, saying that she [...] "just missed the whole baby calling. I feel a lot of women think you're a freak <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>that,</b> and maybe I am strange but I never got that feeling. In some ways I wish I had that urge, because I adore children... I feel I can live quite happily with my decision." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} to begin,' said Sister Constance. 'You can always give it up <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the need lies at home; but I think the few hours' change every day--for duty's sake, mind--will give you vigour not to be worn down by the home cares.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't advise it yet. You {{have tried}} and proved {{one another as}} friends, now try and prove one another as lovers; then, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> all is safe and happy, you {{will be ready for}} the {{greatest}} of the three experiments, and then in God's name marry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> way, Tom, why don't {{you break}} away and go? I think, perhaps, {{it would be}} not only {{a good thing for}} Dick, but it would, also, be a good thing for you," [...] and, for the moment, Sam looked very seriously at his brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, to {{tell the}} truth," [...] said Miss Baker, laughing, [...] "she is doing duty at this moment as head butler in the dining-room. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> any {{vocation}} <b>that</b> way, you may go and help her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must go," [...] he answered, {{looking down}} at her troubled face gently. [...] "And it's best for you to go, Nora. I believe that, and I'm not so selfish as {{not to be able to}} hope that you'll find all you long for. But it will change you all the more if it is so. Nora! Nora! Whatever am I going to do without you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well, then, I have done, Leonard. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can conscientiously <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are acting}} for the best, {{and not to}} gratify your pride, then I can only say I hope you will be helped through the course you have chosen. Good-bye.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I wouldn't laugh inside, either. Why should I?

But if you think you'd rather not--that's all right, too, dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Fan," [...] she said, [...] "does {{not your}} own heart {{tell you that}} it is all a mistake? And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> you do love me, do you not know from your own experience, whether you hide the feeling or not, that your love for others, and chiefly for so dear a friend as Miss Starbrow, remains just as strong as before?" ...|$|E

"I {{am sorry}} to hear you talk so, Eugène; but of one thing you may always be sure--Elsie and I will never be your judges. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> it will reopen old wounds, stop away; but if not, why, come and see us. You have a young friend with you," [...] he added, turning {{slightly}} towards me and speaking a little more earnestly than the occasion seemed to require.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "He's capable, {{so far as}} he sees, but the trouble is he doesn't see quite far enough. Now, there's not room enough for two men with notions round about Somasco, and a one-horse rancher can't fight men with money, so Alton's got hold of a good deal bigger {{contract}} than he can carry through.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said George, {{after a short}} pause, [...] "we {{are going}} to leave our teams here with you, Mr. Simpson, while we start out {{prospecting}} the wood-lot. We believe those men who have just left are the ones who stole my team, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would like to do me a favor, you will keep a sharp lookout over the stable while we are gone, for I do not think they would hesitate to steal it again if they got the chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I really cannot see," [...] Lady Medlincourt murmured, [...] "why {{you should}} drag {{me from my}} bed to talk such rubbish. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>that,</b> go and look for her. It is open for you to marry whom you choose, the lady who is selling primroses {{at the corner of}} the Square <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wish. The only thing is that you cannot expect your friends to marry her too. What did you come here for, advice or sympathy? I have none of the latter for you, and you wouldn't take the former. Do, there's a good boy, leave me! I want to have my bath, and the hairdresser is waiting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} stay you, John, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the Lord has called upon you to go; and indeed, you may save, as you say, {{the lives of}} many of our neighbors, by persuading them to take to the hills with you, instead of {{shutting}} themselves up in Gamala. Go down, then, to the village, and talk to them; and see what they say to your plan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Call him off," [...] {{repeated}} d'Alcacer, {{a little}} bewildered by the aroused fire of her conviction. [...] "I am sure I don't want him called off {{any more than}} you do; and, frankly, I don't believe Jorgenson has any such power. But upon the whole, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Jorgenson has the power, I would--yes, if I were in your place I think I would suppress anything I could not understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Nettie told {{me about}} her. Well, I guess <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> way I have got to let you go, and I don’t quite know I’m sorry you have these notions.

6000|$|... "Please do {{not think}} me {{excessively}} abrupt; but I advise you to alter those plans, {{or if it is}} too late for that, to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him.
