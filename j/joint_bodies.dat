This introduction of presbyteries was somewhat revolutionary in the rather hierarchically structured Lutheran churches.|$|E

50|$|At {{their second}} meeting the State Parties decided to help {{countries}} in establishing <b>joint</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{as required by}} certain provisions of the Convention. Also, {{it was decided to}} facilitate cooperation between this and other UNECE conventions, and to examine difficulties arising when implementing the Convention (administrative practices).At the fifth session of the meeting of the parties, a Guide to implementing the Convention was adopted. A Guide offers commentaries to the provisions, and examples of good practices. In addition to that, an Assessment was made, to show the current status of transboundary waters. The Second Assessment covers more than 140 transboundary rivers, 25 transboundary lakes, about 200 transboundary groundwaters and 25 Ramsar sites or other wetlands of transboundary importance.|$|E

Chief editor Harald Torp was elected chairman, despite not attending the meeting. The association experienced increasing number of members after the war; in 1945 it had 55, whilst it {{in the following year}} had 65 members. The efforts to unite the conservative press were resumed after the war; in 1945 the <b>joint</b> <b>body</b> Norsk Høyrepresse ("Norwegian Conservative Press") was established, comprising DKPF and Høyres Bladeierforening ("The Conservative Party's Newspaper Owner Association"). The <b>joint</b> <b>body</b> organised the merger of Høirepressens Propaganda- og Organisasjonskontor and Høirepressens Oslokontor; together they formed Høires Pressekontor, which eventually was renamed Høyres Pressebyrå.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{metropolitan}} county council was abolished in 1986, several <b>joint</b> <b>bodies</b> exist to run certain services on a county-wide basis. Most notable is the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority, which co-ordinates transport policy. Through its passenger transport executive, known as Nexus, it {{owns and operates}} the Tyne and Wear Metro light rail system, and the Shields ferry service and the Tyne Tunnel, linking communities {{on either side of}} the River Tyne. Also through Nexus, the authority subsidises socially necessary transport services (including taxis) and operates a concessionary fares scheme for the elderly and disabled. The Passenger Transport Authority is a [...] "precepting authority", raising funds by imposing a levy on the Council Tax of the five constituent authorities of Tyne and Wear. In April 2014 Nexus became an executive body of the new North East Combined Authority.|$|E

Regional laws must remove any obstacle to the full equality {{of men and women in}} social, cultural and economic life and promote equal access to elected offices for men and women. Agreements between Regions aiming at improving the performance of regional functions and possibly envisaging the establishment of <b>joint</b> <b>bodies</b> shall be ratified by regional law.

40|$|A {{finite element}} method to model dynamic {{structural}} systems undergoing large rotations is presented. The dynamic systems are composed of rigid <b>joint</b> <b>bodies</b> and flexible beam elements. The configurations of these systems {{are subject to change}} due to the relative motion in the joints among interconnected elastic beams. A body fixed reference is defined for each joint body to describe the joint body's displacements. Using the {{finite element method}} and the kinematic relations between each flexible element and its corotational reference, the total displacement field of an element, which contains gross rigid as well as elastic effects, can be derived in terms of the translational and rotational displacements of the two end nodes. If one end of an element is hinged to a joint body, the joint body's displacements and the hinge degree of freedom at the end are used to represent the nodal displacements. This results in a highly coupled system of differential equations written in terms of hinge degrees of freedom as well as the rotational and translational displacements of <b>joint</b> <b>bodies</b> and element nodes...|$|E
