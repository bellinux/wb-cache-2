5|$|Sonatas and Interludes is a {{collection}} of twenty pieces for prepared piano by American avant-garde composer John Cage (1912–1992). It was composed in 1946–48, shortly after Cage's introduction to Indian philosophy and the teachings of art historian Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, both of which became major influences on the composer's later work. Significantly more complex than his other works for prepared piano, Sonatas and Interludes is <b>generally</b> <b>recognized</b> as one of Cage's finest achievements.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction in organic synthesis is diverse. The reaction has come to encompass reactions of many types of sulfur ylides with electrophiles well beyond the original publications.

In the disputed 1876 presidential election, he was one of the visiting statesmen who went to New Orleans, Louisiana, and concluded that the election had been fairly conducted in that state.|$|E
5|$|Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, first {{published}} in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later {{become known as the}} philosophy of mind. Kant's first critique is <b>generally</b> <b>recognized</b> as among the most significant works of modern philosophy in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both continental and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an in-depth study of transcendental consciousness, or {{the life of the mind}} as conceived through universal categories of consciousness.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{special effects}} are <b>generally</b> <b>recognized</b> {{to be among}} the best of all time, using the {{available}} (non-digital) technology to the fullest. In addition to matte paintings and models, the techniques employed included multipass exposures. In some scenes, the set was lit, shot, the film rewound, and then rerecorded over with different lighting. In some cases this was done 16 times in all. The cameras were frequently motion controlled using computers. Many effects used techniques which had been developed during the production of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps) {{is a small}} American sparrow. This {{passerine}} {{is primarily}} found across the Southwestern United States {{and much of the}} interior of Mexico, south to the transverse mountain range, and to the Pacific coast to the southwest of the transverse range. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. Twelve subspecies are <b>generally</b> <b>recognized,</b> though up to eighteen have been suggested. This bird has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts. The crown is rufous, and the face and supercilium are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each eye and a thick black malar streak.|$|E
25|$|Spendthrift clauses: Trusts {{may be used}} {{to protect}} {{beneficiaries}} (for example, one's children) against their own inability to handle money.

25|$|The NEDD4-2 protein {{consists}} of an amino-terminal Ca2+-phospholipid binding domain (C2), 4 WW domains (protein-protein interaction domains) and the carboxyl-terminal HECT domain (ubiquitin ligase domain).

50|$|Earth science <b>generally</b> <b>recognizes</b> four spheres, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere; these {{correspond}} to rocks, water, air and life.

5|$|While {{classified}} as <b>generally</b> <b>recognized</b> as {{safe in the}} US, juniper berries may have various side effects {{that have not been}} tested extensively in clinical trials. Mainly due to an increased risk of miscarriage, even in small doses, consuming juniper berries may affect pregnant or breastfeeding women and people with diabetes, bleeding disorders or after surgery. In traditional medicine, juniper berries were used for female birth control. In an in vitro study, juniper essential oil was studied for its possible antimicrobial and antifungal properties.|$|E
5|$|Still Impressed with Riefenstahl's work, Hitler {{asked her}} to film Triumph des Willens ("Triumph of the Will"), a new {{propaganda}} film about the 1934 party rally in Nuremberg. More than one million Germans participated in the rally. Initially, according to Riefenstahl, she resisted {{and did not want}} to create further Nazi Party films, instead wanting to direct a feature film based on Hitler's favourite opera, Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland ("Lowlands"). Riefenstahl received private funding for the production of Tiefland, but the filming in Spain was derailed and the project was cancelled. Hitler was able to convince her to film Triumph des Willens on the condition that she would not be required to make further films for the party, according to Riefenstahl. The motion picture was <b>generally</b> <b>recognized</b> as an epic, innovative work of propaganda filmmaking. The film took Riefenstahl's career to a new level and gave her further international recognition.|$|E
5|$|The clade Neoceratopsia {{includes}} all ceratopsians more derived than psittacosaurids. Another subset of neoceratopsians is called Coronosauria, which currently {{includes all}} ceratopsians more derived than Auroraceratops. Coronosaurs show the first {{development of the}} neck frill and the fusion of the first several neck vertebrae to support the increasingly heavy head. Within Coronosauria, three groups are <b>generally</b> <b>recognized,</b> although the membership of these groups varies somewhat from study to study and some animals may not fit in any of them. One group can be called Protoceratopsidae and includes Protoceratops and its closest relatives, all Asian. Another group, Leptoceratopsidae, includes mostly North American animals that are {{more closely related to}} Leptoceratops. The Ceratopsoidea includes animals like Zuniceratops, which are more closely related to the family Ceratopsidae. This last family includes Triceratops and all the large North American ceratopsians and is further divided into the subfamilies Centrosaurinae and Ceratopsinae (also known as Chasmosaurinae).|$|E

5|$|The {{product is}} {{regulated}} in different manners in various regions. In the US, {{the product is}} allowed {{to be used in}} ground beef, and it can be used in other meat products such as beef-based processed meats. The use of ammonia as an anti-microbial agent is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and is included on the FDA's list of GRAS (<b>generally</b> <b>recognized</b> as safe) procedures, and is used in similar applications for numerous other food products, including puddings and baked goods. The product is banned in Canada due to the presence of ammonia in it, and it is banned for human consumption in the European Union. Some consumer advocacy groups have promoted the elimination of the product or for mandatory disclosure of additives in beef, while others have expressed concerns about plant closures that occurred after the product received significant news media coverage.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow was {{described}} in 1852 by American ornithologist John Cassin as Ammodramus ruficeps. It has also been described as belonging to the genus Peucaea, which contains several sparrows in the genus Aimophila that share characteristics, such as a larger bill and a patch of yellow under the bend of the wing, that {{other members of the}} genus do not. However, splitting the Peucaea sparrows into a separate genus is not <b>generally</b> <b>recognized.</b> A 2008 phylogenetic analysis of the genus Aimophila divided it into four genera, with the rufous-crowned sparrow and its two closest relatives, the Oaxaca sparrow and rusty sparrow, being maintained as the genus Aimophila. In addition, this study suggested that the rufous-crowned sparrow may be more closely related to the brown towhees of the genus Pipilo than {{the other members of the}} historical genus Aimophila.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the 14 {{counties}} in Massachusetts. Massachusetts has abolished eight of its fourteen county governments between 1997 and 2000; but the {{counties in}} the southeastern portion of the state retain county-level local government (Barnstable, Bristol, Dukes, Norfolk, Plymouth), or in one case (Nantucket County) combined county/town government. Vestigial judicial and law enforcement districts still follow county boundaries even in the counties whose county-level government has been disestablished, and the counties are still <b>generally</b> <b>recognized</b> as geographic entities if not political ones, along with continuing to provide geographical demarcation for National Weather Service weather warnings. Three counties (Hampshire, Barnstable, and Franklin) have formed new county regional compacts to serve as a form of regional governance.|$|E
