500|$|In 2008, {{while working}} on several films, A. R. Rahman {{received}} an email from Danny Boyle, {{the director of the}} film Slumdog Millionaire, stating: [...] "Hey I'm Danny Boyle, I like your work, and it would be great for us to have you on our film". Rahman was unsure <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer,</b> but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E
500|$|The colony's {{governance}} {{had come}} under increased scrutiny by King Charles II {{beginning in the}} 1660s, but it faced a substantial threat in the late 1670s. [...] Crown agent Edward Randolph was sent to New England in 1676 to collect customs duties and to enforce the Navigation Acts. [...] He documented a list of issues and took his complaints to the Lords of Trade in London. [...] The colonial leadership was divided on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> this threat. [...] Dudley {{was part of a}} moderate faction which supported accommodating the king's demands, along with his brother-in-law Simon Bradstreet and William Stoughton. [...] They were opposed by hardliners who did not want the crown to interfere in the colony's business. [...] These factions were separated in part along class lines; the wealthier land owners and merchants who dominated the legislature's upper house (called the [...] "court of assistants") favored accommodation, while the more representative lower house favored the hardliners.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} by Charles to {{this was}} to issue an order in 1666 demanding that Bellingham, since he was then governor, and William Hathorne, {{the speaker of the}} general court, travel to England to answer for the colony's behavior. [...] The issue of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> this demand divided the colony, with petitions from a cross-section of the colony's population calling for the magistrates to obey the king's demand. [...] The debate also introduced a long-term rift in the council of assistants between hardliners wanting to resist the king's demands at all costs and moderates who thought the king's demands should be accommodated. [...] Bellingham sided with the hardliners and the decision was reached to send the king a letter. [...] The letter questioned whether the request actually originated with the king, protested that the colony was loyal to him, and claimed the magistrates had already explained fully why they were unable to comply with the king's demands. [...] The magistrates further pacified the angered sovereign by sending over a ship full of masts as a gift (New England was a valuable source of timber for the Royal Navy). [...] Distracted by the war with the Dutch and domestic politics, Charles did not pursue the issue further until after Bellingham's death, though for numerous reasons the Massachusetts Bay Colony charter was finally voided in 1684.|$|E

2500|$|Kang acted decisively {{to protect}} Mao and rebut {{the charges against}} Jiang Qing. [...] Invoking his {{background}} {{as head of the}} Organization Department and as an expert on security and espionage matters, Kang vouched for Jiang Qing. [...] She was a Party member in good standing, he declared, and had no affiliations that would bar marriage to Mao. [...] Kang's personal knowledge of Jiang Qing's past was fragmentary and certainly insufficient to allow him to prove that she was not a KMT agent, but he doctored her record, destroyed adverse material, discouraged hostile witnesses, and coached her on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the probing questions of high-level interrogators who hoped to discredit Mao.|$|E
