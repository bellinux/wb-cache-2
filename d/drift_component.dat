40|$|A Kalman filter {{approach}} for combining the outputs of {{an array of}} high-drift gyros to obtain a virtual lower-drift gyro has been known in the literature {{for more than a}} decade. The success of this approach depends on the correlations of the random <b>drift</b> <b>components</b> of the individual gyros. However, no method of estimating these correlations has appeared in the literature. This paper presents an algorithm for obtaining the statistical model for an array of gyros, including the cross-correlations of the individual random <b>drift</b> <b>components.</b> In order to obtain this model, a new statistic, called the “Allan covariance” between two gyros, is introduced. The gyro array model can be used to obtain the Kalman filter-based (KFB) virtual gyro. Instead, we consider a virtual gyro obtained by taking a linear combination of individual gyro outputs. The gyro array model is used to calculate the optimal coefficients, as well as to derive a formula for the drift of the resulting virtual gyro. The drift formula for the optimal linear combination (OLC) virtual gyro is identical to that previously derived for the KFB virtual gyro. Thus, a Kalman filter is not necessary to obtain a minimum drift virtual gyro. The theoretical results of this paper are demonstrated using simulated as well as experimental data. In experimental results with a 28 -gyro array, the OLC virtual gyro has a drift spectral density 40 times smaller than that obtained by taking the average of the gyro signals...|$|R

The estimates suggest that changing beliefs matter for understanding the yield curve and point to an intriguing clue about risk premia. Local approximations to the mean yield spread are highly correlated with the variance of the trend short rate, suggesting a connection between uncertainty about the long-run target of monetary policy and risk premia on long-term bonds.

50|$|Under {{reverse bias}} (P {{negative}} {{with respect to}} N), the potential drop (i.e., voltage) across the depletion region increases. In more detail, majority carriers are {{pushed away from the}} junction, leaving behind more charged ions. Thus the depletion region is widened and its field becomes stronger, which increases the <b>drift</b> <b>component</b> of current and decreases the diffusion component. In this case, the net current is leftward in the figure of the p-n junction. The carrier density (mostly, minority carriers) is small and only a very small reverse saturation current flows.|$|E
50|$|Forward bias (P {{positive}} {{with respect}} to N) narrows the depletion region and lowers the barrier to carrier injection (shown in the figure to the right). In more detail, majority carriers get some energy from the bias field, enabling them {{to go into the}} region and neutralize opposite charges. The more bias the more neutralization (or screening of ions in the region) occurs. The carriers can be recombined to the ions but thermal energy immediately makes recombined carriers transition back as Fermi energy is in proximity. When bias is strong enough that the depletion region becomes very thin, the diffusion component of the current greatly increases and the <b>drift</b> <b>component</b> decreases. In this case the net current is rightward in the figure of the p-n junction. The carrier density is large (it varies exponentially with the applied bias voltage), making the junction conductive and allowing a large forward current. The mathematical description of the current is provided by the Shockley diode equation. The low current conducted under reverse bias and the large current under forward bias is an example of rectification.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a mathematical approach {{to model the}} effects of phenomena with random nature such as turbulence and fire-spotting into the existing wildfire simulators. The formulation proposes that the propagation of the fire-front {{is the sum of}} a <b>drifting</b> <b>component</b> (obtained from an existing wildfire simulator without turbulence and fire-spotting) and a random fluctuating component. The modelling of the random effects is embodied in a probability density function accounting for the fluctuations around the fire perimeter which is given by the <b>drifting</b> <b>component.</b> In past, this formulation has been applied to include these random effects into a wildfire simulator based on an Eulerian moving interface method, namely the Level Set Method (LSM), but in this paper the same formulation is adapted for a wildfire simulator based on a Lagrangian front tracking technique, namely the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS). The main highlight of the present study is the comparison of the performance of a Lagrangian and an Eulerian moving interface method when applied to wild-land fire propagation. Simple idealised numerical experiments are used to investigate the potential applicability of the proposed formulation to DEVS and to compare its behaviour with respect to the LSM. The results show that DEVS based wildfire propagation model qualitatively improves its performance (e. g., reproducing flank and back fire, increase in fire spread due to pre-heating of the fuel by hot air and firebrands, fire propagation across no fuel zones, secondary fire generation, [...] .). Though the results presented here are devoid of any validation exercise and provide only a proof of concept, they show a strong inclination towards an intended operational use. The existing LSM or DEVS based operational simulators like WRF-SFIRE and ForeFire respectively can serve as an ideal basis for the same. Comment: Accepted for publication in Commun. Nonlinear Sci.

A 3. 5 -h morning {{event of}} joint EISCAT/STARE {{observations}} is considered {{and the differences}} between the observed STARE velocities and the electron <b>drift</b> <b>components</b> (EISCAT) are studied.

We show that both the STARE-Finland radar velocity “overspeed” and the offset in the azimuth can be explained by fluid plasma theory, if the ion drift contribution to the irregularity phase velocity is taken into account under the condition of a moderate backscatter off-orthogonality.
