Along with {{the style of}} ceramic chip <b>capacitors,</b> ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>capacitors</b> are often used as safety capacitors in electromagnetic interference suppression applications. Besides these, large ceramic power capacitors for high voltage or high frequency transmitter applications are also to be found.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} Y 2 O 3 {{concentration}} on the dielectric properties of ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>capacitors</b> and multilayer capacitors containing 50 dielectric layers with an approximate thickness of 3 µm were investigated. The relative permittivity and temperature coefficient of capacity of multilayer capacitors at {{low and high}} applied field suggest that two types of microstructures formed, depending on yttrium doping concentration. Yttrium concentrations of 1. 5 - 2. 0 mol% yielded identical relative permittivities over a wide temperature range. The permittivities at Y concentrations of 2. 6 - 3. 0 mol% were also identical, but somewhat higher. The relative permittivity of ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>capacitors</b> of similar composition, determined from hysteresis loop measurements as function of applied field, was compared with field-dependent permittivity measurements on multilayer capacitors. The results indicate that polarization measurements on CDCs are a good indicator for the relative permittivity values of MLCCs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the two <b>discs</b> <b>capacitor,</b> for equal and {{different}} radii. The new results obtained allow a complete characterization of capacity coefficients and forces at short distances. An extensive numerical calculation confirms the theoretical results. The study shows {{the existence of}} a hierarchy in the divergent behaviour of the capacitance coefficients and this implies some unusual behaviour of the forces, strictly related to the dimensionality of the nearcontact zone between electrodes...|$|R

25|$|During World War II, the {{development}} of the anti-aircraft proximity fuse required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be screenprinted with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for resistors, with ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>capacitors</b> and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein, the former head of Globe Union's Centralab Division, its coveted Cledo Brunetti Award for early key contributions to {{the development}} of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate. As well, Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.|$|R
