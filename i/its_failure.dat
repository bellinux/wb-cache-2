5|$|Despite <b>its</b> <b>failure,</b> {{the raid}} was {{presented}} in Britain as a courageous and daring gamble that {{came very close to}} success.

British forces had moderate casualties in the raid, compared to minimal German losses.|$|E
5|$|In 1698, the Company of Scotland {{attempted}} {{a project to}} secure a trading colony on the Isthmus of Panama. Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare {{is said to have}} invested in the Darien scheme. <b>Its</b> <b>failure</b> bankrupted these landowners, but not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat of an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.|$|E

5|$|Not all tramway {{companies}} were purchased, as the Glenelg to Marino company continued operating separately until <b>its</b> <b>failure</b> in 1914. The government purchased the properties, {{plant and equipment}} of existing tramways but did not purchase the companies themselves. The equipment included 162 trams, 22 other vehicles and 1,056 horses. By 1909 at the launch of Adelaide's electric tram services there remained 163 horse trams and 650 horses {{under the control of}} the MTT.|$|E

5|$|The siege's failure had wide-ranging repercussions. The {{rescue of}} Constantinople ensured the {{continued}} survival of Byzantium, while the Caliphate's strategic outlook was altered: although regular attacks on Byzantine territories continued, {{the goal of}} outright conquest was abandoned. Historians consider the siege {{to be one of}} history's most important battles, as <b>its</b> <b>failure</b> postponed the Muslim advance into Southeastern Europe for centuries.|$|E
5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), {{the main}} {{difference}} between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was <b>its</b> <b>failure</b> to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|After {{production}} wrapped on Chalk in 1997, Moffat {{announced to}} the cast that he was marrying Vertue. When she eventually asked him for a sitcom, he decided to base it around the evolution of their own relationship. Coupling was first broadcast on BBC2 in 2000, with his wife producing for Hartswood Films. The series proved to be highly successful, running until 2004 and producing four series and twenty-eight episodes, all written by Moffat. He also wrote the original, unbroadcast pilot episode for the U.S. version, also titled Coupling, although this was less successful and was cancelled after four episodes on the NBC network. Moffat has blamed <b>its</b> <b>failure</b> on an unprecedented level of network interference.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Cochrane has {{completed}} {{the first two}} steps introducing his interest-based rights approach; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Peter Singer, is rejected because of <b>its</b> <b>failure</b> to take individuals seriously enough; Cochrane desires an account which takes well-being seriously but is not purely aggregative. This, he suggests, is one based on interest rights. After explicating {{the details of his}} interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number of rights, and that rights approaches are too rationalistic.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 1840s, the cane toad had been {{introduced}} into Martinique and Barbados, from French Guiana and Guyana. An introduction to Jamaica was made in 1844 {{in an attempt to}} reduce the rat population. Despite <b>its</b> <b>failure</b> to control the rodents, the cane toad was introduced to Puerto Rico in the early 20th century in the hope that it would counter a beetle infestation ravaging the sugarcane plantations. The Puerto Rican scheme was successful and halted the economic damage caused by the beetles, prompting scientists in the 1930s to promote it as an ideal solution to agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was a {{milestone}} in the careers of Sullivan and Mansfield. Sullivan left his banking job to become a full-time writer. He wrote three more plays (none successful), several novels, and a two-volume collection of short stories, {{many of which have}} Gothic elements. Sullivan attempted one more stage collaboration with Mansfield, a drama about the Roman emperor Nero, but they became estranged after <b>its</b> <b>failure.</b> For the actor, playing Jekyll and Hyde helped establish his reputation for dramatic roles; he had been known primarily for comedies. Mansfield continued to struggle financially (in part because of his elaborate, expensive productions) before he achieved financial stability in the mid-1890s with a string of successful tours and new productions.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Bijeljina truth {{commission}} was created with a four-year mandate. It held two public hearings in 2008, but by March 2009, {{although it was}} not formally disbanded, the {{commission was}} effectively dissolved when the majority of its members resigned. A number of factors have been cited as contributing to <b>its</b> <b>failure,</b> such as the inclusion of the commander of the Batković concentration camp in its delegation, its limited legal standing, disputes over the commission's scope, and poor funding.|$|E
5|$|In United States ex rel. Chunie v.

The Ninth Circuit held that, although the Chumash's aboriginal title survived the issuance of Mexican land grants to the same islands, the tribe's title was extinguished by <b>its</b> <b>failure</b> to file under the Land Claims Act.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, {{the success}} of Rossini's Semiramide earlier the same season was what allowed A Life to be staged at all, with {{virtually}} all the cast from Semiramide retained for A Life. Despite A Life's success, the furor over Semiramide aroused an overwhelming demand for Italian opera. This proved a setback for Russian opera in general and particularly for Glinka's next opera, Ruslan and Lyudmila when it was produced in 1842. <b>Its</b> <b>failure</b> prompted Glinka to leave Russia; he died in exile.|$|E
40|$|Research has {{provided}} evidence that type usage in source files is correlated with the risk of failure of software components. Previous studies that investigated the correlation between type usage and component failure assigned equal blame to all the types imported by a component with a failure history, regardless of whether a type {{is used in the}} component, or associated to <b>its</b> <b>failures.</b> A failure-prone component may use a type, but it is not always the case that the use of this type has been responsible for any of <b>its</b> <b>failures.</b> To gain more insight about the correlation between type usage and component failure, we introduce the concept of a failure-associated type to represent the imported types referenced within methods fixed due to failures. We conducted two studies to investigate the tradeoffs between the equal-blame approach and the failure-associated type approach. Our results indicate that few of the types or packages imported by a failure-prone component are associated with <b>its</b> <b>failures</b> — less than 25 % of the type imports, and less than 55 % of the packages whose usage were reported to be highly correlated with failures by the equal-blame approach, were actually correlated with failures when we looked at the failure-associated types. ...|$|R

5|$|Released in {{competition}} with Half-Life 2 and several other titles, Bloodlines sold fewer than 80,000 copies during its initial release, which was considered a poor performance. It divided critics at the time; although they praised the game's writing and scale of choice, they criticized its technical flaws. It was Troika Games' last production before <b>its</b> <b>failure</b> in early 2005, when it was unable to secure additional projects. The game has a cult following as a rarely replicated example of gameplay and narrative, and contemporary reception recognised it as a flawed masterpiece. Since its original release in 2004, Bloodlines received post-release support from fans, supplying unofficial fixes and re-adding unused content.|$|E
5|$|Rudraveena is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} cult films in the careers of Balachander and Shobana. In an interview with Rediff.com in April 1997, Chiranjeevi stated that he opted to act in Rudraveena for an image makeover. He added that despite <b>its</b> <b>failure,</b> the film made him happy as it had inspired many villages in Andhra Pradesh. During his tenure as the president of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam visited Chiranjeevi's Eye & Blood Bank (CEBB) in June 2006 and expressed his appreciation for the initiative; the actor recalled the day when he ruled out the climax of Rudraveena ever happening in real life.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series {{has not been}} universal. For example, the Star Trek franchise's lack of same-sex relationships {{has long been a}} sore spot with LGBT fandom, some of whom have organised boycotts against the franchise to protest <b>its</b> <b>failure</b> to include LGBT characters. They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.|$|E
40|$|The New Orleans Prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s office {{under the}} 30 year {{leadership}} of Harry Connick was notorious for <b>its</b> <b>failures</b> {{to comply with}} constitutional requirements to disclose favorable information to the defense.

This article, the result of in depth interviews with key stakeholders in the New Orleans criminal justice system, including former prosecutors, examines the extent and effect of the policy and practice changes. It concludes with a series of proposals to improve disclosure practices in New Orleans that are applicable to other jurisdictions...|$|R
