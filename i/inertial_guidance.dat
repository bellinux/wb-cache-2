5|$|In electronics, {{magnetic}} core memory, radar, single electron transistors, and <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers. Harold Eugene Edgerton {{was a pioneer}} in high speed photography and sonar. Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory. In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography. At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.|$|E
5|$|The High Virgo missile was a {{single-stage}} weapon, {{powered by}} a solid-fueled Thiokol TX-20 rocket, and was equipped an advanced <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> system derived {{from that of the}} AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. Four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided directional control. The missile was developed by Lockheed, utilising components developed for several existing missiles to reduce the cost of the project, and also to reduce the development time required. Convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of the missile from the prototype B-58, the pylon replacing the aircraft's normal weapons pod.|$|E
5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E

25|$|Applications of {{gyroscopes}} include {{inertial navigation}} systems, {{such as in}} the Hubble telescope, or inside the steel hull of a submerged submarine. Due to their precision, gyroscopes are also used in gyrotheodolites to maintain direction in tunnel mining. Gyroscopes can be used to construct gyrocompasses, which complement or replace magnetic compasses (in ships, aircraft and spacecraft, vehicles in general), to assist in stability (bicycles, motorcycles, and ships) or be used as part of an <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> system.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, at {{the start}} of the Korean War, von Braun and his team were {{transferred}} to Huntsville, Alabama, his home for the next 20 years. Between 1952 and 1956, von Braun led the Army's rocket development team at Redstone Arsenal, resulting in the Redstone rocket, which was used for the first live nuclear ballistic missile tests conducted by the United States. He personally witnessed this historic launch and detonation. Work on the Redstone led to development of the first high-precision <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> system on the Redstone rocket.|$|E
25|$|Torque can {{be defined}} as the rate of change of angular momentum, {{analogous}} to force. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning figure skater as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of neutron stars, the falling cat problem, and precession of tops and gyros. Applications include the gyrocompass, control moment gyroscope, <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> systems, reaction wheels, flying discs or Frisbees and Earth's rotation to name a few. In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.|$|E
50|$|Development of WS-1 {{series with}} simple cascade <b>inertial</b> {{terminal}} <b>guidance.</b> Using standard munitions, the range is 40 - 80 km, and when using extended range rounds, the range is increased to 60 - 120 km. The 10-tube launchers contained 2 5-round launching boxes arranged in 2 rows, 2 on top, and 3 at the bottom.|$|R

25|$|The Nimrod's navigational {{functions}} were computerised, {{and were}} managed from a central tactical compartment {{housed in the}} forward cabin; various aircraft functions such as weapons control and information from sensors such as the large forward doppler radar were displayed and controlled at the tactical station. The flight systems and autopilot could be directly controlled by navigator's stations in the tactical compartment, giving the navigator nearly complete aircraft control. The navigational systems comprised digital, analogue, and electro-mechanical elements; the computers were directly integrated {{with most of the}} Nimrod's guidance systems such as the air data computer, astrocompass, <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> and doppler radar. Navigation information could also be manually input by the operators.|$|E
25|$|It {{is powered}} by a single 400 kgf Ukrainian-made, Motor Sich JSC R95-300 {{turbofan}} engine, with pop-out wings for cruising efficiency. It can be launched from both high and low altitudes, and flies at subsonic speeds at low levels (under 110 m/300nbsp&ft altitude). After launch, the missile's folded wings, tail surfaces and engine deploy. It is guided through a combination of an <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> system plus a terrain contour-matching guidance system which uses radar and images stored in the memory of an onboard computer to find its target. This allows the missile to guide itself to the target {{with a high degree of}} accuracy.|$|E
25|$|The Saturn V Instrument Unit is a {{ring-shaped}} structure {{fitted to}} the top of the Saturn V rocket's third stage (S-IVB) and the Saturn IB's second stage (also an S-IVB). It was immediately below the SLA (Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter) panels that contained the Lunar Module. The Instrument Unit contains the guidance system for the Saturn V rocket. Some of the electronics contained within the Instrument Unit are a digital computer, analog flight control computer, emergency detection system, <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> platform, control accelerometers and control rate gyros. The instrument unit (IU) for Saturn V was designed by NASA at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and was developed from the Saturn I IU. NASA's contractor to construct the Saturn V Instrument Unit was International Business Machines (IBM).|$|E

50|$|Modern rocket {{artillery}} {{such as the}} US M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System {{is highly}} mobile and are used in similar fashion to other self-propelled artillery. Global Positioning and <b>Inertial</b> Navigation terminal <b>guidance</b> systems have been introduced.|$|R
25|$|As first {{explained}} by Maximilian Schuler in a 1923 paper, a pendulum whose period exactly equals the orbital {{period of a}} hypothetical satellite orbiting just above {{the surface of the}} earth (about 84 minutes) will tend to remain pointing at the center of the earth when its support is suddenly displaced. This principle, called Schuler tuning, is used in <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> systems in ships and aircraft that operate on the surface of the Earth. No physical pendulum is used, but the control system that keeps the inertial platform containing the gyroscopes stable is modified so the device acts as though it is attached to such a pendulum, keeping the platform always facing down as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Though a {{significant}} percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment, there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. These robots require some combination of navigation hardware and software in order to traverse their environment. In particular, unforeseen events (e.g. people and other obstacles that are not stationary) can cause problems or collisions. Some highly advanced robots such as ASIMO and Meinü robot have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software. Also, self-controlled cars, Ernst Dickmanns' driverless car, and the entries in the DARPA Grand Challenge, are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information. Most of these robots employ a GPS navigation device with waypoints, along with radar, sometimes combined with other sensory data such as lidar, video cameras, and <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> systems for better navigation between waypoints.|$|E
500|$|Four {{test flights}} of the High Virgo missile were conducted. Due to {{development}} problems, {{the first two}} {{did not include the}} <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> system, instead they were fitted with a simple autopilot guiding the weapon on a pre-programmed course. Launched from its B-58 carrier aircraft at high altitude and supersonic speed, the initial flight, conducted on September 5, 1958, was a failure when the missile's controls malfunctioned. The second test, three months later, proved more successful, with the missile flying over a range of nearly [...] The third flight test, the following June, utilized the <b>inertial</b> <b>guidance</b> system for the first time. It was a successful flight.|$|E

50|$|SY400 is {{a further}} {{development}} of SY300, with a typical range of 400 km. As a low cost alternative to ballistic missiles, the accuracy of SY400 is increased by adding GPS to correct the cascade <b>inertial</b> navigational <b>guidance,</b> {{and according to the}} developer, the accuracy can be further improved if military grade GPS signals are used to replacing the existing civilian GPS signal.

The passenger system was the ASC-15 and the ST-124 <b>inertial</b> platform. <b>Guidance</b> was open loop; that is guidance commands were functions only of time. SA-5 also saw the introduction of the Instrument Unit.|$|R
