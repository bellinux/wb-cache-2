500|$|In 2014, Streisand re-recorded {{the track}} with Lionel Richie for her thirty-fourth studio album, Partners (2014).

5000|$|A three-minute pop song is a cliché that {{describes}} the archetype of popular music, based on the average running-length of a typical single. The root of the [...] "three-minute" [...] length is likely derived from the original format of 78 rpm-speed phonograph records; at about 3 to 5 minutes per side, it's <b>just</b> long enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> of a complete song.|$|R
5000|$|The 1968-69 {{period is}} also known for its {{personnel}} changes within the band. Over a single 12-month period, the bass slot vacated by Vernon Dudley Bohay-Nowell was filled by Dave Clague and then Joel Druckman American whose monotone drawl can be heard to humorous effect throughout the [...] "Doughnut" [...] album, before the band recruited the more temperamentally-suitable and amenable Dennis Cowan early in 1969 - <b>just</b> in time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> sessions <b>for</b> their next album.|$|R
5000|$|It may however {{be that a}} {{contractual}} document {{has failed}} to adequately reflect {{the intentions of the}} parties, in which case they can ask the court to [...] "rectify" [...] the agreement (i.e. pretend the words written down were different and give an order accordingly). Asking a court to rectify a document does not mean asking <b>for</b> <b>the</b> contract to be changed.

Rectification is an equitable discretionary remedy, and therefore unavailable to claimants who delay excessively and it has no effect against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice.

500|$|<b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Record...</b> was {{released}} on September 24, 1989 by Columbia Records. It includes four discs, with each disc focusing on a different decade ("The 60s Part I", [...] "The 60s Part II", [...] "The 70s", and [...] "The 80s"). It was initially priced at $79.98 USD and by 1994 was the second best-selling box set collection in the United States (behind only Led Zeppelin's 1990 self-titled box set) with approximately 404,000 copies sold. Serving as a retrospective of Streisand's three decade-spanning career, it features several songs from her catalogue in addition to previously unreleased tracks. Her first studio-recorded track ever, a cover of Mack Gordon and Harry Warren's [...] "You'll Never Know" [...] (1943), was featured as the album's opener track and was recorded in 1955. Howard Reich from PopMatters claimed that Streisand's cover proved that she already had had plenty of talent to become a recording artist, despite her young age. Despite the wide array of producers who contributed to the various tracks included in the collection, Streisand and her manager, Martin Erlichman, were credited as the album's two executive producers. In addition to the four discs of material, <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Record...</b> includes a 92-page color booklet featuring a variety of photos and artwork created throughout her career.|$|E
500|$|<b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Record...</b> {{received}} high {{ratings and}} praise from music critics. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic enjoyed the unique {{nature of the}} record and commented that because [...] "she had complete creative control over th retrospective", {{she was able to}} release a box set consisting of nearly only [...] "rare [...] previously unreleased material". He also labelled the duets with Garland and [...] "Las Vegas Medley" [...] as some of the album's best tracks. In the publication's review of Highlights from <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Record,</b> Ruhlmann was equally appreciative and noted that it serves as a [...] "fine overview of Bab's career" [...] and provides for a [...] "great listening". Describing the large size of the collection, Entertainment Weeklys David Browne compared it to the two installments of Use Your Illusion (volumes I and II) by Guns N' Roses and claimed that it [...] "is impossible to digest in one sitting". Browne ultimately awarded the collection a grade of A- and called it a good representation of the singer's ability to [...] "chang definition of pop" [...] and [...] "make mainstream adult pop that was strong, elegant, [...] even passionate". Joe Brown from The Washington Post was more mixed towards the effort: [...] "All four discs are dotted with oddities that even the most devoted Barbraphiles will program their CD players to skip after the first listen or two"; however, Brown appreciated some of the rarities on the album, including her duets with Garland and her melody of [...] "My Man" [...] and [...] "Auld Lang Syne".|$|E
500|$|American vocalist Barbra Streisand {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "All in Love Is Fair" [...] for her fifteenth studio album, The Way We Were (1974). Shortly following the commercial success of her previous single, [...] "The Way We Were", Columbia Records began compiling tracks for the singer's then-upcoming fifteenth studio album (The Way We Were). Since time was limited, {{the majority of the}} tracks were taken from material recorded by Streisand as much as seven years previously. According to the liner notes of her 1991 greatest hits album <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Record,</b> the only tracks specifically created for the album were [...] "All in Love Is Fair", [...] "The Way We Were", [...] "Being at War with Each Other", and [...] "Something So Right".

5000|$|However, those critics {{might just}} owe them a rethink, because musically-speaking the Anglo-Swedish trio {{have managed to}} {{suppress}} their more irksome tendencies. In fact, 'Choices' finds them adopting an oh-so contemporary electropop complete with big rubbery synths that Calvin Harris wouldn't cock a snook at. Crucially, in the process they haven't lost their ability to pen a proper pop chorus or, for that matter, a middle 8 that swells like an Olympic gold medallist's chest. Odd-pop?

500|$|The {{concept for}} the record first {{developed}} in late 1973, following the success of [...] "The Way We Were", which was written specifically for the 1973 film {{of the same name}} starring Streisand and Robert Redford. American composer and producer Marvin Hamlisch was commissioned to write the melody for the track, which he found to be hugely challenging when due to Streisand's wants; she had wanted him to produce the composition in minor key, but he instead wrote it in major key due to his fear that the song's lyrics would be revealed too quickly to the listener. According to the liner notes of her 1991 greatest hits album <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Record,</b> [...] "The Way We Were", [...] "All in Love is Fair", [...] "Being at War with Each Other", and [...] "Something So Right" [...] were the only tracks specifically recorded and created for the album. The majority of the project's material consisted of demos and recordings from Streisand's recording sessions with Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman for an unreleased album titled The Singer. Both [...] "The Best Thing You've Ever Done" [...] and [...] "Summer Me, Winter Me" [...] were previously released together as a non-album single by Streisand in April 1970, and were originally intended for inclusion on the official soundtrack to her 1970 film The Owl and the Pussycat.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{following}} the commercial success of [...] "The Way We Were", Columbia Records began compiling tracks for the singer's then-upcoming fifteenth studio album.

According to the liner notes of her 1991 greatest hits album <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Record,</b> [...] "The Way We Were", [...] "All in Love is Fair", [...] "Being at War with Each Other", and [...] "Something So Right" [...] {{were the only}} tracks specifically created for the album. The recording and two other variants were also included on the original soundtrack for the film: the original, the instrumental, and the [...] "Finale" [...] version. Individually, it was released as a 7" [...] single in the United States on September 27, 1973 through Columbia Records; the aforementioned edition included the studio version of [...] "The Way We Were", {{in addition to the}} B-side single [...] "What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?", a cover of the 1969 Michael Dees song. The Japanese release featured the same versions with slightly different durations, while the version intended for the Mexico market includes the instrumental version of [...] "The Way We Were" [...] as the B-side track instead.|$|E

50|$|Claudio Strunz, born in La Tablada, {{began his}} career in Heinkel, a band that would be renamed Jeriko.

2500|$|After {{years of}} largely {{ignoring}} Broadway and traditional pop music {{in favor of}} more contemporary material, Streisand returned to her musical-theater roots with 1985's The Broadway Album, which was unexpectedly successful, holding the coveted No. 1 Billboard position for three straight weeks, and being certified quadruple platinum. The album featured tunes by Rodgers and Hammerstein, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Stephen Sondheim, who was persuaded to rework some of his songs especially for this recording. The Broadway Album was met with acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for album of the year and handed Streisand her eighth Grammy as Best Female Vocalist. After releasing the live album One Voice in 1986, Streisand was set to release another album of Broadway songs in 1988. She recorded several cuts for the album under the direction of Rupert Holmes, including [...] "On My Own" [...] (from Les Misérables), a medley of [...] "How Are Things in Glocca Morra?" [...] and [...] "Heather on the Hill" [...] (from Finian's Rainbow and Brigadoon, respectively), [...] "All I Ask of You" [...] (from The Phantom of the Opera), [...] "Warm All Over" [...] (from The Most Happy Fella) and an unusual solo version of [...] "Make Our Garden Grow" [...] (from Candide). Streisand was not happy with the direction of the project and it was scrapped. Only [...] "Warm All Over" [...] and a reworked, lite FM-friendly version of [...] "All I Ask of You" [...] were ever released, the latter appearing on Streisand's 1988 effort, Till I Loved You. At the beginning of the 1990s, Streisand started focusing on her film directorial efforts and became almost inactive in the recording studio. In 1991, a four-disc box set, <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Record,</b> was released.

5000|$|In the 2011 season, {{both teams}} met {{again for a}} Monday Night Football matchup. Like the {{previous}} season, playoff implications were at stake for both teams, however, in a near-inverse of the 2010 meeting, New Orleans, entered Week 16 with an 11-3 record with a playoff berth already clinched, were in better position to win the NFC South division title, and needed a win {{in one of their}} final two games or an Atlanta loss in one of their final two games to clinch the division title, while Atlanta, entering Week 16 with a 9-5 record, needed to win out as well as for New Orleans to lose against Carolina in Week 17 to repeat as NFC South champions. A major historical aspect of this game was Saint Drew Brees' pursuit of Dan Marino's single season record for passing yards, 5084, set in 1984. Entering the game with 4780 yards, Brees needed only 305 in his final two games to obtain <b>the</b> <b>record.</b> Atlanta received <b>the</b> opening kickoff and quickly jumped out to a 3-0 lead but the Saints immediately responded with an 84-yard touchdown drive sparked by Brees' 38-yard completion to Lance Moore on the drive's first play. Brees would end the first quarter with 66 yards. By halftime, Brees was within 75 yards of <b>the</b> <b>record</b> with 230 yards in the first half, {{thanks in large part to}} the 164 yards he notched in the second quarter, which lifted the Saints to a 21-10 lead. Despite only having 45 yards in the third quarter, Brees managed to help the Saints extend their lead to 31-13 and he entered the fourth quarter 30 yards shy of Marino's <b>record.</b> <b>The</b> fourth quarter was somewhat atypical of how the Saints had played during the first three quarters in that they punted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in the game and were held to a three-and-out <b>for</b> <b>the</b> third straight possession dating back to the third quarter when they had to settle for a field goal after failing to get a first down following Darren Sproles' 92-yard kickoff return which set them up with excellent field position at the Atlanta 14-yard line. Continuing the breaking of trends was the Saints' defense, which came into the game having forced the fewest turnovers of any defense in the league. That improved when linebacker Scott Shanle stripped the football from Falcons' wide receiver Julio Jones at the Falcons' 35-yard line and Saints' free safety Malcolm Jenkins grabbed the ball bouncing off the turf in stride and ran 30 yards down <b>the</b> sideline <b>for</b> a touchdown, extending the lead to 38-16. With zero completions or yards through the Saints' first two fourth-quarter possessions, it appeared uncertain if Brees would be able to get <b>the</b> <b>record</b> in front of a national audience in prime time but after the Saints' defense succeeded in stopping the Falcons on fourth down <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second straight possession and having taken over at the Falcons' 32-yard line with Brees needing <b>just</b> 30 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>record,</b> <b>the</b> stage was set <b>for</b> history. On <b>the</b> ensuing drive, Brees completed a 12-yard pass to Marques Colston and an 11-yarder to Devery Henderson, coming to within 7 yards of <b>the</b> <b>record.</b> After an incomplete pass on first and goal from the Falcons' 9-yard line, Brees connected with running back Darren Sproles at the 1-yard line by the left hash mark and he carried it into the end zone, completing <b>the</b> quest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> with Brees at 5087 yards through 15 games and capping off <b>the</b> scoring <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game with the Saints winning 45-16 and clinching the NFC South division title, their third since Sean Payton became head coach in 2006 and fifth in franchise history. Brees ended the night completing 23 of his 39 passing attempts for 307 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions; it was also his 12th game of the season with at least 300 yards passing, an NFL record.|$|R
