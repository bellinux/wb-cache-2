5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Clement's visit, moreover, the Pope had empowered the Bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin and St Andrews {{to take action}} to rescue the bishopric. He told these bishops that, Since the continual care of all the churches is our daily burden, we grant to the said Church , so far as we personally can, and authorise you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> the situation to be as described, to assign to the said Bishop, if it can be done without scandal, a quarter of the teinds of all the parish churches of the Diocese of Dunblane, so that under your guidance and that of upright men, he may set aside a suitable portion of them for his own maintenance, and thereafter assign revenues for a dean and canons whom we wish and authorise you to institute there. Failing this, the Pope wrote, The quarter teinds of all the churches of the Diocese assigned to the Bishop, which are held by laymen, you shall transfer with the episcopal seat to the Canons Regular of St. John in the Diocese , who shall have power to elect a Bishop in any vacancy.|$|E

25|$|Soloveitchik's four step {{scholarly}} {{approach to}} learning has influenced many of his students. The approach {{can be traced back}} to the approach of the Gaon of Vilna. The first step is concentrating on the text. This follows the Vilna Gaon's approach of carefully amending the texts of both exoteric (the Talmud) and esoteric works (for instance, the Torat Kohanim, Tosefta, Avot de-Rabbi Natan, etc.). The second step is knowing the physical reality of the objects described. Third is the conceptual analysis proffered by Rishonim. At this point he introduces an important distinction between Rishonim, which are primary sources, and must be mastered, even if one has to struggle to understand them; and Achronim, which are secondary sources, which can be exploited (<b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> good material, use it, but if you don't understand it, don't spend too much time on it). The fourth and final step is sevarah, creating the intellectual framework underpinning the Torah.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{presents}} a temporary role reversal for Mulder and Scully. When discussing {{the lack of}} evidence at the crime scenes, Scully points out that [...] "a crime is only as perfect as the man [...] Even if he made not one mistake, there still is a motive. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> his motive, you find the murderer". Kaner argues that this logic is {{more in line with}} what Mulder has subscribed to throughout the series. Furthermore, after Mulder discovers Padgett's manuscript, he arrests him [...] "without a second thought". By relying on empirical logic, Mulder is acting in the way Scully normally thinks.|$|E

Later in 2009, they included Stewie's plan to freeze broccoli crops from the same episode in their list of [...] "Stewie's Top 10 Most Diabolical Evil Plans". Another IGN editor, Jeremy Conrad, stated: [...] "There aren't many shows on TV that are this sharp, or brave enough to offend everyone on the face of the planet.

With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing {{completion}} in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be [...] "very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore {{there will probably be}} no artistic merits in it." [...] He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that [...] "I shan't be at all surprised and offended <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts." [...] Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, [...] "the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best." ...|$|E
500|$|Priyanka Chopra {{was cast}} as series protagonist Alex Parrish, {{the result of}} a talent holding deal with ABC Studios which {{required}} the company to develop a starring project for her or cast her in an existing project for the 2015 television season. ABC casting executive Keli Lee had long tried to persuade Chopra to perform on television in the United States. When the actress began considering U.S. TV, Lee learned that Chopra had been approached by another studio: [...] "I said , 'No, you can't make this deal elsewhere. You're coming here. And I'm flying to India. Lee went to India and convinced Chopra to accept ABC's offer. The actress said about Lee: [...] "I told her, the only way I would do it is <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> me a show and a path which first will put me in the same position that I am in India".|$|E
500|$|After {{developing}} {{a name for}} himself as a female impersonator known for [...] "trashy" [...] behavior in his early John Waters films, Divine capitalized on this image by appearing at his musical performances in his drag persona. In this role, he was described by his manager Bernard Jay, as displaying [...] "Trash. Filth. Obscenity. In bucket-loads". [...] Divine described his stage performances as [...] "just good, dirty fun, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> it offensive, honey, don't join in." [...] As a part of his performance, he constantly swore at the audience, often using his signature line of [...] "fuck you very much", and at times got audience members to come onstage, where he would fondle their buttocks, groins, and breasts. Divine and his stage act proved particularly popular among gay audiences, and he appeared at some of the world's biggest gay clubs, such as Central London's Heaven. According to Divine's manager Bernard Jay, this was not because Divine himself was gay, but because the gay community [...] "openly and proudly identified with the determination of the female character Divine".|$|E
