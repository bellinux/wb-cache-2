5000|$|In the 21st-century America, {{citizenship}} {{is generally considered}} to be a legal marker recognizing that a person is an American. Duty is generally not part of citizenship. Citizens generally do not see themselves as having a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>assistance</b> to one another, although officeholders are seen as having a duty to the public. Rather, {{citizenship is}} a bundle of rights which includes being able to get assistance from the federal government. A similar pattern marks the idea of citizenship in many western-style nations. Most Americans do not think much about citizenship except perhaps when applying for a passport and traveling internationally. Feliks Gross sees 20th century America as an [...] "efficient, pluralistic and civic system that extended equal rights to all citizens, irrespective of race, ethnicity and religion." [...] According to Gross, the US can be considered as a [...] "model of a modern civic and democratic state" [...] although discrimination and prejudice still survive. The exception, of course, is that persons living within the borders of America illegally see citizenship as a major issue.|$|E

50|$|The Swabian League {{not only}} took its <b>duty</b> seriously <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>assistance</b> {{for the city}} of Nuremberg {{as a member of the}} League, but also had a cause for concern because of a {{connection}} between the banned Ulrich of Württemberg and the rebel knight, Franz von Sickingen. Von Sickingen's raids extended as far as Trier and he had strong support in the central German knighthood. Even when Von Sickingen died in May 1523 of his war wounds, the Palatine Knights' War and German Peasants' War erupted a few years later, causing widespread unrest that endangered the growing power of the principalities.|$|R
50|$|In 1995 and 1996 {{the system}} {{continued}} its development, {{especially in the}} field of training and professional growth of physicians and medical assistants coming from all corners of the country. In 1997 alone in Târgu Mureş approximately 250 doctors, medical assistants and firemen were trained, and in 1998 this number surpassed 300. In October 1996, the Military Fire Corps Law no. 121 was promulgated by the President. For the first time in Romania, in this law at articles 9 and 18.k it was established that Military Firemen have a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> emergency medical <b>assistance</b> and extrication. This law has put the system within legal boundaries after an experimentation period of approximately 5 years. Consequently, the Emergency Mobile Service for Resuscitation and Extrication was named the Intervention Station for Emergency Medical Assistance and Extrication (SIAMUD). In Mureş County, currently both names are in use, SMURD or SIAMUD.|$|R
5000|$|A local {{authority}} must accept {{an application for}} assistance from a person seeking homelessness assistance if they {{have reason to believe}} that the person may be homeless or threatened with homelessness. They are then <b>duty</b> bound <b>to</b> make inquiries into that person's circumstances in order to decide whether a legal <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> accommodation and <b>assistance</b> is owed. [...] "Interim accommodation" [...] must be <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> those that may be eligible for permanent assistance pending a final decision. If the {{local authority}} decides that a person is homeless but does not fall into a priority need category, then a lesser duty shall be owed which does not extend to the provision of temporary accommodation. If the authority decides that a person is homeless and priority need but became homeless intentionally then the authority must secure that accommodation is available for such a period as will give the person reasonable time to find long term accommodation, which can extend to provision of temporary accommodation. The local authority shall in all the above cases be lawfully obliged to offer advice and assistance.|$|R

The thesis {{consists}} of two main parts. First part deals with explaining of three basic Acta Reus of crimes of failure <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>assistance,</b> their common features and their differences. First chapter and its sub-chapters discuss problematic areas related to cases of failure <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>assistance.</b> These include: the general and special <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> rescue; attempts of rescue in cases of failure <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> assistance; and questions related to committing of other crimes concurrently with failure <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>assistance.</b> Furthermore, the first chapter explains the most important concept in questions of failure <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>assistance</b> which {{is the concept of}} 'duty to rescue'. It goes on to explain additional concepts such as 'endangering oneself or others', 'profession-based <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> rescue', 'damage to health', 'vehicle driver' and 'traffic collision'. The first part of thesis is concluded with overview of changes in Czech (and Czechoslovakian) legislation since 1950 related to crimes of failure <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>assistance.</b> Second part is dedicated to court case law, systematically divided by their major topic into five chapters.

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} {{are social}} disruptions triggered by physical events. Every year, hundreds of natural disasters occur {{and tens of}} thousands of people are killed as a result. I maintain that everyone would want <b>to</b> be <b>provided</b> with <b>assistance</b> in the aftermath a natural disaster. If a national government is not <b>providing</b> post disaster <b>assistance,</b> then we expect that some other institution has the responsibility <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> it. Unfortunately, that is not the case currently. Therefore, in this thesis I argue that in some situations the international community is required to intervene on behalf of those affected by the disaster caused by a natural hazard. Natural disaster intervention is a moral requirement: because the international community has a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the goods we are entitled to as per the human right to welfare, even in natural disaster scenarios. After making my argument as to why a natural disaster intervention policy should be developed I explain the basic principles of such a policy by applying the Just War criteria to natural disaster scenarios in which a national government is unable or unwilling <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>to</b> its people...|$|R
