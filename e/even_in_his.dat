5|$|Beebe {{was an avid}} {{player of}} tennis, and {{remained}} skilled enough to beat others at it <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early seventies. Other pastimes enjoyed by him included parties, theater, dancing, and occasionally cinema.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{punishment}} his body took throughout his career, Taylor remained relatively injury-free {{compared to other}} power running backs. He has remained in good health <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> later years, which he has credited to his conditioning routine.|$|E
5|$|After his Brandauer trilogy, Szabó {{continued}} to make international co-productions, filming {{in a variety of}} languages and European locations. He has {{continued to}} make some films in Hungarian, however, and <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> international co-productions, he often films in Hungary and uses Hungarian talent.|$|E

5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early years, Linnæus {{seemed to}} have a liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which {{immediately}} calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnæus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the advice}} of his older brother, Breckinridge {{obtained}} his law license on January 3, 1824, but the practice of law did not suit him. He instead decided to follow the family tradition and seek public office, campaigning for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early political career, he began to articulate his stance on the issues that would become his legacy.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} medicine, Rizal {{remained an}} above-average, although his grades were not high {{as those that}} he received in classes {{in the arts and}} letters. This continued <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> later studies in Madrid. Rizal was not recorded to have ever complained about his grades in the University, while he did complain about those he received in Madrid.|$|E

5|$|By 1889 Verdi {{had been}} an opera {{composer}} for more than fifty years. He had written 27 operas, of which only one was a comedy, his second work, Un giorno di regno, staged unsuccessfully in 1840. His fellow composer Rossini commented that he admired Verdi greatly, but thought him incapable of writing a comedy. Verdi disagreed {{and said that he}} longed to write another light-hearted opera, but nobody would give him the chance. He had included moments of comedy <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> tragic operas, for example in Un ballo in maschera and La forza del destino.|$|E
5|$|Critics commented {{upon the}} character's {{resemblance}} both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, {{as well as}} to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and fall in the public eye and the precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team was adamant that they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish to suggest that the character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and made sure that this was emphasised <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> final act of self-sacrifice. Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series.|$|E
5|$|Despite wide popular interest, Escher was {{for long}} {{somewhat}} neglected {{in the art}} world; <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> native Netherlands, he was 70 before a retrospective exhibition was held. In the twenty-first century, major exhibitions have been held in cities across the world. An exhibition of his work in Rio de Janeiro however attracted more than 573,000 visitors in 2011; its daily visitor count of 9,677 made it the most visited museum exhibition of the year, anywhere in the world. No major exhibition of Escher's work was held in Britain until 2015, when the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art ran one in Edinburgh from June to September 2015, moving in October 2015 to the Dulwich Picture Gallery, London. The exhibition moved to Italy in 2015–2016, attracting over 500,000 visitors in Rome and Bologna, and then Milan.|$|E

5|$|He {{achieved}} {{his greatest}} international success with Mephisto (1981), {{which won the}} Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Since then, most of Szabó's films have been international co-productions filmed {{in a variety of}} languages and European locations. He has continued to make some films in Hungarian, however, and <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> international co-productions, he often films in Hungary and uses Hungarian talent. Szabó became involved in a national controversy in 2006 when the Hungarian newspaper Life and Literature revealed that he had been an informant of the Communist regime’s secret police.|$|E
5|$|Like Conrad von Soest, Lochner often applied black {{cross-hatching}} on gold, {{usually to}} render metallic {{objects such as}} brooches, crowns or buckles, in imitation of goldsmiths work on precious objects such as reliquaries and chalices. He was heavily influenced by the art and process of metalwork and goldsmithing, especially in his painting of gold grounds, {{and it has been}} suggested that he may have once trained as a goldsmith. Evidence of his imitation of elements of their craft is apparent <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> underdrawings. Notable and elaborate painted examples include the tooled gold border of the angelic concert in his Last Judgement, and Gabriel's clasp on the outer wing of the Dombild altarpiece.|$|E
5|$|Gray {{was an avid}} reader <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> youth. He {{completed}} Clinton Grammar School {{from about}} 1823 to 1825, in those years reading many books from the nearby library at Hamilton College. In 1825 he enrolled at Fairfield Academy, switching to its Fairfield Medical College, {{also known as the}} Medical College of the Western District of Fairfield, in autumn 1826. It was during this time that Gray began to mount botanical specimens. On a trip to New York City, he attempted to meet with John Torrey to get assistance in identifying specimens, but Torrey was not home, so Gray left the specimens at Torrey's house. Torrey was so impressed with Gray's specimens that he began a correspondence with him. Gray graduated and became an M.D. in February 1831, even though he was not yet 21 years of age, which was a requirement at the time. Although Gray did open a medical office in Bridgewater, New York, where he had served an apprenticeship with Doctor John Foote Trowbridge while he was in medical school, he never truly practiced medicine as he enjoyed botany more. It was around this time that he began making explorations in New York and New Jersey. By autumn 1831 he had essentially given up his medical practice to devote more time to botany.|$|E

5|$|In {{her account}} of the affair, Margaret Macaulay explores 18th-century attitudes to women in general as a {{significant}} factor and notes that although numerous documents {{from the hands of}} Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself. Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children. Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour. Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun. Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale {{from the perspective of the}} descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.|$|E
5|$|In 1320 {{he again}} {{accompanied}} Edward II to France, {{and the next}} year he carried out peace negotiations with the Scots. When in 1322 Thomas of Lancaster rebelled and was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge, Richmond was present at his trial, and when Lancaster was sentenced to death. After this, the English invaded Scotland only to have their army starved when Robert the Bruce burned the country before them. The Bruce brought his army into England and crossed the Solway Firth in the west, making his way in a south-easterly direction towards Yorkshire; he brought many troops recruited in Argyll and the Isles. The boldness and speed of the attack soon exposed Edward II to danger, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own land. On his return from Scotland, the king had taken up residence at Rievaulx Abbey with Queen Isabella. His peace was interrupted when the Scots made a sudden and unexpected approach in mid-October. All that stood between them and a royal prize was a large English force under the command of John of Brittany. John had taken up a position on Scawton Moor, between Rievaulx and Byland Abbey. To dislodge John from his strong position on the high ground, Bruce used the same tactics that brought victory at the earlier Battle of the Pass of Brander. As Moray and Douglas charged uphill a party of Highlanders scaled the cliffs on the English flank and charged downhill into John of Brittany's rearguard. Resistance crumbled, and the Battle of Old Byland turned into a rout. John himself was taken prisoner and given a tongue lashing for his cowardice by Robert the Bruce. John remained in captivity until 1324, when he was released for a ransom of 14,000marks.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} ten {{or twelve}} years of Ibn Sīnā's life were spent {{in the service of}} the Kakuyid ruler Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar (also known as Ala al-Dawla), whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> numerous campaigns.|$|E
