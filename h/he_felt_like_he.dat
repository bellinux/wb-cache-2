5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2016, André Gomes and Paco Alcácer were both sold to Barcelona and Shkodran Mustafi was sold to Arsenal, while Ezequiel Garay and former Manchester United player Nani were brought in. Pako Ayestarán was sacked on 21 September 2016 after four-straight defeats at the {{beginning}} of the 2016–17 season. Former Italy national team head coach Cesare Prandelli was hired as his replacement on 28 September. However, he resigned after just three months on 30 December, claiming the club had made him false transfer promises. Days later, on 7 January 2017, Valencia sporting director Jesús García Pitarch also resigned, saying <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was being used as a shield for criticism by the club and that he could not defend something he no longer believed in. Voro was named caretaker manager for the fifth time until the end of season, with Valencia in 17th position and in danger of relegation. However, results improved under Voro and he steered Valencia clear off relegation, ultimately finishing the season in 13th place. On 27 March, Mateu Alemany was named the new director general of Valencia.|$|E

25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his {{appearance}} as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good feeling about the casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a bit nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E

Still, he was accessible and held himself accountable on the rare occasions that he failed. Hoffman was more accommodating for interviews after blown saves than he was after successful ones. [...] "The people asking the questions are not responsible for the ball flying out of the park", he explained. Both Towers and Black best remember Hoffman for his accountability after his blown save in the 2007 Wild Card tie-breaker.|$|E

Technology evangelist Jon Udell admitted that, in his [...] "retreats" [...] from the Internet, he sometimes struggled to settle into [...] "books, particularly fiction, and particularly in printed form". He found portable long-form audio to be [...] "transformative", however, because he can easily achieve [...] "sustained attention", which makes him optimistic about the potential to [...] "reactivate ancient traditions, like oral storytelling, and rediscover their powerful neural effects".|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Sarsgaard {{starred in}} the drama The Dying Gaul, where he plays Robert Sandrich, a {{struggling}} screenwriter {{who has written a}} serious love story about a man and his terminally ill partner. The film received favourable reviews. In an interview, Sarsgaard said, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was playing a character based on Craig Lucas, the director, whom he describes as [...] "elitist in a fun way". Because his character, a screenwriter, is also [...] "elitist," [...] when he sells his soul by compromising his artistic vision, [...] "...the conflict seems bigger. Anyone can sell their soul. Even people with integrity. There's always that temptation to guard against. Which is why it's best to keep as much as possible hidden." ...|$|E

500|$|Residents {{who have}} bought apartments {{next to the}} High Line Park have adapted to its {{presence}} in varying ways, but most responses are positive; some, however, claim that the park became a [...] "tourist-clogged catwalk" [...] since it opened. The real estate boom has not been victimless, however, many well-established businesses in west Chelsea have closed due to loss of neighborhood customer base or rent increases. Additionally, the majority of visitors to the High Line are tourists rather than locals, and the tourists tend to be overwhelmingly white while the demographics of Chelsea contain significant minority communities, many of whom live in two large public housing developments. In a 2017 interview, Hammond said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> [...] "failed" [...] the community because the High Line did not fulfill its original purpose of serving the surrounding neighborhood, which instead had grown demographically divided around the High Line.|$|E

[...] He said <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was in [...] "internal exile" [...] following September 11 attacks as the US media had become [...] "conservative and timid" [...] and did not welcome the provocative art that he felt the need to create.

500|$|Of Presley's {{films in}} the 1960s, 15 were {{accompanied}} by soundtrack albums and another 5 by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules—he frequently starred in three a year—affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: [...] "three ballads, one medium-tempo , one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie". As the decade wore on, {{the quality of the}} soundtrack songs grew [...] "progressively worse". Julie Parrish, who appeared in Paradise, Hawaiian Style (1966), says that he hated many of the songs chosen for his films. The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how Presley would retreat from the studio microphone: [...] "The material was so bad that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> couldn't sing it." [...] Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. But by and large, according to biographer Jerry Hopkins, the numbers seemed to be [...] "written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll." [...] Regardless of the songs' quality, {{it has been argued that}} Presley generally sang them well, with commitment. Critic Dave Marsh heard the opposite: [...] "Presley isn't trying, probably the wisest course in the face of material like 'No Room to Rumba in a Sports Car' and 'Rock-a-Hula Baby.'" ...|$|E

50|$|They {{lived in}} a {{primarily}} white community; in fact, Trejo and his siblings were often the only Mexican Americans in their classes and often felt left out by their classmates. The lack of representation in his surroundings led Trejo to look for self-identification through other sources, especially art, which became the main source for his self-identification. Trejo earned his M.F.A. in sculpture from the University of Minnesota in 1969. He also earned a minor in Latin American Literature which really helped him learn about his culture and language. In his art classes, <b>he</b> often <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> lacked representation. His professors often asked him {{to look to the}} prominent white artists of the time for inspiration, but instead <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> influence by artists and writers such as Octavio Paz and Guillermo Gómez-Pena, who helped him explore his worldview and identity.|$|R
5000|$|In Tokyo in the Meiji era there lived two {{prominent}} teachers of opposite characteristics. One, Unsho, an instructor in Shingon, kept Buddha's precepts scrupulously. He never drank intoxicants, {{nor did he}} eat after eleven o'clock in the morning. [...] The other teacher, Tanzan, a professor of philosophy at the Imperial University, never observed the precepts. When <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> eating <b>he</b> ate, and when <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> sleeping in the daytime he slept. [...] One day Unsho visited Tanzan, who was drinking wine at the time, not even a drop of {{which is supposed to}} touch the tongue of a Buddhist. [...] 'Hello, brother,' Tanzan greeted him. 'Won't you have a drink?' [...] 'I never drink!' exclaimed Unsho solemnly. [...] 'One who does not drink is not even human,’ said Tanzan. [...] 'Do you mean to call me inhuman just because I do not indulge in intoxicating liquids!' exclaimed Unsho in anger. Then if I am not human, what am I?' [...] 'A Buddha.' answered Tanzan.|$|R
500|$|In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, {{travelled}} {{to their}} Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, Casino Royale, {{which had been}} published in April 1953, and Live and Let Die, whose publication was imminent. He began writing Moonraker on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for Books and Bookmen magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, [...] "This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in my mind for many years." [...] He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he [...] "had to more or less graft {{the first half of the}} book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length".|$|E

I would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen. I never made comments to the effect that I had credit (genius) taken from me... The lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried the right message, at least partly... I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the trailer, although a bit exaggerated." [...] Wozniak did not ask to see the final script because he did not [...] "think that would be appropriate... it is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others." [...] He also noted that the trailer's reference to Jobs' initial rejection of his daughter Lisa evoked an emotional response: [...] "It was hard on me, even being quiet, when Jobs refused to acknowledge his child when the money didn't matter, and I can almost cry remembering it." [...] In September 2015, after seeing a rough cut of the film, Wozniak stated that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> [...] "was actually watching Steve Jobs and the others [...] not actors playing them, I give full credit to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for getting it so right." [...] In an interview with San Francisco Chronicle on February 10, 2016, Wozniak claimed that the film's scenes between him and Jobs never occurred in reality. Wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team onstage, as was shown in the movie. However, he added that Jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group. When asked about the accuracy of the film's portrayal of Jobs, Wozniak replied: [...] "In real life, to real people, that's the way he could be, very sharp, (although) never quite as much as in the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|When Rich Rodriguez {{arrived to}} replace the retired Carr prior to the 2008 season, he {{announced}} the Wolverines would be using a new punting formation along with the spread offense. [...] Instead of using two gunners, the team switched to using six, and Meskó switched to rolling out and using directional kicks. [...] The plan called for a mixture of employing traditional pocket punts and roll out for rugby style ones. [...] Meskó said the changes to the team were so drastic under Rodriguez that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had transferred. On all seven of his punts in the opening game against Utah, Meskó rolled out to his left before punting. [...] The new punt scheme {{was part of the}} option offense and could have resulted in a fake punt. In Michigan's third game against Notre Dame on 13 September, Meskó executed an option run for 13yards and a first down. [...] Meskó also executed a seven-yard option run for a first down against Minnesota on 8 November in the Little Brown Jug game. Meskó had a couple of punts blocked during the season, and one was returned for a touchdown during the Michigan – Ohio State game. During the season, Meskó served as K.C. Lopata's holder on placekicks. Meskó repeated a Guy Award watchlist candidate in 2008. After the list was narrowed from fifty to ten, Meskó was a semifinalist for the award. Meskó led the Big Ten in punting average and finished twentieth in the nation. He was named to the Big Ten All Conference First-Team in 2008. [...] He was recognized by Phil Steele as a fourth team All-American for 2008. Meskó was Academic All-Conference for a third time. [...] At the conclusion of the 2008–09 academic year, the inaugural class of Big Ten Distinguished Scholars was recognized for having attained a 3.7 GPA for the academic year while earning varsity letters, [...] and Meskó was among the honorees.|$|E

In court, Claude makes an eloquent speech in which he calmly tells the judge the full details of the events which had provoked him to commit the crime of murder, and he admits his guilt. However when the King's attorney then states that Claude Gueux had committed the murder unprovoked, Claude becomes angry and he reiterates a long series of acts of extreme provocation on the part of the Director. The president of the court then sums up the case, and in doing so he only mentions the facts about Claude Gueux which are adverse, albeit incontrovertibly true. Claude is then found guilty and sentenced to death.|$|R
