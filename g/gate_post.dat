500|$|Oxbow had a {{reputation}} as a front-runner who was difficult to rate during his races. Plagued with frequent turnover in jockeys prior to the Triple Crown series, and often running from poor starting <b>gate</b> <b>post</b> positions, he had only two wins prior to his victory in the Preakness. That success was Calumet Farm's first win in a Triple Crown race in 45 years and breeder Richard Santulli's first win in a Triple Crown classic race. [...] It also was Stevens' first Triple Crown win since 2001, following his return to riding in early 2013 after a seven-year retirement, and Lukas' first Triple Crown win since 2000.|$|E
2500|$|... 11 June: a taxi-driver {{and former}} UDR soldier was lured and shot dead by the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade {{off the main}} Omagh to Cookstown road. RUC detectives believe that the tax-driver died {{in a burst of}} {{automatic}} fire and his foot jammed on the accelerator, sending the car crashing into a <b>gate</b> <b>post,</b> where his body was found.|$|E
2500|$|The square {{sandstone}} base is not contemporary {{with the}} old cross; it bears a carved cross and the words 'Laugh Moor' on the front face. The top face of this square base stone carries the words [...] "Ora Pro Anima Comerchie De Laugh", translating as [...] "Pray {{for the soul of}} De Laugh foully murdered." [...] When Robert Riddell found the cross it was in use as a <b>gate</b> <b>post,</b> as shown by the niche cut {{into the back of the}} stone.|$|E

5|$|On August 15, 2014, Bill <b>Gates</b> <b>posted</b> a {{video of}} himself on Facebook {{in which he is}} seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. <b>Gates</b> <b>posted</b> the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg {{challenged}} him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).|$|R
50|$|The {{cards in}} the rails are {{available}} for play, {{to be placed on}} the foundations or onto other {{cards in the}} rail. The cards in the rails are built down by alternating color (a card with a red suit over a one with a black suit, and vice versa). Spaces in the rails are filled using cards from the <b>gate</b> <b>posts.</b> If the cards in the <b>gate</b> <b>posts</b> are used up, the top card of the wastepile, or the next card in the stock if there is no wastepile, can be used to fill spaces. The <b>gate</b> <b>posts</b> are never replenished.|$|R
60|$|Eight-sixty-one Jessamine Street was a decayed mansion. Thirty yards {{back from}} the street it stood, outmerged in a splendid grove of trees and {{untrimmed}} shrubbery. A row of box bushes overflowed and almost hid the paling fence from sight; the gate was kept closed by a rope noose that encircled the <b>gate</b> <b>post</b> and the first paling of the gate. But when you got inside you saw that 861 was a shell, a shadow, a ghost of former grandeur and excellence. But in the story, I have not yet got inside.|$|E
6000|$|He {{leaped from}} the cart, gave the rein a turn round the <b>gate</b> <b>post,</b> and {{ran along the}} green path of the wood-lot as if Old Nick were chasing behind. Just then the village clock tolled eight, and as each deep stroke fell, Dominicus gave a fresh bound and flew faster than before, till, dim in the solitary centre of the orchard, he saw the fated pear-tree. One great branch {{stretched}} from the old contorted trunk across the path, and threw the darkest shadow on that one spot. But something seemed to struggle beneath the branch! ...|$|E
60|$|Later in {{the evening}} Fitzpiers was summoned to visit a cottage patient about two miles distant. Like the {{majority}} of young practitioners in his position he was far from having assumed the dignity of being driven his rounds by a servant in a brougham that flashed the sunlight like a mirror; his way of getting about was {{by means of a}} gig which he drove himself, hitching the rein of the horse to the <b>gate</b> <b>post,</b> shutter hook, or garden paling of the domicile under visitation, or giving pennies to little boys to hold the animal during his stay--pennies which were well earned when the cases to be attended were of a certain cheerful kind that wore out the patience of the little boys.|$|E

5000|$|One {{style of}} gate {{is called the}} Hampshire gate in the UK, a New Zealand gate in some areas, and often simply a [...] "gate" [...] elsewhere. Made of wire with posts {{attached}} at both ends and in the middle, it is permanently wired {{on one side and}} attaches to a <b>gate</b> <b>post</b> with wire loops on the other. Most designs can be opened by hand, though some gates that are frequently opened and closed may have a lever attached to assist in bringing the upper wire loop over the <b>gate</b> <b>post</b> ...|$|E

50|$|Located in {{a central}} {{position}} on the Walker street boundary of the hospital site are four substantial rendered masonry <b>gate</b> <b>posts</b> with cast iron palisade gate. The central two <b>gate</b> <b>posts</b> are larger than the flanking posts and all feature steeply pitched double gabled cap. The faces of the central posts have trefoiled lancet-type recesses and this motif is repeated on the smaller posts with circular recesses housing trefoils. The corner edges of the posts are chamfered and the posts have enlarged bases.|$|R
50|$|Following road {{widening}} in the 1970s {{the front}} fencing was removed and the <b>gates</b> and <b>gate</b> <b>posts</b> (replicas of the originals) were relocated higher up the hill.|$|R
50|$|Of {{interest}} in Kellington {{is the local}} parish church, St Edmunds, dating back to at least 1185, its <b>gate</b> <b>posts</b> were built in 1698 and are under a protection order.|$|R
50|$|The {{name comes}} from the fact that once {{released}} after opening, the gate comes together with its <b>gate</b> <b>post</b> making a sharp sound or 'clap' as it shuts. This is unlike a kissing gate, which only 'kisses' or lightly touches its frame.|$|E
50|$|Hidden in {{the trees}} {{at the back of}} the village green is a school <b>gate</b> <b>post</b> which is from when there was a school on the village green and also horse {{mounting}} steps which are from when there was a pub on the village green.|$|E
50|$|No {{remains of}} the station {{are to be found}} at the site, however the <b>gate</b> <b>post</b> survives in situ and the {{sections}} of the road leading to the overbridge remain together with remnants of the bridge itself.

50|$|The astute {{observer}} {{can find}} those few {{traces of the}} site's former railway use. Two cast iron GWR ball top gate posts and one level crossing <b>gate</b> <b>post</b> survive along with rails in the roadway approaching the Ironbridge toll house.

The <b>gate</b> <b>post</b> and the wagon and the whip and anything around there. A hat they talk to 'em, you know. 'Wassa madda wit you, hat?' They imbue them, with personality." ...|$|E
