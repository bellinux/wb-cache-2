40|$|The central {{question}} {{addressed in this}} paper is how policy makers and environmental/natural resource management decision makers in NSW make the most appropriate use of the large amounts of public funds available for environmental improvement across catchments.

A substantial information requirement is implied to predict or measure benefits – in both predicting the quantity of environmental gain from alternative proposals and in the derivation of associated environmental values. The provision of information through (1) bio-physical modelling, and (2) environmental economic valuation methods, is discussed and some <b>issue</b> for Catchment <b>Management</b> <b>Authorities</b> in NSW are canvassed...|$|R
