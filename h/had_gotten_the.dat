5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E

When confronted by his friends, Kabir confesses {{to the other two}} that he is still not ready for a marriage, and that Natasha <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> wrong idea (of him proposing to her) on seeing the ring that he had bought for his mother as a birthday present. On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make a pact to make a promise if they survive the event. Imran vows to publish his poetry (which he has penned down in his private diary), Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha that {{he does not want to}} marry her.

25|$|Boas's {{stance against}} spying {{took place in}} the context of his {{struggle}} to establish a new model for academic anthropology at Columbia University. Previously, American anthropology was based at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Peabody Museum at Harvard, and these anthropologists competed with Boas's students for control over the American Anthropological Association (and its flagship publication American Anthropologist). When the National Academy of Sciences established the National Research Council in 1916 as a means by which scientists could assist the United States government prepare for entry into the war in Europe, competition between the two groups intensified. Boas's rival, W.H. Holmes (who <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> job of Director at the Field Museum for which Boas had been passed over 26 years earlier), was appointed to head the NRC; Morley was a protégé of Holmes.|$|E
25|$|During the 2005–06 season, Pirès {{started the}} season poorly, and {{players such as}} Freddie Ljungberg, José Antonio Reyes and Alexander Hleb were {{preferred}} to him on both wings. As the season progressed, though, Pirès's form improved, outscoring his selection rivals overall mainly because of a bizarre penalty incident with Thierry Henry against Man City when Pires having scored from the spot earlier in the game tried passing it to Arsenal's star striker but Henry missed the ball and it went down as a penalty miss. Pirès was instrumental in Arsenal Quarter Final Champions League first leg against Juventus F.C., where Arsenal won 2–0. Pirès successfully tackled Patrick Vieira and fed the ball to Thierry Henry who passed to Fàbregas to score Arsenal's first goal, {{the first time that}} Pirès <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> better of Vieira. Pirès played his last game for Arsenal in the UEFA Champions league final against Barcelona, in which he was substituted for replacement goalkeeper Manuel Almunia after starter Jens Lehmann was sent off.|$|E
25|$|Joe {{tried to}} attack Jarrett on the October 21 edition of Impact!, but {{was stopped by}} TNA's {{security}} officers Gunner and Murphy, before being beat down by Jarrett. Joe returned two weeks later, attacking Jarrett, Gunner and Murphy. At Turning Point Jarrett defeated Joe, after choking him out with a baton, following interference from Gunner and Murphy. The following month at Final Resolution Joe faced Jarrett in a submission match. After a pre–match assault and later an interference by Gunner and Murphy, Jarrett managed to force Joe to submit with an ankle lock. Earlier that same day {{it was reported that}} Joe's contract with TNA had expired. On December 17, 2010, TNA president Dixie Carter announced on her Twitter page that Joe had re–signed with the promotion. Joe returned on the January 6, 2011, edition of Impact!, confronting D'Angelo Dinero and claiming that he had not been using his donations to help the needy, like he was supposed to. Two weeks later Okato was revealed as the camera man, whom Joe had hired to follow Dinero and from whom he <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> video footage to support his claim. On February 13 at Against All Odds Joe defeated Dinero in a singles match, but was afterwards attacked and bloodied by him.

[...] Similarly, many readers and theatre-goers were disturbed by Steiner's fictional Hitler, and the author admitted that his character <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> better of him.

500|$|Charisma Carpenter had {{originally}} planned {{to read for}} the role of Buffy, but was late for her audition and instead tried out for Cordelia.

After Carpenter's audition, Gellar, who had been offered the role of Cordelia before Carpenter, was asked to come back and audition for the part of Buffy. Bianca Lawson originally won the role of Cordelia Chase, but turned it down due to other contractual obligations. Lawson would later be cast as vampire slayer Kendra in the show's second season. Cordelia was originally intended to serve as a dramatic foil to Buffy, and to represent the characteristics of the less mature and shallower Buffy portrayed in the original film.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on the {{controversy}} the book generated, Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron Rosenbaum (author of Explaining Hitler) {{that he too}} was disturbed by it, adding that his fictional Hitler <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> better of him, [...] "golem- or Frankenstein-like". He said that {{it felt like the}} book [...] "wrote me". Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: [...] "My feeling is that one has to grapple with the abyss if one can." [...] In his 1997 memoir, Errata: An Examined Life, Steiner remarked that had he known what the response to The Portage and its stage interpretation would be, he would have made the novella [...] "my foremost business".|$|E
