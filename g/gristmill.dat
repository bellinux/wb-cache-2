5|$|A forge was {{constructed}} on Nanticoke Creek in 1778 by Mason F. Alden and John Alden. A log <b>gristmill</b> was also {{built in the}} area in the same year by a Mr. Chapman. The mill was heavily guarded in 1780. In 1793, there was a sawmill and <b>gristmill</b> on the creek.|$|E
5|$|The mill is now {{included}} on the National Register of Historic Places, {{and is the only}} <b>gristmill</b> in Oregon to still grind flour. It is also the oldest water-powered <b>gristmill</b> west of the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes a {{fulling mill}} and <b>gristmill</b> would {{share the same}} {{building}} or the same leat and mill pond.|$|E
50|$|Geared <b>gristmills</b> {{were also}} {{built in the}} medieval Near East and North Africa, which were used for {{grinding}} grain and other seeds to produce meals. <b>Gristmills</b> in the Islamic world were powered by both water and wind. The first wind-powered <b>gristmills</b> {{were built in the}} 9th and 10th centuries in what are now Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran.|$|R
25|$|Geared <b>gristmills</b> {{were invented}} by Muslim engineers, and {{were used for}} {{crushing}} metallic ores before extraction. <b>Gristmills</b> in the Islamic world were often made from both watermills and windmills. In order to adapt water wheels for <b>gristmilling</b> purposes, cams were used for raising and releasing trip hammers. The first forge driven by a hydropowered water mill rather than manual labour was invented in the 12th century Islamic Spain.|$|R

5|$|There is no {{surviving}} documentation for {{the creation}} of Van Cortlandt Lake. In 1699, Jacobus Van Cortlandt dammed Tibbetts Brook to power a sawmill, creating a mill pond at the site where the lake is. Later, he also added a <b>gristmill.</b> The sawmill was relocated around 1823 and stayed in operation until 1889. The <b>gristmill</b> was destroyed by lightning in 1901.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, Richard and Israel Inman {{constructed}} a <b>gristmill</b> {{at the foot}} of Solomon's Falls. It was converted to a house in 1833 and destroyed in 1850. A <b>gristmill</b> on the creek in Hanover Township had been built by 1812 and was run by George Mesinger. It was destroyed in 1840. In 1845, William Petty constructed the <b>gristmill</b> called Petty Mill in Hanover Township. This mill burned down in 1887. The Wyoming Division Canal, which was constructed in the 1830s, started at Solomon Creek. Construction of the Ashley Planes in the Solomon Creek gap began in 1837. They were used until 1848. An iron-producing forge operated on the creek in Ashley until 1839. There was also a sawmill on it until 1839. A powder mill operated on Solomon Creek, but was replaced with a brewery by 1885. A slaughterhouse discharged its waste into the creek in the early 20th century. The creek was used as the water supply for the Huber Breaker from the 1930s to the 1970s. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Solomon Creek.|$|E

5|$|In Delaware, the {{flooding}} damaged numerous houses, including 194 in the Glenville area. The rapid flooding trapped numerous {{people in their}} cars and homes, forcing at least one rescue by helicopter. Those people were evacuated to nearby schools. The severe flooding washed out most of a bridge in Hockessin and destroyed 6 Wilmington & Western Railroad bridges, causing about $5million (2003USD, $5.5million 2006USD) in damage. The railroad bridges were still being rebuilt as of 2006. Greenbank Mill, a historic <b>gristmill</b> complex, saw $450,000 in damage. Damage in Delaware totaled to $16.1million (2003USD, $17.5million 2006USD).|$|E
5|$|John Mordan {{settled on}} Little Fishing Creek in Mount Pleasant Township in the 1790s. He also {{built the first}} sawmill in Mount Pleasant Township on Little Fishing Creek. When {{numerous}} other settlers arrived {{in the vicinity of}} Mordan's mill, the area became known as Mordansville. There was also once an obscure <b>gristmill</b> on an island on the creek.

5|$|There {{used to be}} {{a village}} of Delaware Indians at the mouth of Mahoning Creek. One of the first {{buildings}} in Danville, a <b>gristmill</b> built by George Montgomery's father, was built on Mahoning Creek. A tract of 180 acres in Danville, including an area along the creek, was once owned by the Penn family. Phillip Maus was among the first settlers in Valley Township, Montour County, having settled there in 1769. In 1772, Robert Curry settled on Mahoning Creek {{and was one of the}} first settlers in that part of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|A <b>gristmill</b> {{built at}} the mouth of the creek was one of the first {{manufacturing}} buildings on the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of Big Island. In 1864 a large sawmill was constructed on Tangascootack Creek a short distance above the mouth and several years later a shingle mill was built in the area. The sawmill was also expanded and six dams were constructed on the creek. The total cost of this project was $100,000. Agriculture was another industry that was practiced in the area of the creek in the early 1900s. In 1859 the Sunbury and Erie Railroad went into the creek's valley.|$|E
5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned down. It was rebuilt and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, the miller did not have to pay taxes for the next 15 years. In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance from the States General after the miller requested assistance. The mill was rebuilt {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a <b>gristmill</b> and the smaller building an oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years Clark's {{mounting}} debts {{made it impossible for}} him to retain ownership of his land, since it became subject to seizure due to his debts. Clark deeded much of his land to friends or transferred ownership to family members so his creditors could not seize it. Lenders and their assignees eventually deprived the veteran of nearly all of the property that remained in his name. Clark, who was at one time the largest landholder in the Northwest Territory, was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville. In 1803 Clark built a cabin overlooking the Falls of the Ohio, where he lived until his health failed in 1809. He also operated a small <b>gristmill,</b> which he worked with two African American slaves.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, some European settlers, who were granted {{warrants}} by William Penn, explored Native American trails in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. On these paths, skirmishes occasionally occurred between settlers and Native Americans. One {{example is the}} Sugarloaf Massacre, {{when a group of}} Native Americans ambushed some soldiers on the Lehigh Path near Nescopeck Creek in 1780. The first mill was built in the Nescopeck Creek watershed in 1788. By 1791, there were four settlers along Nescopeck Creek. In 1795, Samuel Mifflin built a sawmill at the mouth of Nescopeck Creek. A <b>gristmill</b> was built on Nescopeck Creek the same year. A flood of Nescopeck Creek in 1786, known as the Pumpkin Flood, was noted for sweeping large numbers of pumpkins downstream on the creek.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, major {{industries}} in the watershed of Roaring Creek included agriculture. However, the creek was also used as water power for a small <b>gristmill.</b> During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Roaring Creek and Bear Gap. Their populations were 407 and 124, respectively. In the early 1900s, the only major industries in Franklin Township were gristmills on the creek {{on the border between}} it and Cleveland Township. There were historically proposals to use the creek as a water supply for Danville, transferring the water via pipes under the Susquehanna River. Andrew Trone once constructed a hotel on the creek.|$|E
