500|$|USA Today {{rated the}} film three-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} and Claudia Puig felt that Nolan [...] "regards his viewers as {{possibly}} smarter than they are—or at least as capable of rising to his <b>inventive</b> <b>level.</b> That's a tall order. But it's refreshing to find a director who makes us stretch, even occasionally struggle, to keep up." ...|$|E
500|$|Wario World {{received}} fairly positive reviews. The US {{version of}} Play magazine gave the game a perfect score, and the reviewer commented that Wario World [...] "pays off every second [...] holding the controller, and that, to , is greatness". Nintendo Power {{said that the}} game was [...] "tons of fun". GamePro stated that Wario World [...] "stays addictive by weight of sheer design innovation". The American-based publication Game Informer praised the game for including [...] "droves of awesome boss battles". Matt Casamassina of IGN declared that Wario World had [...] "some great control mechanics and <b>inventive</b> <b>level</b> work". Electronic Gaming Monthlys Greg Ford said, [...] "Wario [...] delivers a great time while it lasts and is well worth checking out. Just don't expect a Mario-quality adventure". Worthplaying gave the game 9 out 10, stating that [...] "Treasure has done itself proud with this title, and Wario himself can lift his head up high. At least in my book, he's got at least one game that's better than Mario's." ...|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for SiN was mixed. While PC Zone gave the game 91% and a [...] "Classic" [...] award, praising its <b>inventive</b> <b>level</b> design and engaging plot, most other publications {{did not have}} such a glowing view towards it.

50|$|Manuel Eisner is a Professor of Comparative and Developmental Criminology, {{researching the}} history of {{interpersonal}} violence. In 2014 he is the Deputy Director of the University of Cambridge Institute of Criminology.Eisner conducted an <b>inventive</b> study on <b>levels</b> of homicide throughout Europe {{over a period of}} 800 years. He found out that violence and homicide are declining in Europe. His research has highlighted the ways in which cultural models of conduct of life, embedded in social institutions, have shaped patterns of daily behaviour among adolescent and young adult men, which in turn influenced the likelihood of frictions leading to aggressive behaviour. He is also recognized for his studies on the developmental causes of crime and delinquency, and advocates the effectiveness of early prevention during childhood.|$|R
2500|$|Reception for {{the game}} was very positive. Sources such as IGN and GameZone {{declared}} it as better overall than the original, which was also very well received. Destructoid praised the game's humor, innovative gameplay, and [...] "mini-game" [...] style levels spread throughout the game were also held in high regard as a welcome change from the linear gameplay common at the time. Reviewing the Genesis version, one reviewer for Electronic Gaming Monthly disapproved of the game, remarking [...] "where the first had technique, this one just gets cheap", but the remaining three declared it a worthy sequel. They commented that it retains the same great gameplay of the original while adding excellent new weapons and levels [...] "which are even crazier than before". Reviewers for GamePro gave rave reviews for both the Genesis and Super NES versions. They noted that the basic gameplay and premise are unchanged from the first game, but highly praised the new level designs, diverse soundtrack, and improved animations for the title character, {{with one of the}} reviewers concluding that [...] "Earthworm Jim 2 manages to exceed the lofty standards of the first game." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation likewise felt that the <b>inventive</b> new <b>level</b> designs were more than enough to make the game feel fresh in spite of its using the same gameplay. He summarized that [...] "For the most part, this long-awaited sequel has answered the success of the first installment using more of the same humor, action, and skill, adding a few surprises this time around." [...] Sega Saturn Magazine (previously Sega Magazine) gave the Genesis version a 94%, citing the variety of gameplay styles with [...] "every one, in every way, sickeningly well implemented." ...|$|R

[...] Praising its unusual lack {{of weapons and}} use of 3-D graphics, it concluded that [...] "you've got to see it to believe it." [...] Antic's review of the original was more subdued, simply stating that [...] "Computer enthusiasts who enjoy quick-paced, challenging action games will like Zombie".|$|E
5000|$|Retro Gamer {{included}} it {{on their}} list of ten essential Saturn imports, described as [...] "a delightfully nutty game that takes elements of Shinobi and Alisa Dragoon and marries them to insanely over-the-top action scenes that involve gigantic frogs and fantastic scaling and rotating effects. The difficulty is a little unfair in places, but the impressive visuals, <b>inventive</b> <b>level</b> design and stunning animation certainly makes up for it." ...|$|E
50|$|MAG has {{received}} generally positive reviews. According to Metacritic, the game {{stands at a}} 76. GameTrailers gave the game praise for its large multiplayer and <b>inventive</b> <b>level</b> up system, giving the game an 8.2/10. G4 gave it 4 out of 5 stars saying {{it is a good}} addition to the PlayStation 3's library. IGN US gave the game a rating of 7.0/10, complaining about bugs, stiff animations, unbalanced factions and overall lack of content and polish for the price. IGN UK gave it 7.6/10 and complained about the same problems. GameSpot gave it a rating of 8/10, praising the well-integrated command structure, but complaining about technical awkwardness.|$|E
40|$|With the {{evolutions}} of {{the surrounding}} world market, researchers and engineers have to propose technical innovations. Nevertheless, Chemical Engineering community demonstrates a small interest for innovation compared to other engineering fields. In this paper, an approach to accelerate inventive preliminary design for Chemical Engineering is presented. This approach uses Case Based Reasoning (CBR) method to model, to capture, to store and to make available the knowledge deployed during design. CBR {{is a very interesting}} method coming from Artificial Intelligence, for routine design. Indeed, in CBR the main assumption is that a new problem of design can be solved with the help of past successful ones. Consequently, the problem solving process is based on past successful solutions therefore the design is accelerated but creativity is limited and not stimulated. Our approach is an extension of the CBR method from routine design to inventive design. One of the main drawbacks of this method is that it is restricted in one particular domain of application. To propose <b>inventive</b> solution, the <b>level</b> of abstraction for problem resolution must be increased. For this reason CBR is coupled with the TRIZ theory (Russian acronym for Theory of solving inventive problem). TRIZ is a problem solving method that increases the ability to solve creative problems thanks to its capacity to give access to the best practices in all the technical domains. The proposed synergy between CBR and TRIZ combines the main advantages of CBR (ability to store and to reuse rapidly knowledge) and those of TRIZ (no trade off during resolution, inventive solutions). Based on this synergy, a tool is developed and a mere example is treated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of time series data to isolate quality change in the Japanese economy using a hedonic procedure. We argue that the {{traditional}} approach to hedonic estimation based upon panel data sets of different brands in a given product area is extremely resource intensive and, thus, unlikely to be adopted by official statistical bodies outside of key areas, such as computers. This paper adopts a "top-down" approach to see whether more traditional measures of technical change, such as patents, {{can be used to}} separate pure inflation from quality change. If this is possible, it offers a much simpler route to estimate the role of quality change in economic growth and performance. In practice, we extend the analysis not only to include patents, but other forms of intellectual property that might reflect technology and attribute changes, such as designs, utility models and trademarks. We begin by taking a longer-term historical perspective, exploring the development of indigenous inventive capacity in Japan during the early years when R&D data are not available. It is possible to show that the rise in utility models pre-dates the main growth in patenting activity, suggesting the development in more low-level indigenous creative work prior to higher <b>level</b> <b>inventive</b> activity. The principal aim of this paper, however, is to demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} develop robust models to explain changes in the producer price index in Japan, which can then be used to re-examine Japanese growth performance over the period from about 1960. If the official Japanese statistical body has fully accounted for quality change in the price indices (i. e. produced fully quality-constant price deflators), then the official estimates of growth will be correct. However, we provide strong evidence that this is not the case. Changes in quality, proxied by the IP variables, are important determinants of prices in Japan over the period 1960 to 1995 as a whole. Indeed, we provide evidence that the true rate of growth of the Japanese economy, taking into account the rate of quality change, is significantly higher than that suggested in official statistics.

5000|$|BattleBlock Theater has {{received}} mainly positive reviews, with a Metacritic rating of 85. GamesRadar gave the game 4.5/5 stars, praising varied stages and extensive multiplayer modes. Destructoid gave the game 9/10, calling it [...] "a hallmark of excellence". Official Xbox Magazine also gave the game 9/10, praising its vast content and community features, as did Eurogamer, who called it [...] "a masterclass in pure game design." [...] IGN gave the game {{a score of}} 7.8, praising <b>inventive</b> <b>level</b> design, but criticising the platforming gameplay in comparison to other titles like Super Meat Boy and Braid. Den of Geek! (US) gave it a score of 9.4/10, saying, 'the game makes for a great team-building exercise, or a backhanded way of saying “I don’t want to be friends anymore.”' ...|$|E
5000|$|A conceptually similar {{approach}} has been applied at times in US, UK, and European patent law. In Neilson v. Harford, the Exchequer adopted a method of analyzing the patent-eligibility of inventions based on a natural principle or phenomenon of nature, in which the principle is treated as if part of the prior art and {{the remainder of the}} invention (i.e., the mechanical implementation of the principle) is evaluated for patentability under the usual tests (novelty, etc.). The US Supreme Court followed this approach in O’Reilly v. Morse and subsequent decisions including Parker v. Flook and Mayo v. Prometheus. A similar type of analysis of obviousness or <b>inventive</b> <b>level</b> has been used under the name of the [...] "point of novelty" [...] test, which is suggested by the use of a Jepson claim.|$|E

[...] TIME magazine's Richard Corliss wrote the film's [...] "noble intent is to implant one man's vision {{in the mind of}} a vast audience ...

40|$|Although many {{animal species}} show {{at least some}} {{evidence}} of cultural transmission, broadly defined, only humans show clear evidence of cumulative culture. In the current study, we investigated whether young children show the "ratchet effect," {{an important component of}} cumulative culture [...] the ability to accumulate efficient modifications across generations. We tested 16 diffusion chains [...] altogether consisting of 80 children [...] to see how they solved an instrumental task (i. e., carrying something from one location to another). We found that when the chain was seeded with an inefficient way of solving the task, 4 -year-olds were able to innovate and transmit these innovations so as to reach a more efficient solution. However, when it started out with relatively efficient solutions already (i. e., the ones that children in a control condition discovered for themselves), there were no further techniques invented and/or transmitted beyond that. Thus, young children showed the ratchet effect to a limited extent, accumulating efficient modifications but not going beyond the <b>inventive</b> <b>level</b> of the individual...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper has}} the {{objective}} of analyzing the relationship between sports and television, and identifies {{the role of the}} professional who acts in the field of Physical Education related to sport on television. The media institution produces discourses and an image related to sports and attributes a group of signifiers to this cultural element. Watching sport on television is different from watching them in a stadium or a gymnasium. This occurs because the televise production is restrict to the passes and scenes chosen previously by journalists and producers. As methodological procedures, it was made bibliographical review of qualitative type and also, thematic, textual, interpretative and critical analysis of the books written by scholars in the field of Leisure, Communication and Physical Education. The conclusions are: sport, when it is showed by television, it is transformed into entertainment. During this process, the role of the professional of Physical Education is essential to mediate knowledge. The teacher, based on the perspective of education for leisure, can help students to have access to the knowledge so they can reach superior and <b>inventive</b> <b>level</b> of comprehension. Accordingly, pedagogical mediation realized in formal education will be essential so that the subjects have access to theoretical elements for a qualified reading of the sport showed by media, thus, they can enjoy their moments of leisure with quality...|$|E
