5|$|The RAF sought more thrust {{than was}} {{available}} from the Avon 100 series; in response Rolls-Royce developed the Avon 200 series engine. This was an almost wholly new design, equipped with a new compressor {{to put an end}} to surge problems, an annular combustion chamber, and an improved <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> system. The resulting Avon 203 produced 10,000lbf (44.48kN) of thrust, and was the engine for the Hunter F.6.|$|E
25|$|Ricardo also {{assisted}} {{in the design of}} the combustion chambers and <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> system of Sir Frank Whittle's jet engine.|$|E
25|$|An uprated version, the 2300lbf (10.23kN) thrust FJ44-2A, was {{introduced}} in 1997. It has a larger 21.7 in (551mm) diameter fan, with two additional booster stages to increase core flow. Owing to stressing considerations, the centrifugal compressor is throttled-back aerodynamically to a lower HPC pressure ratio than the -1. Other features include an exhaust mixer and an electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> unit. The 2400lbf (10.68kN) thrust FJ44-2C {{is similar to the}} -2A, but incorporates an integrated hydromechanical <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> unit.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Hamilton {{developed}} {{the technology to}} accurately meter fuel in jet engines, and its <b>fuel</b> <b>controls</b> were employed on Boeing 707's and Douglas DC-8's {{as well as most}} other Pratt & Whitney jet engines. In 1952 Hamilton Standard opened its plant in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. In 1958 Hamilton's first environmental control system entered service on the Convair 880. In 1968 Hamilton began delivering automatic, electronic systems for control of cabin pressure in aircraft. Hamilton's mechanical <b>fuel</b> <b>controls,</b> in use since the 1950s, evolved into electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>controls</b> and, eventually, to Full Authority Digital Electronic Controls (FADEC) for jet engines and are in use today on many commuter, airline, and military engine applications. Hamilton's environmental systems and early association with NASA were highlighted in the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing - supported by environmental <b>control,</b> <b>fuel</b> cell, and life support systems manufactured by Hamilton Standard.|$|R

These floatless pressure carburetors are the topic of this article.|$|E
25|$|Other {{events that}} can happen with jet engines, such as a <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> fault, can result in excess fuel in the engine’s combustor. This {{additional}} fuel can result in flames extending from the engine’s exhaust pipe. As alarming as this would appear, at no time is the engine itself actually on fire.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} United States’ entry into World War I, the Food and <b>Fuel</b> <b>Control</b> Act of 1917 {{established}} the United States Food Administration, with {{a mandate to}} voluntarily reduce the domestic consumption of food and produce, while increasing home production. President Woodrow Wilson appointed future president Herbert Hoover as its head, and Hoover appointed Van Winkle to organize and direct its speakers’ bureau.|$|E

25|$|April 18, 1975: A Cessna 310F, {{registration}} number N5818X, ran {{off the end}} of the runway, struck a fence, and burned after losing engine power during takeoff. The craft's two occupants, a student pilot and flight instructor, escaped with minor injuries. The crash was attributed to fuel starvation: the student pilot had mishandled the <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> valve (known as the fuel selector) and taken off with the fuel tanks disconnected from the engines.|$|E
25|$|These {{reactors}} use {{a pressure}} vessel {{to contain the}} nuclear <b>fuel,</b> <b>control</b> rods, moderator, and coolant. They are cooled and moderated by high-pressure liquid water. The hot radioactive water that leaves the pressure vessel is looped through a steam generator, which in turn heats a secondary (non-radioactive) loop of water to steam that can run turbines. They are the majority of current reactors. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the VVER-1200, Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor and the European Pressurized Reactor. United States Naval reactors are of this type.|$|E
25|$|On 8 February 2005, {{on board}} an Airbus A340-600 {{aircraft}} (G-VATL) {{en route from}} Hong Kong to Heathrow, the <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> computer system caused a loss of automatic fuel transfer between tanks. The left outboard engine lost power, and shortly afterwards the right outboard engine also began to falter until the crew began to crossfeed fuel manually. The crew diverted to Amsterdam and landed safely. The interim accident report made four safety recommendations addressed to the primary certification bodies for large transport category aircraft (EASA and the FAA), advising {{on the need for}} a low-fuel warning system for large aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Single- and double-engine engine flameouts {{plagued the}} program between June 1965 and July 1967, when <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> {{problems}} were finally corrected. No aircraft were destroyed but one {{was out of}} service for six months after it crash-landed in a field near Albuquerque. By May 1968 stress cracks began appearing in the wing spars and ribs of all the RB-57Fs outboard of the main engines and numerous groundings forced the cancellation of many operational missions. Some aircraft were sent to General Dynamics for repairs but under Big Safari dicta the cost of repairing all of the aircraft was excessive and resulted in five being placed in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB in 1972 and another three in 1973. The remaining aircraft were retired in 1974. Each had accumulated on average a total of 3,000 hours of airframe life. The 58th WRS, the last squadron in the Air Force to use the WB-57F, was inactivated on 1 July 1974.|$|E

50|$|Speed control via a {{governor}} is {{another type of}} servomechanism. The steam engine uses mechanical governors; another early application was to govern the speed of water wheels. Prior to World War II the constant speed propeller was developed to control engine speed for maneuvering aircraft. <b>Fuel</b> <b>controls</b> for gas turbine engines employ either hydromechanical or electronic governing.|$|R
2500|$|Military carburetors {{may have}} [...] an anti-detonation {{injection}} (ADI) system. [...] This {{consists of a}} [...] "derichment valve" [...] located in the <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> portion, a storage tank for the ADI fluid, a pump, a regulator that provides a specific amount of ADI fluid based on the fuel flow, and a spray nozzle that is mounted in the air stream entering the supercharger.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} of a combat or {{emergency}} situation, the mixture control may be moved to the auto rich position, providing extra fuel to the engine, or in military aircraft, into military position, if the aircraft is so equipped. [...] When in the military position, the Anti-Detonation Injection (ADI) system is activated, injecting the ADI fluid into the engine intake system. [...] The pressure in the ADI system moves the derichment diaphragm in the <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> to close off the derichment jet, reducing the fuel flow to a leaner mixture which produces higher engine power by raising the mean effective pressure. This causes the cylinder head temperature to increase to a very high level, which dramatically increases the risk of detonation (see: engine knocking). Adding the ADI fluid raises the mean octane level of the charge preventing pre-ignition and also lowers the cylinder temperatures to a more acceptable level. As this operation takes the engine well beyond its normal design limits, this power setting is not suitable for prolonged use. Once the ADI fluid is exhausted or if the mixture control valve is moved out of the military position, the <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> derichment diaphragm pressure is lost, and the derichment jet is opened once again for normal fuel flow.|$|E
2500|$|On July 7, 2005, BC Ferries {{concluded}} that a missing cotter pin was to blame. The pin normally retained a nut on a linkage between an engine speed governor and the <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> {{for one of the}} engines. Without the pin, the nut fell off and the linkage separated, causing the engine, [...] clutches, and propellers to increase in speed until overspeed safety devices tripped and shut down the entire propulsion system. The faulty speed governor had been serviced 17 days before the incident during a $35-million upgrade, and the cotter pin had not been properly replaced at that time.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of {{study was to}} design, develop, and evaluate techniques to measure exhaust emissions from non-road equipment representative of major off-road diesel emissions contributors. Emissions data was collected from an excavator powered by a 1987 Komatsu 266 hp engine with mechanical <b>fueling</b> <b>control,</b> and a track-type tractor powered by a 2001 Caterpillar 850 hp engine with electronic <b>fueling</b> <b>control.</b> For the excavator, data was logged during in-field operation, and then representative in-field cycles were created on an engine test bed using this data. The Komatsu excavator engine was exercised over these new cycles in the WVU Engine and Emissions Research Laboratory, and brake-specific emissions of CO, NOx, total HC, total PM, and CO 2 were determined. For the tractor, on-board emissions measurement equipment, namely the Mobile Emissions Measurement System (MEMS) and the Realtime Particulate Mass Monitor, RPM 100 were employed to collect in-use mass emissions rates of CO 2, NOx, and PM. Brake-specific emissions data collected while operating the excavator engine o...|$|R
2500|$|A floatless {{pressure}} carburetor {{is a type}} {{of aircraft}} <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> that provides very accurate fuel delivery, prevents ice from forming in the carburetor and prevents fuel starvation during negative [...] "G" [...] and inverted flight by eliminating the customary float-controlled fuel inlet valve. [...] Unlike the float-type carburetor fuel system that relies on venturi suction to draw fuel into the engine, a pressure carburetor only uses the venturi to measure the mass airflow into the engine and manages the flow of fuel that is continuously under pressure from the fuel pump to the spray nozzle. In 1936, the first Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburetor (a model PD12-B) was installed and flown on an Allison V-1710-7.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} years of World War II, {{aircraft}} engines that exceeded a specific horsepower of greater than 1.0, were equipped first with distributed fuel injection and later with direct injection, which became the fuel system of choice. Using the same principles as the pressure carburetor to measure air flow into the engine, the distributed fuel injection system used individual fuel lines to each cylinder, injecting the fuel at the intake port. [...] The direct-injection systems differed only in that it injected the fuel directly into the cylinder head, much like a diesel engine fuel system. These <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> devices were individually sized and calibrated to fit almost all piston aircraft engines used by both civil and allied military aircraft made in the post war era. These fuel injection systems are found on high performance general aviation piston engines that continue flying into the 21st century.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1952 show season, <b>fuel</b> <b>control</b> {{problems}} grounded the team's Grumman F9F Panthers leaving the Cutlasses to put on the primary demonstration between March and June. During a show at Saufley Field in Florida, Feightner experienced a total loss of hydraulics on a full afterburner takeoff and steep climb. While trying to gain enough altitude for ejection he was able to stay with the aircraft until the back up control system engaged. He clipped trees {{on the end of the}} runway, causing the left engine to flame out. With hydraulic fluid streaming back in a bright flame, he made a hard turn and got the plane back on the runway, much to the excitement of the crowd. Feightner and Macknight performed maneuvers that showed off the best attributes of the F7U. The two solos would approach each other from opposite ends of the runway and, after passing each other, would roll the aircraft, deploy speed brakes, and light afterburners.
