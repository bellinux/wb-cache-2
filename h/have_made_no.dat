5|$|Tiberius {{seems to}} have tired of {{politics}} at this point. In AD22, he shared his tribunician authority with his son Drusus, and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year. In AD23, Drusus mysteriously died, and Tiberius seems to <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> effort to elevate a replacement. Finally, in AD26, Tiberius retired from Rome altogether to the island of Capri.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{however, the}} son, Clarence, {{repeated}} {{the story and}} published a book in the United States, My Uncle George V, in which he claimed {{he was born in}} London in September 1890, about nine months after Albert Victor's meeting with Mrs. Haddon. In 1933, he was charged with demanding money with menace and attempted extortion after writing to the King asking for hush money. At his trial the following January, the prosecution produced documents showing that Haddon's enlistment papers, marriage certificate, officer's commission, demobilisation papers and employment records all showed he was born in or before 1887, at least two years before Albert Victor met Mrs. Haddon. Haddon was found guilty and the judge, believing Haddon to be suffering from delusions, did not jail him but bound him over for three years on the condition that he made no claim that he was Albert Victor's son. Haddon breached the conditions and was jailed for a year. Dismissed as a crank, he died a broken man. Even if Haddon's claim had been true, as with other royal illegitimacies, it would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> difference to the royal line of succession.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jordan has won {{the most}} scoring titles, with ten. Jordan and Chamberlain are the only players to have won seven {{consecutive}} scoring titles (this was also Chamberlain's career total). George Gervin, Allen Iverson and Durant have won four scoring titles in their career, and George Mikan, Neil Johnston and Bob McAdoo have achieved it three times. Paul Arizin, Bob Pettit, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant, and Russell Westbrook have each won the scoring title twice. Since the 1946–47 season, five players have won both the scoring title and the NBA championship in the same season: Fulks in 1947 with the Philadelphia Warriors, Mikan from 1949 to 1950 with the Minneapolis Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar (then Alcindor) in 1971 with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jordan from 1991 to 1993 and from 1996 to 1998 with the Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal in 2000 with the Los Angeles Lakers.

The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Edwards {{began his}} own firm in Raleigh (now named Kirby & Holt) with a friend, David Kirby. He {{became known as}} the top plaintiffs' {{attorney}} in North Carolina. The biggest case of his legal career was a 1996 product liability lawsuit against Sta-Rite, the manufacturer of a defective pool drain cover. The case involved Valerie Lakey, a three-year-old girl who was disemboweled by the suction power of the pool drain pump when she sat on an open pool drain whose protective cover had been removed by other children at the pool, after the swim club had failed to install the cover properly. Despite 12 prior suits with similar claims, Sta-Rite continued to make and sell drain covers lacking warnings. Sta-Rite protested that an additional warning would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> difference because the pool owners already knew the importance of keeping the cover secured.|$|E

500|$|In {{part due}} to its dual printing, [...] "The Raven" [...] made Edgar Allan Poe a {{household}} name almost immediately, and turned Poe into a national celebrity.

Though it made Poe popular in his day, it did not bring him significant financial success. As he later lamented, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> money.

500|$|Because of this uncertainty, a co-regency is {{currently}} impossible to prove or disprove. [...] Both Redford's and Murnane's {{works on the}} subject are undecided {{on the grounds that}} there is too little conclusive evidence either for or against a coregency. Even if there was one, it would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> difference to the chronology of the period because in this kind of institution Amenhotep would have begun counting his regnal dates from his first year as sole ruler. However, co-regency supporters note that since at least one rebellion had been led against Ahmose during his reign, it would certainly have been logical to crown a successor before one's death to prevent a struggle for the crown.|$|E
500|$|A German {{victory would}} be of greater {{magnitude}} against the Western Allies than it would against the Soviet Union. According to General Alfred Jodl, [...] "The Russians had so many troops that {{even if we had}} succeeded in destroying thirty divisions it would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> difference. On the other hand, if we destroyed thirty divisions in the West, it would amount to {{more than a third of}} the whole invasion Army." [...] Hitler believed that inaction in the West would only conclude in an inevitable German defeat. His basic plan involved an early morning breakthrough along the lightly defended sector of the Ardennes Forest, with the eventual task of crossing the Meuse River and capturing Antwerp in order to deny the Western Allies a crucial port.|$|E
500|$|Gebhard's {{conversion}} and marriage were exceptionally costly, {{in terms of}} lives and property, and historians <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> actual estimate of its actual cost, although 19th century historians tend to criticize him for acting rashly. Perhaps its greater cost, however, lay in the impact his actions had on Protestantism and Catholicism in the northern territories of the German states. Although fighting continued until 1589, by early 1588, Ernst controlled most of the Electorate. Gebhard's defeat was a serious blow to Protestantism in northern Germany, and marks a critical stage {{in the history of}} the Reformation. [...] Bavarian Jesuits went to the Electoral territories to bring the population back to Catholicism, a process rife with violence and coercion. Gebhard also opened the doors for Spanish incursions into the Rhineland; blocked from water access to the rebellious Dutch, Spanish military commanders sought a land route to the Dutch Provinces and by providing troop support for Ernst, they established valuable bridgeheads in the Rhine valley. Finally, the Cologne War marks the beginning of the [...] "internationalization" [...] of the German religious question, which was not resolved until 1650, after the disasters of the Thirty Years Wars.|$|E

500|$|During {{her time}} at the English court, Lehzen {{attracted}} attention outside of the royal household for her close relationship with Victoria. She was criticised for her influence with the queen, particularly from those who disliked German influences at court. Pamphlets, many released by the Tory party, complained of the [...] "stranger harboured in our country" [...] and the [...] "evil counsellors" [...] surrounding Victoria. One in particular, published as the Warning Letter to Baroness Lehzen, declared that a [...] "certain foreign lady pulled the wires of a diabolical conspiracy of which Lady Flora {{was to be the}} first victim," [...] a reference to the Flora Hastings affair. More positive, The Times once described her as having simply [...] "held a highly and strictly confidential situation about the person of the Sovereign." [...] As a sign of the perceived political influence she possessed, in 1838 false rumours suggested that Lehzen had been [...] "converted" [...] to the Whig party, and that she had been offered [...] "an urgent proposal of marriage" [...] by Whig prime minister Viscount Melbourne. Despite all of this criticism, historian Gillian Gill describes how Lehzen was honest and frugal; even after Victoria ascended the throne, she seems to <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> demands for money or rank, preferring instead to simply be in the queen's company. Historian K.D. Reynolds adds that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character and moral development, in particular giving the queen the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and young queenship. Not all of her influence was positive however; Reynolds also speculates that the 1839 Bedchamber crisis stemmed partly from Victoria's unwillingness to lose Lehzen.|$|E
