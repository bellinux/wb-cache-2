25|$|The {{theory of}} an anti-tumoral {{response}} {{of the immune system}} in vivo was recognized by the physician William B. Coley. In 1968, Dr. Gale A Granger from the University of California, Irvine, reported a cytotoxic factor produced by lymphocytes and named it lymphotoxin (LT). Credit for this discovery is shared by <b>Dr.</b> <b>Nancy</b> H. Ruddle from Yale University, who reported the same activity in a series of back-to-back articles published in the same month. Subsequently, in 1975 Dr. Lloyd J. Old from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, reported another cytotoxic factor produced by macrophages and named it tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Both factors were described based on their ability to kill mouse fibrosarcoma L-929 cells. These concepts were extended to systemic disease in 1981, when Ian A. Clark, from the Australian National University, in collaboration with Elizabeth Carswell in Dr. Old's group, working with pre-sequencing era data, reasoned that excessive production of TNF causes malaria disease and endotoxin poisoning.|$|E

500|$|At the 2002 {{conference for}} Canadian Society of Women in Philosophy, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Nancy</b> Tuana {{asserted}} that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction; she states {{that it has been}} ignored because of [...] "a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear." [...] She reasoned that this fear causes ignorance, which veils female sexuality. O'Connell states, [...] "It boils down to rivalry between the sexes: the idea that one sex is sexual and the other reproductive. The truth is that both are sexual and both are reproductive." [...] She reiterates that the vestibular bulbs appear {{to be part of the}} clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the location of female sexual function and orgasm.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{qualitative study}} analyzed {{family life and}} work life satisfaction perceptions of employed mothers with young children. The {{purpose of the study}} was to examine family life satisfaction, work life satisfaction, and the relationship between the two from the employed mother's point of view. Qualitative data were drawn from 195 responses on voluntary, self- administered questionnaires distributed at various selected child care and after-school sites within the North Texas area. The following questions g uided the qualitative research process: (a) How satisfied are employed mothers with their family life? (b) How satisfied are employed mothers with their work life? and (c) How do family life and work life interact? Numerous emerging themes a nd patterns were found to influence family/work life perceptions of employed mothers. Family life satisfaction themes included the influence of relationships, burden of respons ibilities, t ime concerns, and necessary income for lifestyl e maintenance. Work life satisfaction issues focused on the effect of work environment, desire for reduced work load, and impact of personal satisfaction. Family/work interaction themes centered around balancing work and family, spillover effect of family/work, effect on children, and other influences.

5000|$|The Boston process {{approach}} is {{an approach to}} neuropsychological assessment, which was developed at the Boston Veterans Medical Center by the American psychologist, Dr. Edith Kaplan, along with her colleagues, Drs. Harold Goodglass, Nelson Butters, Laird Cermak, and Norman Geschwind. [...] It focuses on qualitative measurements of behavior and arises from the premise that “equal performance on any given mental task {{can be accomplished by}} different processes or strategies”. That is, because different sorts of errors by different patients may attain the same total score on a test, it is important to look at underlying processes {{in order to understand the}} particular difficulties of the individual. The goal of the {{approach is}} to create an understanding of the cognitive strengths and weaknesses of a patient. It is a flexible-battery approach to neuropsychological testing, meaning the set of standardized tests given to the patient is chosen according to the patient's specific deficits.In 1976, Dr. Kaplan began training neuropsychology interns to allow them to apply what she referred to at the time as the Boston approach to neuropsychological assessment of their patients. The first fairly formalized and comprehensive description of Dr. Kaplan’s methods was published in the original 1986 version of her book chapter with <b>Drs.</b> <b>Nancy</b> Hebben and William Milberg, and it was here that the term “Boston process approach” was first used. There are no overall descriptions of the approach and no instances of that term used before that chapter. The Boston process approach is currently used as a method of neuropsychological assessment, with experience in its use being considered by some to be essential or very important for applicants to internships in clinical neuropsychology.|$|R
