5|$|Hao Fengjun, another <b>defector</b> to Australia, {{had worked}} for the 610 Office of Tianjin city and claims that his job {{involved}} the collection and analysis of intelligence reports on Falun Gong from Europe, Australia, and North America. The implication was that local 610 offices are involved in the espionage efforts abroad. Another <b>defector</b> from China's Ministry of State Security—which conducts both domestic and international intelligence—claimed that the repression and monitoring of underground Christians and Falun Gong practitioners is a major focus of the ministry.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} the {{adaptation}} of North Korean elite <b>defectors</b> who fled from North Korea. Data used {{for the purpose of}} this article came from surveys of North Korean <b>defectors</b> conducted in the late 2000 ’s. Findings of the realized research indicate that the majority of senior <b>defectors</b> are experiencing less psychological and material issues when adjusting to society than regular North Korean <b>defectors.</b> The paper will proceed in three steps: explaining the notion of <b>defectors,</b> outlining their background, and focusing on their adaptation in South. Although <b>defectors</b> as a whole has emerged as of the most research group as a minority in South Korea, the so-called senior <b>defectors</b> have hardly been spotlighted. Basically North Korean senior <b>defectors</b> are supposed to strengthen the anti-Kim movement and legitimize the power of the South Korean government and the image of South Korea abroad. What has to be enlightened upon is the fact that North Korean senior <b>defectors</b> partially disagree with the integration policy of South Korean authorities. A major research question emerges: How are the experience of elite <b>defectors</b> localized in South Korea? How do their specific identities impact their opinion within the South Korean society? The aim of the article is also to categorize senior <b>defectors</b> and to provide in a single document a list of senior North Korea <b>defectors</b> based abroad. This kind of information is only available for Korean speaking readers. I wanted to make it accessible to the Englishspeaking community...|$|R

5|$|Chinese {{authorities}} reportedly maintain {{lists of}} high-profile overseas Falun Gong practitioners, {{and they use}} these blacklists to impose travel and visa restrictions on practitioners. Chen Yonglin, the <b>defector</b> from the Chinese consulate in Sydney, said in 2005 that approximately 800 Australian Falun Gong practitioners had been blacklisted (Chen claimed he sought to remove most of these names).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to domestic surveillance, the 610 Office is allegedly involved in foreign intelligence.

50|$|China {{refuses to}} grant refugee status to North Korean <b>defectors</b> and {{considers}} them illegal economic migrants. The Chinese authorities arrest and deport hundreds of <b>defectors</b> to North Korea, sometimes in mass immigration sweeps. Chinese citizens caught aiding <b>defectors</b> face fines and imprisonment. In {{the early to}} mid-1990s, the Chinese government was relatively tolerant {{with the issue of}} North Korean <b>defectors.</b> Unless the North Korean government sent special requests, the Chinese government did not display serious control of the residence of North Koreans in Chinese territory. However, along with intensified North Korean famine in the late 90s, the number of <b>defectors</b> sharply increased, which raised international attention. As a result, China stepped up the inspection of North Korean <b>defectors</b> and began their deportations.|$|R
40|$|Cooperation among {{unrelated}} {{individuals is}} an enduring evolutionary riddle {{and a number}} of possible solutions have been suggested. Most of these suggestions attempt to refine cooperative strategies, while little attention is given to the fact that novel defection strategies can also evolve in the population. Especially in the presence of punishment to the <b>defectors</b> and public knowledge of strategies employed by the players, a defecting strategy that avoids getting punished by selectively cooperating only with the punishers can get a selective benefit over non-conditional <b>defectors.</b> Furthermore, if punishment ensures cooperation from such discriminating <b>defectors,</b> <b>defectors</b> who punish other <b>defectors</b> can evolve as well. We show that such discriminating and punishing <b>defectors</b> can evolve in the population by natural selection in a Prisoner’s Dilemma game scenario, even if discrimination is a costly act. These refined defection strategies destabilize unconditional <b>defectors.</b> They themselves are, however, unstable in the population. Discriminating <b>defectors</b> give selective benefit to the punishers in the presence of non-punishers by cooperating with them and defecting with others. However, since these players also defect with other discriminators they suffer fitness loss in the pure population. Among the punishers, punishing cooperators always benefit in contrast to the punishing <b>defectors,</b> as the latter not only defect with other punishing <b>defectors</b> but also punish them and get punished. As a consequence of both these scenarios, punishing cooperators get stabilized in the population. We thus show ironically that refined defection strategies stabilize cooperation. Furthermore, cooperation stabilized by such <b>defectors</b> can work under a wide range of initial conditions and is robust to mistakes...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{a recent}} survey, about 56% of the North Korean <b>defectors</b> are {{influenced}} {{by one or more}} types of psychological disorders. [...] 93% of surveyed North Korean <b>defectors</b> identify food and water shortages and no access to medical care and, thus, constant illness as the most common types of their traumatic experiences preceding PTSD. Such traumatic experiences greatly influence the ways North Korean <b>defectors</b> adjust in new places. PTSD often prevents <b>defectors</b> from adequately assimilating into a new culture as well as from being able to hold jobs and accumulate material resources.|$|R
5|$|Russian {{secret service}} <b>defector</b> Alexander Litvinenko accused the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of having {{organised}} the Armenian parliament shooting, ostensibly {{to derail the}} peace process, which would have resolved the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but he offered {{no evidence to support}} the accusation.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of stigma, {{identity}} and consumption among North Korean <b>defectors</b> living an urban life in Seoul, South Korea. I wanted to explore the challenges North Korean <b>defectors</b> face being integrated into South Korean society. Drawing on ethnographic research, seven North Korean <b>defectors,</b> arriving South Korea via China and Mongolia participated in this field study. How do North Korean <b>defectors</b> overcome the obstacles of resettling in a new country, {{and at the same}} time deal with identity, establish networks and overcome possible stigmas? I wanted to research identity and the social self, trying to capture this by looking at consumption and possible stigmas in the society. A central question is whether the new modern society, where the individual has fewer permanent attachments and more choices than ever before, leads to a greater understanding and depth of knowledge for the individual, or whether it leads to confusion and rootlessness. The demographics of <b>defectors</b> have changed from being the powerful elite that defected before the 1990 s, to people from all walks of life - often those who are far less privileged. The historical shifts in both South Korea and North Korea provide the background. Songbun, North Koreas stratified class system, gives an possible understanding of why <b>defectors</b> flee the North and how songbun can affect the adaption process for <b>defectors</b> arrived in the South. The main findings of this thesis are that North Korean <b>defectors</b> do their best to hide their identities as North Koreans in a highly competitive and stigmatized South Korean society. Thus, North Korean values and way of life cannot be expressed and <b>defectors</b> cannot take pride of their North Korean identities. Modernity and consumption become tools <b>defectors</b> actively use to portray themselves as South Koreans, and by taking up South Korean way of speech, dress and consumption patterns, North Korean <b>defectors</b> try to shed their North Koreanness"...|$|R

5000|$|The organization's {{domestic}} and sexual violence counseling for North Korean <b>defectors</b> is for <b>defectors</b> {{who have suffered}} through abusive family situations.

Through these counseling sessions Saejowi provides these <b>defectors</b> with {{the information they need}} to both recognize and avoid abusive situations.|$|R
5|$|Having {{detected}} the U.S. aircraft which deployed Snake flying over Soviet soil, the Soviet Union declares the United States {{responsible for the}} nuclear attack, tipping both nations {{to the edge of}} a nuclear war. In a secret conference between U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, a deal is hatched to prove the U.S.'s innocence and restore peace.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{coevolution}} of networks and action choices in a Prisoners' Dilemma. Agents in our model learn about both action choices and choices of interaction partners (links) by imitating successful behavior of others.

5|$|However, {{much of the}} {{currently}} information regarding the smoking habits of North Koreans is obtained by studying North Korean <b>defectors</b> who now live in the South {{and may not be}} totally representative of the true picture.

5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a <b>defector</b> to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{have been}} made to the alleged 2004 {{poisoning}} of Viktor Yushchenko, the alleged 2003 poisoning of Yuri Shchekochikhin and the fatal 1978 poisoning of the journalist Georgi Markov by the Bulgarian Committee for State Security. The incident with Litvinenko has also attracted comparisons to the poisoning by radioactive (unconfirmed) thallium of KGB <b>defector</b> Nikolay Khokhlov and journalist Shchekochikhin of Novaya Gazeta (the Novaya Gazeta interview with the former, coincidentally, prepared by Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was later found shot to death in her apartment building). Like Litvinenko, Shchekochikhin had investigated the Russian apartment bombings (he {{was a member of the}} Kovalev Commission that hired Litvinenko's friend Mikhail Trepashkin as a legal counsel).|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about {{recruiting}} processes for local 610 Offices. In rare instances where such information is available, 610 officers appeared to have been drawn from other party or state agencies (such as the Political and Legislative Committee staff or Public Security Bureaus). Hao Fengjun, a <b>defector</b> and former officer with the 610 Office in Tianjin City, was one such officer. Hao had previously worked for the Public Security Bureau in Tianjin, and was among the officers selected to be seconded to the newly created 610 Office. According to Hao, few officers volunteered for a position in the 610 Office, so selections were made through a random draw. Some 610 Offices conduct their own recruiting efforts to bring in staff with university degrees.|$|E

50|$|People for Successful Corean Reunification (PSCORE) is a {{non-governmental}} {{organization based in}} Seoul, South Korea, and Washington D.C. in the United States.

50|$|Saejowi's four {{medical centers}} were {{established}} to provide medical counseling to supplement and explain professional diagnoses and treatments. The organization's counselors are North Korean <b>defectors,</b> {{so they are}} able to describe medical recommendations using the North Korean dialect. The medical counseling offered by Saejowi specifically addresses the following situations: North Korean <b>defectors</b> who arrive in South Korea with untreated physical illness and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), North Korean <b>defectors</b> who are unable to obtain necessary medical treatment because of misunderstandings caused by differences between medical procedures in North and South Korea, and North Korean <b>defectors</b> who experience difficulties understanding medical terms and phrases derived from English and other Western languages.|$|R
5|$|Responding to {{international}} pressures, in 1991 the Soviet government allowed a joint U.S.-British inspection team to tour {{four of its}} main weapons facilities at Biopreparat. The inspectors were met with evasion and denials from the Soviet scientists, and were eventually ordered out of the facility. In 1992 Soviet <b>defector</b> Ken Alibek alleged that the Soviet bioweapons program at Zagorsk had produced a large stockpile—as much as twenty tons—of weaponized smallpox (possibly engineered to resist vaccines, Alibek further alleged), along with refrigerated warheads to deliver it. Alibek's stories about the former Soviet program's smallpox activities have never been independently verified.|$|E

The Adventurers are initially involved in both conflicts within the nations provoked by the Garlean pretense, led by the Garlean Legatus Gaius Van Baelsar, and the Beastmen's attempts to summon their Primals and their consequent hoarding of crystal supplies. Eventually, a greater threat is {{brought to the attention of}} the nations by the Sharlayan scholar Louisoix Leveilleur: another Garlean Legatus named Nael Van Darnus is using arcane magic and technology to summon Dalamud, the planet's second moon, down on Eorzea to purge the Beastmen and Primals. With the aid of Garlean <b>defector</b> Cid nan Garlond, the Adventurers discover that Nael has set up a beacon for summoning Dalamud in the new fortress of Castrum Novum. While each nation makes individual attempts to storm the fortress, they are repelled. Faced with this, their leaders form a pact and unite the nations under the banner of the Eorzean Alliance.|$|E

These classes teach participants how to assist patients as they obtain medical referrals, schedule necessary appointments, receive discharge information, and communicate with medical staff. Counselors also provide <b>defectors</b> with social support by visiting them in the hospital, listening to their concerns, and sharing information regarding life in South Korea.
