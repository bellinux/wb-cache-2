25|$|A major <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> {{of sexual}} {{coercion}} is physical injury. Male seed beetles (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) have sclerotized spine on their genitalia, which penetrate the female and leave melanized scars. Females can be physically injured from just one mating, {{and the more}} a female mates, the more scarring forms in the copulatory duct. In guppies, the male’s gonopodium can cause damage when forcefully inserted, causing cloacal damage to the females. In fowl, females can be physically injured during forceful copulations. Also, semen transferred from the males can contain pathogens and fecal matter, {{which can lead to}} disease and decrease female fitness. In elephant seals, physical injury happens very often. In fact, mating leads to 1 in every 1,000 female elephant seals getting killed. Other species in which the females (and/or their offspring) are injured or even killed include lions, rodents, farm cats, crabeater seals, elephant seals, sea lions, wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis), and newts (N. viridescens).|$|E

A financial syndicate subscribed for 57% of the $16,000,000 loan, of which $5,720,000 came from New York City, $6,858,000 from Philadelphia, and $75,000 from Boston.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> of raising external equity capital for US real estate investment trust (REIT) initial public offerings (IPOs). Design/methodology/approach – The study provides recent evidence on total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> for a comprehensive dataset of 125 US REIT IPOs from 1996 until June 2010. A multivariate OLS regression is performed to determine significant factors influencing the level of total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> and also underwriting fees and non-underwriting direct expenses. Findings – The study finds economies of scale in total <b>direct</b> <b>costs,</b> underwriting fees and non-underwriting expenses. The equally (value) weighted average total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> are 8. 33 percent (7. 52 percent), consisting of 6. 49 percent (6. 30 percent) underwriting fees and 1. 87 percent (1. 22 percent) non-underwriting direct expenses. The study finds a declining trend of total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> for post 2000 IPOs which is attributed to the declining trend in both underwriting fees and non-underwriting direct expenses. Offer size is a critical determinant for both total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> and their individual components and inversely affects these <b>costs.</b> The total <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> are found significantly higher for equity REITs than for mortgage REITs and are also significantly higher for offers listed in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Underwriting fees appear to be negatively influenced by the offer price, the number of representative underwriters involved in the issue, industry return volatility and the number of potential specific risk factors but positively influenced by prior quarter industry dividend yield and ownership limit identified in the prospectus. After controlling for time trend, the paper finds REIT IPOs incur higher non-underwriting direct expenses in response to higher industry return volatility prior to the offer. Originality/value – This paper adds to the international REIT IPO literature by exploring a number of new influencing factors behind total <b>direct</b> <b>costs,</b> underwriting fees and non-underwriting direct expenses.

25|$|To give {{an idea of}} {{the scale}} of the problem, {{assuming}} a solar panel mass of 20kg per kilowatt (without considering the mass of the supporting structure, antenna, or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors) a 4 GW power station would weigh about 80,000 metric tons, all of which would, in current circumstances, be launched from the Earth. Very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1kg/kW, meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 GW capacity station. This would be the equivalent of between 40 and 150 heavy-lift launch vehicle (HLLV) launches to send the material to low earth orbit, where it would likely be converted into subassembly solar arrays, which then could use high-efficiency ion-engine style rockets to (slowly) reach GEO (Geostationary orbit). With an estimated serial launch cost for shuttle-based HLLVs of $500 million to $800 million, and launch costs for alternative HLLVs at $78 million, total launch costs would range between $11 billion (low cost HLLV, low weight panels) and $320 billion ('expensive' HLLV, heavier panels). To these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch emissions, if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production. For comparison, the <b>direct</b> <b>cost</b> of a new coal or nuclear power plant ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion per GW (not including the full cost to the environment from CO2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel, respectively); another example is the Apollo missions to the Moon cost a grand total of $24 billion (1970s' dollars), taking inflation into account, would cost $140 billion today, more expensive than the construction of the International Space Station.|$|E

The objectives of the study are to identify quantitative variables influencing <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> of structural building elements and develop cost prediction models for small and medium rise buildings. A total of 216 low and medium rise building projects were used for analyses. Data were obtained from cost records and published data.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the immediate {{economic impact of}} maternal death on rural Chinese households. Methods: Results are reported from a study that matched 195 households who had suffered a maternal death to 384 households that experienced a childbirth without maternal death in rural areas of three provinces in China, using quantitative questionnaire to compare differences of <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>costs</b> between two groups. Findings: The <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> of a maternal death {{were significantly higher than}} the costs of a childbirth without a maternal death (US$ 4, 119 vs. $ 370, p, 0. 001). More than 40 % of the <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> were attributed to funeral expenses. Hospitalization and emergency care expenses were the largest proportion of non-funeral <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> and were higher in households with maternal death than the comparison group (US$ 2, 248 vs. $ 305, p, 0. 001).

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is a prevalent condition {{associated with}} pain, joint destruction and morbidity. <b>Direct</b> healthcare <b>costs</b> are 2 to 3 {{times higher than}} average costs for individuals of similar age and gender. Furthermore, utilisation and costs rise with age and disease duration. Managed care has become an increasingly popular way to organise and finance the delivery of healthcare. Studies comparing {{the quality of care}} in health maintenance organisations and fee-for-service settings have found few differences in outcomes, although reduced costs have been attributed to lower hospitalisation rates in patients with RA. We reviewed 10 studies of the <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> of RA. In 1996 dollars, <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> ranged from $US 2299 per person per year in Canada to $US 13 549 in a US study focusing on patients who have been hospitalised only. Surprisingly, the contributions to <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> - hospital care, medications and physician visits - remained relatively stable over time and the setting of care. Hospitalisation costs were the highest component of <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> accounting, generally, for 60 % or more of costs while only approximately 10 % of patients with RA were hospitalised. The only exception was a managed care setting where hospitalisation costs were 16 % of total <b>direct</b> <b>costs.</b> In managed care settings, costs of medications were proportionately higher than in fee-for-service settings. We conclude that in studies of the <b>direct</b> <b>costs</b> of RA the components of costs have remained relatively stable over time. This may change with the development and growing use of new RA medications including cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors, interleukins, cytokines, treatments that inhibit tumour necrosis factor, and combination therapies.
