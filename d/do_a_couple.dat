500|$|In North America, the Series (particularly {{the first}} few games) exposed the need for better {{preparation}} and off-season training. Philadelphia Flyers coach Fred Shero became an avid student of the Soviet style {{and was one of}} the first to bring the Soviet training techniques to the NHL as the Flyers won two Stanley Cup championships in 1974 and 1975. Tom Mellor (who joined the small but rapidly growing group of American-born NHL players after the 1972 Olympics) lamented that the NHL training methods of the early 1970s were vastly inferior to those of the Soviets. [...] "When I went to play for Detroit after the Olympics, Alex Delvecchio was the coach.... When he would coach, we would <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of one-on-ones, two-on-twos, three-on-twos, we'd scrimmage, and he would scrimmage with us. At the end of the scrimmage, we'd <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of figure eights and then go to the bar. That was the NHL and pro mentality." [...] Mark Howe commented that the Soviet national team must have trained six hours on the day of a game in the 1972 Winter Olympics. On the other hand, Swedish sports journalists were extremely impressed by the toughness and [...] "never say die" [...] fighting spirit of the Canadians, who lost only one game out of seven on European ice despite usually trailing in the third period. According to Soviet player Boris Mikhailov, who later became a coach, [...] "it was a meeting between two schools of hockey and we have since continued this great exchange and we have learned from each other, taking the best of both styles." ...|$|E

I'd like to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of new tracks for those releases with Tony Martin... I'll also be looking at working on Cross Purposes and Forbidden."

Our fans have waited long enough, I think, so we wanna get something in their hands that they can listen to and hold, and put in their ears." [...] Holland added that the album will [...] "for sure" [...] be released in 2018. In an October 2017 interview, however, Holland said, [...] "I think I want to do like an EP. It's kind of what people are doing these days and it makes for less time in between stuff. It has been five years for us {{so we have a}} few songs together and I'm hoping to get something out by early next year." [...] In the same month, bassist Greg K. mentioned a possible 2018 release date for the new Offspring album, and revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for the album's slow progress is because they have been working on songs here and there. He also stated that the band is no hurry to finish the album.|$|E

2500|$|On his {{recovery}} from illness Gartside returned to London {{and went straight}} into the studio with the group to begin recording the album {{at the end of}} 1980. It was recorded at Berry Street Studio in London, with the exception of [...] "Faithless" [...] which was recorded at Island Studios (now renamed Sarm Studios). The band were able to take their time with the recording and to employ guest musicians including Mike McEvoy and Joe Cang because their label Rough Trade paid each member a salary of £50 per week, as well as giving them a generous advance to record the album. Gartside explained that the album had taken several months to make because [...] "a lot of the ideas for this album, particularly lyrically, weren't finalised by the time we went into the studio, so we decided to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days at a time. Also, we were working with Adam Kidron, who was at the time committed to Delta Five [...] and Pere Ubu and Orange Juice, so it took that much longer to complete. Plus the fact that there's quite a few other musicians playing on it, many of whom could only work two hour schedules." ...|$|E

[...] However, shortly afterwards, Rose told MTV News [...] "You'll see , but I don't know if 'soon' is the word". Dizzy Reed mentioned in November 2002 that the album [...] "should be in stores by June (2003)" [...] and stating there were only [...] "a few odds and ends left to <b>do,</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of finishing touches, a couple of vocals – {{and we need to}} mix it." [...] Rose also confirmed the plans for multiple albums and stated that a part of the delay was due to lack of support from the label to older bands, saying, [...] "I've had to do way more jobs in it than I'm supposed to. I've had to be manager, A man, producer, sole lyric writer, {{and a lot of other}} things." [...] An editor from antiMUSIC claimed Rose told him in an informal chat in June 2003 that [...] "he wants to make sure it is a perfect as possible before it is released". In mid-2003, the band reportedly started the process of re-recording the album again. Shortly after Buckethead left the band in March 2004, Rose {{released a}} statement saying, [...] "Guns will be moving forward, we hope to announce a release date within the next few months."

I could make a colored sketch, but that was all, now I am on the highway to becoming an artist. Goudé will only receive pupils whom he considers likely to do him credit, and on seeing two of the things I had done after I had been working with Terrier, he accepted me at once. He is a splendid master--out and away the best in Paris, and is really a great artist himself.
