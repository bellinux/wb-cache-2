5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty dishes to soak <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels {{with his name}} on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to understand each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

25|$|Houses, {{cars and}} {{businesses}} were abandoned by those evacuating. Some locked their front doors, some did not, reasoning {{that someone would}} break the door to get in anyway. Some gave away pets, others just released them, many put them down. Some gave away furniture and belongings, some gave it to someone for safe storage, others simply walked away, leaving dirty dishes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> and food on the table. The withdrawal of cash from banks was limited to £20 per person. People could take just one suitcase.|$|E
25|$|When Hermes {{discovers the}} Professor's fate, he shows Leela the Professor's video will, which shows Leela kicking {{him into the}} {{anteater}} pit. Leela kills Hermes {{to cover up the}} first murder. Later, Bender walks in on Leela while she is getting rid of Hermes' body parts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> disposal. He is morally unconcerned, but takes the opportunity to blackmail Leela. She kills Bender by exposing him to the radiation from an open microwave oven and turns his body into a toy car. Amy makes a derisive comment about her new Go-kart (Bender), and Leela promptly murders her as well.|$|E
25|$|Marvel Cave is a National Natural Landmark {{located just}} west of Branson, Missouri, on top of Roark Mountain in Stone County. The cave was known by the Osage Indians in the early 16th century, after a tribe member fell through the cave's main entrance, a sinkhole. There is {{evidence}} that in 1541 the Spanish explored the cave, but the first recorded expedition was in 1869, led by Henry T. Blow. The unofficial Stone County chapter of Bald Knobbers, a local group of vigilantes, were rumored to have taken people {{to the top of}} Roark Mountain, and thrown them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> hole.|$|E

500|$|Later on, {{the protagonist}} {{encounters}} a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named Lisa, and {{upon entering the}} bathroom and being locked, he obtains a flashlight and finds a creature resembling an underdeveloped fetus crying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> He soon gets out, but finds out that the apparition is watching him. If the protagonist is attacked by the ghost, he reawakens in the first room of the game, beginning the loop again, but it's possible to avoid her completely. In the room, a bloody moving paper bag speaks to him, speaking of a disturbing experience, and stating the same quote seen {{at the start of}} the game - [...] "Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?" ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} to the ideal free distribution and balanced dispersal models is when fitness can vary among potential breeding sites within habitat patches and individuals must select the best available site. [...] This alternative {{has been called the}} [...] "ideal preemptive distribution", because a breeding site can be preempted if it has already been occupied. [...] For example, the dominant, older individuals in a population may occupy all of the best territories in the source so that the next best territory available may be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> [...] As the subordinate, younger individuals age, {{they may be able to}} take over territories in the source, but new subordinate juveniles from the source will have to move to the sink. [...] Pulliam argued that such a pattern of dispersal can maintain a large sink population indefinitely. [...] Furthermore, if good breeding sites in the source are rare and poor breeding sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> are common, it is even possible that the majority of the population resides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b>|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{additions}} to the source-sink literature is by Tittler et al., who examined wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) survey data for evidence of source and sink populations on a large scale. [...] The authors reasoned that emigrants from sources would likely be the juveniles produced in one year dispersing to reproduce in sinks in the next year, producing a one-year time lag between population changes in the source and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> [...] Using data from the Breeding Bird Survey, an annual survey of North American birds, they looked for relationships between survey sites showing such a one-year time lag. [...] They found several pairs of sites showing significant relationships 60–80km apart. [...] Several appeared to be sources to more than one sink, and several sinks appeared to receive individuals from more than one source. [...] In addition, some sites appeared to be a sink to one site and a source to another (see Figure 1). [...] The authors concluded that source-sink dynamics may occur on continental scales.|$|E
2500|$|The iconic {{nature of}} Champagne {{has long been}} used as a means of effusive ritual celebration, in which the wine is not {{consumed}} so much as [...] "sacrificed". The Champagne bottle traditionally smashed off the bow of a ship or aeroplane at its launch is believed to originate in the rather more reserved celebrations surrounding the christening of a baby. It is not uncommon to see champion sporting teams spraying bottles of champagne around their dressing rooms during celebrations, and indeed a bottle of champagne is a common gift to player-of-the-match award winners in football or cricket. The contents of a bottle agitated and sprayed over onlookers from the winners' podium of Formula 1 motor racing and other sports has origins in the earlier patronage of prestige sporting events by the social elite; the extravagant [...] "waste" [...] of the highly valued wine being an expression of the spirit of the Belle Époque. Rock band U2 famously end their concerts in similar fashion, spraying the audience with Champagne before leaving the stage. The act of pouring out champagne <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> (so called sinking) has arisen in Sweden due to a ban on spraying champagne in bars.|$|E
