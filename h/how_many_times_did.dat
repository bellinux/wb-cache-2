60|$|What a {{resolution}} is here! Moses and Samuel could {{do almost anything}} with God in prayer. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> Moses by prayer turn away God's judgments from even Pharaoh himself! yea, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> he by prayer preserve Israel, when in the wilderness, from the anger and wrath of God! (Psa 106:23). Samuel is reckoned excellent this way, yea, so excellent, that when Israel had done that fearful thing as to reject the Lord, and choose them another king, he prayed, and the Lord spared, and forgave them (1 Sam 12). But yet neither Moses nor Samuel can save a barren fig-tree. No; though Moses and Samuel stood before me, that is, pleading, arguing, interceding, supplicating, and beseeching, yet could they not incline mine heart to this people.|$|E
60|$|And {{yet they}} fear not God: alas! they believe not these things. These things, to carnal men, are like Lot's preaching to his {{sons and daughters}} that were in Sodom. When {{he told them that}} God would destroy that place, he seemed unto them as one that mocked; and his words to them were as idle tales (Gen 19:14). Fearless men are not won by words; blows, wounds, and killings, are the things that must bring them under fear. How many {{struggling}} fits had Israel with God in the wilderness? <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> they declare that there they feared him not? And observe, they were seldom, if ever, brought to fear and dread his glorious name, unless he beset them round with death and the grave. Nothing, nothing but a severe hand, will make the fearless fear. Hence, to speak after the manner of man, God is put upon it to go this way with sinners when he would save their souls; even bring them, and lay them at the mouth, and within sight of hell and everlasting damnation: and there also charge them with sin and guilt, to the breaking of their hearts, before they will fear his name.|$|E
6000|$|Eighth. But suppose God deals not {{either of}} these ways with the backslider, but shines upon him again, and seals up to him the {{remission}} of his sins a second time, saying, [...] "I will heal their backslidings, and love them freely," [...] what will the soul do now? Surely it will walk humbly now, and holily all its days. It will never backslide again, will it? It may happen it will not, it may happen it will; {{it is just as}} his God keeps him; for although his sins are of himself, his standing is of God; I say, his standing, while he stands, and his recovery, if he falls, are both of God; wherefore, if God leaves him a little, the next gap he finds, away he is gone again. [...] "My people," [...] says God, [...] "are bent to backsliding from me." [...] <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> David backslide; yea, Jehoshaphat and Peter! (2 Sam 11,24; 2 Chron 19:1-3; 20:1-5; Matt 26:69-71; Gal 2:11-13). As also in the third of Jeremiah it is said, [...] "But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers, yet return unto me, saith the Lord" [...] (verse 1). Here is grace! So many time as the soul backslides, so many times God brings him again--I mean, the soul that must be saved by grace--he renews his pardons, and multiplies them. [...] "Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man" [...] (Job 33:29).|$|E

The godly {{man that}} walketh with God, that chiefly careth {{to do the}} work that God hath allotted him to do for his name in this world, he hath not only these advantages, but further, he hath as it were a {{privilege}} of power with God, he can sway much with him; as it is said of Jacob, as a prince he had power with God to prevail in times of difficulty (Gen 32:28). And so again, it is said of Judah, being faithful with the saints, he ruled with God (Hosea 11:12). <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> that good man Moses turn away the wrath of God from the many thousands of Israel; yea, as it were, he held the hands of God, and staved off the judgments not once nor twice; the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much (2 Sam 5:10). One man that walketh much with God, may work wonders in this very thing; he may be a means of saving whole countries and kingdoms from those judgments their sins deserve. How many times, when Israel provoked the Lord to anger, did he yet defer to destroy them? and the reason of that forbearance, he tells them it was for David's sake; for my servant David's sake I will not do it. As the Lord said also concerning Paul, 'Lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee'; that is, to save their lives from the rage of the sea (Acts 27:24). Yea, when a judgment is not only threatened, but the decree gone forth for its execution, then godly upright men may sometimes cause the very decree itself to cease without bringing forth (Zech 2:1-3). Or else may so time the judgment that is decreed, that the church shall best be able to bear it (Matt 24:20).|$|E
60|$|Off went Aurelia in solitude, {{within a}} large carriage, once gaily fitted though now {{somewhat}} faded and tarnished. She {{was sorry to}} be parted from the Doves, whom she {{wanted to give her}} courage for the introduction to my Lady, and to explain to her the wonders of the streets of London, which she did not quite expect to see paved with gold! She ate her extemporised meal, gazing from the window, and expecting to see houses and churches thicken on her, and hurrying to brush away her crumbs, and put on her gloves lest she should arrive unawares, for she had counted half-a-dozen houses close together. No! here was another field! More fields and houses. The signs of habitation were, so far from increasing, growing more scanty, and looked strangely like what she had before passed. Could this be the right road! How foolish to doubt, when this was my Lady's own coach. But oh, that it had waited for Mrs. Dove! She would beg her to get in when the riders overtook her. When would they? No sign of them could be seen from the windows, and here were more houses. Surely this was Turnham Green again, or there must be another village green exactly like it in the heart of London. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> not poor Aurelia go through all these impressions {{in the course of the}} drive. She was absolutely certain that she was taken through Brentford again, this time without a halt; but after this the country became unknown to her, and the road much worse. It was in fact for the most part a mere ditch or cart track, so rough that the four horses came to a walk. Aurelia had read no novels but Telemaque and Le Grand Cyrus, so her imagination was not terrified by tales of abduction, but alarm began to grow upon her. She much longed to ask the coachman whither he was taking her, but the check string had been either worn out or removed; she could not open the door from within, nor make him hear, and indeed she was a little afraid of him.|$|E
6000|$|With these {{frank and}} {{pleasant}} young men Clive soon formed a considerable intimacy: {{and if any}} of his older and peaceful friends chanced to take their afternoon airing in the Park, and survey the horsemen there, we might have the pleasure of beholding Mr. Newcome in Rotten Row, riding {{side by side with}} other dandies who had mustachios blonde or jet, who wore flowers in their buttons (themselves being flowers of spring), who rode magnificent thoroughbred horses, scarcely touching their stirrups with the tips of their varnished boots, and who kissed the most beautiful primrose-coloured kid gloves to lovely ladies passing them in the Ride. Clive drew portraits of half the officers of the Life Guards Green; and was appointed painter in ordinary to that distinguished corps. His likeness of the Colonel would make you die with laughing: his picture of the Surgeon was voted a masterpiece. He drew the men in the saddle, in the stable, in their flannel dresses, sweeping their flashing swords about, receiving lancers, repelling infantry,--nay, cutting--a sheep in two, as some of the warriors are known {{to be able to do}} at one stroke. Detachments of Life Guardsmen made their appearance in Charlotte Street, which was not very distant from their barracks; the most splendid cabs were seen prancing before his door; and curly-whiskered youths, of aristocratic appearance, smoking cigars out of his painting-room window. <b>How</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> Clive's next-door neighbour, little Mr Finch, the miniature-painter, run to peep through his parlour blinds, hoping that a sitter was coming, and [...] "a carriage-party" [...] driving up! What wrath Mr. Scowler, A.R.A., was in, because a young hop-o'-my-thumb dandy, who wore gold chains and his collars turned down, should spoil the trade and draw portraits for nothing! Why did none of the young men come to Scowler? Scowler was obliged to own that Mr. Newcome had considerable talent, and a good knack at catching a likeness. He could not paint a bit, to be sure, but his heads in black-and-white were really tolerable; his sketches of horses very vigorous and lifelike. Mr. Gandish said if Clive would come for three or four years into his academy he could make something of him. Mr. Smee shook his head, and said he was afraid, that kind of loose, desultory study, that keeping of aristocratic company, was anything but favourable to a young artist--Smee, who would walk five miles to attend an evening party of ever so little a great man! ...|$|E

Servants clad in purple coat send morning greetings. Looking back to the days (we had at the) waterfront pavilion, I was in a daze throughout the night. I eschewed my own desolation to console my grieving mother. Riding on chariots, sorrows soared into the ninth Heaven. Feathery flags fluttering along the celestial path. Illness did not erode the filial piety in you. You would remind me to be diligent in my studies. Even in dreams, you would send regards to inquire about His Majesty’s health. Should I joy or mourn? I must be looking haggard, for tears are streaming down my cheeks as if a river breached its banks. Who had no brothers? To whom could I pour out my heart to? In the northern garden, the moon shore on the pine forest. Underneath the eastern hill, wild birds shrieking. How could (a bird) fly with broken wings? It is such a pity that yellow birds did not have a hundred lives. The flock of wild geese is shrinking with just three of us left. Tree branches rustling, I sink into deep melancholy. Are dreams real or is reality a dream? Embraced by the cherry blossoms, I coalesced my thoughts to let bitterness fade with time. Times flies relentlessly, like the water that flows and never returns.|$|E

We want to {{quantify}} reciprocity between individuals in weighted networks, {{and we want to}} discover whether it depends on their topological features (like degree, or number of common neighbors). Here we answer these questions, by studying the call- and SMS records of millions of mobile phone users from a large city, with more than 0. 5 billion phone calls and 60 million SMSs, exchanged over a period of six months. Our main contributions are: (1) We propose a novel distribution, the Triple Power Law (3 PL), that fits the reciprocity behavior of all 3 datasets we study, with a better fit than older competitors, (2) 3 PL is parsimonious; it has only three parameters and thus avoids over-fitting, (3) 3 PL can spot anomalies, and we report the most surprising ones, in our real networks, (4) We observe that the degree of reciprocity between users is correlated with their local topological features; reciprocity is higher among mutual users with larger local network overlap and greater degree similarity. ...|$|E

In his book Emotion and Reason: The Cognitive Neuroscience of Decision Making, Alain Berthoz aims to answer these questions and to shed light on the neural underpinnings of the highly familiar, yet so puzzling, phenomenon of making decisions. In 295 pages, he gives a comprehensive and entertaining overview of the neuroscience of choice behaviour. The focus of the later chapters is preluded by the first section of the book, entitled ‘Is decision making rational or irrational?’. In this section, Berthoz gives a brief account of the current controversy of whether decision making is just about computing gains, losses, and probabilities, or whether it is more than that. Decision making is of course more than that as emotional, social, and other factors frequently bias a person's judgment to deviate from the path of rationality, hence the book's title...|$|E

A single macro containing all the needed parameters for input and output is discussed for exporting all file types. The GREPLAYi procedure is used to create a list and ultimately output graphical entries from a chosen catalogue. Although the methodology presented can be expanded for many other applications and file types, the focus is on producing Computer Graphics Metafiles (CGM), Graphics Stream Files (GSF), and Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) files. These files can be opened or imported by the required application. Finally, the advantages of initially storing SAS graphs as catalogued entries as well as appropriate versions of SAS are discussed...|$|E

This paper describes an application that allows a nearly automatic, real time creation of video proceedings. All the talks are captured in video, and are automatically indexed by speech recognition and video analysis tools. The abstracts and speaker’s biography are extracted from the text proceedings and are converted to web pages.
