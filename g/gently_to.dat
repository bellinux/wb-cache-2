McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station, where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet. Although a {{primitive}} X-ray machine was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds, it was not used. McKinley was taken to the Milburn House.|$|E
5|$|Highway407 {{begins in}} Burlington within Halton Region at the Freeman Interchange between Highway403 and the QEW, {{from which it}} {{branches}} off northward. The six-lane route passes under Brant Street, Upper Middle Road and Guelph Line (Halton Regional Road1) before it interchanges with Dundas Street (Halton Regional Road5 and former Highway5). It briefly enters greenspace as it curves <b>gently</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, avoiding the nearby Niagara Escarpment. The route is crossed by Walkers Line, east of which residential subdivisions line the south side and greenspace lines the north. At an interchange with Appleby Line (Halton Regional Road20), the highway straightens and travels parallel to Dundas Street before passing over Bronte Creek and under the Canadian National Railway's (CN) Halwest Subdivision.|$|E

5|$|Zion National Park {{includes}} an elevated plateau {{that consists of}} sedimentary formations that dip very <b>gently</b> <b>to</b> the east. This means that the oldest strata are exposed along the Virgin River in the Zion Canyon part of the park, and the youngest are exposed in the Kolob Canyons section. The plateau is bounded on the east by the Sevier Fault Zone, and on the west by the Hurricane Fault Zone. Weathering and erosion along north-trending faults and fractures influence the formation of landscape features, such as canyons, in this region.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{numerous}} {{proposals were}} put forward to salvage Titanic. However, all fell afoul of practical and technological difficulties, {{a lack of}} funding and, in many cases, {{a lack of understanding}} of the physical conditions at the wreck site. Charles Smith, an architect from Denver, proposed in March 1914 to attach electromagnets to a submarine which would be irresistibly drawn to the wreck's steel hull. Having found its exact position, more electromagnets would be sent down from a fleet of barges which would winch Titanic to the surface. An estimated cost of $1.5 million (£ today) and its impracticality meant that the idea was not put into practice. Another proposal involved raising Titanic by means of attaching balloons to her hull using electromagnets. Once enough balloons had been attached, the ship would float <b>gently</b> <b>to</b> the surface. Again, the idea got no further than the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|Several {{observers}} (including Plait and Tyson) {{said that}} in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need to tug the tether <b>gently</b> <b>to</b> pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.|$|E

25|$|The Bellarine Peninsula is a <b>gently</b> <b>to</b> {{moderately}} undulating landform that protrudes in an {{east and}} north-easterly direction into Port Phillip. The peninsula {{is generally considered}} to begin its protrusion from between the town of Torquay and east of Geelong. It is surrounded by Corio Bay and the Outer Harbour to the north, Port Phillip to the north-east and east, The Rip to the south-east and Bass Strait to the south.|$|E

Ridges are developed on plane and rippled surfaces.|$|R
25|$|The former route begins {{travelling}} northwards but immediately begins curving <b>gently</b> <b>to</b> the west, splitting {{from the}} old Port Franks Road and entering Thedford. It briefly curves southwest through the commercial strip of the town, an orientation influenced by the former railway. At King Street, the route turns north and crosses the former track bed. As it exits the town, the route curves west onto Ravenswood Line and enters farmland. It curves north onto Northville Road and travels straight for several kilometres, eventually crossing the old Port Franks Road just south of Highway21, where the route ends.|$|E
25|$|The base of Mount Hood {{consists}} of soils of the Goulding-Toomes-Guenoc association, which are well-drained <b>gently</b> <b>to</b> very steep loams and clay-loams situated upon upland formations. The upper reaches consist of the Kidd-Forward-Cohasset association, which group ranges from well-drained to excessively drained moderate to very steep gravelly and stony loams. Specific soil map patches {{on the upper}} slopes include Boomer loam on some 15 to 30 percent slopes; Goulding cobbly clay loam on 15 to 30 percent slopes; Henneke gravelly loam on some 5 to 30 percent slopes; Henneke gravelly loam on 30 to 75 percent slopes; and rock land on 15 to 75 percent slopes.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern side}} of the fell forms the head of Swindale proper, the upper valley being known as Mosedale. Swindale is a classic U-shaped valley, its profile almost a square section, with a flat base and sheer walls. Selside Pike's eastern slopes fall <b>gently</b> <b>to</b> about the 2,000ft contour and then plunge over a wall of crag to the valley floor. Geordie Greathead Crag is the {{dominant}} feature and below this is the dry tarnbed of Dodd Bottom. Hobgrumble Gill falls down this face in a deep gully, separating Selside Pike from the north east ridge of High Howes. Above the crags the gill runs in a small hanging valley.|$|E

25|$|Screening the fibre {{involves}} using a mesh {{made from}} non-corroding and inert material, such as aluminium, which is stretched {{in a wooden}} frame {{similar to that of}} a window. The size of the paper is governed {{by the size of the}} frame. This tool is then completely submerged in the solution vertically and drawn out horizontally to ensure a uniform coating of the wire mesh. Excess water is then removed and the wet mat of fibre laid on top of a damp cloth. The process is repeated for the required number of sheets. This stack of wet mats is then pressed in a hydraulic press very <b>gently</b> <b>to</b> ensure the fibre does not squeeze out. The fairly damp fibre is then dried using a variety of methods, such as vacuum drying or simply air drying. Sometimes, the individual sheet is rolled to flatten, harden, and refine the surface. Finally, the paper is then cut to the desired shape or the standard shape (A4, letter, legal, etc.) and packed.|$|E
25|$|Dante and Virgil {{approach}} the Central Well, {{at the bottom}} of which lies the Ninth and final Circle of Hell. The classical and biblical Giants – who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery – stand perpetual guard inside the well-pit, their legs embedded in the banks of the Ninth Circle while their upper halves rise above the rim and can be visible from the Malebolge. Dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city. Among the Giants, Virgil identifies Nimrod (who tried to build the Tower of Babel; he shouts out the unintelligible Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi); Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy; he has his arms chained up) and Briareus (who Dante claimed to have challenged the Gods); and Tityos and Typhon, who insulted Jupiter. Also here is the Giant Antaeus, who did not join in the rebellion against the Olympian Gods and therefore is not chained. At Virgil's persuasion, Antaeus takes the Poets in his large palm and lowers them <b>gently</b> <b>to</b> the final level of Hell.|$|E
