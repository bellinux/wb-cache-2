In 2004, 25 firms {{in a sample of}} 73 reported net deferred tax assets and 48 reported net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Firms differ substantially in the composition of their deferred tax assets and liabilities. The largest components of deferred tax assets for sample firms are Loss and Credit Carryforwards and Employment and Post-employment Benefits. The largest components of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> are Property, Plant & Equipment and Leases. Total deferred tax assets for sample firms with net deferred tax assets in 2004 were $ 61. 9 billion, while total <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> for sample firms with net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> were $ 223. 8 billion. A five percentage point decline in the federal statutory corporate tax rate could reduce net income at sample firms with net deferred tax assets by as much as $ 8. 8 billion, since a statutory rate cut would reduce the value of deferred tax assets and this change would be reflected on the income statement. We use data on the sales, market value, and assets of sample firms, relative to aggregate data for the U.

Selection of these companies is because fixed assets revaluation is one of the components of deferred taxes. Fixed Assets Revaluation will cause deferred tax asset or liability depend on the comparison of the company recorded value and the market value. When the company recorded value is larger than the market value of assets would cause deferred tax liability, and in contrast if the company recorded value is lower than the market value of assets would cause deferred tax asset. 120 firms are the total sample of this study. This study uses Feltham & Ohlson’s price model in order to regress the value relevance of the sample. Dependent variable that used in this study is closed price per share. Independent variables that used in this study are deferred tax assets and liabilities and other components of deferred taxes (net deferred taxes, net deferred tax assets, net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities,</b> and net deferred tax based on quintile distribution).

40|$|The article {{highlights}} {{the results of}} the analysis of deferred taxes as indicators of the accounting financial statements, reflecting payments to the budget for income tax agricultural organizations. The importance of deferred tax assets and <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> as a key marker of efficiency of the tax policy of the agricultural organizations is emphasized. Its inefficiency can be judge by excess of deferred tax assets over <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities,</b> which is seen as a temporary diversion of funds from the market, which has zero profitability. The conclusion was made about the improvement of financial stability and liquidity of the organization under the influence of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liabilities</b> and the deteriorating financial situation, financial stability and liquidity under the influence of deferred tax assets. The effective income tax rate of the agricultural organizations of Krasnodar territory is determined; it does not exceed 3 % and differs from general because of tax benefits, deductions and tax policy.

The current study replicates Phillips et al. (2003) ’s study, where they found evidence that firms use {{deferred tax}} expense to manage earnings.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the theory underlying the current accounting and reporting standards for <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> and concludes that using the flow-through accounting approach is a better fit for reporting this financial statement item than the asset-liability approach currently required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The authors propose that the underlying issue in accounting for <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> is the unit problem as presented by Carl Devine. To obtain a perspective on the magnitude and behavior of the <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> account balances reported by firms, 2, 100 firms in 20 industries were observed approximately over a ten-year period (1997 - 2006). Most firms appear to postpone <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> reversals by utilizing tax planning strategies, allowing them to defer indefinitely the requirement to pay tax on earlier timing differences. Therefore, net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> balances {{can be thought of}} as possible or remote contingencies rather than probable liabilities. To illustrate the financial consequences of using the approach where the tax expense is equal to the statutory <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> instead of the expense reported under the current rules, the change in the debt-to-equity (DTE) ratios was computed for the firms in the sample by eliminating the net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> balances from <b>liabilities</b> and adding them to equities...|$|R
