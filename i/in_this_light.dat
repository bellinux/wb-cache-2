5|$|The {{construction}} {{of the book and}} {{the subject matter of the}} poem within it share a metaphorical connection in the decay of memory. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>light,</b> critic Peter Schwenger asserts that Agrippa can be understood as organized by two ideas: the death of Gibson's father, and the disappearance or absence of the book itself. In this sense, it instantiates the ephemeral nature of all text.|$|E
5|$|In other words, column j of A {{expresses the}} image of vj {{in terms of the}} basis vectors wi of W; thus this {{relation}} uniquely determines the entries of the matrix A. The matrix depends on the choice of the bases: different choices of bases give rise to different, but equivalent matrices. Many of the above concrete notions can be reinterpreted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>light,</b> for example, the transpose matrix AT describes the transpose of the linear map given by A, with respect to the dual bases.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 2009, it was {{announced}} that the new album title would be <b>In</b> <b>This</b> <b>Light</b> and on This Evening and that they would be the first band to play at the new O2 Academy Birmingham. Through producer Flood's heavy usage of synthesisers, the album provided a synthpop/post-punk sound to Editors' production. Flood, who is famous for collaborating with electronic music influenced bands like U2, Depeche Mode, The Killers and Erasure, helped develop synthetic elements on the album, which resulted in a mixed reception from long-term fans as to the group's new direction.|$|E

5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and Triceratops {{that seemed to have}} survived initial attacks. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with Tyrannosaurus that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>light,</b> scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was an active predator that was willing to scavenge if it could.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} with his reading of Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion {{in the face of}} sexual temptation (act 2, scene 3). Schopenhaurian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through negation of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. When viewed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>light,</b> Parsifal, with its emphasis on Mitleid ("compassion") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen ("yearning"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} Sue, paleontologist Pete Larson found {{a broken}} and healed fibula and tail vertebrae, scarred facial bones and a tooth from another Tyrannosaurus {{embedded in a}} neck vertebra. If correct, these might be strong evidence for aggressive behavior between tyrannosaurs but whether {{it would have been}} competition for food and mates or active cannibalism is unclear. Further recent investigation of these purported wounds has shown that most are infections rather than injuries (or simply damage to the fossil after death) and the few injuries are too general to be indicative of intraspecific conflict. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. Top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics that only small dromaeosaurs and troodontids remain as feasible top predators. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>light,</b> scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators, although they may have had a hard time finding enough meat to scavenge, being outnumbered by smaller theropods. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger like most large carnivores.|$|E

25|$|Any {{principle}} of relativity prescribes a symmetry in natural law: that is, the laws must {{look the same}} to one observer as they do to another.

25|$|Although {{there has}} been some debate, {{inhibition}} is generally no longer considered to be an executive function deficit in people with autism. Individuals with autism have demonstrated differential performance on various tests of inhibition, with results being taken to indicate a general difficulty in the inhibition of a habitual response. However, performance on the Stroop task, for example, has been unimpaired relative to matched controls. An alternative explanation has suggested that executive function tests that demonstrate a clear rationale are passed by individuals with autism. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>light,</b> it is the design of the measures of inhibition that have been implicated in the observation of impaired performance rather than inhibition being a core deficit.|$|E
