A series of derivatives were synthesized in a selective manner by controlling the reaction temperature. Different POE and POP blocks in copolymers were made to have various polarity and molecular weight. (1) Synthesis of star-shape copolymers by cyanuric chloride and polyoxyalkylene amine. Star-shape copolymers are similar to hyperbranch structure which is different from linear-type. We can design molecule configuration of different property and remain reactive functionalities. The structures are constituted of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic poly(oxyalkylene) -segments which could reduce surface tension as low as 34. 3 mN/m, and exhibits the capability of reducing interfacial tension (toluene/water) until 1. 3 mN/m (0. 001 wt %). (2) A series of cross-linked structure were synthesized with cyanuric chloride and polyoxyalkylene amine by controlling diverse reactive groups. The presence of the poly(oxyethylene) block structure afforded the copolymers properties such as hydrophilicity and metal chelation.

Frenier and Hill (2002) showed that these additives have a minimal effect on the performance of the acids.

These additives are added to minimize other problems like corrosion and incompatibility (Rabie and Nasr-El-Din 2015). Incompatibility problems can be minimized using surfactant additives in the main acid and after-flush stages. Corrosion inhibitors are used at concentrations of 0.1 % uniformly throughout the acid stages to protect the metal integrity (McLeod et al. 1983).

Water or undiluted glycols were applied four times daily on days 7 to 16 of gestation to the shaved interscapular skin with an automatic pipetter. Volumes of EGEE (0. 25 mL), EGEEA (0. 35 mL), and diEGEE (0. 35 mL) were approximately equimolar (2. 6 mmole per treatment). EGBE at 0. 35 mL four times daily (approximately 2. 7 mmole per treatment) killed 10 of 11 treated rats, and was subsequently tested at 0. 12 mL (0. 9 mmole) per treatment. EGEE- and EGEEAtreated rats showed a reduction in body weight relative to water controls that was associated with completely resorbed litters and significantly fewer live fetuses per litter. Fetal body weights were also significantly reduced in those groups. Visceral malformations and skeletal variations were significantly increased in EGEE and EGEEA groups over the negative control group. No embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects were detected in the EGBE- or diEGEE-treated litters...|$|R
40|$|Past {{studies on}} the {{toxicological}} effects of ethylene glycol alkyl ethers {{as well as the}} recent data on these chemicals in Japan are reviewed. Only a few researchers have participated in the study of ethylene glycol alkyl ethers in Japan. The effects of ethylene glycol alkyl ethers on testis and embryotoxic effects of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGM) have been studied, as has the teratogenicity of ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (EGdM). Studies on ethylene glycol alkyl ethers and related compounds administered to mice by oral gavage revealed the occurrence of testicular atrophy and decreased white blood cell count by EGM, EGdM, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, and the toxicity was related to their chemical structure. On the other hand, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monopropyl <b>ether,</b> ethylene glycol <b>monobutyl</b> <b>ether,</b> ethylene glycol monophenyl ether, ethylene glycol monoacetate or ethylene glycol diacetate showed no such an effect. Studies on EGM using hamsters or guinea pigs revealed the occurrence of testicular atrophy similar to that observed in mice. In regard to the methyl ethers of other glycols, there is no convincing evidence that propylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether or diethylene glycol dimethyl ether causes testicular atrophy in mice. Teratological studies of EGM and EGdM revealed embryotoxic effects in mice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEthylene glycol <b>monobutyl</b> <b>ether</b> (EGBE), {{also known}} as 2 -butoxyethanol (2 -BE), has been {{identified}} as a contaminant in hydraulic fracturing fluids. In order to determine the presence of 2 -BE in hydraulic fracturing chemical additives, a reliable method for recovering 2 -BE from aqueous phases by liquid-liquid extraction combined with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was established. The liquid-liquid extraction method was applied to samples matrices containing various amounts of salt. Using methylene chloride for liquid-liquid extraction in a sample to solvent ratio of 1 : 3, ≥ 99 % 2 -BE recovery may be achieved with less than 5 % standard error. The limit of detection was determined to be 0. 957  mg L− 1 2 -BE. Accuracy was determined to be 2. 58 % and precision was determined using the coefficient of variation, which was 3. 5 %. The method was used to recover 2 -BE in a hydraulic fracturing chemical additive called Revert Flow and to quantify the weight percent of 2 -BE in the chemical additive. Weight percent of two additional components of Revert Flow, D-limonene and 1 -butoxy- 2 -propanol, were also determined. We also used the method to determine the abiotic of 2 -BE in water, which was 5. 55 days. The persistence of 2 -BE in hydraulic fracturing fluid was also investigated and determined that 2 -BE is more persistent in this environment...|$|R
40|$|Timed-pregnant Fischer 344 {{rats and}} New Zealand White rabbits {{were exposed to}} {{ethylene}} glycol <b>monobutyl</b> <b>ether</b> vapors by inhalation on gestational days 6 through 15 (rats) or 6 through 18 (rabbits) at concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 100 or 200 ppm. The animals were sacrificed on gestational day 21 (rats) or 29 (rabbits). In rats, exposure to 200 or 100 ppm resulted in maternal toxicity (clinical signs, decreased body weight and weight gain, decreased absolute and relative organ weights, decreased food and water consumption and evidence of anemia), embryotoxicity (increased number of totally resorbed litters and decreased number of viable implantations per litter) and fetotoxicity (reductions in skeletal ossification). No increase in fetal malformations was observed in any exposure group relative to controls. At 50 or 25 ppm, there was no maternal, embryo or fetal toxicity (including malformations) in rats. In rabbits, exposure to 200 ppm resulted in maternal toxicity (apparent exposure-related increases in deaths and abortions, clinical signs, decreased weight during exposure and reduced gravid uterine weight at sacrifice) and embryotoxicity (reduced number of total and viable implantations per litter). No treatment-related fetotoxicity was seen. No treatment-related increased in fetal malformations or variations were seen at any exposure concentration tested. There {{was no evidence of}} maternal, embryo, or fetal toxicity (including malformations) at 100, 50 or 25 ppm in rabbits...|$|R
40|$|Intercellular {{communication}} {{most likely}} plays a significant coordinating role in morphogenesis. Blockage {{of a specific}} type of intercellular communication, that mediated by gap junctions, has been proposed as a mechanism of action of some teratogens. Several glycol ethers have recently been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals. Because these compounds are negative in genotoxic assays, it is suggested that they may act by nongenetic, perhaps membrane-mediated mechanisms. In the present study several structurally related alkyl glycol ethers were examined for their ability to block junction-mediated intercellular communication. Interruption of intercellular communication was measured in vitro by an assay that depends on the transfer of metabolites via gap junctions, i. e., metabolic cooperation. All compounds tested [...] ethylene glycol (EG), ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME), ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGEE), ethylene glycol monopropyl ether (EGPE), and ethylene glycol <b>monobutyl</b> <b>ether</b> (EGBE) [...] were able to block metabolic cooperation in vitro. The potencies of the compounds were inversely related to the length of the aliphatic chain, the dose required for maximum blockage increasing as the aliphatic chain shortened. Some differences in the maximum amount of blockage were detected, but these were not consistent and hence were not considered significant. Cytotoxicity, as measured by cell survival, was also related to the structure of the compound, generally increasing with increased length of the aliphatic chain. There were structurally related differences in the concentration ranges over which the compounds were effective. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
