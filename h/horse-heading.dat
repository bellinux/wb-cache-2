2500|$|On farmhouses in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, <b>horse-head</b> gables were {{referred}} to as [...] "Hengst und Hors" [...] as late as around 1875. Rudolf Simek notes that these horse heads gables can still be seen today, and says that the <b>horse-head</b> gables confirm that Hengist and Horsa were originally considered mythological, horse-shaped beings. Martin Litchfield West comments that the horse heads may have been remnants of pagan religious practices in the area.|$|R

60|$|We dismounted, and grooms, in the Cavalcanti livery of scarlet {{with the}} <b>horse-head</b> in white upon their breasts, led away our horses. The seneschal acted as quarter-master to our lances, whilst Cavalcanti himself led us up the great stone {{staircase}} with its carved balustrade of marble, from which rose a file of pillars {{to support the}} groined ceiling. This last was frescoed in dull red with the white <b>horse-head</b> at intervals. On our right, on every third step, stood orange-trees in tubs, all flowering and shedding the most fragrant perfume.|$|R
50|$|Pfersee {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in 8th century, {{but there also}} are important archeological findings such as a brazen <b>horse-head</b> {{which was part of}} an equestrian statue, probably dedicated to emperor Hadrian.|$|R
50|$|Use of the bowed string {{is thought}} to {{originate}} with nomads who mainly used the snake-skin, covered horsetail-bowed lute. In Mongolia instruments like the morin khuur or <b>horse-head</b> fiddle survive today.|$|R
25|$|The black-figure style became {{generally}} {{established in}} Athens around 600 BC. An early Athenian development was the <b>horse-head</b> amphora, the name {{coming from the}} depiction of horse heads in an image window. Image windows were frequently used in the subsequent period and were later adopted even in Corinth. The Cerameicus Painter and the Gorgon Painter {{are associated with the}} <b>horse-head</b> amphoras. The Corinthian influence was not only maintained, but even intensified. The animal frieze was recognized as generally obligatory and customarily used. This had economic as well as stylistic reasons, because Athens competed with Corinth for markets. Attic vases were sold in the Black Sea area, Libya, Syria, lower Italy and Spain, as well as within the Greek homeland.|$|R
6000|$|... "Allow me, madam," [...] said Giles, {{offering}} his right-hand to an elderly female, who, having screwed up her courage {{to make a}} rush, got into sudden danger and became mentally hysterical {{in the midst of}} a conglomerate of hoofs, poles, <b>horse-heads,</b> and wheels.|$|R
60|$|Soon he had dipped out of sight, and of {{his company}} nothing was visible but the {{fluttering}} red pennons with the device of the white <b>horse-head.</b> Gradually these also sank and vanished, and once more I was alone with the crowd of pilgrims.|$|R

5000|$|A {{reviewer}} {{writing about}} the Walden Country Inn & Stables, a hotel in Aurora, Ohio, noted a [...] "horsey theme" [...] reflected throughout the hotel's decoration, [...] "never overdone (except, perhaps, for the Walden <b>horse-head</b> logo crimped into {{the end of the}} toilet paper)".|$|R
2500|$|When Suvorovo graves {{appeared}} in the Danube delta grasslands, <b>horse-head</b> maces also {{appeared in}} some of the indigenous farming towns of the Tripolye and Gumelnitsa cultures in present-day Romania and Moldova, near the Suvorovo graves. These agricultural cultures had not previously used polished-stone maces, and horse bones were rare or absent in their settlement sites. Probably their <b>horse-head</b> maces came from the Suvorovo immigrants. The Suvorovo people in turn acquired many copper ornaments from the Tripolye and Gumelnitsa towns. After this episode of contact and trade, but still during the period 4200-4000 BCE, about 600 agricultural towns in the Balkans and the lower Danube valley, some of which had been occupied for 2000 years, were abandoned. Copper mining ceased in the Balkan copper mines, and the cultural traditions associated with the agricultural towns were terminated in the Balkans and the lower Danube valley. This collapse of [...] "Old Europe" [...] has been attributed to the immigration of mounted Indo-European warriors. The collapse could have been caused by intensified warfare, for which there is some evidence; and warfare could have been worsened by mounted raiding; and the <b>horse-head</b> maces have been interpreted as indicating the introduction of domesticated horses and riding just before the collapse.|$|R
50|$|The most {{striking}} {{feature of the}} temples is the Sabha mandapa porches. Two madanikas are seen on the northern side of the portico. The eastern and southern porticos are embellished with several mythical figures of Gaja Kesari, half human-half lion form riding on elephant, and <b>horse-head</b> lion back on elephant.|$|R
60|$|Now Eric and his henchman Skallagrim the Baresark rode {{four hours}} and saw nobody, till at length {{they came to the}} brow of a hill that is named <b>Horse-Head</b> Heights, and, {{crossing}} it, found themselves almost {{in the midst of a}} score of armed men who were about to mount their horses.|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} {{a model for the}} play Our Town, written by Thornton Wilder while in {{residence}} at the MacDowell Colony. His fictional town of Grovers Corners appears to have been named for Peterborough's Grove Street. At the corner of Grove and Main streets, a cell-phone Quick Response Code near the <b>horse-head</b> fountain starts a QR-code tour of Peterborough.|$|R
50|$|The Breather enjoys {{stalking}} victims {{over the}} telephone and much like Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th films, he hates seeing youngsters having sex. The Breather uses many unusual objects to kill his female victims such as a paper clip, a chalkboard eraser, and a <b>horse-head</b> bookend. He kills his male victims by placing them in trash bags alive.|$|R
50|$|On July 5, 1878 {{the arms}} were {{replaced}}. The new arms showed a <b>horse-head,</b> {{symbol for the}} famous stud farms in the city, with in the chief two coins and a star (see above). The coins symbolised trade and wealth, the star the new university. These arms were, {{at the request of}} the nobility, replaced by the old 1781 arms again on May 21, 1887.|$|R
50|$|The <b>horse-head</b> fiddle, or morin khuur, is a distinctively Mongolian {{instrument}} and {{is seen as}} a symbol of the country. The instrument has two strings. There is some controversy regarding the traditional carving of a horse on the upper end of the pegbox. Some scholars believe that this is proof that the instrument was originally a shamanistic instrument. The staffs of shamans have a horse similarly carved on top; the horse is a much-revered animal in Mongolia.|$|R
60|$|Now Eric came to Coldback in the Marsh, and Saevuna {{his mother}} and Unna, Thorod's daughter, the betrothed of Asmund, were glad to welcome him; for the tidings of his mighty deeds and of the {{overthrow}} of Ospakar and the slaying of Mord were noised far and wide. But at Skallagrim Lambstail they looked askance. Still, when they heard {{of those things that}} he had wrought on <b>Horse-Head</b> Heights, they welcomed him for his deed's sake.|$|R
50|$|Roof apex: The roof apex {{of a large}} hall {{is usually}} topped with a ridge of tiles and statues for both {{decorative}} purposes {{as well as to}} weigh down the layers of roofing tiles for stability. These ridges are often well decorated, especially for religious or palatial structures. In some regions of China, the ridges are sometimes extended or incorporated into the walls of the building to form matouqiang (<b>horse-head</b> walls), which serve as a fire deterrent from drifting embers.|$|R
5000|$|Buryatia {{is a part}} of the Russian Federation. One of the country's main {{instruments}} is a two-stringed <b>horse-head</b> fiddle {{called a}} morin khuur. This is a similar instrument to that found across the region. Other elements of Buryat music, such as the use of fourths both in tuning instruments and in songs, and pentatonic scales, reveal similarities to music from Siberia and Eastern Asia. There traditionally was no polyphony, instead voices and instruments performed the same melody in unison but varied in timing and ornamentation.|$|R
60|$|Now on {{the fifth}} day after the going of Gudruda, Skallagrim came back to Mosfell {{somewhat}} cold and weary. And he told Eric, who could now walk and grew strong again, that he and Jon had ridden with Gudruda the Fair to <b>Horse-Head</b> Heights, seeing no man, and had left her there to go on with her thralls. He had come back also seeing no one, for the weather was too cold for the men of Gizur to watch the fell in the snows.|$|R
50|$|In Japanese Mahayana Buddhism, Hayagriva is {{considered}} as a Avalokiteśvara with wrathful form (Batō Kannon 馬頭觀音, lit.Hayagrīva-Avalokiteśvara) , {{one of the six}} Avalokiteśvaras intended to save the sentient beings of the six realms: deities (deva), demons (asura), human beings, animals, hungry ghosts, beings of hell. Hayagriva's sphere is realm of animals (or beings whose state of mind are animal-like). In Folk religion in Japan, Hyagriva was also worshipped as the guardian deity for horses because of its name <b>Horse-head</b> (Batō). The horse was symbolized as a vehicle, not as one of Hayagriva's heads.|$|R
5000|$|The Kelpies are 30-metre-high <b>horse-head</b> sculptures, {{standing}} next to a new extension to the Forth and Clyde Canal, and near [...] River Carron, in The Helix, a new parkland project built to connect 16 communities in the Falkirk Council Area, Scotland. The sculptures were designed by sculptor Andy Scott and were completed in October 2013. The sculptures form a gateway at the eastern entrance to the Forth and Clyde canal, and the new canal extension built as part of The Helix land transformation project. The Kelpies are a monument to horse powered heritage across Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|The Kentucky Oaks {{was first}} run in 1875; its winner gained a purse of $1,175, but the {{existing}} records do not mention any trophy {{as part of}} the award ceremony. [...] In 1924 Lemon & Son, Inc. commissioned Redlich & Co. of New York City to create a loving cup, possession of which would signify having won the Kentucky Oaks competition. Redlich asked George Louis Graff to provide an appropriate design. The resulting sterling silver design was 25 inches (64 cm) tall, with <b>horse-head</b> handles on each side and an ornate silver horseshoe on top.|$|R
5000|$|This genre {{is called}} [...] "Long song" [...] (Urtyn duu) because each {{syllable}} of text is extended {{for a long}} duration. A four-minute song may only consist of ten words. Lyrical themes vary depending on context; they can be philosophical, religious, romance, or celebratory, and often use horses as a symbol or theme repeated throughout the song. Eastern Mongols typically use a morin khuur (<b>horse-head</b> fiddle) as accompaniment, sometimes with a type of indigenous flute named limbe. Oirat groups of the Western Mongols typically sing long songs unaccompanied or accompanied with the igil.|$|R
2500|$|... "Here I {{set up a}} níð-pole, {{and declare}} this níð against King Erik and Queen Gunnhildr", [...] he turned the <b>horse-head</b> to face the {{mainland}} [...] "I declare this níð at the land-spirits there, and the land itself, so that all will fare astray, not to hold nor find their places, not until they wreak King Erik and Gunnhild from the land." [...] He set up the pole of níð in the cliff-face and left it standing; he faced the horse's eyes on the land, and he rist runes upon the pole, and said all the formal words of the curse.|$|R
5000|$|Not all of {{the figures}} {{identified}} as prehistoric art are in fact human made. An example given by archaeologists Paul Bahn and Paul Pettitt is the 'horse-head', Which they say is [...] ""highly visible and resembles a heavily maned <b>horse-head...</b> lacks any trace of work: it {{is a combination of}} erosion, black stains for the head, and natural burrow cast reliefs for the mane." [...] Others are a 'bison-head' which they think may be natural and a 'bear' image which [...] "lacks any evidence of human work." [...] Notwithstanding they believe that more figures may be discovered in the future.|$|R
60|$|Now Gizur, Ospakar's son, and Swanhild, Atli's widow, rode {{fast and}} hard from Mosfell, giving no rest to their horses, {{and with them}} rode that thrall who had showed the secret path to Gizur. They stayed a while on <b>Horse-Head</b> Heights till the moon rose. Now one path led hence to the shore that is against the Westmans, where Gudruda's ship lay bound. Then Swanhild turned to the thrall. Her {{beautiful}} face was fierce and she had said few words all this while, but in her heart raged a fire of hate and jealousy which shone through her blue eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is the truth, then: Swanhild the Fatherless, Atli's wife, {{has always}} sought my love, {{and she has}} ever hated Gudruda whom I loved. From a child she has striven to work {{mischief}} between us. Ay, and she did this, though till now it has been hidden: she strove to murder Gudruda; {{it was on the}} day that Skallagrim and I overcame Ospakar and his band on <b>Horse-Head</b> Heights. She thrust Gudruda from the brink of Golden Falls while she sat looking on the waters, and as she hung there I dragged her back. Is it not so, Gudruda?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well spoken, Blacktooth," [...] laughed Eric. [...] "I {{waited for}} such words from thee. Thrice have we striven together--once out yonder in the snow, once on <b>Horse-Head</b> Heights, and once by Westman Isles--and still we live {{to tell the}} tale. Come down, Ospakar: come down from that soft seat of thine and here and now let us {{put it to the}} proof who is the better man. When we met before, the stake was Whitefire set against my eye. Now the stake is our lives and fair Gudruda's hand. Talk no more, Ospakar, but fall to it." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s Yadamsüren {{moved away}} from European oil {{painting}} techniques and turned to flat, solid colours in gouache, reminiscent of earlier Buddhist art. He also began to explore a greater diversity of subjects - not just revolutionary and patriotic, but figures from Mongolia's earlier history, and scenes from everyday pastoral life. This neotraditional style became known as Mongol zurag and Yadamsüren {{is considered one of}} its pioneers. His 1958 work The Old Fiddler (Өвгөн хуурч), depicting an old man holding a morin khuur (<b>horse-head</b> fiddle), is credited with bringing the style to national audience. It remains one of Mongolia's most frequently reproduced paintings.|$|R
5000|$|... "Here I {{set up a}} níð-pole, {{and declare}} this níð against King Eiríkr and Queen Gunnhildr," [...] - he turned the <b>horse-head</b> to face the {{mainland}} - [...] "I declare this níð at the land-spirits there, and the land itself, so that all will fare astray, not to hold nor find their places, not until they wreak King Eiríkr and Gunnhildr from the land." [...] He set up the pole of níð in the cliff-face and left it standing; he faced the horse's eyes on the land, and he carved runes upon the pole, and said all the formal words of the curse. (ch. 57).|$|R
50|$|Bronze Roman buckles came {{in various}} types. Not only used for {{practical}} purposes, these buckles were also decorated. A Type I Roman buckle was a “buckle-plate” either decorated or plain {{and consisted of}} geometric ornaments. Type IA Roman buckles were similar to Type I buckles but differed by being long and narrow, made of double sheet metal, and attached to small D-shaped buckles (primarily had dolphin-heads as decorations). Type IB “buckle-loops” were even more similar to Type IA buckles, only difference being that instead of dolphin-heads, they were adorned with <b>horse-heads.</b> There were also Type II buckles (Type IIA and Type IIB) used by Romans, but all types of Roman buckles could have served purposes for simple clothing as well, and predominantly, as a military purpose.|$|R
