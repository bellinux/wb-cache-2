5|$|The first {{evidence}} of {{presence of a}} neutralizing substance in the blood that could counter infections came when Emil von Behring along with Kitasato Shibasaburō in 1890 developed effective serum against diphtheria. This they did by transferring serum produced from animals immunized against diphtheria to animals suffering from it. Transferring the serum thus could cure the <b>infected</b> <b>animals.</b> Behring was awarded the Nobel Prize for this work in 1901.|$|E
5|$|In April 2004, Farmer {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a committee to study the effectiveness of state owned and operated farmer's markets. In June 2005, he was elected secretary of the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture; in 2007, he was elected president of the organization. Farmer also sought to prevent an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis virus in the state's horses and cattle by banning the import of animals from 20 western counties where the virus was known to have <b>infected</b> <b>animals.</b> On Farmer's advice, Governor Ernie Fletcher requested that the United States Department of Agriculture designate Kentucky as an agricultural disaster area after an April 2007 cold snap devastated the state's fruit and wheat crops; the designation made Kentucky farmers eligible for low-interest federal loans to help compensate for their lost crop revenue.|$|E
5|$|In June 1904, {{during the}} experiments, Zammit {{learned that a}} Maltese family of five members became {{simultaneously}} ill after consuming fresh unpasteurized milk from goats. Zammit decided to purchase healthy goats and tested them, {{and at one point}} also kept them {{on the first floor of}} the Castellania (then known as the public health building or the variants). Zammit was successful in the discovery of the disease. David Bruce, who led the MFC, discouraged the experiments when proposed by Zammit. However, when the experiment concluded in the discovery, Bruce tried to discredit Zammit by taking the merit for himself. Information about the role of Zammit was kept low profile or ignored. The fever was renamed after Bruce, as brucellosis. The MFC managed to find cure and ways to eradicate the fever, but had a hard time since there was lack of cooperation with sellers and consumers of milk, some dismissing or ignoring the finding. It was under control by 1938, with the enforcement of standard procedures of pasteurizing milk. However, slaughtering of <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> continued throughout the 20th century and there was another rising challenge for the department in 1994 and 1995.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease is}} caused by the RVF virus, which is of the Phlebovirus type.

5|$|Endoparasites {{known to}} infect wolves include {{protozoan}}s and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thorny-headed worms). Of 30,000 protozoan species, {{only a few}} have been recorded to infect wolves: Isospora, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Babesia, and Giardia. Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> being 3–13 {{times more likely to}} miscarry than those not infected. Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is Alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, Alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little. Metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and emaciation. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition. Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas. Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause hyperchromic anemia, emaciation, diarrhea, and possibly death. Toxocara canis, a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100cm. D. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy. Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates. Although T. spiralis isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: Nicolla skrjabini, Macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and Moniliformis moniliformis.|$|E

25|$|Animal trypanosomiasis, {{also called}} nagana when {{it occurs in}} bovine cattle or horses or sura when it occurs in {{domestic}} pigs, is caused by several trypanosome species. These diseases reduce the growth rate, milk productivity, and strength of farm animals, generally leading to the eventual death of the <b>infected</b> <b>animals.</b> Certain species of cattle are called trypanotolerant because they can survive and grow even when infected with trypanosomes although they also have lower productivity rates when infected.|$|E

25|$|In {{northern}} Europe, the fly lays its eggs in sheep wool. The larvae then migrate {{down the}} wool where they feed {{directly on the}} skin surface. This can cause massive lesions and secondary bacterial infections. In the UK, blow fly strike affects an estimated 1 million sheep, as well as 80% of sheep farms each year. This causes a huge economic impact in these regions. Not only does it cost money to treat <b>infected</b> <b>animals,</b> but measures also {{must be taken to}} control L. sericata.|$|E
25|$|In {{some areas}} special control {{programs}} {{are in place}} or have been planned. The types of control measures depend on the setting (such as epidemiologic, ecologic, and cultural factors). Strict control of the growth and sale of watercress and other edible water plants is important. Individual people can protect themselves by not eating raw watercress and other water plants, especially from endemic grazing areas. Travelers to areas with poor sanitation should avoid food and water that might be contaminated (tainted). Vegetables grown in fields, {{that might have been}} irrigated with polluted water, should be thoroughly cooked, as should viscera from potentially <b>infected</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{dog that}} {{successfully}} recovers from CPV2 generally remains contagious {{for up to}} three weeks, but it is possible they may remain contagious for up to six. Ongoing infection risk is primarily from fecal contamination of the environment due to the virus's ability to survive many months in the environment. Neighbours and family members with dogs should be notified of <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> so that they can ensure that their dogs are vaccinated or tested for immunity. The vaccine will take up to 2 weeks to reach effective levels of immunity; the contagious individual should remain in quarantine until other animals are protected.|$|E

30|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{have great}} impact on human and animals life, which are always aroused by viruses, parasites, bacteria, fungi, and some microorganisms with pathogen. These diseases spread to human (or animals) with directly or indirectly ways. There are significant data showing that many infectious diseases spread with mediums, such as Measles, Dengue fever, Plague, Hydrophobia, and so on. Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) is an important mosquito-borne viral zoonsis in North Africa and Kenya, which {{is a member of}} the Phlebovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. RVFV was first discovered in Kenya in the early 1930 s [1]. RVFV is spread by either touching <b>infected</b> <b>animal</b> blood, breathing in the air around an <b>infected</b> <b>animal</b> being butchered, drinking raw milk from an <b>infected</b> <b>animal,</b> or the bite of <b>infected</b> mosquitoes. <b>Animals</b> such as cows, sheep, goats, and camels may be affected [2, 3].|$|R
25|$|The {{transmission}} from swine {{to humans}} {{is believed to}} occur mainly in swine farms, where farmers are {{in close contact with}} live pigs. Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans, this may occasionally happen, so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face masks when dealing with <b>infected</b> <b>animals.</b> The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swine-to-human transmission. Risk factors that may contribute to swine-to-human transmission include smoking and, especially, not wearing gloves when working with sick animals, thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose or hand-to-mouth transmission.|$|E
25|$|The disease nagana or African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) causes gradual health {{decline in}} {{infected}} livestock, reduces milk and meat production, increases abortion rates, and animals eventually {{succumb to the}} disease (annual cattle deaths caused by trypanosomiasis are estimated at 3 million). This has {{an enormous impact on}} the livelihood of farmers who live in tsetse-infested areas, as <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> cannot be used to plough the land, and keeping cattle is only feasible when the animals are kept under constant prophylactic treatment with trypanocidal drugs, often with associated problems of drug resistance, counterfeited drugs, and suboptimal dosage. The overall annual direct lost potential in livestock and crop production was estimated at US$4.5 billion.|$|E
25|$|The {{first report}} of {{suspected}} iatrogenic CJD {{was published in}} 1974. Animal experiments showed that corneas of <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> could transmit CJD, and the causative agent spreads along visual pathways. A second case of CJD associated with a corneal transplant was reported without details. In 1977, CJD transmission caused by silver electrodes previously used in the brain of a person with CJD was first reported. Transmission occurred despite decontamination of the electrodes with ethanol and formaldehyde. Retrospective studies identified four other cases likely of similar cause. The rate of transmission from a single contaminated instrument is unknown, {{although it is not}} 100%. In some cases, the exposure occurred weeks after the instruments were used on a person with CJD.|$|E
50|$|An {{epidemiological}} investigation {{can be done}} {{to determine}} a patient's exposure to raw infected meat. Often, an infection arises from home-preparation of contaminated meat, in which case microscopy of the meat may be used to determine the infection. Exposure determination {{does not have to be}} directly from a laboratory-confirmed <b>infected</b> <b>animal.</b> Indirect exposure criteria include the consumption of products from a laboratory-confirmed <b>infected</b> <b>animal,</b> or sharing of a common exposure with a laboratory-confirmed infected human.|$|R

25|$|Pasteurization {{was first}} used in the United States in the 1890s after the {{discovery}} of germ theory to control the hazards of highly contagious bacterial diseases, including bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, that could be easily transmitted to humans through the drinking of raw milk. Initially after the scientific discovery of bacteria, no product testing was available {{to determine if a}} farmer's milk was safe or infected, so all milk had to be treated as potentially contagious. After the first test was developed, some farmers actively worked to prevent their <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> from being killed and removed from food production, or would falsify the test results so that their animals would appear to be free of infection.|$|E
25|$|Humans can be {{infected}} with foot-and-mouth disease through contact with <b>infected</b> <b>animals,</b> {{but this is}} extremely rare. Some cases were caused by laboratory accidents. Because {{the virus that causes}} FMD is sensitive to stomach acid, it cannot spread to humans via consumption of infected meat, except in the mouth before the meat is swallowed. In the UK, the last confirmed human case occurred in 1966, and only a few other cases have been recorded in countries of continental Europe, Africa, and South America. Symptoms of FMD in humans include malaise, fever, vomiting, red ulcerative lesions (surface-eroding damaged spots) of the oral tissues, and sometimes vesicular lesions (small blisters) of the skin. According to a newspaper report, FMD killed two children in England in 1884, supposedly due to infected milk.|$|E
25|$|Control of {{outbreaks}} requires coordinated medical services, {{alongside a}} certain level of community engagement. The medical services include rapid detection of cases of disease, contact tracing of those who have come into contact with infected individuals, quick access to laboratory services, proper healthcare for those who are infected, and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial. Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution. Prevention includes limiting the spread of disease from <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> to humans. This may be done by handling potentially infected bushmeat only while wearing protective clothing and by thoroughly cooking it before eating it. It also includes wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease. No specific treatment or vaccine for the virus is available, although a number of potential treatments are being studied. Supportive efforts, however, improve outcomes. This includes either oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids as well as treating symptoms.|$|E
