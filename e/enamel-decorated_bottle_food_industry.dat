The results showed that both countries´ <b>food</b> <b>industries</b> improved energy efficiency. During the period of study, energy consumption in the German <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> increased by an average of 1. 3 % per year and the energy intensity decreased 7 %, whereas the Colombian <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> decreased its energy consumption by an average of 1. 9 % per the year and the energy intensity decreased 11 %. However, Colombian <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> needs 2. 2 times more energy than German <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> to produce a unit of gross production. A decomposition analysis indicated that economic and technical factors have {{played an important role in}} the energy efficiency performance because increases in economic growth and technology improvements increase the industrial sector´s ability to improve energy efficiency. A second-stage empirical analysis revealsthat capital, material, investments and value added variables had a positive influence on energy efficiency performance in both countries.

Considering that the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> is not one industry but a collection of several types of industry producing a diverse range of products and employing a varied range of processes, a <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> classification system is proposed {{on the basis of}} visits to various food plants and the available literature. To investigate specific issues pertaining to the adoption of lean concepts in the <b>food</b> <b>industry,</b> a multiple case study research strategy approach is selected for the research investigation. This research investigation includes fifteen case studies. Except for one case study of a vehicle plant the rest of the case studies relate to food manufacturing plants. The case study of a vehicle assembly plant was selected in order to undertake a comparison with the <b>food</b> <b>industry.</b> The fourteen <b>food</b> manufacturing plants and the one vehicle assembly plant have been studied through a visit tour together with interviews, documentation and a questionnaire. Each case study has been described with regard to product, market, raw materials and process aspects of a plant. Subsequently the case studies have been assessed {{in order to understand the}} degree of leanness by examining the status of lean practices. All the cases pertaining to the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> were mapped on the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> classification scheme to identify specific <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> types of each of the food plants. It is observed that the lean model widely adopted in a discrete manufacturing environment, particularly automotive, is not applicable as such in the food sector. Therefore, a lean approach consisting of lean principles, lean practices and lean vision has been suggested for continuous, batch and assembly type of the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> which would enable <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> to stay competitive. The major contributions of this research are, the development of a lean manufacturing framework consisting of goals, principles and practices which can be used to assess the leanness of any manufacturing plant, the development of a <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> classification system which would help researchers and managers to better understand the specificity of the production systems, an investigation of issues pertaining to the use and applicability of lean manufacturing in the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> to help the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> take advantage of operational improvement initiatives to stay competitive in today's global market, the development of a lean approach comprising of lean principles, lean practices and lean vision for the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> which would enable the managers to transform their plants into lean plants...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-communicable {{diseases}} (NCDs) are {{the leading}} cause of mortality in Fiji, a middle-income country in the Pacific. Some food products processed sold and marketed by the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> are major contributors to the NCD epidemic, and the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> is widely identified as having strong economic and political power. However, little research has been undertaken on the attempts by the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> to influence public health-related policies and programs in its favour. The "corporate political activity" (CPA) of the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> includes six strategies (information and messaging; financial incentives; constituency building; legal strategies; policy substitution; opposition fragmentation and destabilisation). For this study, we aimed to gain a detailed understanding of the CPA strategies and practices of major <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> actors in Fiji, interpreted through a public health lens. METHODS AND RESULTS: We implemented a systematic approach to monitor the CPA of the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> in Fiji for three months. It consisted of document analysis of relevant publicly available information. In parallel, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 stakeholders involved in diet- and/or public health-related issues in Fiji. Both components of the study were thematically analysed. We found evidence that the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> adopted a diverse range of strategies in an attempt to influence public policy in Fiji, with all six CPA strategies identified. Participants identified that there is a substantial risk that the widespread CPA of the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> could undermine efforts to address NCDs in Fiji. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited public disclosure of information, such as data related to <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> donations to political parties and lobbying, we were able to identify many CPA practices used by the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> in Fiji. Greater transparency from the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> and the government would help strengthen efforts to increase their accountability and support NCD prevention. In other low- and middle-income countries, it is likely that a systematic document analysis approach would also need to be supplemented with key informant interviews to gain insight into this important influence on NCD prevention...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This study {{examines}} the global value chains of the Finnish <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> and aims {{to explain how}} value is created and distributed within the <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> value chains. The global value chains have been evolving greatly during the past decades due to the globalization, and these far more complex value chains pose challenges for both economies and the corporate world to understand value creation and distribution. This study aims to address the research gap of empirical results on global value chains, {{but at the same}} time provide managerially significant industry information. The results should help to understand the functioning of global value chains in the Finnish <b>food</b> <b>industry.</b> Research method: The research method for this thesis is qualitative with a single case study approach. Both qualitative and quantitative data is used, since data collection was carried out through semi-structured interviews and data bases. Results: The main results of this study comprise of four important findings. First finding is the identification of the value chain participants (on broad level) in a Finnish <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> value chain, which are the primary sector, refiners of raw materials, <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> companies, and distribution. Second finding was that the most value of these value chain participants is created in the downstream of the value chain by distribution and <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> companies, whereas upstream of the value chain is capturing less value due to the low value adding activities performed. Third finding was that Finnish companies create nearly all the value created in the Finnish <b>food</b> <b>industry.</b> Fourth, the Finnish <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> remains very traditional, where the impacts of globalization are so far experienced only to some extent.
