50|$|The current {{terminal}} building {{was built in}} two phases. The first phase was completed in 1980. The second phase, or the expansion phase, was constructed because of increased passenger volumes {{and the arrival of}} new air carriers. In 1985, a separate International Terminal was built to the south in order to accommodate the Federal Inspection Services necessary for international travelers to access the United States; it is connected to the main terminal through a covered walkway. The main terminal is approximately 26,000 square feet and includes three levels, the basement, the ground floor, and the second floor. The basement houses a small storage facility; the ground floor is where the entire passenger processing area is held, and the second floor contains office space. There is one concession stand: Halibut Henry's store where light snacks, coffee drinks, gifts, and sundries are offered. The International Terminal is a one-level building consisting of 4,222 square feet. It serves several functions including the housing of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service,</b> FIS offices, and the storage of BLI's Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting equipment.|$|E

50|$|GIPSA's <b>Federal</b> Grain <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> (FGIS) {{establishes}} the Official Standards for Grain, {{which are used}} each day by sellers and buyers to communicate the type and quality of grain bought and sold.

Finally, the program provides for the impartial application of these grades and standards through a network of federal, state, and private inspection agencies known as the official system. The <b>Federal</b> Grain <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> (FGIS) was established by Congress in 1976 to manage the national grain inspection system, which was established in 1916, and to institute a national grain weighing program. The goal of creating a single <b>federal</b> grain <b>inspection</b> entity was to ensure development and maintenance of uniform U.S. standards, to develop inspection and weighing procedures for grain in domestic and export trade, and to facilitate grain marketing.|$|R

(Concourses A, B, and C are housed in the McNamara Terminal) The concourse has 26 gates, two of which opened {{in the middle of}} 2009 to accommodate international wide-body aircraft. The two gates were unusable at the building's opening because they were extremely close to Smith Terminal's C Concourse, which was demolished after operations moved to the new facility.

BE was more prevalent during the month of March (1. 6) and markedly reduced during May (- 2). A possible seasonal predominance of BE was identified: comparatively fewer cases occurred from April to August, while there was a peak from December to March. The study indicates that bovine eurytrematosis is hypoendemic and occurs in almost all geographical regions of the State of Paraná.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to verify the effect of {{conventional}} air chilling associated to intermittent spray-chilling treatment, on weight loss, physico-chemical and bacteriological quality of beef carcasses. Two plants of commercial beef slaughterhouse located in Goiânia and fiscalized by the <b>Federal</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Service</b> were used to develop the research. The spray-chilling treatment was accomplished in an intermittent way, commanded by a controlled logical program, with cycles of 90 seconds, in intervals of 30 minutes, during the first 4 hours of the chilling process.

The average values of carcasses weight loss of treatment group were lower to the ones verified for the control group, in both plants, A and B, (P < 0, 001), showing a high economic potential. As a conclusion of physico-chemical and bacteriological analysis results of water and meat samples, it is clear that the technology of chilling beef carcasses in the conventional system associated to spraying did not interfere in the quality of meat, and it can become an analysis object on part of official organs for sanitary regulation and fiscalization, for its definitive adoption...|$|E
