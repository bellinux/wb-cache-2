40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} score, to stratify patients with acute cholecystitis into high, intermediate, or low probability of gangrenous cholecystitis. The probability of gangrenous cholecystitis (score) was derived from a logistic regression of a clinical and pathological review of 245 patients undergoing urgent cholecystectomy. Sixty-eight patients had <b>gangrenous</b> <b>inflammation,</b> 132 acute, and 45 no inflammation. The score comprised of: age &# 62; 45 years (1 point), heart rate &# 62; 90 &#x 2009;beats/min (1 point), male (2 points), Leucocytosis &# 62; 13, 000 /mm 3 (1. 5 points), and ultrasound gallbladder wall thickness &#x 003 E; 4. 5 &#x 2009;mm (1 point). The prevalence of gangrenous cholecystitis was 13 &# 37; in the low-probability (0 &# 8211; 2 points), 33 &# 37; in the intermediate-probability (2 &# 8211; 4. 5 points), and 87 &# 37; in the high probability category (&#x 003 E; 4. 5 points). A cutoff score of 2 identified 31 (69 &# 37;) patients with no acute inflammation (PPV 90 &# 37;). This scoring system can prioritize patients for emergent cholecystectomy based on their expected pathology...|$|E

The prevalence of gangrenous cholecystitis was 13 % in the low-probability (0 – 2 points), 33 % in the intermediate-probability (2 – 4. 5 points), and 87 % in the high probability category (> 4. 5 points).

50|$|Celis {{was born}} into a Creole family. At a young age he moved to the Guatemalan capital to receive the best {{possible}} education of the time. In 1794 he enrolled at the Tridentino School. On the 16 of August 1800 he received the rank of Bachelor of Medicine at the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala from which he received his master's degree, finally graduating on 11-12 August 1802. His master's degree was partly achieved by his essays and new ideas for the treatment and evolution of <b>gangrenous</b> <b>inflammations.</b> He married Ana Andrade Canes, a relative of Jose Simeón Canes.|$|R
30|$|A 101 -year-old woman (145  cm, 45.2  kg) was {{diagnosed}} with grade I (mild) acute cholecystitis with gallstones. Although she had a 2 -day history of right upper abdominal quadrant pain, Murphy’s sign was not seen. She had a fever (37.7  °C) and elevated C-reactive protein (24.3  mg/dl), {{white blood cell count}} (15, 520 /mm 3), total bilirubin (1.4  mg/dl), and blood urea nitrogen (28.2  mg/dl). Gallbladder distention, pericholecystic fat stranding, and gallbladder wall thickening were seen on computed tomography. She did not show any signs of organ dysfunction or grade II (moderate) acute cholecystitis. Markedly elevated white blood cell count (> 18, 000 /mm 3), palpable tender mass in the right upper abdominal quadrant, duration of complaints > 72  h, and marked local <b>inflammation</b> (<b>gangrenous</b> cholecystitis, pericholecystic abscess, hepatic abscess, biliary peritonitis, emphysematous cholecystitis) are considered as signs of grade II (moderate) acute cholecystitis [7]. She was able to walk with a cane without help. She did not need any supports with eating, bathing, dressing, and toileting. An emergency LC was scheduled. Preoperative gallbladder drainage was not performed. Pre-anesthetic examination of the patient showed that she was taking telmisartan 30  mg and losartan 50  mg daily for hypertension. The patient’s laboratory data showed that she had mild coagulopathy (prothrombin time international normalized ratio of 1.46 and activated partial thromboplastin time of 42  s), anemia (hemoglobin concentration of 11.8  g/dl), thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 103, 000 /μl), and decreased renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30.7  ml/min/ 1.73  m 2). We considered that the patient had an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of II. We planned general anesthesia with TAPB to avoid hemodynamic instability and to reduce opioid dosage.|$|R
