5|$|Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand {{genealogy}} {{of modern}} humanity, rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and hypothesis. Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – it <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the trouble of reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade has {{put it all together}} as a single compelling story. This is a brilliant book, by one of our best science journalists.|$|E

The Bump can be climbed using the North Norfolk Coastal Path from either the east or west, and <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the climb. From the top, there are views of the surrounding land and sea. Each Easter, the combined churches in the area make a pilgrimage carrying a cross {{to the top of}} Beeston Bump, and an open-air service takes place.|$|E

This part of the coastline is reputed to be the stalking ground of Legendary hellhound Black Shuck. And so on to Cromer and the Parish Church of St Peter and Saint Paul. The tower {{of the church is}} 160ft high and <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> a visit and also marks the end of Paston Way. The path links with the North Norfolk Coastal Path/Peddars Way and the UK National Trails Network.|$|E

25|$|The King {{knew that}} he had to take Paris if he stood any chance of ruling all of France. This, however, was no easy task. The Catholic League's presses and {{supporters}} continued to spread stories about atrocities committed against Catholic priests and the laity in Protestant England (see Forty Martyrs of England and Wales). The city prepared to fight to the death rather than accept a Calvinist king. The Battle of Ivry, fought on March 14, 1590, was another victory for the king, and Henry's forces went on to lay siege to Paris, but the siege was broken by Spanish support. Realising that his predecessor had been right {{and that there was no}} prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in Catholic Paris, Henry reputedly uttered the famous phrase Paris vaut bien une messe (Paris <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> a mass). He was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1593 and was crowned at Chartres in 1594.|$|E
500|$|The {{church is}} still used for worship by the Church in Wales, {{and is one}} of five churches in a {{combined}} benefice. It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to [...] "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them", because it is a [...] "simple rural church built on Medieval foundations".

[...] "This evil book is now issued in pretty-pretty expurgated editions, but it <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> reading in the original version.

Mr. Fairchild, for instance, when he catches his children quarrelling, first thrashes them, reciting Dr. Watts's 'Let dogs delight to bark and bite' between blows of the cane, and then takes them to spend the afternoon beneath a gibbet where the rotting corpse of a murderer is hanging.".|$|E

500|$|Samuel Lewis {{said that}} the church, which he {{described}} as [...] "a plain edifice", was [...] "beautifully situated near a small lake, and surrounded with pleasing scenery". The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church on 4 September 1867. [...] He {{said that the}} church [...] "has been so completely modernised, that it is doubtful whether any original feature remains but the bell-gable and one single light window in the north wall". He said that the font was of [...] "singular design": [...] "octagonal, swelling downwards and each face concave." [...] He {{also said that the}} site was [...] "wild and striking."

500|$|The {{novel was}} well {{received}} by most readers and critics. Two months after publication, all 210,000 {{copies of the}} first printing had been sold. The New York Times published two positive reviews of the book: Basil Davenport compared Clarke to Olaf Stapledon, C. S. Lewis, and H. G. Wells, a [...] "very small group of writers who have used science fiction as the vehicle of philosophic ideas." [...] William DuBois called the book [...] "a first rate tour de force that <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the attention of every thoughtful citizen {{in this age of}} anxiety." [...] Don Guzman of the Los Angeles Times admired the novel for its suspense, wisdom, and beauty. He compared Clarke's role as a writer to that of an artist, [...] "a master of sonorous language, a painter of pictures in futuristic colors, a Chesley Bonestell with words". Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin called the novel [...] "a formidably impressive job...a continuous kaleidoscope of the unexpected." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{review for}} The Guardian, Phelim O'Neill {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "the ultimate undead movie", praising its commitment to gory scenes and convincing effects. O'Neill felt that the film stood {{the passage of time}} well, and explained that this was [...] "because it delivers, plain and simple". He also highlighted Frizzi's work on the score, and summed the film up as [...] "a real influence on what followed". Anne Billson, writing for The Daily Telegraph in 2013, included Zombi 2 in her list of the top ten zombie films, describing its opening scenes as [...] "sublimely creepy" [...] and the eye-gouging scene as [...] "memorably nasty". Writing for the Daily Mirror, James Kloda praised Fulci's directing, finding that he consistently made evocative use of particular shots to accentuate the film's action or horror. Kloda felt that the film [...] "can often blind with its shock violence but <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the look".|$|E

500|$|Overseas, {{the film}} {{received}} positive reviews. Russel Edwards of Variety reviewed, [...] "Debuting helmer Karan Malhotra stokes up a fiery revenge tale in Agneepath, an expensively pumped-up, relentlessly energetic retelling of the 1990 Amitabh Bachchan cult {{favorite of the}} same name. Toplining Bollywood hunk Hrithik Roshan and veteran actor Sanjay Dutt donning the hat as the antagonist, this dynamic Hindi action extravaganza boosts its potent story with an aggressive style that will ensure audiences feel every blow." [...] Farah Andrews of Gulf News praised the film while saying, [...] "Fans of the 1990 original starring Amitabh Bachchan and Danny Denzongpa as Vijay and Kancha may be wary about the remake, but take it from us, the revamped flick <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> a watch." [...] Rabina A. Khan of The First Post wrote, [...] "Director Karan Malhotra has made an impressive film under the able guidance of his mentor, Karan Johar.

500|$|Wario World {{received}} fairly positive reviews. The US {{version of}} Play magazine gave the game a perfect score, and the reviewer commented that Wario World [...] "pays off every second [...] holding the controller, and that, to , is greatness".

The American-based publication Game Informer praised the game for including [...] "droves of awesome boss battles". Matt Casamassina of IGN declared that Wario World had [...] "some great control mechanics and inventive level work". Electronic Gaming Monthlys Greg Ford said, [...] "Wario [...] delivers a great time while it lasts and <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> checking out. Just don't expect a Mario-quality adventure".

500|$|Bernard Perusse of The Gazette {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "more superficial but more positive" [...] than the 2006 biography [...] by Johnny Rogan.

[...] Writing for The Irish Times, John Boland was critical of the book's text but wrote positively of its images: [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now, has a trite, fanzine style text and isn't very informative about the great man, but it has some splendid pictures and in its coffee table format <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the asking price". A review in the Herald Sun was critical: [...] "Too Late To Stop Now is more suited to the coffee table than a library shelf. It is browsing material, fleshed with snapshots, album covers, PR shots, posters and prints. The words are mere stitches, there to hold the pictures in place." [...] The Herald Sun noted that the author left out critical quotes from individuals that knew Van Morrison, and questioned Turner's objectivity.|$|E

GamesRadar editor Henry Gilbert praised Kadabra and Alakazam's mustaches, listing them on their list of [...] "The 10 {{greatest}} mustaches in gaming history". GamesRadar editor Brett Elston labelled Abra's moveset [...] "lame", while acknowledging its potential to evolve into more powerful Pokémon. However, he claimed that Alakazam was [...] "useful" [...] only in [...] "limited" [...] circumstances. Elston also called Alakazam one of the [...] "most disturbing" [...] Pokémon of all time for the game's assertion that its brain cells [...] "continually multiply" [...] until it dies a horrible death. In a poll conducted by IGN, Kadabra was voted as the 91st best Pokémon, where it was called [...] "much cooler" [...] than Alakazam because [...] "He doesn't need to show off by bending two spoons". Alakazam was voted as the 20th best Pokémon, where the staff commented on the evolution line, stating they [...] "not only loved the clever naming system but the creatures' designs and abilities as well".

[...] Lacroix also commented [...] "If you missed it, get the replay. Don't think, just do it [...] the main event <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the price." [...] The main event was given Lacroix's highest match rating of 10 out of 10 in his review. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10, while a 7 out of 10 {{was given to the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship contest. Commenting on the main event, Lacroix spoke of it as a [...] "certified match of the year candidate." [...] Going onto describe in detail: [...] "Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event, featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title. Now, this is the part where I go into a detail review of the match, but I'm not going to that. Fact is there is no review that could do justice in describing just how stellar this bout was."

500|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth {{received}} generally favorable reviews, but {{was also}} often criticized for being buggy and inaccessible for many players because of its high difficulty. GameSpy ranked it as the tenth best game of E3 2004 while GameSpot nominated it for their [...] "Most Surprisingly Good Game of 2005" [...] award, with a comment that [...] "after a development cycle that was nearing infinity, it's {{hard to imagine a}} world where this H.P. Lovecraft-based horror game turned out all right. Luckily for us, we don't have to imagine it." [...] According to IGN, the game [...] "succeeds brilliantly in some areas," [...] making [...] "great use of the source material" [...] and forcing players [...] "to accept some realistic responsibility for their character" [...] due to the sanity system and HUD-less display, but can make the players [...] "cringe at the difficult nature of the game." [...] Greg Kasavin of GameSpot opined [...] "a thick, unsettling atmosphere fills this ambitious first-person action-adventure, which makes up for some frustrating moments and dated graphics with plenty of chills, variety, and originality." [...] Cheat Code Central's Cole Smith called it [...] "one of the greatest book to game translations ever" [...] and a game [...] "that is full of twists, turns and incredibly wonderful scary surprises. It's got a great atmosphere which is sustained by dark and grainy graphics, chilling sound effects and an incredibly improbable storyline that is treated properly as to suspend reality from creeping in and ruining your experience." [...] GameSpy's Allen Rausch wrote [...] "this disturbing slice of Lovecraft's America <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>worth</b> the time to visit," [...] as [...] "despite the occasional missteps, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a more than fitting tribute to its literary inspiration." [...] Similarly, Kyle Williams of Gaming Target called it [...] "a labor of love" [...] that [...] "defies convention in favor of creating a videogame experience that is a worthy heir to the Lovecraft name." [...] Team Xbox's Matthew Fisher wrote that, despite some of the game's various shortcomings regarding the graphics and some of the detective aspects, [...] "this is an immersive experience that is a new and unique title for the Xbox, which is more than a welcome change. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely." [...] Despite the mostly positive reviews, the game was a commercial failure.|$|E

500|$|Some {{reception}} of the film, however, was much more positive, in particular by reviewers for horror outlets. Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave it two-and-half out of four skulls, while Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting gave it {{four out of five}} skulls, stating it [...] "isn’t a movie meant to scare or make you think but {{it is one of the}} most entertaining and enjoyable movies of its kind that I’ve seen in years."

[...] Cinema Blend's Sean O'Connell stated that the film is [...] "often mean and nasty, but that's really its saving grace." [...] Peter Paras of E! recommended this [...] "super violent, pretty funny flick" [...] for how it [...] "revels in the mayhem". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe, giving the film three out of five stars, called it a [...] "splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun." [...] Jonathon Natsis of Filmink wrote: [...] "Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory...big on blood-soaked entertainment and low on pretension." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave it four out of five stars, stating: [...] "This has all the elements of a classic action flick, and it's destined for cult status. Welcome to the most fun movie of 2013." [...] DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich summed up: [...] "Is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters a good movie? Probably not. At least not in any way that is defensible by regular critical standards. Is it a hell of a good time? Absolutely so. Unabashedly so. That's all it wants to be." ...|$|E
