40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the use of}} flow cytometry as a high-throughput quantifiable technique to study multicomponent adsorption interactions between proteins and surfaces. Flow cytometry offers the advantage of high-throughput analysis of multiple parameters on a very small sampling scale. This enables flow cytometry to distinguish between <b>individual</b> <b>adsorbent</b> particles <b>and</b> <b>adsorbate</b> components within a suspension. As a proof of concept study, the adsorption of three proteinssbovine serum albumin (BSA), bovine immunoglobulin gamma (IgG) and fibrinogensonto five surfacemodified organosilica microsphere surfaces {{was used as a}} model multicomponent system for analysis. By uniquely labeling each protein and solid support type with spectrally distinguishable fluorescent dyes, the adsorption process could be “multiplexed” allowing for simultaneous screening of multiple <b>adsorbate</b> (protein) <b>and</b> <b>adsorbent</b> (particle surface) interactions. Protein adsorption experiments quantified by flow cytometry were found to be comparable to single-component adsorption studies by solution depletion. Quantitative distribution of the simultaneous competitive adsorption of BSA and IgG indicated that, at concentrations below surface saturation, both proteins adsorbed onto the surface. However, at concentrations greater than surface saturation, BSA preferentially adsorbed. Multiplexed particle suspensions of optically encoded particles were modified to produce a positively and negatively charged surface, a grafted 3400 MW poly(ethylene glycol) layer, or a physisorbed BSA or IgG layer. It was observed that adsorption was rapid and irreversible on all of the surfaces, and preadsorbed protein layers were the most effective in preventing further protein adsorption...|$|R

30|$|Initial dye {{concentration}} and contact time Maximum dye removal efficiency is obtained at low {{concentration and}} high contact time (Fig.  5 e).

30|$|Adsorption isotherms usually {{describe}} {{the performance of}} adsorbents in adsorption processes by describing the surface interaction between the <b>adsorbent</b> <b>and</b> <b>adsorbate</b> [49]. There are various isotherm models used to {{describe the}} adsorption processes. In this study, the two most common used adsorption isotherms, namely, Langmuir isotherm [50, 51] and Freundlich isotherm [52], are employed.|$|R
30|$|The {{study of}} {{adsorption}} isotherms {{is imperative to}} describe the adsorption mechanism and so the interaction of metal ion on the adsorbent surface. The previous experiments permitted as to determine the optimal conditions relating to <b>adsorbent</b> <b>and</b> <b>adsorbate,</b> for the lead removal using the available pine sawdust: pH 5.42, N =  500  rpm, r =  10  g/L, d <  500  µm, without NaCl, contact time 90  min.|$|R
30|$|There is {{a slight}} {{decrease}} in the removal efficiency with the decrease in percentage composition of the saw dust {{in the production of}} filter elements; this might be due to the decrease in porosity of the ceramic filters.

30|$|The main {{adsorption}} mechanisms include chemisorption and physiosorption (Yagub et al. 2014). Chemisorption {{is characterized}} by strong intraparticle bonds between an exchange of electrons and molecules. This sorption is stable and irreversible. Physiosorption such as dipole–dipole, hydrogen bonds and π-π interaction {{is characterized by}} weak intraparticle bonds between <b>adsorbent</b> <b>and</b> <b>adsorbate.</b> Physiosorption is deemed to be unstable and reversible sorption (Yagub et al. 2014).|$|R

Dissociated and undissociated poly(acrylic acid) carboxyl groups can participate in the hydrogen bond formation with the activated carbon surface groups (especially those containing sulfur atoms).

The adsorption of hazelnut hull for Fe(III) was shown {{as a function of}} initial pH, <b>adsorbent</b> <b>and</b> <b>adsorbate</b> concentrations, temperature, <b>and</b> contact time.

30|$|The kinetic {{experimental}} data of bisacodyl adsorption process by mesoporous silica were well fited with pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic equation (R 2 [*]>[*] 0.9).

(2014), carbon nanotubes adsorption process for removing of antibiotics amoxicillin followed Langmuir isotherm and second order kinetic model (Samadi et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|The {{electrostatic}} attraction between the <b>adsorbent</b> <b>and</b> <b>adsorbate</b> occurs at pH 3. The dissociation of PAA functional groups at pH 3 is minimal, {{and for this}} reason, polymeric macromolecules assume a more coiled conformation. On the other hand, the surface of activated carbon is positively charged (point of zero charge of HPA is 7). Under such conditions, the structure of polymeric adsorption layer is characterized by considerable packing and as a result, the highest PAA adsorption level on the activated carbon surface is obtained.|$|R
30|$|These isotherms had an {{appearance}} reminiscent {{of those of}} the Langmuir adsorption isotherms. They provide a satisfactory linearization of retained amount, Q. This linearization was used to standardize the method of determining the maximum quantity Qm. It also provides the affinity constant, K, on which {{it is difficult to}} pronounce. In that order of size, the K values are at least comparable, suggesting that whatever the LDH mass used, the type of interaction between <b>adsorbent</b> <b>and</b> <b>adsorbate</b> is the same. However, the maximum adsorbed amount decreases when the mass of LDH is increased.|$|R
30|$|Primarily, the pseudo-second order {{model is}} based on the {{assumption}} that the rate-determining step may be chemisorptions, capitalizing on the exchange of electrons between <b>adsorbent</b> <b>and</b> <b>adsorbate</b> (Ho et al. 2000; Kula et al. 2008). Our results have favoured this kinetic model for NaOH-AC and KOH-AC, while the rest of the activated carbons did not agree with any monolinear model. This is notwithstanding the fact that the adsorption of Cd 2 + on activated carbons prepared using ZnCl 2 activation were earlier found to comply with the pseudo-second kinetic scheme.|$|R

Modified adsorbents were chemically characterized for their chemical composition and pHPZC (point of zero charge), while adsorption tests determined the best conditions of pH, <b>adsorbent</b> mass, <b>and</b> contact time between <b>adsorbent</b> <b>and</b> <b>adsorbate</b> {{in the process of}} removal of the metal ions. Isotherms obtained from the preliminary results were linearized by Langmuir’s and Freudlich’s models. The thermodynamic parameters, such as ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS, were also evaluated. The modifying solutions proposed were effective in the modification of <b>adsorbents</b> <b>and</b> resulted in high capacity sorption materials. Equilibrium time between <b>adsorbent</b> <b>and</b> <b>adsorbate</b> for the solutions contaminated with metals is about 40 minutes.

30|$|Adsorption {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied as a cost-effective method for removing {{a wide variety of}} hazardous materials, such as dyes and heavy metals, from aqueous solutions. The most widely used adsorbent for separating the pollutants is activated carbon. Most adsorption research focused on the isotherm, kinetic, and thermodynamic processes. For the adsorption process, an analysis of the isotherm data is important because the isotherms describe equilibrium relationships between <b>adsorbent</b> <b>and</b> <b>adsorbate,</b> usually the ratio between the quantity adsorbed and that remaining in the solution at a fixed temperature at equilibrium. The distribution of dye between the <b>adsorbent</b> <b>and</b> dye solution, when the system {{is in a state of}} equilibrium, is important in establishing the capacity of the adsorbent for the dye (Mall et al. 2006).

30|$|Many factors {{play role in}} the {{adsorption}} process. Temperature, for instance, is a key player. If the adsorption {{takes place}} through physical processes (physical adsorption) then increasing the temperature will desorb the adsorbed molecules from the pore of adsorbent.

The pH is another important factor that may affect the adsorption of pollutants {{on the surface of}} a surface adsorbent. The change in pH may affect both the status of the adsorbent by changing its surface charge enhancing or decreasing the adsorbability and also can affect the status of the adsorbate for example by hydrolysis or even precipitation.
