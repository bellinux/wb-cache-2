In the study, four kinds of blade profile were selected, that is, NACA 0020, NACA 0015, CA 9, and HSIM 15 - 262123 - 1576. The experiments have been carried out for two solidities, ÃÂƒ = 0. 48 and ÃÂƒ = 0. 64, under sinusoidal and <b>irregular</b> <b>unsteady</b> <b>flow</b> conditions based on Irish waves (site 2).

40|$|This article {{presents}} work {{carried out to}} predict {{the behavior of a}} 0. 6 m impulse turbine with fixed guide vanes as compared with that of a 0. 6 hub-to-tip ratio turbine under real sea conditions. In order to predict the true performance of the actual oscillating water column (OWC), the numerical technique was fine-tuned by incorporating the compressibility effect. Water surface elevation versus time history was used as the input data for this purpose. The effect of compressibility inside the air chamber and the turbine's performance under unsteady and irregular flow conditions were analyzed numerically. Considering the quasi-steady assumptions, the unidirectional steady-flow experimental data was used to simulate the turbines characteristics under <b>irregular</b> <b>unsteady</b> <b>flow</b> conditions. The results showed that the performance of this type of turbine is quite stable and that the efficiency of the air chamber and the mean conversion efficiency are reduced by around 8 % and 5 %, respectively, {{as a result of the}} compressibility inside the air chamber. The mean efficiencies of the OWC device and the impulse turbine were predicted for 1 month, based on the Irish wave climate, and it was found that the total time period of wave data used is one of the important factors in the simulation technique...|$|E

40|$|The <b>unsteady</b> {{convective}} <b>flow</b> {{effects in}} a transonic compressor rotor with a circumferential-groove casing treatment are investigated in this paper. Experimental {{results show that}} the circumferential-groove casing treatment increases the compressor stall margin by almost 50 % for the current transonic compressor rotor. Steady flow simulation of the current casing treatment, however, yields only a 15 % gain in stall margin. The flow field at near-stall operation is highly unsteady due to several self-induced flow phenomena. These include shock oscillation, vortex shedding at the trailing edge, and interaction between the passage shock and the tip clearance vortex. The primary focus of the current investigation is to assess the effects of <b>flow</b> unsteadiness and <b>unsteady</b> <b>flow</b> convection on the circumferential-groove casing treatment. Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques were applied in addition to steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) to simulate the flow field at near-stall operation and to determine changes in stall margin. The current investigation reveals that <b>unsteady</b> <b>flow</b> effects are as important as steady flow effects on the performance of the circumferential grooves casing treatment in extending the stall margin of the current transonic compressor rotor. The primary <b>unsteady</b> <b>flow</b> mechanism is <b>unsteady</b> <b>flow</b> injection from the grooves into the main flow near the casing. Flows moving {{into and out of the}} grooves are caused due to local pressure difference near the grooves. As the pressure field becomes transient due to self-induced flow oscillation, flow injection from the grooves also becomes <b>unsteady.</b> The <b>unsteady</b> <b>flow</b> simulation shows that this <b>unsteady</b> <b>flow</b> injection from the grooves is substantial and contributes significantly to extending the compressor stall margin. <b>Unsteady</b> <b>flows</b> into and out of the grooves have as large a role as steady flows in the circumferential grooves.
