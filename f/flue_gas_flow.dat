40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to clarify}} {{some aspects of}} the thermo-fluid dynamics of woody biomass <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> within the refractory twisted conduit inside heat accumulation stoves. These are traditional heating elements in the European Alpine regions, whose history began in the fifteenth century. The high temperature <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flows</b> in a twisted conduit, releasing heat along its path to the refractory. The heat stored in the refractory is then released slowly into the environment mainly as a radiant component. The physical phenomena that occur in an accumulation stove, once the activation energy in the combustion chamber has been provided, continues, initially increasing temperature and velocity of <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> and then decreasing the two variables {{until the end of the}} reaction. The decreasing temperatures of <b>flue</b> <b>gases,</b> <b>flowing</b> from the combustion chamber in the twisted conduit, tends to cause the transition of the flow regime from laminar to turbulent conditions. Moreover the continuous changes of direction imposed by the curves cause local contractions and expansions of the flux and, consequently, energy losses which are difficult to evaluate. The way the heat transfer occurs appears to depend mainly on <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> conditions (laminar or turbulent) and on the radiative properties of the hot particle cloud inside the <b>flue</b> <b>gas.</b> The physical properties of the conduit (roughness of the internal surface), as well as the thermodynamic properties of the refractory material (its mass and its geometric arrangement), play a fundamental role in the functionality of the stove. This paper describes some analysis performed on heat transport and exchange processes inside the <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> and between them and the refractory.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{mechanical}} induced draught. The first is through use of a steam jet.

5000|$|Induced draught: This is {{obtained}} {{one of three}} ways, the first being the [...] "stack effect" [...] of a heated chimney, in which the flue gas is less dense than the ambient air surrounding the boiler.

Prediction of the heat exchanger performance using this correlation was possible. As a result, it was elucidated that the using mini-tubes is remarkably effective to reduce the size of heat exchanger due to enhancement of heat transfer coefficient and enlargement of heat transfer surface.

The investigated heat transfer system consisted of two consecutively positioned heat exchangers with various construction designs. This study brings more detailed information on heat transfer and fluid flow characteristic of the secondary exchanger and its overall influence on the efficiency of use of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> waste heat. Possible water condensation from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> is analyzed as well. According to the results, the secondary exchanger can be utilized as the preliminary one to the primary exchanger. Consequently, the number of sections of the primary exchanger needed for water heating can be significantly decreased. Water temperature {{in the case of}} connection of both the exchangers reached 370 K. Approximately 33 % of the temperature increase {{can be attributed to the}} secondary exchanger. The mean logarithmic temperature difference of the analyzed secondary exchanger was ∼ 166 K. The favorable geometry of the secondary exchanger resulted in a decrease in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> temperature, as well as in a decrease of its gradient throughout the cross-section of the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> system. The <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> temperature behind both the exchangers was sufficient to prevent condensation of water from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> even under “extreme” conditions. A decrease of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> mass <b>flow</b> had a significantly higher influence on the volume of the condensed water than had lower temperature of the <b>flue</b> <b>gas.</b> A decrease of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> temperature by 100 K led only to formation of a more continuous layer of the condensed water on the entire length of the wall of the tube.

40|$|Flexible {{operation}} {{has the potential}} to significantly improve the economic viability of post-combustion CO 2 capture (PCC). However, the impact of disturbances from flexible operation of the PCC process is unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of flexible operation in a PCC pilot plant by implementing step-changes for improved dynamic data reliability. The flexible operation campaign was conducted at the CSIRO PCC pilot plant at AGL Loy Yang using monoethanolamine (MEA) absorbent. The pilot plant was operated under a broad range of transient conditions (changing <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> <b>flow,</b> liquid absorbent flow and steam pressure) to capture the dynamics of a PCC process during flexible operation.

At 1. 0 MeV and 10 mA more than 90 % NO removal from <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> <b>flowing</b> at 120 Nm 3 /h can be achieved. For higher removal percentage, higher beam current was required.

Additional SO 2 in the in let gas stream lowered the removal rate but was overcame by scaling up the system to 10 DBD tubes. The system was operated with input AC voltage of 35 kV peak to peak.
