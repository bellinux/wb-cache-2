40|$|Semi-supervised {{learning}} of Geographical <b>gazetteers</b> from the Internet In this paper we present {{an approach to}} the acquisition of geographical <b>gazetteers.</b> Instead of creating these resources manually, we propose to extract <b>gazetteers</b> from the World Wide Web, using Data Mining techniques. The bootstrapping approach, investigated in our study, allows us to create new <b>gazetteers</b> using only a small seed dataset (1260 words). In addition to <b>gazetteers,</b> the system produces classifiers. They can be used online to determine a class (CITY, ISLAND, RIVER, MOUNTAIN, REGION, COUNTRY) of any geographical name.

25|$|<b>Gazetteers</b> {{are often}} {{categorized}} by the type, and scope, {{of the information}} presented. World <b>gazetteers</b> usually consist of an alphabetical listing of countries, with pertinent statistics for each one, with some <b>gazetteers</b> listing information on individual cities, towns, villages, and other settlements of varying sizes. Short-form <b>gazetteers,</b> often {{used in conjunction with}} computer mapping and GIS systems, may simply contain a list of place-names together with their locations in latitude and longitude or other spatial referencing systems (e.g.,British National Grid reference). Short-form <b>gazetteers</b> appear as a place–name index in the rear of major published atlases. Descriptive <b>gazetteers</b> may include lengthy textual descriptions of the places they contain, including explanation of industries, government, geography, together with historical perspectives, maps and/or photographs. Thematic <b>gazetteers</b> list places or geographical features by theme; for example fishing ports, nuclear power stations, or historic buildings. Their common element is that the geographical location is an important attribute of the features listed.|$|R

Furthermore, applying the extended <b>gazetteers</b> to an entity extraction task in a scientific domain, we empirically observed a significant improvement in system accuracy when compared with those using seed <b>gazetteers.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|According to Francis Buchanan, 15,000 of them {{returned}} to Mangalore and its environs, whilst 10,000 of them migrated to Malabar.

According to the Mangalorean Catholic genealogist Michael Lobo, the present Mangalorean Catholic community is descended almost entirely {{from the small}} group of survivors who {{returned to}} South Canara. Soon after the death of Tipu, a detachment from the Bombay army under Lieutenant-Colonel Wiseman took possession of Mangalore on 4 June 1799, as well as the entire province of Canara, {{with the exception of the}} fortress of Jamalabad.|$|E
5|$|During Keyser's lordship, John Marius Wilson's Imperial <b>Gazetteer</b> of England and Wales listed Adminston as a {{possible}} name for the village. On his death in 1929, his wife, Mary, continued to occupy the house until she died in 1938. The estate was auctioned off in September 1938, and many lots were purchased by their occupiers. The manor house was bought by Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) for £16,000. One of the houses in the village is recorded as having fetched £1,375. As AEI's chairman, Felix Pole became the de jure Lord of the Manor upon their purchase of Aldermaston Court.|$|E

5|$|Ever {{since the}} Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep {{boreholes}} to transport natural gas from bamboo pipelines to stoves where cast iron evaporation pans boiled brine to extract salt. During the Tang dynasty, a <b>gazetteer</b> of Sichuan province stated {{that at one}} of these 182m (600ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame. These were essentially the first gas cylinders; Robert Temple assumes some sort of tap was used for this device.|$|E
5|$|His initial posting was to Midnapur in Bengal as an Assistant Magistrate and Assistant District Collector. The {{area was}} {{inhabited}} {{in part by}} forest tribes. He soon took to studying them and retained {{an interest in the}} anthropology of such tribes for the remainder of his life. He also became involved in William Wilson Hunter's Statistical Survey of India, which began in 1869, and was to be printed in the first edition of The Imperial <b>Gazetteer</b> of India, published in 1881. Hunter personally conducted the survey of Bengal, and the anthropological, linguistic and sociological accomplishments of Risley were recognised in February 1875 when he was appointed as one of five Assistant Directors of Statistics for Hunter's Survey.|$|E
5|$|Historian Alan Machado Prabhu {{mentions}} that only 11,000 survived the captivity as Christians. British general Arthur Wellesley helped 10,000 of them return to South Canara and resettle on their lands. Of the remaining Christians freed, {{about a thousand}} went to Malabar, and some hundreds settled in Coorg. According to Francis Buchanan, 15,000 of them returned to Mangalore and its vicinity, while 10,000 of them migrated to Malabar. The <b>Gazetteer</b> of the Bombay Presidency (1883) {{mentions that}} 15,000 persons returned, of which 12,000 were from South Canara and 3,000 from North Canara.

40|$|It {{is often}} claimed that Named Entity {{recognition}} systems need extensive <b>gazetteers</b> [...] lists of names of people, organisations, locations, and other named entities. Indeed, the compilation of such <b>gazetteers</b> is sometimes {{mentioned as a}} bottleneck {{in the design of}} Named Entity recognition systems. We report on a Named Entity recognition system which combines rule-based grammars with statistical (maximum entropy) models. We report on the system's performance with <b>gazetteers</b> of different types and different sizes, using test material from the MUC- 7 competition. We show that, for the text type and task of this competition, it is sufficient to use relatively small <b>gazetteers</b> of well-known names, rather than large <b>gazetteers</b> of low-frequency names. We conclude with observations about the domain independence of the competition and of our experiments...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gazetteers</b> are {{important}} tools {{when it comes}} to the management and retrieval of geospatial and environmental data. Analogous to thematic thesauri, they provide a controlled and geo-referenced vocabulary of geographic features. However, current implementations of <b>gazetteers</b> have a number of limitations with respect to the formulation of spatial queries. We propose to use qualitative spatial modeling and reasoning to enhance state-of-the-art <b>gazetteers,</b> and to overcome some of these shortcomings...|$|R

5|$|The Itcha Range has had {{at least}} two forms of names {{throughout}} its history. It was originally named the Itcha Mountains as identified in the 1930 BC <b>Gazetteer.</b> This form of name remained official until March 13, 1947 when it was changed to its current form, Itcha Range, {{as part of an}} official government policy. Larger mountain ranges throughout British Columbia, such as the Coast Mountains, retained their gazetted names whereas smaller ones, especially ranges of larger groupings, were subjected to renaming. In more casual speech, the Itcha Range {{is referred to as the}} Itchas. The name Itcha is indigenous in origin, coming from the local Tsilhqot'in people.|$|E
5|$|Although phumdi {{vegetation}} {{has existed}} for centuries, {{it was not until}} 1886 that the Manipur <b>Gazetteer</b> recorded that wetlands with floating islands were used by inhabitants for fishing. Before the Itahi barrage was constructed in 1986, 207 khangpoks (huts or sheds) were reported on the phumdis, but after the dam was completed in 1999, the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) reported 800 such structures. Many of the huts are reported to have been converted into permanent dwellings and about 4,000 people live in these floating huts, earning their living as fishermen. The huts are constructed using plastic ropes, heavy rocks, wood, bamboo, zinc plates and iron rods. Athapums, artificial circular phumdis, which were built by the villagers as enclosures for fish farming, are present on the lake, and this aquaculture has caused further proliferation of the phumdis. A tourist lodge has been built on one of the phumdis in Sandra Island.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{creative}} differences, Kuntz {{backed out of}} the project, but created an adventure module that would be published {{at the same time as}} Gygax's first book. Gygax continued to painstakingly put Castle Zagyg together on his own, but even this slow and laborious process came to a complete halt when Gygax suffered a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later. Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from 14-hour work days to only one or two hours per day. Finally in 2005, Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh, the first book in the six-book series, appeared. Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau (2005), the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz. Jeff Talanian helped with the creation of the dungeon, eventually resulting in publication of the limited edition CZ9: The East Marks <b>Gazetteer</b> (2007).|$|E
40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{potential}} for increased synergy be-tween <b>gazetteers</b> and high-resolution remote sensed imagery. These two data sources are complementary. <b>Gazetteers</b> pro-vide high-level semantic information about what is where but they must be manually compiled and maintained. On the other hand, imagery can be automatically acquired but only provides low-level radiometric information. We explore ways in which these two data sources can be integrated to more fully automate geographic data management. In particular, we show how <b>gazetteers</b> represent {{a rich source of}} semi-supervised training data for geospatial object mod-elling. We also describe an example of information flow in the other direction, namely, how high-resolution imagery can be used to refine the spatial extents of geospatial objects in <b>gazetteers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Even {{with the}} Jiajing reforms to {{document}} migrant workers and merchants, {{by the late}} Ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population. Gazetteers across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the Ming, some guessing that it had doubled, tripled, or even grown fivefold since 1368. Fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps 160 million in the late Ming dynasty, while Brook estimates 175 million, and Ebrey states perhaps as large as 200 million. However, a great epidemic that entered China through the northwest in 1641 ravaged the densely populated areas along the Grand Canal; a <b>gazetteer</b> in northern Zhejiang noted {{more than half the}} population fell ill that year and that 90% of the local populace in one area was dead by 1642.|$|E
5|$|In 1827 {{a rolling}} mill capable of 100 tons of bar iron per week was {{installed}} at the Walker Ironworks; in the same year, Losh, Wilson and Bell's Walker foundry was listed in Parson and White's <b>gazetteer</b> of Durham and Northumberland as a steam engine manufacturer. In 1833, the iron puddling process was installed at Walker. In 1835, while working as an inspector of construction on the Whitby & Pickering Railway, Thomas Wilson noted the presence of ironstone in a railway cutting at Grosmont, and arranged for drift mines to exploit the find; the new railway carried the ore to Whitby. In that year, {{at the age of}} nineteen, Thomas Bell's son Lowthian Bell entered the firm's Newcastle office under his father. In 1836 he joined his father at the firm's ironworks at Walker.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man {{marked the}} first {{discovery}} in Britain of a well-preserved bog body; its condition was {{comparable to that of}} Grauballe Man and Tollund Man from Denmark. Before Lindow Man was found, it was estimated that 41bog bodies had been found in England and Wales and 15 in Scotland. Encouraged by the discovery of Lindow Man, a <b>gazetteer</b> was compiled, which revealed a far higher number of bog bodies: over 85 in England and Wales and over 36 in Scotland. Prior to the discovery of the bodies in Lindow Moss, British bog bodies had been a relatively neglected subject compared to European examples. The interest caused by Lindow Man led to more in-depth research of accounts of discoveries in bogs since the 17thcentury; by 1995, the numbers had changed to 106 in England and Wales and 34 in Scotland. The remains covered a large time frame.|$|E

Local <b>gazetteers</b> and yearbooks are also increasingly available in electronic format through commercial databases or as is less known, in public domain. The {{purpose of this article is}} to address the following questions: What are new local <b>gazetteers</b> and yearbooks? Why so many titles are published now? Are there any free online full texts available? What are the free online full texts? In addition, I will briefly examine the institutionalization of compiling and publishing local <b>gazetteers</b> and yearbooks in China. Furthermore, I present the result of a survey on freely available online full texts of such materials that I conducted from 2007 through 2008. Given that commercial full-text databases of local <b>gazetteers</b> are unaffordable for most libraries in North America, it is hoped that students, researchers and librarians of Chinese studies shall find the free online full-text materials useful...|$|R
