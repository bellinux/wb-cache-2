5|$|The {{publication}} of vernacular literature increased, with Dante (d. 1321), Petrarch (d. 1374) and Giovanni Boccaccio (d. 1375) in 14th-century Italy, Geoffrey Chaucer (d. 1400) and William Langland (d. c. 1386) in England, and François Villon (d. 1464) and Christine de Pizan (d. c. 1430) in France. Much literature remained religious in character, and although a great <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{continued to be}} written in Latin, a new demand developed for saints' lives and other devotional tracts in the vernacular languages. This was fed by {{the growth of the}} Devotio Moderna movement, most prominently {{in the formation of the}} Brethren of the Common Life, but also in the works of German mystics such as Meister Eckhart and Johannes Tauler (d. 1361). Theatre also developed in the guise of miracle plays put on by the Church. At the end of the period, the development of the printing press in about 1450 led to the establishment of publishing houses throughout Europe by 1500.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulties}} {{attending the}} execution of this first order were such {{that they are not}} easily understood by present-day mechanics. Modern machine tools simply did not exist; the cylinders were bored by a chisel fixed in a block of wood and turned by hand; the workmen had to be taught how to do nearly all the work; and Baldwin himself did a great <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> with his own hands.|$|E
25|$|Outside of Dubuque, {{this region}} of Iowa is thinly populated. In the western section, {{agriculture}} and livestock raising are the norm.

The state maintains an extensive number of wildlife management areas (basically hunting and fishing areas), along with state forests and state parks.|$|E

25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read a good <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking {{of what he called}} ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E
500|$|Peirce {{wanted to}} tell the story from Brandon's perspective. She was {{familiar}} with Brandon's desire to wear men's clothing: [...] "I started looking at all the other coverage and a great <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was sensational. People were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar to so many people. Where to me, I knew girls who had passed as boys, so Brandon was not some weird person to me. Brandon was a very familiar person." [...] Peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case, believing the American public were generally misinformed: she said, [...] "People were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and I think that's really dangerous, especially with this culture of violence that we live in". Peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title Take It Like a Man.|$|E
500|$|At {{this stage}} Kneale was working {{primarily}} in Independent Television, having written the play Murrain (screened in the anthology series Against The Crowd, 1975) and the anthology series Beasts (1976) for ATV. In May 1977, Euston Films—a subsidiary of Thames Television {{best known for}} The Sweeney (1975–1978)—announced that they had picked up Kneale's unmade Quatermass scripts. This new production, known either as Quatermass or Quatermass IV, would consist of a four-part serial to be broadcast by ITV which would be recut as a 100-minute film, titled The Quatermass Conclusion, for release in North America and Europe. Kneale was dubious about having to craft both a television serial version and a film version of his tale, feeling that [...] "in the end we had two versions, neither {{of which was the}} right length for the story". During the rewrites, Kneale transplanted the action at the conclusion of part three from Stonehenge to the more easily available Wembley Stadium. When asked about what differences there were between the Euston Films version and the version originally envisaged for the BBC, Kneale remarked that [...] "the BBC version would have been much more in the studio, whereas the Euston Films version was entirely shot on 35mm film with a great <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> outside. Much more lavish than either the BBC or I had contemplated".|$|E

2500|$|Kapil Dev was {{appointed}} {{coach of the}} Indian national cricket team in 1999, succeeding Anshuman Gaekwad. [...] In his term, India won just one test match (at home against New Zealand) and had two major series losses in Australia (3–0) and at home against South Africa (2–0) and in general considered a disappointment. At {{the height of the}} match fixing allegation by Manoj Prabhakar – a charge that was dismissed later, Kapil resigned from his position as national coach. Stung by the betting controversy, he announced his farewell stating that [...] "I bid adieu to the game that gave me so much and then took a great <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> away on the mere hearsay of a third party". After a brief interval, he was succeeded as coach by former New Zealand batsman John Wright, who became India's first foreign coach.|$|E
2500|$|In 1818, a British {{architect}} named George Ledwell Taylor spent {{a summer}} in Greece with two friends at Livadeia. On June 3, {{they decided to}} go horseback riding to the nearby village of Chaeronea using Pausanias' Description of Greece as a guidebook. Two hours away from the village, Taylor's horse momentarily stumbled {{on a piece of}} marble jutting from the ground. Looking back at the rock, he was struck by its appearance of being sculpted and called for their party to stop. They dismounted and dug at it with their riding-whips, ascertaining that it was indeed sculpture. They enlisted the help of some nearby farmers until they finally uncovered the massive head of a stone lion which they recognized as the same lion mentioned by Pausanias. Parts of the statue had broken off and a good <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> still remained buried. They immediately reported their discovery when they returned to Athens. However, during the Greek War of Independence (1821–1832), a Greek general damaged the monument by ordering that the pedestal be smashed, perhaps looking for treasure. He found nothing but spears and shields, some of which with names still inscribed in them. As a result of the incident, the original design of the pedestal is now unknown. Offers in the late 19th century by the British archeologist Cecil Harcourt Smith to fund the restoration of Lion of Chaeronea was initially refused by the Greeks. In 1902, however, permission was granted and the monument was pieced back together with funding by the Order of Chaeronea. The lion, which stands about [...] high, was mounted on a reconstructed pedestal about [...] high.|$|E
