5|$|Each title {{focuses on}} the {{extraordinary}} invading the ordinary world, though the two main Megami Tensei series focus on different things: Shin Megami Tensei focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed {{to survive in a}} world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while Persona focuses on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group of people. That protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead's gender <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> of the question, some staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better suited to a male character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism, various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} scoring variations; under the first and simpler ruleset, {{the first player to}} pocket his private number wins. Under the second variation, {{although}} a player still wins by pocketing his private number, points are scored in various ways: 1) two points are given by each participant to the winning player for the pocketing of his private number; 2) a player receives one point for pocketing any other player's private number, and the player whose private number was pocketed is penalized one point (and can have a negative point total), but <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> of the game and can still win points in this way; 3) if a player whose private number is pocketed by another does not disclose this fact before a subsequent shot is taken, the non-disclosing player forfeits, immediately losing the game, and the player who made that ball is given two points instead of one. In the event that no player succeeds in pocketing his private number, gameplay ends when the last private number is potted, and the game is played again with all points values doubled.|$|E

25|$|Law 36: Leg before wicket (LBW). If {{the ball}} hits the batsman without first hitting the bat, {{but would have}} hit the wicket if the batsman was not there, and the ball does not pitch on the leg side of the wicket, the batsman will be out. However, if the ball strikes the batsman outside {{the line of the}} off-stump, and the batsman was {{attempting}} to play a stroke, he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|A run out cannot {{occur if}} no fielder has touched the ball. As such, if a batsman plays a {{straight}} drive which breaks the non-striker's stumps whilst he is outside his crease, he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out.</b> However, if a fielder (usually the bowler, in this case) touches {{the ball at}} all before it breaks the stumps at the non-striker's end, then it is a run out, even if the fielder never has any control of the ball.|$|E

Though the novel {{stresses the importance of}} love and understanding in marriage, Austen never seems to condemn Charlotte's decision to marry for money. She uses Charlotte to convey how women of her time would adhere to society's expectation for women to marry even if it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> of love, but convenience. Charlotte is the daughter of Sir William Lucas and Lady Lucas, friends of Mrs. Bennet.|$|E
25|$|If a bowler's {{delivery}} {{hits the}} stumps and if {{at least one}} bail is completely removed {{from the top of}} the stumps, the striker (the batsman facing the bowler) is out (assuming the bail does not luckily land back in the stump's spigots). The ball can either have struck the stumps directly, or have been deflected off the bat or body of the batsman. However, the batsman is not bowled out if the ball is touched by a fielder or touched by the wicket-keeper or the umpire before hitting the stumps. The batsman <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> if the bails remain on the stumps.|$|E
25|$|Cave divers {{occasionally}} visit Jordbrugrotta {{which is}} the most dived cave in Scandinavia. Most of the other approximately 200 caves in Rana are not suitable for diving, and formation of caves has been limited due most of the rock being granite. Another diveable cave nearby is Litjåga. Damming of Kallvatnet made diving in Jordbrugrotta possible. There have been multiple cases of fatalities and injuries among visiting cave divers, but the accident rate <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> of proportion with the number of divers. The cave's passages were formed by the river Plura's flow through porous limestone. Rock formations include marble. Visibility in the cave is good.|$|E

25|$|This {{criticism}} {{is similar to}} the critic levelled at development in developing countries by authors such as James C. Scott, James Ferguson, and L. Lohman. Although peacekeeping and development are two different things, the logic behind the {{criticism is}} the same. The third-party officials-whether they are peacekeepers or agents of development-are isolated from the general populace, believing they know what is best, and refusing to gather information from a ground level. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> of maliciousness or imperialism, but out of a legitimate belief that they, as educated officials with access to other experts and who are well versed in development and peacekeeping literature, know what is best.|$|E

500|$|While many Star Trek episodes {{dealt with}} false deities, The Final Frontier {{is one of}} the few that, in the words of {{religious}} scholar Ross Shepard Kraemer, [...] "intentionally confronted and explored theological questions, including the existence of God." [...] Theologian Larry Kreitzer dubbed it the film most preoccupied with religious ideas. According to the film, centuries in the future, beliefs in Eden persist, even among other alien races such as the Klingons and Romulans. Moreoever, the view of God is homogenized— no one disputes Sybok's references to God as a [...] "he". Kreitzer finds that the film's theological interpretation is offered by Kirk's words: [...] "Maybe He [...] <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> there, Bones.

Toriyama was not concerned about consistency with the color of characters' clothes for the occasional color pages, having sometimes used different ones than he had before. He even specifically asked Torishima to produce as few color pages as possible. Character names are almost always puns sharing a theme with characters related to them, most commonly food.

However, she saw [...] "absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing [...] and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere.

500|$|Releases {{from major}} studios – such as The Big Lebowski (1998), which was {{distributed}} by Universal Studios – can become cult films when they fail {{at the box}} office and develop a cult following through reissues, such as midnight movies, festivals, and home video. [...] Hollywood films, due to their nature, are more likely to attract this kind of attention, which leads to a mainstreaming effect of cult culture. [...] With major studios behind them, even financially unsuccessful films can be re-released multiple times, which plays into a trend to capture audiences through repetitious reissues. [...] The constant use of profanity and drugs in otherwise mainstream, Hollywood films, such as The Big Lebowski, can alienate critics and audiences yet lead to a large cult following among more open-minded demographics not often associated with cult films, such as Wall Street bankers and professional soldiers. [...] Thus, even comparatively mainstream films can satisfy the traditional demands of a cult film, perceived by fans as transgressive, niche, and uncommercial. [...] Discussing his reputation for making cult films, Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap said, [...] "I didn't set out to make cult films. I wanted to make box-office hits." [...] Writing in Cult Cinema, academics Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton state that this acceptance of mainstream culture and commercialism <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> of character, as cult audiences have a more complex relationship to these concepts: they are more opposed to mainstream values and excessive commercialism than they are anything else.|$|E
500|$|Halo 5 shows Halsey {{explaining}} that Cortana has recovered from Rampancy and attained meta-stability by {{gaining access to}} The Domain, a Forerunner database {{thought to have been}} destroyed with the firing of the Halo Array. How the UNSC and Halsey are aware that Cortana gained access to The Domain is unknown. She explains to Master Chief on Genesis that she survived by falling through slipspace, and likens the Domain to the [...] "Water Of Life for AI's". Her goal now is to preserve an ever lasting peace by subjugating all biological life. Whether this is a direct reaction to her link with The Domain, influence from The Didact (as their goals are now extremely similar) or some other external influence is yet to be known. With all Promethean troops and most Forerunner tech now under her command, and believing she cannot trust the Chief, who tries to reason with her, she converts most, if not all of the UNSC's AI constructs to her cause and begins her assault by plunging Humanity into a new Dark Age, using the Guardian's EMP abilities to shut off most UNSC technology, except The Infinity which barely escapes with Roland, the ship's AI, still intact and seemingly loyal. In the Legendary Ending, a Halo ring can be seen activating accompanied by Cortana humming. Whether she found it or built it is unknown although, considering she has access to the Domain, the Guardians, Forerunner tech and a multitude of different AI constructs at her disposal, building her own ring <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> of the realms of possibility.|$|E
