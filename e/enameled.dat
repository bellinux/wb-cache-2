5|$|I {{will always}} think of Mussolini {{as one of the}} oddest {{characters}} in history, and I will remember him as I last saw him in the great white and gold foyer of the Grand Hotel, under a huge crystal candelabra slouching wearily into a graceful Louis XV ivory and <b>enameled</b> chair.|$|E
5|$|New {{construction}} almost halted {{when the}} Great Depression {{began in the}} 1930s. As a result, there are few buildings in the district in that era's architectural styles. The post office at Fourth and Broadway, built despite much public outcry over the demolition of its landmark 1894 predecessor, is the district's most notable building of the 1930s. Its stripped-down Classical Revival style shows the influence of Art Deco in its smooth, finished surfaces. The <b>enameled</b> metal facade on a Third Street storefront, dating to 1940, makes it the only building in the district to show any trace of the Streamline Moderne style.|$|E
50|$|<b>Enamel</b> hypocalcification is {{a defect}} of tooth <b>enamel</b> in which normal amounts of <b>enamel</b> are {{produced}} but are hypomineralized. In this defect the <b>enamel</b> is softer than normal. Some areas in <b>enamel</b> are hypocalcified: <b>enamel</b> spindles, <b>enamel</b> tufts, and <b>enamel</b> lamellae.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Enamel</b> {{spindles}} {{are often}} confused {{with two other}} entities: <b>enamel</b> lamellae and <b>enamel</b> tufts. Lamellae are linear <b>enamel</b> defects that extend {{from the surface of}} the <b>enamel</b> towards the DEJ, or vice versa. <b>Enamel</b> tufts are [...] "small, branching defects that are found only at the DEJ, protruding into the <b>enamel</b> towards the <b>enamel</b> surface. <b>Enamel</b> spindles however, are in fact odontoblast processes that extend into the <b>enamel.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Kowalewko {{cemetery}} in Greater Poland {{is one of}} the largest in Poland and is distinguished by a great number of beautiful relics, made locally or imported from the Empire. The total number of burials is estimated at over 500, most of which have been excavated. 60 percent of the bodies were not cremated and typically placed in wooden coffins constructed of board or plank pieces. The burial ground was in use from the mid-1st century AD to about 220, which gives approximately 80 area inhabitants per generation. Remnants of settlements in the region have also been investigated. At Rogowo near Chełmno a Wielbark settlement, an industrial production site and a 2nd to 3rd century bi-ritual cemetery with very richly furnished graves have been discovered. In the area of Ulkowy, Gdańsk County a settlement consisting of both sunken floor and post construction dwellings, as well as a burial ground in use from the mid-1st century to the second half of the 3rd century were found. Only a part of the cemetery was excavated on the occasion of a motorway construction, but it yielded 110 inhumations (11 in hollowed-out log coffins) and 15 cremations (8 of them in urns) and a rich collection of decorative objects, mostly from the graves of women. Those include fancy jewelry and accessories made of gold, silver, bronze, amber, glass and <b>enameled</b> plates. Ceramics, utility items and tools including weaving equipment were recovered from the settlement site. Other significant Wielbark settlements in the area were encountered in Swarożyn and Stanisławie, both in Tczew County.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enameled</b> ovens do {{not need}} to be {{seasoned}} before use. However, they lose some of the other advantages of bare cast iron. For example, deep frying is usually not recommended in <b>enameled</b> ovens; the enamel coating is not able to withstand high heat, and is best suited for water-based cooking.|$|E

5000|$|Interrod <b>enamel</b> is histologically {{identified}} on microscopic views of tooth <b>enamel.</b> Because interrod <b>enamel</b> is located around <b>enamel</b> rods, {{the areas of}} interrod <b>enamel</b> enhances the [...] "keyhole" [...] appearance of <b>enamel</b> rods by acting as its border.

30|$|Normal and {{abnormal}} <b>enamel</b> rods {{could be}} observed in dental fluorosis <b>enamel.</b> In particular, the microstructures of abnormal <b>enamel</b> rods in dental fluorosis <b>enamel</b> drastically differed {{from those of the}} normal <b>enamel</b> rods.

50|$|The <b>enamel</b> cord, {{also called}} <b>enamel</b> septum, is a {{localization}} of cells on an <b>enamel</b> organ that appear {{from the outer}} <b>enamel</b> epithelium to an <b>enamel</b> knot.

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1957 Flaminia, Lancia cars {{switched}} {{from the traditional}} vertical split grille to an horizontal, full-width one. The logo was therefore moved inside the grille opening, and changed to a more stylized chromed metal open-work design; shield and steering wheel became chrome frames, the only remaining <b>enameled</b> surface being the blue field of the flag. This new metal logo was used on most models with some exceptions, namely Zagato-bodied Lancia Fulvias and Flavias, the Lancia 2000 Berlina (which reprised the traditional upright grille and the round <b>enameled</b> badge) and the Stratos HF (whose ornaments lacked the triangular shield).|$|E

5000|$|The {{arrangement}} of <b>enamel</b> rods is understood {{more clearly than}} their internal structure. <b>Enamel</b> rods are found in rows along the tooth, and within each row, the long axis of the <b>enamel</b> rod is generally perpendicular to the underlying dentin.

Understanding <b>enamel</b> orientation is very important in restorative dentistry, because <b>enamel</b> unsupported by underlying dentin is prone to fracture.The area around the <b>enamel</b> rod is known as interrod <b>enamel.</b> Interrod <b>enamel</b> has the same composition as <b>enamel</b> rod, however a histologic distinction is made between the two because crystal orientation is different in each.

An index of relative <b>enamel</b> thickness scaled for size has been developed and this defined four categories of relative <b>enamel</b> thickness metrically: Thin <b>enamel</b> (mean values of relative <b>enamel</b> thickness between 8. 90 and 11. 30), intermediate/ thin <b>enamel</b> (mean values between 11. 30 and 14. 65), intermediate/ thick <b>enamel</b> (mean values between 14. 65 and 17. 25), and thick <b>enamel</b> (mean values between 17. 70 and 26. 20).

25|$|<b>Enamel</b> tufts are {{frequently}} confused with <b>enamel</b> lamellae, {{which are also}} <b>enamel</b> defects, but which differ in two ways: lamella are linear, and not branched, and they exist primarily extending from the <b>enamel</b> surface, through the <b>enamel</b> and towards the dentinoenamel junction, whereas <b>enamel</b> tufts project in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|The {{microstructure}} of the <b>enamel</b> of VPL/JU/NKIM/25 {{has been}} studied.

The rows of small, round <b>enamel</b> prisms {{are separated by}} interprismatic matrix that forms crystals oriented at right angles relative to the prisms. Prisms arise at the enamel-dentine junction, run through the <b>enamel,</b> and meet the outer <b>enamel</b> at a high angle.
