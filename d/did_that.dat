5|$|Although Artigas was {{defeated}} by the Luso-Brazilian armies, his allies Estanislao López and Francisco Ramírez continued hostilities against Buenos Aires for its inactivity against the invasion. Pueyrredón called the Army of the Andes and the Army of the North (led by Belgrano) to aid Buenos Aires in the conflict. Guido noted to San Martín that if both armies <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> the north of Argentina and Chile would be easily reconquered by the royalists. San Martín also knew {{that most of the}} soldiers of the Army of the Andes would not be willing to aid Buenos Aires in the civil war, as most were from other provinces or from Chile. San Martín had doubts as well about the projected arrival of a large military expedition from Spain, as the absolutist restoration of Ferdinand VII had met severe resistance in Spain. San Martín finally kept the Army in Chile when Belgrano's lieutenant Viamonte signed an armistice with López; he thought that the conflict had ended.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had {{established}} diplomatic {{contact with each other}} in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names <b>did</b> <b>that</b> title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it simply because his readers would have been familiar with it, not because he thought it authentic.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus recounts that, {{according}} to the Athenians, as the battle began the Corinthians hoisted their sails and began sailing away from the battle, northwards up the straits. However, {{he also says that}} other Greeks denied this story. If this did in fact occur, one possible interpretation is that these ships had been a decoy sent to reconnoitre the northern exit from the straits, in case the arrival of the encircling Egyptian detachment was imminent (if indeed this also occurred). Another possibility (not exclusive of the former) is that the departure of the Corinthians triggered the final approach of the Persians, suggesting as it <b>did</b> <b>that</b> the Allied fleet was disintegrating. At any rate, if they indeed ever left, the Corinthians soon returned to the battle.|$|E

30|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty five years later, {{in the era of}} Big Data, various {{statistical}} data are publicly available. The task of ensuring that security intensive information does not leak out becomes much more challenging. A modern man lives and works in a society oriented toward collecting and storing data on each and every person. Statistics services <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (census forms), taxing services <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (tax declarations), medical facilities <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (patient’s medical records), law enforcement agencies <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (person’s IDs), employers <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (CVs), retail stores <b>do</b> <b>that</b> (personal discount cards), security <b>does</b> <b>that</b> (security cameras files), {{and so on and so}} forth. Problems of preserving privacy in such data are widely discussed within the field of privacy-preserving data publishing (Fung et al. 2010; Wong and Fu 2010). To great extent, appropriate protection implies removing identifiers (passport data, full name etc.), and distorting the data (e.g., values of certain characteristics are swapped between respondents or get noised) or suppressing them (e.g., data on elder people are grouped in a category of senior citizens).|$|R

5|$|In 1936, {{with the}} help of a friend, the then 28-year-old Ho set up shop in Chinatown with only a comb, a stool, and a {{kerosene}} lamp. She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb hair or weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. She <b>did</b> <b>that</b> every day for almost three decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street. Although illiterate, she made some property investments and eventually became a landlord, renting out rooms. As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characteristics}} {{about the}} Tribune made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx {{to reach a}} sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean. Since its founding, the Tribune had been an inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy. Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses {{of the working class}} of the United States. With a run of about 50,000 issues, the Tribune was the most widely circulated journal in the United States. Editorially, the Tribune reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions. Not only did the Tribune have wide readership with the United States and not only <b>did</b> <b>that</b> readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed to be from the progressive wing of the working class. Marx's first article for the New York Tribune was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the Tribune on 21 August 1852.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} appeared {{less frequently}} after 1964, when Julius Schwartz (who disliked the Joker) became {{editor of the}} Batman comics. The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series Batman, {{in which he was}} played by Cesar Romero. The show's popularity compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show's popularity waned, however, so <b>did</b> <b>that</b> of the Batman comics. After the TV series ended in 1968, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic's sales decline; editorial director Carmine Infantino resolved to turn things around, moving stories away from schoolboy-friendly adventures. The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker's defining character traits: lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes.|$|E

5|$|Whether the {{information}} Fuchs passed {{relating to the}} hydrogen bomb would have been useful is still debated. Most scholars agree with Hans Bethe's 1952 assessment, which concluded {{that by the time}} Fuchs left the thermonuclear program in mid-1946, too little was known about the mechanism of the hydrogen bomb for his information to be useful to the Soviet Union. The successful Teller-Ulam design was not devised until 1951. Soviet physicists later noted that they could see as well as the Americans eventually <b>did</b> <b>that</b> the early designs by Fuchs and Edward Teller were useless.|$|E
5|$|Winckelmann’s {{theories}} {{on the evolution}} of art culminated in the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of complete political and religious liberty. The theories idealised Ancient Greece and increased people’s desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as he <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He convinced 18th-century Europe that life in Ancient Greece was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of “noble simplicity and calm grandeur”. Greece became the “motherland of the arts” and “the teacher of taste”.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of printing, written legal texts became more available, reducing the need for students to attend readings and lectures. However, {{this meant that the}} students denied themselves the opportunity to query what they had learnt or discuss it in greater detail. Eventually, students now had a way to learn without attending lectures, they began to excuse themselves from lectures, meetings and moots altogether; in the early 17th century they developed a way of deputising other students to do their moots for them. The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings, first because many probably believed (as the students <b>did)</b> <b>that</b> books were an adequate substitute, and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading, which cut into their time as practising barristers. These problems were endemic to all the Inns, not just Gray's Inn.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the shock}} of the Western public, the {{practice}} of Vietnamese monks self-immolating was not unprecedented. Instances of self-immolations in Vietnam had been recorded for centuries, usually carried out to honor Gautama Buddha. The most recently recorded case had been in North Vietnam in 1950. The French colonial authorities had tried to eradicate the practice after their conquest of Vietnam in the nineteenth century, but had not been totally successful. They did manage to prevent one monk from setting fire to himself in Huế in the 1920s, but he managed to starve himself to death instead. During the 1920s and 1930s, Saigon newspapers reported multiple instances of self-immolations by monks in a matter-of-fact style. The practice had also been seen in the Chinese city of Harbin in 1948 when a monk seated down in the lotus position on a pile of sawdust and soybean oil and set fire to himself in protest against the treatment of Buddhism by the communists of Mao Zedong. His heart remained intact, as <b>did</b> <b>that</b> of Đức.|$|E
5|$|The city of Bastogne, Belgium was a hub {{of several}} major roads {{and became a}} prime target for the Germans, seeing its capture as {{necessary}} to their advance.
