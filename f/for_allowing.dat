5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized <b>for</b> <b>allowing</b> the {{doctrine}} of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp {{the discretion of the}} executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E

5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel <b>for</b> <b>allowing</b> him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{residents}} {{were allowed to}} return to their neighborhoods on a by-town basis. Once authorized to enter their communities, many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return of civilians. In turn, dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations. In Pinellas County, laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters. As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local officials, would become responsible <b>for</b> <b>allowing</b> cities to reopen. Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders. An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.|$|E

The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case <b>for</b> <b>allowing</b> competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E

As a result, city council has not issued Ferrara any development permits until restoration work to the orphanage is complete.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1982 season, the San Diego Chargers signed Allen. He {{played in}} the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. The {{secondary}} unit was praised <b>for</b> <b>allowing</b> only 3 points despite fielding two new starters, Allen and Andre Young. He went on to start in nine regular season games with the Chargers. Allen intercepted a pass from Terry Bradshaw intended for Lynn Swann in the Chargers' first round playoff win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but the Chargers lost {{in the second round}} to the Miami Dolphins. Prior to the 1983 season, the Chargers traded Allen to the San Francisco 49ers for a draft pick, but Allen was cut during the preseason and never played for the 49ers.|$|E

5|$|By a 5–4 margin, {{the justices}} {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992.

The original poll of the justices showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation <b>for</b> <b>allowing</b> wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E

5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} that God, though omnipotent, could not be {{expected}} to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason <b>for</b> <b>allowing</b> evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.|$|E
