40|$|Yellow-orange-red {{ornaments}} {{present in}} the integuments (feathers, bare parts) of birds are often produced by carotenoid pigments and may serve to signal {{the quality of the}} bearer. Although carotenoid esterification in tissues is a common phenomenon, most of the work on avian carotenoids has been focused on the identification of free forms or have been done after sample saponification. Here we determined free and esterified carotenoid composition in a bird species with red ornaments: the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa). Carotenoids from leg integument were extracted and processed by TLC to separate three major carotenoid groups (free form, mono- and diesters with fatty acids), whereas saponified extracts gave only free forms of carotenoids. TLC fractions were then analyzed by HPLC-DAD with C 18 phase column for a preliminary identification of carotenoid groups. The final characterization of free carotenoids and its esters with fatty acids was performed with direct extracts analyzed by LC-MS and LC-MS/MS with a C 30 phase, always with a system coupled to DAD. The main carotenoid (λmax 478 nm and [M+H]+ at m/z 597. 2) was identified as astaxanthin by comparison with standards. A second carotenoid (λmax between 440 and 480 nm and [M+H]+ at m/z 581. 3) was not identified among any of the commercially available carotenoid standards, although it could correspond to pectenolone according to its fragmentation pattern. Both the unidentified carotenoid and astaxanthin formed monoesters with fatty acids, but only astaxanthin was in its diesterified form. Monoesters were mainly formed with palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids. Complementary analyses of fatty acid composition in partridge integument by GC-MS revealed high amounts of these and other fatty acids, such as myristic, arachidic and <b>docosanoic</b> <b>acids.</b> The combination of HPLC-DAD and LC-MS/MS spectra was especially useful to identify the carotenoids {{present in the}} esterified forms and the probable masses of the fatty acids included in them, respectively.

Complexation yields, relative crystallinities, dissociation temperatures and enthalpies increased with amylose chain lengths (DP 20 -DP 60 -DP 400). Relative crystallinities and thermal stabilities of the DP 950 -complexes were {{slightly lower than}} those of the other amylose fractions, probably due to increased conformational disorders, resulting in crystal defaults. Molecular weight distributions of the complexes revealed that, irrespective to the complexation temperature, the critical DP for complex formation and precipitation was 35 and 40 for complexes with GMS and C 22, respectively, corresponding to the length needed to accommodate two GMS- or C 22 -molecules within an amylose helix. Complexation of dextrins with a well-chosen lipid, allows to separate starch derived dextrins with a predictable critical chain length as border.

Optimal operating conditions and column stability for routine analysis were established. An Aerograph Hy-Fi gas chromatograph was used for all work, except the studies with Tween 80 in which an Aerograph A- 90 -C was employed. Chromatographic traces are presented of volatile fatty acid analyses with each of the liquid phases.

The latter two liquid phases were extremely unstable and proved to be unsatisfactory for analysis of aqueous samples. A column of Carbowax 20 M + H 3 PO 4 separated steam-volatile organic acids completely. The volatile fatty acid isomers were separated by 5 % Tween 80 somewhat less completely, and the peak shapes were not as sharp and symmetrical as that desired for good quantitative work.

40|$|AIM: To {{elucidate}} {{the underlying mechanisms}} of metastasis and to identify the metabolomic markers of gastric cancer metastasis. METHODS: Gastric tumors from metastatic and non-metastatic groups were used in this study. Metabolites and different metabolic patterns were analyzed by gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and principal components analysis (PCA), respectively. Differentiation performance was validated by the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: Twenty-nine metabolites were differentially expressed in animal models of human gastric cancer. Of the 29 metabolites, 20 were up-regulated and 9 were down-regulated in metastasis group compared to non-metastasis group. PCA models from the metabolite profiles could differentiate the metastatic from the non-metastatic specimens with an AUC value of 1. 0. These metabolites were mainly involved in several metabolic pathways, including glycolysis (lactic acid, alaline), serine metabolism (serine, phosphoserine), proline metabolism (proline), glutamic acid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle (succinate, malic acid), nucleotide metabolism (pyrimidine), fatty acid metabolism (<b>docosanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and octadecanoic acid), and methylation(glycine).

40|$|Peroxisomal {{disorders}} are characterized biochemically by {{elevated levels of}} very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in serum. Herein, we describe a novel approach for quantification of VLCFAs in serum, namely, eicosanoic acid (C 20 : 0), <b>docosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 22 : 0), tetracosanoic acid (C 24 : 0), and hexacosanoic acid (C 26 : 0). The methodology is based on (i) enrichment of VLCFA derivatives using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs); (ii) quantification using stable isotope-labeled internal standards; and (iii) direct detection using MWCNT-based surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SALDI-TOFMS). Four kinds of MWCNTs (Aldrich 636843, 636495, 636509, and 636819) of different lengths and diameters were tested using the developed technique. The data show that 636843, the MWCNT with the largest outer diameter (o. d.), the widest wall thickness, and shortest length, had the best limit of detection (0. 5 - 1 mu g/mL) We also {{found that there was}} no significant difference in enrichment efficiency of VLCFAs between the four MWCNTs, which suggests that the size of the MWCNT may contribute to desorption/ionization efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test the enrichment of VLCFAs using MWCNTs of different sizes. We have shown that the VLCFAs adsorbed by MWCNTs can be analyzed by SALDI-TOFMS. In addition, this method does not require liquid/gas chromatography separation, thereby allowing for high-throughput screening of VLCFAs in peroxisomal disorders...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the role of clay minerals in organic matter preservation, the fixation of pure organic compounds on two synthetic low- and high-charge saponites was investigated in laboratory experiments simulating marine water conditions. The clays were exposed to four carboxylic acids: pentadecanoic, docosanoic, 5 β-cholanic acid and ursolic, dissolved in treated natural sea water. Characterization of the resulting organo-clay association indicates that, under marine water column conditions, the organic fixation is only a sorption process, no intercalation being observed. The surface coverage, similar for the two clays (ca. 0. 04 mg organic carbon m- 2), demonstrates that the sorption {{is controlled by the}} surface properties of clays rather than their cation exchange capacity. The weaker sorption of <b>docosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> underlines the major role of the molecular properties, but the lack of selectivity among the three others does not corroborate the influence of molecular size on the sorption process. The general failure of a chemolysis treatment performed on the organo-clay associations demonstrates the high stability of these complexes. Results suggest that the bonding mechanisms are dominated by ligand exchange and not by hydrophobic effects, cation bridges or cation exchange. The minor extractible organic fraction consists of acid molecules connected to clay surfaces by van der Waals interactions. The high stability of the bonds formed in this environment, close to those observed from previous studies of marine sediments, could explain in part the organic matter preservation during transfer across marine water columns, especially metabolisable materials...|$|E

Chuquiraga ulicina ssp. ulicina, collected by the ecological or environmental strategy, yielded ten compounds including four novel taraxastane-type triterpenoids, 3 β-acetoxy- 6 β-hydroxytaraxasta- 20 -ene (1), 6 β-hydroxytaraxast- 20 -en- 3 -one (2), 6 β-hydroxytaraxasta- 20 -ene 3 β-palmitate (3), and 3 β, 6 β-dihydroxytaraxasta- 20 -ene (4), together with the known triterpenoids lupeol (5), lupenyl acetate (6), lupenone (7), friedelinol (8), 3 β-acetoxy- 30 -nor-lupan- 20 -one (9), and 30 -norlupan- 3 β-ol- 20 -one (10). Lupeol (5) was the only compound to show antitubercular activity. Sphacele salviae, collected by the ethnobotanical or ethnomedical approach, allowed the isolation of three known compounds, including the two abietane diterpenoids carnosol (11) and rosmadial (12), as well as one pentacyclic triterpenoid, ursolic acid (13). Greigia sphacelata, collected according to the random approach, afforded nine compounds. These include the two novel flavanones 5, 7, 3 '-trihydroxy- 6, 4 ', 5 '-trimethoxy flavanone (14) and 5, 3 '-dihydroxy- 6, 7, 4 ', 5 '-tetramethoxy flavanone (15), as well as four known phenylpropanoids, 1, 3 -O-di-trans-p-coumaroylglycerol (16), 1 -O-trans-cournaroylglycerol (17), 1 -(ω-feruloyldocosanoyl) glycerol and 1 -(ω-feruloyltetracosanoyl) glycerol (18), and trans-ferulic acid 22 -hydroxy <b>docosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> ester (19), and three known pentacyclic triterpenoids, arborinone (20), arborinol (21), and isoarborinol (22) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{fluidity}} of neuronal membranes plays {{a pivotal}} role in brain aging and neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the role of the omega- 3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in modulation of membrane fluidity, APP processing, and protection from cytotoxic stress. To this end, we applied unilamellar transfer liposomes, which provided protection from oxidation and effective incorporation of DHA into cell membranes. Liposomes transferring <b>docosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (DA), the completely saturated form of DHA, to the cell cultures served as controls. In HEK-APP cells, DHA significantly increased membrane fluidity and non-amyloidogenic processing of APP, leading to enhanced secretion of sAPPα. This enhanced secretion of sAPPα was associated with substantial protection against apoptosis induced by ER Ca 2 + store depletion. sAPPα-containing supernatants obtained from HEK-APP cells exerted similar protective effects as DHA in neuronal PC 12 cells and HEK 293 control cells. Correlating to further increased sAPPα levels, supernatants obtained from DHA-treated HEK-APP cells enhanced protection, whereas supernatants obtained from DHA-treated HEK 293 control cells did not inhibit apoptosis, likely due to the low expression of endogenous APP and negligible sAPPα secretion in these cells. Further experiments with the small molecule inhibitors LY 294002 and SP 600125 indicated that sAPPα-induced cytoprotection relied on activation of the anti-apoptotic PI 3 K/Akt pathway and inhibition of the stress-triggered JNK signaling pathway in PC 12 cells. Our data suggest that liposomal DHA is able to restore or maintain physiological membrane properties, which are required for neuroprotective sAPPα secretion and autocrine modulation of neuronal survival...|$|E
40|$|ArticleThe {{literature}} on non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations in blood cell membranes from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is scarce and reports on concentrations in brain tissue from these patients are inconsistent. NEFAs {{are needed for}} several biological functions, for example, as precursors for inflammatory eicosanoid synthesis. The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to compare NEFA concentrations in blood cell membranes from patients with that of healthy control subjects, and to correlate possible changes with disease outcome. NEFA C 18 : 2 n- 6 (9, 12 -octadecadienoic acid) was decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cell membranes from patients, median (quartile range) : patients: 0. 05 (0. 02) and controls: 0. 07 (0. 14) μg/mg protein, p= 0. 007. C 18 : 2 n- 6 also showed a weaker relationship with other fatty acids: with C 16 : 0 : patients: R= 0. 40, p= 0. 04; controls: R= 0. 82, p= 0. 000001. Saturated and MUFA showed positive correlations with the Bowel and bladder Functional System Scores (FSS). In contrast, in red blood cell membranes C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 22 : 0 (<b>docosanoic</b> <b>acid)</b> showed inverse correlations with the Sensory and Brainstem FSS. The decrease in NEFA C 18 : 2 n- 6 resulted in metabolic abnormalities between itself and saturated and monounsaturated NEFAs. Altered fatty acid composition in immune cell membranes would influence immune cell functions, and could possibly have contributed to the positive correlations between these fatty acids and disease outcome. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|We {{studied the}} omega-oxidation of <b>docosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 22 : 0) in rat liver microsomes. C 22 : 0 and 22 -hydroxy-docosanoic acid (omega-hydroxy-C 22 : 0) {{were used as}} substrates, and the {{reaction}} products were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, omega-oxidation of C 22 : 0 produced not only the hydroxylated product, omega-hydroxy-C 22 : 0, but also the dicarboxylic acid of C 22 : 0, docosanedioic acid (C 22 : 0 -DCA). When rat liver microsomes were incubated with omega-hydroxy-C 22 : 0 {{in the presence of}} either NAD+ or NADPH, C 22 : 0 -DCA was formed readily. Formation of C 22 : 0 -DCA from either C 22 : 0 or omega-hydroxy-C 22 : 0 with NADPH as cofactor was inhibited strongly by miconazole and disulfiram, whereas no inhibition was found with NAD+ as cofactor. Furthermore, omega-oxidation of C 22 : 0 was reduced significantly when molecular oxygen was depleted. The high sensitivity toward the more specific cytochrome P 450 inhibitors ketoconazole and 17 -octadecynoic acid suggests that hydroxylation of C 22 : 0 and omega-hydroxy-C 22 : 0 may be catalyzed by one or more cytochrome P 450 hydroxylases belonging to the CYP 4 A and/or CYP 4 F subfamily. This study demonstrates that C 22 : 0 is a substrate for the omega-oxidation system in rat liver microsomes and that the product of the first hydroxylation step, omega-hydroxy-C 22 : 0, may undergo further oxidation via two distinct pathways driven by NAD+ or NADP...|$|E
40|$|X−linked {{adrenoleukodystrophy}} {{is a rare}} inherited demyelinating disorder {{characterized by}} an abnormal accumulation of very long chain fatty acids, mainly hexacosanoic acid (26 : 0), due to a mutation of the gene encoding for a peroxisomal membrane protein. The only available, and partially effective, therapeutic treatment consists of dietary intake of a 4 : 1 mixture of triolein and trierucin, called Lorenzo’s oil (LO), targeted to inhibit the elongation of <b>docosanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (22 : 0) to 26 : 0. In this study we tested whether, besides inhibiting elongation, an enhancement of peroxisomal beta oxidation induced by conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), will improve somatosensory evoked potentials and modify inflammatory markers in adrenoleukodystrophy females carriers. We enrolled five heterozygous women. They received a mixture of LO (40 g/day) with CLA (5 g/day) for 2 months. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by the means of plasma levels of 26 : 0, 26 : 0 / 22 : 0 ratio, modification of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers and somatosensory evoked potentials. Changes of fatty acid profile, and in particular CLA incorporation, were also evaluated in CSF and plasma. The results showed that CLA promptly passes the blood brain barrier and the mixture was able to lower both 26 : 0 and 26 : 0 / 22 : 0 ratio in plasma. The mixture improved somatosensory evoked potentials, which were previously found unchanged or worsened with dietary LO alone, and reduced IL- 6 levels in CSF in three out of five patients. Our {{data suggest that the}} synergic activity of CLA and LO, by enhancing peroxisomal beta-oxidation and preventing 26 : 0 formation, improves the somatosensory evoked potentials and reduces neuroinflammation...|$|E
