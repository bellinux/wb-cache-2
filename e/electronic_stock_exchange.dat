40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{models for}} accurate prediction of price changes on <b>electronic</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> by utilizing autoregressive and logistic methods. Prices on these <b>electronic</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges,</b> also called ECNs, are solely determined by where orders {{have been placed}} into the order book, unlike traditional <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> where prices are determined by an expert market maker. Identifying the significant variables and formulating the models will provide critical insight into the dynamics of prices on ECNs. Whereas previous research has relied on simulated data to test market strategies, this analysis will utilize actual ECN data. The models recognize patterns of asymmetry and movement of the shares in the order book to formulate accurate probabilities for possible future price changes. On traditional <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges,</b> price changes could only occur as quickly as human beings could enact them. On ECNs, computerized systems place orders on behalf of traders based on their preferences, resulting in price changes that reflect trader activity almost instantaneously. The quickness of this automation on ECNs forces the re-evaluation of commonly held beliefs about stock price dynamics. Previous strategies developed for trading on ECNs have relied mainly on price fluctuations to gain profits. This thesis uses the formulated models to design profitable strategies that use accurate prediction rather than price variability...|$|R

50|$|Beginnings of {{the history}} of the Bucharest <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> can be traced back to 1839, when the commodities-trade exchanges were {{established}} in Bucharest. It was nevertheless only until December 1, 1882 that the BVB was officially inaugurated. One week later, the first exchange rates begun being published in the Official Gazette.Throughout its existence, the activities of the Bucharest <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> were affected by the socio-political events of the time, such as the Romanian Uprising of 1907 or the Balkan Wars that took place between 1912 and 1913. The <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> was moreover closed during the First World War. When BVB re-opened following the end of the war, it went through a period of 7 years of significant growth, followed by a period of 7 years of accelerated loss. The activity of the Market for Effects, Actions and Exchange was stopped in 1948, with the establishment of the Communist regime in Romania and the beginning of the nationalisation process. At that time, shares issued by 93 companies and 77 fixed-income instruments (bond type) were listed on the Bucharest <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange.</b> The Bucharest <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> reopened again in 1995, after almost 50 years since it was shut down by the Communist regime. The first trading session was carried out on November 20, 1995. On that date, 905 shares issued by 6 listed companies were traded. In 2005, BVB absorbed RASDAQ - the over-the-counter <b>electronic</b> <b>stock</b> market. On February 14, 2008, Erste Bank listed on BVB and became the first international company listed on the regulated market. Subsequently, Bucharest <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> has experienced a continuous development and is now established as the main <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> in Romania. In 2010, Bucharest <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> listed on its own spot regulated market under the symbol BVB. In 2010, the Alternative trading system was launched by BVB for SMEs and start-up companies wanting to raise capital from the market. At the end of 2014, it was announced that the equities segment of the ATS market will be re-launched under a new name 'AeRO' which stands for Alternative Exchange in Romania. AeRO was officially relaunched on February 25, 2015 during an official opening of the trading session during which two companies debuted - Delivery Solutions (symbol: SDAY) and Carpathia Capital (CRPC). AeRO targets early stage companies, to finance their projects, growth stories, increase their visibility and contribute to the development of the business environment.On December 15, 2014 BVB has launched a new website, synchronized with all the channels used by BVB, including social media pages. On March 27, 2015, BVB announced that it was joining the United Nations Sustainable <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchanges</b> initiative making it the 19th <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> to join.

40|$|Software {{is neither}} law nor architecture. It {{is its own}} {{modality}} of regulation. This Note builds on Larry Lessig’s famous formulation that “code is law” to argue that Lessig was wrong to equate computer software with physical architecture. Although software resembles both law and architecture in its power to constrain behavior, it has features that distinguish it from both. The Note identifies four relevant attributes of software: It is ruleish, potentially nontransparent, impossible to ignore, and vulnerable to sudden failure. By assessing {{the impact of these}} characteristics in a given context, one can decide whether software is a good or a bad choice to solve a regulatory problem. Part I situates software within Lessig’s theory of different and complementary modalities of regulation that constrain individuals. In Code, he postulates four such modalities: law, social norms, markets, and physical architecture. He then argues that software is a subspecies of physical architecture as a modality. I argue instead that three basic characteristics of software establish it as a distinct modality that should not be conflated with any of the others: First, software is automated. Once set in motion by a programmer, a computer program makes its determinations mechanically, without further human intervention. Second, software is immediate. Rather than relying on sanctions imposed after the fact to enforce its rules, it simply prevents the forbidden behavior from occurring. Third, software is plastic. Programmers can implement almost any system they can imagine and describe precisely. Software is like physical architecture and unlike law in being automated and immediate. However, plasticity is more characteristic of legal systems than of architectural ones. Software’s plasticity interacts with its automation and its immediacy to produce consequences that set it apart from both law and physical architecture. In Part II, I turn to these distinctive consequences. There are four recurring and predictable patterns present in any regulation by software: First, along the traditional continuum between rules and standards, software lies at the extreme rule-bound end. Second, software can regulate without transparency. Frequently, those regulated by software may have no reasonable way to determine the overall shape of the line between prohibited and permitted behavior. Third, software rules cannot be ignored. Parties facing a decision made by software can, at best, take steps to undo what software has wrought. Fourth, software is more fragile than other systems of regulation. Hackers can turn its plasticity against it, and its automated operation means that unintended consequences are shielded from human review. Part III applies this analysis to two case studies. It predicts that software {{is a good way to}} manage negotiations and transactions in online marketplaces such as online auction sites and <b>electronic</b> <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges.</b> On the other hand, it predicts several pitfalls for the use of software to restrict the distribution of digital media...|$|R
