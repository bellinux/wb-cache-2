50|$|The {{geographic}} location of Canillas de Aceituno {{makes it a}} natural balcony of Axarquia. The road to the village offers views of the Velez and Rubite valleys, through a landscape of olive plantations, vineyards, almond and fig trees. On the hills or mountains {{one can see the}} awnings ready to dry the <b>grapes</b> <b>for</b> <b>raisins.</b> This tree abundance is made possible by the Almanchares, Bermuza and Rubite rivers, which also facilitate the existence of natural springs such as the Gazuela and the Ivy. In the environment of Canillas is abundant with natural caves highlighted by the Fajara, four kilometers from the villa, in whose interior are the tunnels up until a kilometer and a half.|$|E

5000|$|Muscat of Alexandria is a {{white wine}} grape that {{is a member of}} the Muscat family of Vitis vinifera. It is {{considered}} an [...] "ancient vine", and wine experts believe it is one of the oldest genetically unmodified vines still in existence. While today it is mostly cultivated as a table <b>grape</b> or <b>for</b> <b>raisin</b> production, it is still an important grape in the Australian and South African wine industry. It is also cultivated very heavily on the islands of Samos, and Lemnos in the North Eastern Aegean region of Greece, and reputedly Cleopatra drank muscat wine from there. It is also thought to rival the French Beaume de Venise in its most refined form. In Italy wine is made from the grape on the island of Pantelleria, and in Spain, the <b>grape</b> is used <b>for</b> wine around Málaga, Alicante, Valencia, and the Canary Islands. The grape originated in North Africa, and the name is probably derived from its association with Ancient Egyptians who used the <b>grape</b> <b>for</b> wine making. It is also a table <b>grape</b> used <b>for</b> eating and <b>raisins.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} most appropriated chemical treatment to be used to dry <b>grapes</b> cv. Rubi <b>for</b> <b>raisin</b> production. Drying curves for convective drying with air at 50 oC, in a tray drier, were obtained <b>for</b> <b>grapes</b> submitted to chemical pretreatments with different concentrations of potassium carbonate and olive oil, and different dipping times, according to factorial designs. Convective drying curves were also obtained <b>for</b> <b>grapes</b> pretreated in aqueous suspensions of soybean lecithin, at varied lecithin concentrations and dipping times. Page model was adjusted to the experimental drying curves, and the calculated drying times showed that the best pretreatment consisted in dipping <b>grapes</b> <b>for</b> 2 minutes in a 5 % olive oil and 6 % K 2 CO 3 emulsion, at 50 oC, which resulted in a drying time close to that of the pretreatment with 2. 5 % of olive oil, but with a lower consumption of this substance. In addition, the immersion of grapes in an aqueous suspension of 2 % soy lecithin, at 50 oC, for 5 minutes, resulted in a total drying time slightly higher than the most effective pretreatment. 200...|$|R
40|$|Fresh fruit {{consumption}} is being promoted {{for health reasons}} in North America, Europe and other regions. Consumers are responding, {{as evidenced by the}} 20 percent increase in per capita fruit consumption in the past 30 years. US consumers have increased fruit consumption by 23 percent, but they still consume half the amount recommended by the dietary guidelines of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Fruit production often requires significant intervention with pesticides to control pests and diseases. Thus, health conscious consumers increasingly see organic fruit as a logical package. Fruit and vegetable sales account for about 40 percent of the retail sales of organic foods in the US (93 percent of this is fresh produce), with fruit estimated to represent about half of this. In Europe, organic fruit sales represent about five percent of all fruit sales, but the market penetration differs considerably by the specific fruit. Apples, pears, <b>grapes</b> (including <b>grapes</b> <b>for</b> wine, <b>raisins</b> and table grapes), strawberries and peaches are among the top temperate fruits consumed in the US and Europe. These fruits can also be grown in those regions and thus supply a significant share of the organic market...|$|R
5000|$|The River Raisin is a {{river in}} southeastern Michigan, United States that flows through glacial sediments into Lake Erie. The area today is an {{agricultural}} and industrial center of Michigan. The river flows for almost 139 mi, draining {{an area of}} 1072 sq mi in the Michigan counties of Lenawee, Monroe, Washtenaw, Jackson, Hillsdale, a portion of Fulton County, Ohio, and Monroe County, where its mouth is located. French settlers named it as La Rivière aux Raisins because of the wild grapes growing along its banks, since the French word <b>for</b> <b>grape</b> is <b>raisin.</b> The French term for [...] "raisin" [...] is raisin sec (dry grape).|$|R

40|$|Farmers {{of several}} {{progressive}} countries like India are producing the grape raisins. However, the existing grading systems {{in these countries}} are human expert based and judgmental. The image based sorting and grading systems developed in the advanced countries are costly and are sometimes slow as they do analysis of individual raisin. This work proposes to develop a cost effective grading process <b>for</b> <b>grape</b> <b>raisins</b> which will give judgment about grading of bulk of raisins sorted manually or mechanically. In this study, the database is developed using the images taken by simple webcam from the local raisin market. Based on {{the opinion of the}} raisin experts, these images are grouped into four classes. The Hue, Saturation and Intensity (HSI) color features of these images are obtained to develop the fuzzy logic system for the classification of the images of different grades. The Gaussian membership function is used for developing the four rules for four grades. The performance of the fuzzy classification system is measured in the form of Success Rate. The results show that for more than four features, the raisin grading can be classified with 100 % success rates...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} energy consumption of input and output used in raisin production and making a cost analysis in Aegean Region. Energy output-input analysis is generally done to determine the scope of environment and energy efficiency of agricultural production. In this study the cost of raisin production was calculated by Manisa Viticulture Research Institute's records in 2015. Costs of inputs and prices of raisin were obtained from various sources such as Turkish Statistical Institute, Aegean Exporters' Association and Turkish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock. The total energy input necessity <b>for</b> <b>raisin</b> production was 39, 066. 91 MJ/ha. The research results indicated that the total energy input used <b>for</b> <b>raisin</b> was mainly dependent on non-renewable energy forms (% 97). The high ratio of non-renewable energy in the total used energy inputs causes negative effects on the sustainability in agricultural production. Among input energy sources, diesel oil, chemical fertilizers and electricity contained highest energy shares with 34. 30 %, 26. 96 %, and 22. 50 % respectively. The energy ratio and energy productivity were found to be 6. 04 and 0. 51 [*]kg/MJ. Gross production value and total variable costs <b>for</b> <b>raisin</b> were $ 8, 600 and $ 4, 528. 25, respectively. As a result of cost analysis, gross margin was calculated as $ 4, 071. 75...|$|R
