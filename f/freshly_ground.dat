40|$|Tobacco smoke {{contains}} many toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic chemicals, {{as well as}} stable and unstable free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the particulate and the gas phase {{with the potential for}} biological oxidative damage. Epidemiological evidence established that smoking {{is one of the most}} important extrinsic factor of premature morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to investigate oxidative and carcinogenic mechanisms of tobacco and synergistic action with other respirable particles in the respiratory system of smokers. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and spin- trapping techniques were used to study stable free radicals in the cigarette tar, and unstable superoxide anion (O 2 ·-) and hydroxyl (HO·) radicals in the smoke Results showed that the semiquinone radical system has the potential for redox recycling and oxidative action. Further, results proved that aqueous cigarette tar (ACT) solutions can generate adducts with DNA nucleobases, particularly the mutagenic 8 -hydroxy- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine (a biomarker for carcinogenesis). Also, we observed synergistic effects in the generation of HO·, through the Fenton reaction, with environmental respirable particles (asbestos fibres, coal dust, etc.) and ambient particulate matter (PM), such as PM 10, PM 2. 5 and diesel exhaust particles (DEP). The highest synergistic effects was observed with the asbestos fibres (<b>freshly</b> <b>grounded),</b> PM 2. 5 and DEP. Finally, we discuss results from our previous study of conventional cellulose acetate filters and “bio-filters” with hemoglobin impregnated activated carbon, which showed that these filters do not substantially alter the free radical content of smoke in the particulate and in the gaseous phase...|$|R

40|$|Consumers {{associate}} {{with the quality of}} food its freshness (97 %) and taste (93 %) (e. g. GFK 2000). As the extrinsic cue country of origin serves as an indicator for the intrinsic cue taste it works as quality indicator (PETZOLDT ET AL. 2007; KROEBER-RIEL 2003). Indeed several studies reveal that country of origin labeling (COOL) {{plays an important role in}} consumers’ quality evaluation of food products (e. g. VAN ITTERSUM ET AL. 2001; HONG AND WYER 1989; ELLIOTT AND CAMERON 1994). Most studies investigating consumers’ preferences and willingness to pay for COOL focus on meat (e. g. VERBEKE AND WARD 2006; LOUREIRO AND MCCLUSKY 2000), olive oil (e. g. SANDALIDOU ET AL. 2002) or wine (e. g. SKURAS AND VAKROU 2002). Spices such as pepper have not been researched yet. Nevertheless, pepper for instance seems very interesting to analyze as we can note a shift from pepper being a low-involvement commodity to becoming a lifestyle product. This holds especially for consumers of organic products and for gourmets (KAUSCH 2008; NATUR AND KOSMOS 2007). For example <b>freshly</b> <b>grounded</b> pepper experiences an increasing culinary demand (DEAK 2004). Pepper experts state that pepper should be differentiated with respect to country and region of origin, as it is already common for wine, tea and coffee, because origin has a strong effect on peppers aroma (NATUR AND KOSMOS 2007; MCFADDEN 2008). Research reveals knowledge is a crucial factor for the use of country of origin labels as purchase criterion (e. g. SCHÄFER 1997; VAN ITTERSUM ET AL. 2001). We can suspect that conscious consumers know about a products’ diversity, e. g. taste variety as a result of its country of origin. Therefore it can be assumed that consumers’ knowledge and taste perception is of relevance for the success of country of origin labeling. Against this background, we carried out a standardized survey (n= 100) in a organic grocery store in Bonn, Germany in August 2009 to investigate whether consumers expect taste differences with respect to pepper, olive oil, wine, rice and tea and if so, whether they assume these differences to be a result of country of origin. The word association test is used to gain insights into what comes to consumers mind when being asked about pepper. Based on these results we assess the relevance of country of origin (COO) in the case of pepper. In addition, we analyze consumers’ awareness and expertise with respect to the diversity of pepper as a result of country of origin and region. Finally, a blind tasting of black pepper of different origins and production methods (organic versus conventional) is conducted to assess whether consumers are able to identify aroma differences between the different varieties. The results show that consumers’ awareness of taste differences regarding product varieties differentiated by countries/locations depends on the familiarity with the considered product. For all products analysed, the correlation between COO and taste is positive (above 0. 5) and highly significant at the 0. 01 level. In the case of wine 82 % of the respondents expect taste differences due to the COO with 61 % indicating a preference for a specific country in their purchase decision. The preferred wine countries are Germany (34 %) and France (18 %). Also with respect to olive oil the majority of respondents (79 %) assume taste differences due to the COO and 66 % reveal a preference for a specific country (e. g. 52 % for Italy; 33 % for Greek). In the case of pepper only 44 % of the survey participants expect taste differences in view of country of origin. 16 % indicate a preference for a specific origin of which India is most often mentioned (56 %), followed by China, however with a considerable smaller relevance (13 %). The low relevance of the COO in the case of pepper might be a result of the fact that only organic brands label the producing country. Additionally advertisement for spices focusing on country of origin is in general rare. Therefore it is not surprising that the connection between COO and taste is less made for pepper compared to wine and olive oil which are, in contrast to pepper, considered as high involvement products and are often discussed in the context of country of origin. For these products advertisement focuses on and highlights this attribute (Becker 2000). Therefore we can assume that consumers’ knowledge and awareness of the producing country is more skilled and present for wine and olive oil. Based on these results, we conclude that COO serves as an indicator for taste for the products under investigation. On the basis of a word association test, the relevance of the attribute ‘country of origin’ is analysed in comparison to other product characteristics for pepper. The test reveals that country of origin (17 times mentioned) is only one of many relevant product attributes consumers {{associate with}} pepper. Most frequently mentioned are varietal diversity (64 times) and spiciness (54 times). Thus, the results of the word association test indicate that differences the majority of the respondents make between pepper varieties are rather based on the degree of maturity (e. g. black pepper versus green pepper) than on country of origin. The blind tasting test aims to analyse whether consumers are indeed able to perceive taste differences between pepper of different origins and production methods. Therefore in the blind testing pepper of two different regions (India versus Sri Lanka) and two different production methods (organically versus conventionally produced) was considered. Three of the four organic peppers were exclusively distributed in organic stores. One organic and one conventional pepper are distributed in the conventional retail sector. All peppers distributed in the organic stores are COO labelled, the ones in the conventional retail stores are not. The results reveal that consumers are able to identify taste differences - pungency, finish and aroma are the aspect respondents were asked to evaluate - between peppers of different countries of origin and production methods. We found out that aroma was the most important attribute for the appraisal of a pepper and consumers’ willingness to buy one. On a scale from 1 (hardly any aroma) to 4 (very aromatic) the two organic peppers exclusively listed in organic stores were from India and were ranked first and third by consumers. The organic pepper without COOL distributed in the conventional retail sector was placed second with regard to aroma. The organic pepper brand from Sri Lanka (also exclusively listed in organic stores) ranked fourth and the conventional one last. Overall our results indicate that German consumers prefer a specific country of origin only if they assume that this is linked to differences in taste. Lacking awareness and knowledge hinders most of the participants of our survey to combine taste and country of origin in the case of pepper. This holds despite the fact that the survey was conducted in an organic grocery store and thus was directed at consumers of organic food who are in general considered to be more involved in purchase decision and are more knowledgeable with respect to production issues (see e. g. OLTERSDORF 1996; SENAUER 2001). In times of increasingly importance and renaissance of food culture, product differentiation by means of COOL can be appropriate to meet consumers’ preferences for geographical indication. With respect to pepper our study indicates that this is still a low involvement product even for consumers in organic grocery stores. A precondition for the success of COOL in the case of pepper would be to increase consumers’ knowledge of the relevance of country of origin for peppers taste.

40|$|During the {{interaction}} of sulphide minerals with the environment many reactions may occur. The knowledge of sulphur chemical state is important in order to clarify the mechanisms of oxidation/dissolution and precipitation reactions also in biotic conditions {{on the surface of}} these minerals. To date different hypotheses have been proposed for identifying the sulphur compounds that may form but no consensus is reached so far because the identification has been carried out either only {{on the basis of the}} photoelectron signals or combining the photoelectron signal with the centroid of the X-ray induced SKLL Auger line. The objectives of this thesis are: the development of an analytical strategy for the unambiguous identification of sulphur chemical state in nanometer thick layers that form on mineral surfaces after leaching. To this purpose the acquisition of detailed spectra of a series of metal sulphides and of model systems made of mixtures of sulphur and polysulphides prepared under controlled conditions is necessary. Second objective was the establishment of the curve-fitting procedure to allow the separation of the different components present on the surface (sulphide, polysulphides, sulphates) not only of the S 2 p XP-spectra but also of the SKLL spectra. Based on these results the Auger parameter values will be determined and will be used together with the chemical state plot to distinguish the chemical state of sulphur species formed on the mineral surfaces after different surface treatments. In this way, the surface reactivity of sulphide minerals and more in general, of sulphur –bearing particles will be determined The present work is organized in six chapters: the first one presents a short overview on the environmental problems that may occur when sulphide minerals, especially, those bearing eco-toxic elements such as arsenic, are exposed to the acidic mine drainage in the presence of oxidants and/or of microorganisms which enhance oxidation kinetics. It then outlines the analytical strategy that was adopted in this work for the identification of the sulphur chemical state. In the second chapter a literature survey is provided: it underlines the role of sulphur in sulphide bearing minerals: Section 2. 1 reports information about the mineral enargite and the chemical state of sulphur on its surface as it is available to date. Section 2. 2 deals with the literature on the possibility of using the KLL Auger transition. In chapter 3 a brief description of X-ray photoelectron and X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy is given while the materials and methods used in the present work are presented in chapter 4. In chapter 5 – results and discussion - the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES) analyses on alkaline and transition metal sulphide and sulphates, polysulphides and sulphide minerals are presented. In particular the spectra recorded on the S 2 p and S KLL lines of the sulphides and sulphates are shown: they were collected for getting the peak fitting parameters and apply them to the model systems obtained by mixing sulphur with sodium tetrasulphide and to investigate the composition of mineral surfaces. Minerals were analysed <b>freshly</b> cleaved, <b>ground</b> and after air exposure. The chemical state of sulphur in sulphates, sulphides (alkali- and transition metal compounds, minerals) and polysulphide is then discussed. For the first time the X-ray excited Auger SKLL lines were fitted with parameters based on standards. In this way, which can be considered as an extension of previous work, a separation of the different components and a more precise determination of their kinetic energy were achieved. The Auger parameter and the chemical state plot were obtained by combining the S 2 p photoelectron lines and the SKLL Auger lines. On this basis a clear distinction of the chemical state of sulphur in sulphates, in alkali sulphides and in transition metal sulphides was possible. The chemical state of sulphur in the bulk of minerals such as enargite or pyrite was determined. The chemical state of sulphur that formed on the surface of compounds after exposure to air or after grinding was found to vary according the coordinating metal and its concentration. It can be assessed that the analytical approach developed in the presented thesis and based on the curve – fitting procedure applied to the X-ray induced Auger electron spectroscopy appears to be a very promising method for identifying the chemical state of sulphur and for providing a new insight in the surface chemistry of sulphide minerals...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{and energy}} {{extractive}} industries play a strategic {{role in the}} economic development of Sweden. At the same time these industries present {{a major threat to}} the environment due to multidimensional environmental pollution produced in the course of ageing of ore processing tailings and waste rocks. In the context of valuable sulphide mineral recovery from sulphide ore, the complex chemistry of the sulphide surface reactions in a pulp, coupled with surface oxidation and instability of the adsorbed species, makes the adsorption processes and selective flotation of a given sulphide mineral from other sulphides have always been problematic and scientifically a great challenge. Invariably, the problems associated with acid mine drainage and selectivity in flotation are explained {{to be associated with the}} oxidation of metal sulphides. Although metal sulphides oxidation and galvanic effects were well known in flotation and leaching of sulphides, recent studies reveal the formation of reactive, oxidizing oxygen species and H 2 O 2 by sulphides due to the catalytic activity of sulphide surfaces. The inherent formation of H 2 O 2 by single and mixture of sulphide minerals during wet and dry grinding systems and in open and closed environments have been investigated. It was found that pyrite (FeS 2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), sphalerite ((Zn,Fe) S), and galena (PbS) generated H 2 O 2 in pulp liquid during wet grinding in the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen in water and also when the <b>freshly</b> dry <b>ground</b> solids are placed in water immediately after grinding. Pyrite generated more H 2 O 2 than other sulphide minerals and the order of H 2 O 2 production by the minerals found to be pyrite > chalcopyrite > sphalerite > galena. The pH of water influenced the extent of hydrogen peroxide formation where higher amounts of H 2 O 2 are produced at highly acidic pH. The amount of H 2 O 2 formed also increased with increasing sulphide mineral loading and grinding time due to increased surface area and its interaction with water. The sulphide surfaces are highly catalytically active and capable of breaking down the water molecule leading to hydroxyl free radicals. Type of grinding medium on formation of hydrogen peroxide by pyrite and galena revealed that the mild steel produced more H 2 O 2 than stainless steel grinding medium, where Fe 2 + and/or Fe 3 + ions played a key role in producing higher amounts of H 2 O 2. In addition, the effect of mixed sulphide minerals, i. e., pyrite–chalcopyrite, pyrite–galena, chalcopyrite–galena and sphalerite–pyrite, sphalerite–chalcopyrite and sphalerite–galena on the formation of H 2 O 2 showed increasing H 2 O 2 formation with increasing the content of a nobler mineral or higher rest potential mineral in a mixed composition. The results of H 2 O 2 formation in pulp liquid of sulphide minerals and mixed minerals at different experimental conditions have been explained by Eh–pH diagrams of these minerals and the existence of free metal ions that are equally responsible for H 2 O 2 formation besides surfaces catalytic activity. The results also corroborate the amount of H 2 O 2 production with the rest potential of the sulphide minerals; higher is the rest potential more is the formation of H 2 O 2. Most likely H 2 O 2 is answerable for the oxidation of sulphide minerals and dissolution of non-ferrous metal sulphides in the presence of ferrous sulphide besides the galvanic interactions. Studies have also been carried out to build correlation between percentage of pyrite in the concentrate, grinding conditions and concentration of OH•/H 2 O 2 in the pulp and as well of controlling the formation of these species through known chemical means for depressing the generation of the oxidant. Flotation tests using a complex sulphide ore with the same reagent scheme that is being used at Boliden concentrator but with the addition of collector and depressant during grinding stage have been performed to judge the beneficial or detrimental role of H 2 O 2 on the selective flotation of sulphides. The results demonstrate that the selectivity of metal sulphides against pyrite increases with increasing generation of H 2 O 2 in the pulp liquid. This study highlights the necessity of revisiting into the electrochemical and/or galvanic interactions between the grinding medium and sulphide minerals, and interaction mechanisms between pyrite and other sulphide minerals in terms of their flotation behaviour, leaching and environmental degradation in the context of inevitable H 2 O 2 existence in the pulp liquid.

40|$|This manual {{summarizes}} the roadside tree and brush control methods used {{by all of}} Iowa's 99 counties. It is based on interviews conducted in Spring 2002 with county engineers, roadside managers and others. The target audience of this manual is the novice county engineer or roadside manager. Iowa law is nearly silent on roadside tree and brush control, so individual counties have been left {{to decide on the}} level of control they want to achieve and maintain. Different solutions have been developed but the goal of every county remains the same: to provide safe roads for the traveling public. Counties in eastern and southern Iowa appear to face the greatest brush control challenge. Most control efforts can be divided into two categories: mechanical and chemical. Mechanical control includes cutting tools and supporting equipment. A chain saw is the most widely used cutting tool. Tractor mounted boom mowers and brush cutters are used to prune miles of brush but have significant safety and aesthetic limitations and boom mowers are easily broken by inexperienced operators. The advent of tree shears and hydraulic thumbs offer unprecedented versatility. Bulldozers are often considered a method of last resort since they reduce large areas to bare ground. Any chipper that violently grabs brush should not be used. Chemical control is the application of herbicide to different parts of a plant: foliar spray is applied to leaves; basal bark spray is applied to the tree trunk; a cut stump treatment is applied to the cambium ring of a cut surface. There is reluctance by many to apply herbicide into the air due to drift concerns. One-third of Iowa counties do not use foliar spray. By contrast, several accepted control methods are directed toward the <b>ground.</b> <b>Freshly</b> cut stumps should be treated to prevent resprouting. Basal bark spray is highly effective in sensitive areas such as near houses. Interest in chemical control is slowly increasing as herbicides and application methods are refined. Fall burning, a third, distinctly separate technique is underused as a brush control method and can be effective if timed correctly. In all, control methods tend to reflect agricultural patterns in a county. The use of chain saws and foliar sprays tends to increase in counties where row crops predominate, and boom mowing tends to increase in counties where grassland predominates. For counties with light to moderate roadside brush, rotational maintenance is the key to effective control. The most comprehensive approach to control is to implement an integrated roadside vegetation management (IRVM) program. An IRVM program is usually directed by a Roadside Manager whose duties may be shared with another position. Funding for control programs comes from the Rural Services Basic portion of a county's budget. The average annual county brush control budget is about 76, 000. That figure is thought not to include shared expenses such as fuel and buildings. Start up costs for an IRVM program are less if an existing control program is converted. In addition, IRVM budgets from three different northeastern Iowa counties are offered for comparison in this manual. The manual also includes a chapter on temporary traffic control in rural work zones, a summary of the Iowa Code as it relates to brush control, and rules on avoiding seasonal disturbance of the endangered Indiana bat. Appendices summarize survey and forest cover data, an equipment inventory, sample forms for record keeping, a sample brush control policy, a few legal opinions, a literature search, and a glossary...|$|R

50|$|Inhalation of <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz, when {{compared}} to inhalation of aged quartz, results in {{a significant increase in}} animal lung injury. <b>Freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz has increased reactive silicon-based oxygen radicals, and animals that are exposed to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz have been found to have decreased concentrations of antioxidant enzymes. Activated quartz particles decay with age in ambient air. Quartz dusts containing surface iron as an impurity have been shown to deplete cellular glutathione, contributing to the oxidative damage that is caused by particle and cell-derived ROS. Castranova et al. suggest that <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz dust that is contaminated with trace levels of iron may be more pathogenic than quartz dust alone.|$|E
