In 1992, Philips introduced the <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (<b>DCC),</b> a DAT-like tape in almost the same shell as a Compact Cassette. It was aimed primarily at the consumer market. A DCC deck could play back both types of cassettes. Unlike DAT, which was accepted in professional usage because it could record without lossy compression effects, DCC failed in both home and mobile environments, and was discontinued in 1996.|$|E

50|$|In 1985, Immink joined Philips’ {{magnetic}} recording group, where he {{contributed to the}} design of coding technologies of the digital video tape recorder, DV and the <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (<b>DCC).</b> The DCC was short-lived: introduced in 1992 and discontinued in 1996. The DV, launched in 1994, has become a popular tape standard for home and semi-professional video production.|$|E

50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> was {{intended}} as a digital replacement for the mass-market analog cassette tape, but received very little attention or adaptation. Its failure is generally attributed to higher production costs than audio CDs, and lukewarm reception by consumers.|$|R
5000|$|Recording from an {{analogue}} source {{resulted in}} a disc marked [...] "protected" [...] and [...] "original" [...] allowing one further copy to be made (this contrasts with the SCMS on the <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> where analogue recording was marked as [...] "unprotected").|$|R

50|$|The <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (<b>DCC)</b> is a {{magnetic}} tape sound recording format introduced by Philips and Matsushita in late 1992 and marketed as {{the successor to}} the standard analog Compact Cassette. It was also a direct competitor to Sony's MiniDisc (MD), but neither format toppled the then-ubiquitous analog cassette despite their technical superiority. Another competing format, the Digital Audio Tape (DAT) had by 1992 also failed to sell in large quantities (although it was established in recording studios)—DCC was envisaged as a less expensive alternative to DAT. DCC shares a similar form factor to analog compact cassettes, and DCC recorders can play back either type of cassette. This backward compatibility allowed users to adopt digital recording without rendering their existing tape collections completely obsolete.|$|E
50|$|Sony's MiniDisc {{was one of}} two rival digital systems, both {{introduced}} in 1992, that were targeted as replacements for the Philips Compact Cassette analog audio tape system: the other was <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (<b>DCC),</b> created by Philips and Matsushita. Sony had originally intended Digital Audio Tape (DAT) to be the dominant home digital audio recording format, replacing the analog cassette. Due to technical delays, DAT was not launched until 1989, and by then the U.S. dollar had fallen so far against the yen that the introductory DAT machine Sony had intended to market for about $400 in the late 1980s now had to retail for $800 or even $1000 to break even, putting it out of reach of most users.|$|E

50|$|Philips' <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (<b>DCC)</b> vs. Sony's MiniDisc (MD): both {{introduced}} in 1992. Since affordable CD-R {{was not available}} until 1995, DCC and MD were an attempt to bring CD-quality recording to the home consumer. Restrictions by record companies fearful of perfect digital copies had limited an earlier digital system (DAT) to professional use. In response Sony introduced MiniDisc which provided a copy control system that seemed to allay record companies' fears. Philips introduced their DCC system at approximately the same time using the same copy control system. Philips' DCC was discontinued in 1996 but MD successfully captured the Asia Pacific market (e.g. Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc.). The consumers {{in other parts of}} the world chose neither format, preferring to stick with analog Compact Cassettes for home audio recording, and eventually upgrading to CD recordable discs and lossy-compressed MP3 formats. Production of MiniDisc systems and discs finally ceased in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The first {{digital audio}} {{recorders}} were reel-to-reel decks introduced by {{companies such as}} Denon (1972), Soundstream (1979) and Mitsubishi. They used a digital technology known as PCM recording. Within a few years, however, many studios were using devices that encoded the digital audio data into a standard video signal, which was then recorded on a U-matic or other videotape recorder, using the rotating-head technology that was standard for video. A similar technology was used for a consumer format, Digital Audio Tape (DAT) which used rotating heads on a narrow tape contained in a cassette. DAT records at sampling rates of 48 kHz or 44.1 kHz, the latter being the same rate used on compact discs. Bit depth is 16 bits, also the same as compact discs. DAT was a failure in the consumer-audio field (too expensive, too finicky, and crippled by anti-copying regulations), but it became popular in studios (particularly home studios) and radio stations. A failed digital tape recording system was the <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (<b>DCC).</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{promise of}} chip-wide {{asynchronous}} operation is {{its potential for}} very low power consumption. This potential is demonstrated by an error-corrector based on <b>digital</b> <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> (<b>DCC)</b> specifications, dissipating 80 % less than its synchronous counterpart. A reduction in power consumption means longer battery lifetime, important in portable products such as cellular radio and personal audio...|$|E
50|$|In 1979 the Walkman brand was introduced, in {{the form}} of the world's first {{portable}} music player using the <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> format. Sony introduced the MiniDisc format in 1992 as an alternative to Philips <b>DCC</b> or <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> and as a successor to the <b>compact</b> <b>cassette.</b> Since the introduction of MiniDisc, Sony has attempted to promote its own audio compression technologies under the ATRAC brand, against the more widely used MP3. Until late 2004, Sony's Network Walkman line of digital portable music players did not support the MP3 standard natively.|$|R
50|$|Field {{recording}} {{experienced a}} {{rapid increase in}} popularity during the early 1960s, {{with the introduction of}} high-quality, portable recording equipment, (e.g., the Uher, and Nagra portable reel-to-reel decks). The arrival of the DAT (Digital Audio Tape) in the 1980s introduced a new level of audio recording fidelity with extended frequency response and low self-noise. In addition to these technologies, other popular means for field recording have included the analog <b>cassette</b> (CAC), the <b>DCC</b> (<b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette),</b> and the MiniDisc. The latest generation of recorders are completely digital-based (hard disk/Flash). It is also possible to use personal electronic devices, (e.g., a smartphone or tablet), with software, to do field recording and editing.|$|R
25|$|On January 25, 1994, {{the album}} Thought 'Ya Knew, {{which was to}} {{represent}} Peniston's musical zenith at that time, arrived on all available formats, including <b>digital</b> <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes.</b> However, as the record promptly entered the music charts, it was soon to be evident Thought 'Ya Knew was not enjoying the high-profile success of her previous set Finally. After its progress had stalled in the Billboard 200 at No. 96, Thought 'Ya Knew climbed to No. 31 in the UK, but the album charted for only {{two weeks in the}} UK.|$|R
50|$|Singles {{have been}} issued in various formats, {{including}} 7 in, 10 in, and 12-inch (30 cm) vinyl discs (usually playing at 45 rpm); 10-inch (25-cm) shellac discs (playing at 78 rpm); cassette, 8 and 12 cm (3- and 5-inch) CD singles and 7-inch (18 cm) plastic flexi discs. Other, less common, formats include singles on <b>digital</b> <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> DVD, and LD, {{as well as many}} non-standard sizes of vinyl disc (5-inch/12 cm, 8-inch/20 cm, etc.). Some artist release singles on records, a trend more common in musical subcultures.|$|R
50|$|The DAT {{recorder}} mechanism {{was considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive than an analogue cassette deck mechanism due to the rotary helical scan head, therefore Philips and Panasonic Corporation developed a rival digital tape recorder system with a stationary head based on the analogue <b>compact</b> <b>cassette.</b> The <b>DCC</b> was cheaper and simpler mechanically than DAT, but did not make perfect digital copies as it used a lossy compression technique called PASC. (Lossy compression was necessary to reduce the data rate to a level that the DCC head could record successfully at the linear tape speed of 4.75 cm/s that the <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> system uses.) <b>DCC</b> was never a competitor to DAT in recording studios, because DAT was already established, and as it was launched {{at the same time}} as Sony's Minidisc format (which has random access and editing features), it was not successful with consumers either. However, DCC proved that high quality digital recording could be achieved with a cheap simple mechanism using stationary heads.|$|R
50|$|Analog {{cassette}} deck {{sales were}} expected to decline rapidly {{with the advent of}} the compact disc and other digital recording technologies such as digital audio tape (DAT), MiniDisc, and the CD-R recorder drives. Philips responded with the <b>digital</b> <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> a system which was backward-compatible with existing analog cassette recordings for playback, but it failed to garner a significant market share and was withdrawn. One reason proposed for the lack of acceptance of digital recording formats such as DAT was a fear by content providers that the ability to make very high quality copies would hurt sales of copyrighted recordings.|$|R
5000|$|Those who favour {{the digital}} format {{point to the}} results of blind tests, which {{demonstrate}} the high performance possible with digital recorders. The assertion is that the 'analog sound' is more a product of analog format inaccuracies than anything else. One of the first and largest supporters of digital audio was the classical conductor Herbert von Karajan, who said that digital recording was [...] "definitely superior to any other form of recording we know". He also pioneered the unsuccessful <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> and conducted the first recording ever to be commercially released on CD: Richard Strauss's Eine Alpensinfonie.|$|R
5000|$|Digital Audio Tape (DAT or R-DAT) is {{a signal}} {{recording}} and playback medium developed by Sony and introduced in 1987. In appearance it {{is similar to a}} <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette,</b> using 3.81 mm / 0.15" [...] (commonly referred to as 4 mm) magnetic tape enclosed in a protective shell, but is roughly half the size at 73 mm × 54 mm × 10.5 mm. As the name suggests, the recording is digital rather than analog. DAT has the ability to record at higher, equal or lower sampling rates than a CD (48, 44.1 or 32 kHz sampling rate respectively) at 16 bits quantization. If a digital source is copied then the DAT will produce an exact clone, unlike other digital media such as <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> or non-Hi-MD MiniDisc, both of which use a lossy data reduction system.|$|R
50|$|MPEG-1 layer I {{was also}} used by the <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> format, {{in the form of}} the PASC audio {{compression}} codec. Because of the need of a steady stream of frames per second on a tape-based medium, PASC uses the rarely used (and under-documented) padding bit in the MPEG header to indicate that a frame was padded with 32 extra 0-bits (four 0-bytes) to change a short 416-byte frame into 420 bytes. The varying frame size only occurs when a 44.1 kHz 16-bit stereo audio signal is encoded at 384 kilobits per second, because the bitrate of the uncompressed signal is not an exact multiple of the bitrate of the compressed bit stream.|$|R
50|$|Interlock {{was formed}} in 1996 by guitarist, {{programmer}} and songwriter John Tyrell. Taking his influence from bands such as Fear Factory, My Dying Bride and Nine Inch Nails, he was joined by the co-founder, and only other consistent member, Syan (bass). A demo, which was later to become known as demo ‘97 was recorded on a 4 track and <b>Digital</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> and subsequently released in May 1997. Matthew Lee (vocals/lyrics/samples) and Syan, a friend of John, filling in on female vocals also featured on this demo. The band gained some attention from UK magazines and fanzines due {{to the use of}} electronics, male and female singers and the accompanying inlay; a full colour, photocopied, eight-page design from John and spray painted audio cassette.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cases that}} DCCs come in {{generally}} {{do not have the}} characteristic folding mechanism of those for analog <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes.</b> Instead, <b>DCC</b> cases tend to be simply plastic boxes that are open on one of the short sides. The front side has a hole that is almost the size of the cassette, so that any label on the cassette is exposed even when the cassette is in its case. This allows the user to slide the cassette {{into and out of the}} case with one hand, and it reduced production costs, especially for prerecorded cassettes, because a label is needed only for the cassette rather than for the case. Format partner Matsushita does, however, produce blank cassettes (under their Panasonic brand) with a clam-shell-style case. Because DCCs have no [...] "bulges" [...] near the tape access holes, there is more space in the case behind the cassette to insert, for example, a booklet for a prerecorded tape, or a folded up card on which users could write the contents of the tape. In spite of the differences, the outside measurements of the standard DCC cases are exactly identical to the cases of analog <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes,</b> so they can be used in existing storage systems. The Matsushita-designed clam-shell case is slightly thinner than an analog <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> case is.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a certain}} level of {{hesitation}} over the first single, [...] "I'm in the Mood" [...] (originally produced by Soulshock and Karlin) was picked to be the final leader—though as support for [...] "Searchin'", which would be separately delivered on vinyl only to DJs. [...] "I'm in the Mood" [...] did well by itself, and with a video accompanied by a hip-hop remix from M-Doc & Jere M.C. (better known as In Da Soul) the title was on singles reproduced by David Morales for the dance floor. The song spawned Peniston's fourth No. 1 (dethroning {{from the top of the}} US Dance chart Aretha Franklin's [...] "A Deeper Love") and peaked at No. 16 in UK (#32 in the Hot 100). I guess the title tells you where I'm coming from with the new album. It's like I Thought 'Ya Knew I could do it, that I was coming right backatcha, real and honest. —Peniston stated in her A&M biography On January 25, 1994, the album Thought 'Ya Knew, which was to represent Peniston's musical zenith at that time, arrived on all available formats, including <b>digital</b> <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes.</b> However, as the record promptly entered the music charts, it was soon to be evident Thought 'Ya Knew was not enjoying the high-profile success of her previous set Finally.

50|$|Philips' {{development}} of the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> in 1963 and Sony's {{development of}} the Walkman in 1979 led to widespread consumer use of magnetic audio tape. In 1990, the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> was the dominant format in mass-market recorded music. The development of Dolby noise reduction technology in the 1960s brought audiophile quality recording to the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> also contributing to its popularity.|$|R
