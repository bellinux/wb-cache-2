40|$|<b>Debranning</b> {{of wheat}} {{to remove the}} outer 7 % of the kernel, prior to {{grinding}} or milling reduced xylanase activity in wheat wholemeal and wheat endosperm flour by up to 80 and 60 %, respectively, whereas {{there was no significant}} reduction of xylanase inhibiting activity. Flours obtained after <b>debranning</b> and milling showed no major differences in moisture content, whereas ash content decreased and protein and arabinoxylan content decreased slightly with increasing <b>debranning</b> degree. Part of the xylanase activity in the flour was lost on addition of Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor (TAXI). Since TAXI specifically inhibits glycosyl hydrolase family 11 xylanases and since endogenous cereal xylanases belong exclusively to family 10, part of the xylanase activity in the flour is most likely of microbial origin. <b>Debranning</b> also significantly reduced alpha-amylase activities in wheat wholemeal and wheat flour. <b>Debranning</b> prior to milling can, therefore, impact on flour functionality.

40|$|The {{effects of}} two {{different}} pozole preparation processes, traditional (TP) and industrial (IP), on quality variables, chemical composition, and pasting properties of processed grain of nine maize landraces were evaluated. Nixtamalization and steeping time in TP (~ 15 [*]h) allowed more water absorption resulting in higher moisture content as well as softer <b>debranned</b> nixtamal relative to the <b>debranned</b> nixtamal produced by IP (52 [*]min). Steeping in TP and bleaching in IP increased the pasting temperature, peak viscosity, and time to peak viscosity of maize starch. Flowering time was shorter in IP (120 [*]min) and was significantly affected by the hardness of <b>debranned</b> nixtamal and bleached precooked grains. Total dry matter loss was higher in IP (> 10. 5 %) than in TP (< 5. 0 %), mainly due to the complete elimination of pedicel and pericarp by the Ca(OH) 2 + NaOH solution during cooking. Soft grains, with low test weight, {{a high proportion of}} floury endosperm, and high peak viscosity, are required to obtain higher yield of bleached precooked grains and soft flowered grains in both processes...|$|R

Black wheat variety Heibaoshi 1 had the highest total phenolic content (659. 8 μggallic acid equivalentsg− 1), total flavonoid content (319. 3 μgrutin equivalentsg− 1), and antioxidant activity, whereas light purple wheat variety Shandongzimai 1 had the lowest total flavonoid content (236. 2 μgrutin equivalentsg− 1) and antioxidant activity. Whole wheat flour and partially <b>debranned</b> grain flour had significantly higher total phenolic contents, total flavonoid contents, and antioxidant activity than refined flour (P< 0. 05). Compared with flour, total phenolic contents, total flavonoid contents and antioxidant activity decreased in noodles and steamed bread, whereas noodles had slightly higher total phenolic and flavonoid content than steamed bread. Antioxidant activities (by ferric reducing ability of plasma assay) of steamed bread made from whole wheat flour, partially <b>debranned</b> grain flour, and refined flour were 23. 5 %, 21. 1 %, and 31. 6 % lower, respectively, than the corresponding values of flour.

40|$|Wheat grain {{contains}} about 12 - 14 % of fibres mainly {{located in the}} outer layers. Moreover, the composition {{and the structure of}} fibres, as well as the nature and amount of co-passengers, varie according to the tissue where they are originated from. The aleurone layer is rich in low substituted arabinoxylans esterified to ferulic acid whereas outer pericarp contains highly substituted arabinoxylans but also cellulose and lignin. Therefore wheat fibres properties (such as enzymatic hydrolysis susceptibility, fermentescibility) showed a high variability according to their origin within the grain. Conventional milling technology allows fibres separation from the starchy endosperm (recovered in flour/semolina) to the outer layers (recovered in the bran fraction). However, this process is unable to sort out the various fibres encountered in the whole grain and its peripheral layers with a view to enhance positive nutritional effect. Accordingly, other processes have to be developed with the aim to produce fractions enriched with selected fibres within the outer layers. <b>Debranning</b> technology was studied in order to recover enriched dietary fibre fractions with contrasted composition and properties. At first, common and durum wheat were both processed at the pilot scale (300 kg/h) in order to identify any differences in tissue composition for similar <b>debranning</b> yield and to determine how tissues segregate during <b>debranning.</b> The influence of tempering and dehulling process on the <b>debranning</b> kinetics were analysed through a parametric study. Wheat grain tissue proportions were determined in each dehulled fraction by the marker methodology (Hemery et al., 2009) in order to assess the histological origin of fibres and their co-passengers. This quantitative analysis was related to a qualitative microscopic observation of debranned grains. It was then possible to follow the separation of each outer layer according to the <b>debranning</b> rate. Considering the wheat grain geometry no pure fraction of each tissue was obtained. However combination between markers methodology and <b>debranning</b> unit operations (friction and/or abrasion) allows obtaining enriched fractions either from pericarp or from aleurone layer. An optimised <b>debranning</b> diagram is proposed to produce contrasted fractions, in term of composition (pericarp amount vs aleurone layer amount), that could not be obtained in conventional mill streams. The potential interest of such fractions will be further evaluated on a nutritional point of view...|$|E
40|$|<b>Debranning</b> {{of wheat}} affects flour quality, {{initially}} by altering the breakage of wheat kernels during first break. The double normalized Kumaraswamy breakage function {{was applied to}} model the effect of <b>debranning</b> on wheat breakage during first break milling, in which type 1 breakage describes a relatively narrow distribution of midsized particles, whereas type 2 breakage describes a wide size range of predominantly small particles extending to very large particles. Mallacca (hard) and Consort (soft) wheats were debranned and milled at three roll gaps under sharp-to-sharp and dull-to-dull dispositions. Type 1 breakage increased at longer <b>debranning</b> times, whereas type 2 breakage decreased, for both wheat varieties under both dispositions. Sharp-to-sharp milling tended to produce more type 1 breakage than dull-to-dull. A mechanism of wheat breakage is proposed to explain the coproduction of very large and small particles via type 2 breakage and, hence, the effect of <b>debranning.</b> The proposed mechanism is that small particles of endosperm arise from scraping of large flat particles of wheat bran under the differential action of the rolls, such that removal of the bran reduces {{the production of the}} large bran particles and thus reduces the opportunity for the scraping mechanism that produces the very small particles...|$|E
40|$|The {{prebiotic}} {{potential of}} oat samples was investigated by in vitro shaker-flask anaerobic fermentations with human fecal cultures. The oat bran fraction {{was obtained by}} <b>debranning</b> and was compared with other carbon sources such as whole oat flour, glucose, and fructo-oligosaccharide. The oat bran fraction showed a decrease in culturable anaerobes and clostridia {{and an increase in}} bifidobacteria and lactobacilli populations. A similar pattern was observed in fructo-oligosaccharide. Butyrate production was higher in oat bran compared to glucose and similar to that in fructo-oligosaccharide. Production of propionate was higher in the two oat media than in fructo-oligosaccharide and glucose, which can be used as energy source by the liver. This study suggests that the oat bran fraction obtained by <b>debranning</b> is digested by the gut ecosystem and increases the population of beneficial bacteria in the indigenous gut microbiota.

At the same time, dough syruping was effectively suppressed. The onset of syruping was delayed from 3 d to more than 16 d, {{and the rate of}} syrup development was slowed. In addition, the dough showed better retention of consistency.

40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} Deoxynivalenol (DON) {{is one of}} several mycotoxins produced by certain Fusarium species that frequently infect wheat, corn, rice, oats, barley and other grains in the field or during storage. Guilan, Golestan and Mazandaran areas are located in the North Iran with favorite conditions for Fusarium growth. DON affects animal and human health causing vomiting, acute temporary nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and fever. Material and Methods In this study, a total of 96 wheat flour samples of different types were collected during summer 2013 from six flour mills in Northern Iran. All samples were analyzed for DON by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results DON was detected in 80 out of 96 wheat flour samples (83. 33 %), at levels ranging from 23 to 1270 µg/kg. The maximum contamination level of DON (1270 μg/kg) was found in whole flour while the minimum value (23 μg/kg) was registered in <b>debranned</b> flour. The mean of contamination was 630. 53 µg/kg. Conclusions According to results obtained, incidence and contamination levels of DON, seem to be a serious problem for public health. Therefore, cereal and cereal based foods should be controlled for the presence of toxins, storage conditions and moisture content, which is considered {{a major factor in the}} growth of the Fusarium fungi...|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{increasing}} demand for alternative fuel additives, the Canadian ethanol industry has grown tremendously. In Western Canada, wheat has been the dominant feedstock for ethanol production because of steadily increasing domestic production and higher ethanol yields. Low protein and high starch wheat varieties have further increased the potential of grain-based ethanol production. As a consequence, the increased ethanol production has demonstrated an exponential increase in the availability of its co-products. Depending on the processes used, several co-products are produced, such as bran, condensed distillers solubles (CDS), and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Wheat bran is obtained as the co-product when <b>debranning</b> is incorporated in ethanol production. <b>Debranning</b> of wheat feedstock may {{be integrated into the}} ethanol production process to improve ethanol quality and yield. <b>Debranning</b> follows the principles of abrasion and friction. It improves the starch content of the feedstock and the fermentation efficiency of the ethanol plants. Several abrasive equipment that generate products having good quality and desirable ethanol yield are being used commercially. Among these, the Satake mill and the tangential abrasive dehulling device (TADD) are prominent, having high <b>debranning</b> efficiency, levels of sanitation, and improved production rates. In this thesis, the laboratory <b>debranning</b> process using these two equipment was optimized by varying the process variables in order to improve the ethanol production process. In the Satake mill, the sample size (30 and 200 g), rotational speed (1215, 1412, and 1515 rpm), grit size (30, 36, and 40), and retention time (30, 60, and 90 s) were varied. In the TADD mill, the sample size (30 and 200 g), grit size (30, 36, 50, and 80), and retention time (120, 180, 240, and 300 s) were varied while maintaining a constant rotational speed of 900 rpm. The experimental results indicated that in the Satake mill, 200 g sample size, 1515 rpm rotational speed, 30 grit size, and 60 s retention time provided optimal <b>debranning</b> and starch separation efficiency. For the TADD mill, 200 g sample size, 900 rpm rotational speed, 50 grit size, and 240 s retention time provided optimal results. Increased availability of ethanol co-products from the pretreatments and other processes brings forth the need for broadening the areas of application of these co-products. Among the various applications, the usage of the co-products as animal feed is predominant. Ethanol co-products have been traditionally incorporated as ingredients for animal feed. This thesis is aimed at combining the wheat bran and CDS in varying proportions (70 : 30, 80 : 20, and 90 : 10) and producing high quality animal feed pellets. Laboratory-scale pelleting was done at varying pelleting temperatures, 60, 75, and 90 °C, to optimize the pelleting process. The results of laboratory-scale single pelleting indicated that 90 : 10 bran-CDS ratio and 90 °C pelleting temperature produced pellets having good physical properties. Pilot-scale pelleting was done to verify the optimized variables, and to produce dimensionally stable and highly durable feed pellets. The results showed that 70 : 30 bran-CDS mixture produced pellets with high nutrient content and physical properties (760. 88 ± 2. 04 kg/m 3 bulk density and 97. 79 ± 0. 76 % durability). Similar to the single pelleting results, high pelleting temperatures (75 °C) produced pellets with desirable physical properties. However, on cooling, the bulk density and durability change was the highest for 70 : 30 bran-CDS pellets, indicating an improvement in the physical characteristics. In conclusion, the bran and CDS, the two co-products of the ethanol industry, could be combined to produce feed pellets having good physical and nutritional properties...|$|E

Analyses of 81, 920 near infrared spectra followed by partial least squares data treatment enables determination of purity with respect to endosperm versus nonendosperm content for each individual pixel in the image. Heterogeneity is revealed by the resulting image, and a mathematical weighted summation provides the composite composition for the field of view. The advantages of the solid-state technology employed in this method include the high sensitivity of individual indium antimonide detector elements and the programmed electronic wavelength switching of the liquid crystal tunable filter, which operates with no moving parts. The organic chemical content of endosperm (primarily starch and protein) is compared to nonendosperm components (cell walls, aleurone, pericarp, etc.) using the vibrational spectroscopic response of different molecules within the solid mixture. This objective quantitative chemical imaging method was applied to determine the endosperm purity profile of 29 flour streams from a commercial flour mill in which the break system is preceded by a <b>debranning</b> operation. A cumulative flour endosperm purity plot reveals distinct changes in purity as successively less pure streams are incorporated to increase the yield. The sensitivity and chemical structure basis of the endosperm purity method described should be useful in assessing the effects of new equipment installation or significant changes in operational settings on the efficiency of a commercial milling process...|$|E

The wheat fractions, produced by conventional <b>debranning,</b> aleurone separation and a novel electrostatic process, were analysed for phytosterol contents using GC-FID and for steryl ferulate contents using HPLC-UV. The compounds were identified by GC- and LC-MS. Phytosterols and steryl ferulates were concentrated in the bran layers. The steryl ferulates were accumulated in the intermediate layers, whereas the phytosterols were more evenly distributed in the intermediate layers and aleurone cell contents. The phytosterol composition varied within the wheat kernel, while the steryl ferulate composition was similar in different fractions. Sitosterol and campestanyl ferulate were the main compounds. The highest levels of phytosterols (up to 2117 mu g/g) and steryl ferulates (up to 703 mu g) were found in the pearling, aleurone and certain bran fractions. The phytosterol-rich fractions could be utilised in cereal foods to enhance the intake of health-promoting compounds from natural sources. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

In Western countries, sorghum is {{utilized}} as animal feed but is a viable ingredient alternative in gluten-free foods and biofuels (O’Kennedy et al., 2006). The high level of phytochemicals in sorghum kernels {{is found in the}} bran and germ (Dykes 2 ̆ 6 Rooney, 2006). A range of phenolic compounds in sorghum offering antioxidant capacity (AOC) includes phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins and tannins (Awika 2 ̆ 6 Rooney, 2004). Phenolic compounds have been extracted from cereal grains using various techniques such as aqueous alcohol (Medina, 2011; Cuevas Montilla et al., 2011) and enzymes (Cuevas Montilla et al., 2011). However, these methods require grain kernels to be processed into meal or flour prior to analysis. Decortication, a mechanical method, is often cited as a means to isolate the phytochemical rich bran from the grain (Awika et al., 2005). Yet, decortication is an abrasive method of bran removal and may be less efficient for grains with a softer pericarp (Mwansaru et al., 1988). Researchers have reported success in using alkali solutions to remove bran and improve milling yields in corn (Blessin et al., 1970; Mistry 2 ̆ 6 Eckhoff, 1992), but in the literature, there are no available data concerning the evaluation of the waste streams obtained by a chemical <b>debranning</b> process for phenolic compounds.

40|$|Arabinoxylan {{is only a}} minor {{constituent}} in wheat. Nevertheless, it can have a determining impact on wheat processing or on final product yield or quality, hence the use of xylanases to optimize wheat applications. In the last 20 years knowledge on xylanase functionality has been gradually building up. The presence and impact of wheat kernel associated xylanases has, however, largely been overlooked and was the object of several studies. Results of these studies indicated that xylanases associated with wheat kernels consist of wheat endogenous xylanases {{on one hand and}} kernel-associated microbial endoxylanases on the other hand. Levels and ratios between different types of enzymes were shown to vary significantly with harvest year and wheat variety. In some cases, wheat kernel-associated microbial endoxylanases accounted for over 90 % of the total wheat-associated xylanase activity. The impact of these xylanases on two systems, i. e. refrigerated doughs subjected to longer term storage and wheat bread doughs subjected to a normal fermentation process, was investigated. Using <b>debranning</b> as a tool to remove the majority of kernel-associated microbial xylanases prior to milling, we were able to show that the onset and extent of dough syruping (the undesirable appearance of a brown liquid) during refrigerated dough storage was drastically reduced when using flour samples which contained reduced levels of xylanases. In normal bread doughs, mainly inhibition insensitive endogenous xylanases were active, and led to increased solubilization of arabinoxylan in the dough, probably affecting the end product. In conclusion, we can say that wheat kernel associated xylanases should not be neglected and that they can add to batch to batch and year to year variability in performance of wheat. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The organic {{bread wheat}} {{market has been}} diversified over time through the {{emergence}} of different sale channels. Processors require organic bread wheat of higher quality and safety {{in order to meet}} the consumers’ demand. The overall objective of the AGTEC-Org project was to identify agronomical and technological ways to improve the performance of organic wheat and flour. The findings would contribute to enhanced baking quality and nutritional value of organic flour, as well as prevention of mycotoxin contamination. The project involved 9 research centers or universities from 5 European countries for a total budget of about 1. 5 million €. More than 400 experimental treatments were analyzed from 23 agronomic trials and 4 lab-experiments on food technology. Choice of cultivar is an efficient way to obtain higher grain quality. Intercropping legumes (grain or forage) improves weed control and N availability for wheat crop or succeeding crop. Green manure can be an effective alternative to farmyard manure. Fertilization with organic fertilizers improves yield and quality when water is available. Reduced tillage affects soil fertility and wheat yield but has little effects on grain quality. Milling process strongly influences flour characteristics. Stone milling improves the nutritive value and flour characteristics remain very stable independently of the milling yield. However, stone milling slightly raises DON levels. Characteristics of flour produced by means of roller milling appear very dependent on milling yield, instead. Increasing milling yield with the aim of enriching nutritional quality has a detrimental effect on either safety (DON) or bread-making quality (bread volume). <b>Debranning</b> before milling has a very positive impact on flour safety by reducing its DON content by 50...|$|E
40|$|Cereal {{processes}} {{were long}} optimised for products containing only grain endosperm. So the milling {{technology has been}} improved over the centuries {{for the production of}} white flour or semolina as a major product exhibiting excellent functional and sanitary properties for second transformation. However, {{a large part of the}} bioactive compounds of the grain that are preferentially located in the outer layers is thus excluded from the mass cereal foods. The manufacture of whole grain products (or inclusion of whole bran in flours) constitutes a possible response to better exploit the grain nutritional potential but with some limitations. The breadmaking functionality of whole grain flours makes it difficult to manufacture diversified and appealing products for consumers. Also the outermost layers of the grains may contain some contaminants which are detrimental to the sanitary quality of the flours. At last, the bioactive compounds exhibit in general a poor availability as they are trapped in the cellular fibrous structures of the enveloppes. Revising the conventional grain fractionation processes in considering the properties and potential of all its different parts and tissues will aim at producing new healthy functional ingredients for cereal-based food products of high sensory quality. New tools designed to gain a better understanding of grain tissue structure and their behaviour upon processing are necessary to develop and optimize a new grain fractionation technology. For example, the combination of milling and <b>debranning</b> monitored by a grain tissue marker methodology can allow to tailor flours with different levels of peripheral layers inclusion, quantitatively and qualitatively. The by-products from the milling industry (brans) can be exploited also as a source of healthy ingredients. They can undergo different cracking diagrams using advanced technologies of grinding and separation, to result in concentrates of grain tissues or sub-fractions of contrasted functional properties with improved availability of bioactives...|$|E
40|$|The EU-project HEALTHGRAIN has {{suggested}} a new definition for whole grain which allows {{a small part}} of the grain to be removed during processing. By removing the outer part or the grain the hygienic quality will increase but it is not clear how the taste and colour is affected. So therefore in this study three different <b>debranning</b> methods, peeling, pearling and polishing, which remove the outer parts of the grains have been used on common and durum wheat. The dietary fibre and ash content, as well as germination was analysed in untreated, peeled, pearled and polished grains. The decrease in dietary fibre and ash was higher in grains that had been pearled compared to those that had been peeled or polished. With approximately 2 % of the grain removed there was a 4. 2 – 12. 2 % decrease in dietary fibre content for the pearled samples while the peeled sample had a decrease of 2. 4 % and the content was not affected by polishing. Peeling seems to be a more gentle process compared to pearling and will preserve most of the dietary fibres and keep the aleurone layer intact which will give a more nutritious end-product. To get an indication of how the different milling techniques affects colour and taste of the end-product and if these processes are of interest as a raw material for the next generation of whole grain products, a small sensory test was performed on pasta produced in a pilot scale from unteated, pearled ( 2. 5 %) and peeled samples. The sensory test was small but gave an indication that the pasta produced from wheat where approximately 2 % of the grain had been removed tasted slightly better than the pasta made from untreated wheat. The colour analysis of the pasta flour showed that the flour got a brighter colour with a higher degree of removal with peeling or pearling. Bran from different producers was also analysed to investigate if there is a natural variation in dietary fibre content in wheat. The results obtained from this investigation on bran showed a wide variation of dietary fibre content from 37 - 50 % and the ash content varied from 4 - 7 %...|$|E
40|$|Wheat bran, a {{co-product}} of {{the industrial}} roller milling of wheat, {{can be added to}} food products such as bread because of its nutritional profile and physiological effects. However, incorporation of wheat bran in bread systems can negatively affect final product quality. Next to possible taste issues, bran-enriched bread modifies crumb texture and shows a lower loaf volume as compared to white bread. Some intrinsic bran properties are believed to play a considerable role in this quality reduction. These properties can be either physical, chemical or biochemical in nature. However, the actual contribution and relative importance of each of these properties to decreased bread quality is a matter of debate. To counteract the negative effects of bran on bread quality, bran-enriched products can be supplemented with gluten, emulsifiers or other improvers, which are generally relatively expensive. Clear understanding of the relationship between bran composition and structure, bran properties and bran impact on bread making is, however, still missing. Against this background, this dissertation investigates the relationship between intrinsic bran properties and their effect on bread making, and aims to provide insight in the causes of the quality loss upon incorporation of bran in bread. To this end, bran fractions differing in intrinsic properties were produced using either a roller milling or a pearling process, and related to their effect on bread making. Both processes were used to obtain bran fractions with different properties, and were themselves not studied in detail in this dissertation. Next to this, more in-depth research into the impact of the physical presence of wheat bran particles and bran water binding capacity during bran-enriched bread making was executed. In a first experimental part of this thesis, the properties of bran fractions, produced by roller milling or by pearling and their impact on bread making was investigated. With both explorative approaches, a first view was obtained on the relationship between bran constituents, enzyme activity levels, steric hindrance, and hydration properties on the one hand, and bread volume and textural quality on the other hand. Four industrial roller milling fractions - coarse bran, coarse weatings, fine weatings, and low grade flour - were studied. All co-products differed in chemical composition, enzyme activity levels, particle size, and hydration properties. To relate these properties with the effect of co-products on bread making, meals consisting of flour and co-products were composed on a same overall starch level to compensate for differences in endosperm contamination in the co-products. While uncommon, this approach seemed appropriate here, as the co-products differed strongly in botanical bran content. Bread specific volume was more strongly depressed with fine weatings and low grade flour than with coarse bran and coarse weatings. While this suggests that the properties of the former were intrinsically more detrimental to bread volume than those of the latter, it was not clear which properties were responsible for this, as the variability between the different co-products was relatively high. More insight in the contribution of bran properties on bread quality was gained when wheat bran was mechanically treated through abrasive pearling (also referred to as <b>debranning).</b> Pearling is a more specific, bran-directed treatment than roller milling, producing bran fractions with a similar particle size distribution (in contrast to the different milling co-products), but with a broader variation in other properties amongst each other. Pearling fractions P 0 - 3 %, P 3 - 6 %, P 6 - 9 % and P 9 - 12 %, obtained after pearling to 3, 6, 9 and 12 % by weight, strongly differed in composition, hydration properties, enzymatic load, and chemical reactivity. Pericarp-rich fraction P 0 - 3 %, having the highest water binding capacity among the fractions, had the most adverse effects on bread quality, whereas addition of aleurone-rich fraction P 6 - 9 %, having low water binding capacities, had less adverse effects on bread properties. To investigate the contribution of bran-associated enzymes on bread quality loss, a heat treated versus a native P 0 - 3 % fraction, the latter having a high bran-associated enzymatic activity, were compared. The results showed that bran-associated enzymes can clearly affect both the Hagberg Falling Number of meal and bread crumb textural properties. The reducing power of bran-associated chemical components, finally, is probably less determinative as compared to other properties. Overall, results from {{the first part of the}} experimental work suggested that bran hydration is a key element that determines its impact on bread making, but further research was needed in this dissertation to confirm and underpin this. Hence, in a second part of this dissertation, the effect of hydration properties and the steric effect of bran particles on different parts of the bread making process were studied more in-depth. Regular coarse and ground bran, synthetic bran-like particles with no water binding capacity, and pericarp-enriched bran particles were incorporated in a bread recipe, and their effect on bread making was studied. Dough with synthetic bran displayed a near to normal oven rise and resulted in a smaller loaf volume decrease as compared to the breads containing regular and pericarp-enriched bran, strengthening the hypothesis that water binding by bran affects the bread making process the most. Besides, grinding of regular bran and synthetic bran did not change their impact compared to coarse particles, suggesting that steric hindrance by the physical presence of bran particles is of less importance. Finally, the molecular mobility of water and biopolymers in coarse, ground, and pericarp-enriched wheat bran and refined flour was studied using time-domain proton nuclear magnetic resonance (TD 1 H NMR) relaxometry, and related to their hydration properties. These insights were used to assess water mobility and biopolymer behavior during bran-enriched bread making and subsequent storage. Bran incorporation in dough resulted in a progressive immobilization of water during dough resting, which was not observed in the white control dough. This could be linked to changes in evolution of dough height during fermentation and oven rise. This, together with modified starch gelatinization behavior upon baking, seems at least partly responsible for the lower loaf volume and inferior crumb texture properties in bran-rich breads. Textural quality during storage was less affected for bran-rich bread compared to wheat flour bread. The latter could be principally attributed to retardation of amylopectin retrogradation during bread storage in the presence of bran. In conclusion, this dissertation studied the functional relevance and contribution to quality loss of the enzymatic load, chemical reactivity, steric hindrance and water binding capacity of wheat bran in bran-enriched bread making. Bran-associated enzymes did not affect loaf volume when fermentable substrate was abundantly present, but were functionally relevant with regard to Hagberg Falling Number and crumb textural properties. Reducing compounds from bran had limited impact on bread making. The hydration properties of bran are believed to be a key element in the deleterious effect of bran on bread quality. This could be due to modifications in dough rheology during leavening and starch gelatinization behavior during baking, leading to a negligible oven rise when flour is replaced by bran. This effect was independent of the size of bran particles. The knowledge of the actual contribution and functional relevance of bran properties during bread making obtained in this dissertation allows bran-centered approaches to enhance the nutritional value and physiological benefits of bread with mitigated quality loss. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Variations in wheat quality are {{of major}} {{concern for the}} wheat {{processing}} industry, as they require both small continuous and large year-to-year adaptations of processing conditions and alter end-product quality. Such quality variations are not only caused by genetic differences between wheat varieties, but also often depend strongly on climatological and agronomic circumstances. Because of the great economical importance, considerable effort has already been made to elucidate the effects of genetic, climatological and agronomic conditions on gluten protein contents and quality and on α-amylase activity levels. The impact of varying levels of wheat associated endoxylanases as possible contributors to differences in wheat functionality is not known. This is rather surprising, as their potential importance can be easily demonstrated. On the one hand, microbial endoxylanases are frequently added in diverse wheat processing applications, albeit often on an empirical basis. On the other hand, recent research at the Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Biochemistry (K. U. Leuven) revealed that flour associated endoxylanase levels can vary more than twentyfold {{and that they are}} able to impact product quality. Furthermore, some preliminary evidence was provided for the presence of microbial endoxylanases in wheat (flour), and their levels are most likely strongly underestimated due to the large concentrations of endoxylanase inhibitors present in wheat (flour), interfering with activity measurements. The endoxylanase activity levels measured so far in wheat (flour) should therefore be considered as apparent activity levels. To fill this gap and to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the varying functionality of wheat flour in biotechnological applications, the distribution and variability of wheat associated endoxylanases were investigated, as well as their functionality during the bread making process. As all methods commonly used to measure endoxylanase activity levels in wheat were expected to underestimate the actual levels, a method was developed to quantify all wheat associated endoxylanases in an adequate way. The method is based on a physical separation of microbial endoxylanases from endogenous endoxylanases and endoxylanase inhibitors by washing of wheat kernels, followed by classic endoxylanase activity measurements. The total wheat associated endoxylanase activity levels can be calculated as the sum of the endoxylanase activity level in the washing liquid, corresponding to the microbial endoxylanase population, and that in the washed kernels, corresponding to the endogenous endoxylanase population. The developed method does not only allow estimation of the total endoxylanase activity levels, but also assessment of the relative contributions of microbial and endogenous endoxylanases to this total endoxylanase activity level. The results indicated that a large discrepancy exists between the commonly measured apparent endoxylanase activity levels and the total wheat associated endoxylanase activity levels due to the presence of a vast majority of inhibition sensitive microbial endoxylanases in wheat. With the developed method, the variability in both microbial and endogenous endoxylanase activity levels in wheat as a function of genetic, climatological and agronomic factors was analyzed. Genotype was the most important determinant for the variability in microbial endoxylanase activity levels, while the interaction between harvest year and genotype mainly determined the variations in endogenous endoxylanase activity levels. The impact of harvest year on the observed variability is, most likely, due to differences in the climatological conditions preceding the time of harvest. Furthermore, it was clear that agronomic factors, such as fungicide treatment and nitrogen fertilization, only had small effects on the levels of wheat associated endoxylanase activities. The variability in the arabinoxylan (AX) and endoxylanase inhibitor contents was also studied and was found to be mainly caused by genetic differences. Selection of appropriate wheat varieties can hence be an effective tool in reducing the problems associated with such variability. The distribution of endoxylanases over different wheat milling streams was investigated, together with the distribution of AX and endoxylanase inhibitors, and more standard parameters, such as ash, starch and protein contents and α-amylase activity levels. Bran fractions were significantly richer in endoxylanase activity levels and in AX and endoxylanase inhibitor contents than germ and, even more so, than flour fractions. Endoxylanase activity levels varied enormously between the different flour fractions and were strongly positively correlated with ash and negatively with starch content. This indicates that the endoxylanase activity level in wheat flour largely depends on the level of bran contamination and that microbial and/or aleurone specific endoxylanases, located on or in the outer wheat kernel layers, can end up as a contamination in wheat flour. As endoxylanase activity levels vary widely in wheat and wheat flour, the impact of varying levels of endoxylanase activity in wheat flour on the AX population in dough after mixing and resting was studied. AX solubilization during the mixing phase of bread making resulted from physical phenomena. Enzymic solubilization hardly took place, most likely due to the relatively short mixing time. During the dough resting phase, the levels of solubilized AX and reducing xylose formed were correlated well with the endoxylanase activity level of the flour, indicating AX hydrolysis by wheat flour associated endoxylanases. The effects of wheat flour associated endoxylanases on the AX population during dough and bread making were mainly caused by endogenous endoxylanases. The contribution of microbial endoxylanases was generally limited which can be explained by either a limited contamination of wheat flour with microbial enzymes during milling or by an extensive inactivation of these microbial endoxylanases that end up as contamination in wheat flour by endoxylanase inhibitors. The potential effects of all microbial endoxylanases present on wheat kernels were much larger, implying much larger variability problems in whole meal wheat processing applications.
