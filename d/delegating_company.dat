40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{produced}} {{in order to make}} steps in the field of parametric design for engineering. Currently there is a wide variety of tools available of made within companies. But they commonly lack the possibility for iterating and teamwork. Furthermore many of these scripts make use of optimization. However the conditions are often not specified, which results in nontransparent decision making. The result {{can be used as a}} way to identify possibilities in the manufacturing of geometrically complex projects. It will give insight in the combination of different design considerations with a focus on engineering aspects. It will streamline the process to compare different outcomes and priorities. The specific challenges will be used to draw a more general conclusion. Approach to these challenges is a symbiosis of case studies and surveys. The results and experiences from these aspects will be combined to develop a general workflow proposal and a more specific workflow for the <b>delegated</b> <b>company.</b> The case studies come from the portfolio of Royal IHC Architectural Fabrication. The three cases have an increasingly complexity in their challenges. These cases are analyzed to distill their key opportunities for optimization. Following a parametric strategy is developed and described to measure these goals. This can be a combination of objective and subjective goals, which created the need for human consideration. The results of this analysis are then compared by recording the genome and fitness data. The data is visualized in coordinate systems, that assist in making decisions. Filters are then be applied to either the parameters or the fitness in order to find a spectrum for further assessment. The surveys were taken at a spectrum of companies related to architectural design. To create the material for the surveys, draft results of the case studies were used. The surveys takers were confronted with the results the optimizations and asked to respond in respect to the used strategy. The first survey was taken during the time of the running case studies. This way results could directly be implemented in the research. The second survey was done with the results in retrospect. A draft of the proposed workflow was presented and explained. Takers responded with their professional opinion on this strategic matter. The proposed strategy is based on a layered structure. Optimize and review using the three different categories. By clearly visualizing the date all solutions can be considered properly. Furthermore, create a workflow library that is company or project specific. Make use of this library in a structured script. Streamline data integration with other programs by deciding on the right amount of collaboration. Architecture and The Built EnvironmentArchitectural Engineering +Technolog...|$|R

The views presented have been compiled through a number of interviews with representatives of both, large companies and standards setting organisations.

40|$|The {{standardization}} {{landscape in}} the Information and Communication technology industries is fragmented {{in many different}} standardization bodies, industry consortia, and alliances. Some of these coalitions cooperate with each other, while others compete. The existence of competing standardization coalitions may prevent coordination on a common standard. There {{is a lot of}} debate among practitioners and analysts about whether this fragmentation creates a coordination failure. This paper takes a middle ground in this debate. Competition between standardization coalitions may indeed harm compatibility, but it also helps to mitigate coordination failures within standardization bodies and coalitions. The negotiation process in a coalition can cause coordination failures of its own. An important failure is lack of timeliness, due to delaying tactics by <b>company</b> <b>delegates</b> in the coalition. Introducing competition between coalitions can speed up negotiations within them, and thus help to overcome this intracommittee coordination failure. A game theoretic model explores the effect of competition between coalitions on the speed of decision-making and standardization. ...|$|R
25|$|Since 2000, the {{government}} has increasingly relied on {{the private sector to}} operate water and sanitation infrastructure, beginning with desalination and wastewater treatment plants. Since the creation of the National Water Company (NWC) in 2008, the operation of urban water distribution systems in the four largest cities has gradually been <b>delegated</b> to private <b>companies</b> as well. The apparent paradox of very low water tariffs and water privatization is explained by government subsidies. The government buys desalinated water from private operators at high prices and resells the bulk water for free. Likewise, {{the government}} directly pays private operators that run the water distribution and sewer systems of large cities under management contracts. Furthermore, it fully subsidizes investments in water distribution and sewers. Water utilities are expected to recover an increasing share of their costs from the sale of treated effluent to industries. In January 2016 water and sewer tariffs were increased {{for the first time in}} more than a decade, which resulted in discontent and in the sacking of the Minister of Water and Energy Abdullah Al-Hussayen in April 2016.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Earlier {{studies suggest}} that the quality of {{handling}} occupational health and safety (OHS) activities differs between companies of different sizes. Company size is a proxy variable for other variables affecting OHS performance. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate if there is an association between company size and perceptions of work environment prioritizations. METHODS: Data from 106 small- and medium-sized Swedish manufacturing companies was collected. One manager and one safety <b>delegate</b> at each <b>company</b> rated different aspects of their companies' work environment prioritizations with a 43 -item questionnaire. Ratings were aggregated to a summary statistic for each company before analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences in perceptions of priority were found to be associated with company sizes. This is in contrast to earlier studies of objective differences. The respondents in small companies, however, showed significantly greater consensus in their ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Company size does not appear to be associated with perceptions of work environment prioritizations. Company size is an important proxy variable to study in order to understand what factors enable and obstruct safe and healthy workplaces. The work presented here should be viewed as an initial exploration to serve as direction for future academic work...|$|R

About 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and 10% from surface water,especially in the mountainous southwest of the country. The capital Riyadh, located {{in the heart of the}} country, is supplied with desalinated water pumped from the Persian Gulf over a distance of 467 km. Given the substantial oil wealth,water is provided almost for free. Despite improvements service qualityremains poor. For example, in Riyadh water was available only once every 2.5 days in 2011, while in Jeddah it is available only every 9 days. Institutional capacity and governancein the sector are weak, reflecting general characteristics of the public sector in Saudi Arabia. Since 2000, the government has increasingly relied on the private sector to operate water and sanitation infrastructure, beginning with desalination and wastewater treatment plants. Since 2008, the operation of urban water distribution systems is being gradually <b>delegated</b> to private <b>companies</b> as well.|$|R
