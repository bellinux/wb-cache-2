40|$|Abstract. Tactile {{displays}} {{are used}} to convey small-scale pressure and shape information to the <b>finger</b> <b>tip.</b> Our device designs include a 1 x 10 pin display using shape-memory alloy actuators and a 6 x 6 pin display using inexpensive commercially available servomotor-gearhead packages. Our human factors studies suggest that bandwidths of about 30 Hz are required for free exploratory motions with pin-based displays, and that perception and task performance can be assisted through signal processing algorithms that compensate for the artificial interactions between the display and <b>finger</b> <b>tip.</b> One promising application area is surgery, where relaying tactile information to the surgeon’s <b>finger</b> <b>tip</b> from within the patient’s body may enhance minimally invasive procedures. ...|$|R
25|$|In humans, {{the distal}} pads are wider {{than in other}} {{primates}} because the soft tissues of the finger tip are attached to a horseshoe-shaped edge on the underlying bone, and, in the grasping hand, the distal pads can therefore conform to uneven surfaces while pressure is distributed more evenly in the <b>finger</b> <b>tips.</b> The distal pad of the human thumb is divided into a proximal and a distal compartment, the former more deformable than the latter, which allows the thumb pad to mold around an object.|$|E
25|$|ADRs {{can include}} {{enlargement}} of the gums, convulsions, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, hypercholesterolemia, dyspnea, numbness and tingling particularly of the lips, pruritus, high blood pressure, potassium retention possibly leading to hyperkalemia, kidney and liver dysfunction (nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity), burning sensations at <b>finger</b> <b>tips,</b> and an increased vulnerability to opportunistic fungal and viral infections. In short, it is nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, {{increases the risk of}} squamous cell carcinoma and infections, and often causes hypertension (due to renal vasoconstriction and increased sodium reabsorption). The latter may result in serious adverse cardiovascular events; thus it is recommended that prescribers find the lowest effective dose for people requiring long term treatment. Ciclosporin also causes {{enlargement of the}} gums and increased hair growth which is not seen with tacrolimus (another calcineurin inhibitor).|$|E
25|$|The borrindo is {{a simple}} hollow clay ball with three to four {{fingering}} holes, one hole slightly larger than the other three, which are smaller and of equal size to one another. The holes are arranged in an isosceles triangular form. The borrindo {{is made out of}} soft alluvial clay available in plenty everywhere in the central Indus Valley. Being of the simplest design, it is made even by children. Some adults make fine borrindos of larger size, put pottery designs on them, and bake them. These baked borrindos, with pottery designs, are the later evolved forms of this musical instrument, which appears to have previously been used in its simple unbaked form for a long time. The sound notes are produced by blowing somewhat horizontally into the larger hole. <b>Finger</b> <b>tips</b> are placed on smaller holes to regulate the notes. Its ease of play makes it popular among children and the youth.|$|E

25|$|These basic shapes are {{modified}} {{with lines}} jutting from {{their faces and}} corners to represent fingers that are not positioned as described above. Straight lines represent straight fingers (these may be {{at an angle to}} indicate that they are not in line with the palm; if they point toward or away from the signer, they have a diamond shape at the tip); curved lines for curved (cupped) fingers; hooked lines for hooked fingers; right-angle lines, for fingers bent at only one joint; and crossed lines, for crossed fingers, as shown in the chart at right. The pentagon and C are only modified to show that the fingers are spread rather than in contact; the angle is only modified to show whether the thumb touches the <b>finger</b> <b>tips</b> or juts out to the side. Although there are some generalizations which can be made for the dozens of other glyphs, which are based on the circle and square, the details are somewhat idiosyncratic and each needs to be memorized.|$|E

500|$|The group {{worked well}} with German {{producer}} Conny Plank on Whodini, and {{were trying to}} find a similar producer. According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of how to explain it to these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we decided that we needed to get somebody from [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his <b>finger</b> <b>tips</b> ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E

40|$|Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) {{was used}} to study skin blood flow in the <b>finger</b> <b>tip</b> and on the dorsum of the hand in healthy volunteers. Vasodilatation in the <b>finger</b> <b>tip</b> was induced by {{immersing}} the arm in water at 42 degrees C, and vasodilatation in the dorsum of the hand by intracutaneous injection of dihydralazine. Simultaneous measurements were performed using venous occlusion plethysmography (<b>finger</b> <b>tip)</b> and 133 Xe clearance (dorsum of hand). Three output signals from the laser Doppler flowmeter were recorded. The LDFPf- 1 value is linearly related to the blood flow, provided the concentration of blood cells in the scattering volume is low. The LDFPf- 2 value is generated by a signal processor designed to give linearity even at higher concentrations of moving blood cells (CMBC), the latter quantity being reflected by the CMBC value. During vasodilatation by immersion, all laser Doppler values from the <b>finger</b> <b>tip</b> increased but less than the total finger blood flow as measured using venous occlusion plethysmography. Intracutaneous injection of dihydralazine in the dorsum of the hand caused markedly increased CMBC values {{and the increase in}} LDFPf- 2 was significantly greater than that of LDFPf- 1. The increase in 133 Xe clearance was less pronounced. The results indicate that capillary blood flow as well as blood flow in vessels below the capillary level contribute to the Doppler signal. However, flow through the arteriovenous shunts in the <b>finger</b> <b>tip</b> seems to be only partially registered by the laser Doppler technique. The higher the CMBC value, the more obvious is the difference between LDFPf- 1 and LDFPf- 2 values. When using laser Doppler flowmetry, the addition of CMBC value registration may be helpful in clarifying changes in microvascular blood flow...|$|R

2500|$|There is a {{practice}} in many Orthodox communities {{to wash the}} hands before reciting birkat hamazon. This practice is called mayim acharonim (final waters). It is held that this, though a chovah (duty), is not a mitzvah (a commandment), as the practice was instituted for health reasons (specifically, to avoid the danger of touching the eyes with harmful salts). There is therefore no blessing said for this washing. A special ritual dispenser {{can be used to}} dispense the water, but does not need to be. [...] Although the practice is based on a ruling recorded in the Talmud, whether or not this ruling is still binding is a matter of dispute among various Orthodox communities, given that the practice of eating with knives and forks seems to remove the practical reason for it. [...] Some practice it as a binding halachah, others as an optional custom, and others do not practice it at all. [...] Among those who do practice mayim acharonim, the majority simply pour a small amount of water over their <b>finger</b> <b>tips</b> (note that according to the Mishna Berurah, this does not fulfill the terms of the obligation at all but according to the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch(43:1) [...] one [...] "need not wash the entire hand.

40|$|The use of Infrared Thermography to {{diagnose}} circulatory {{problems in the}} hands {{is based upon the}} assumption that a change in skin temperature can be related to a change in skin blood flow.

The resultant reactive hyperaemia with associated skin erythemia was monitored on the forearm and <b>finger</b> <b>tip</b> of the 2 nd digit with Infrared Thermography (IR) and with Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF). Following vascular stasis clear increases in skin perfusion as measured with LDF were seen at both the <b>finger</b> <b>tip</b> and forearm.
