5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor <b>enantioselectivity,</b> or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. The trouble stems from {{the need for a}} nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a second coordinating group on the substrate enhances <b>enantioselectivity</b> {{in a number of}} cases. C-Acyl hydrazones are hydrogenated with much higher <b>enantioselectivity</b> than the corresponding C-alkyl hydrazones, for instance.|$|E
25|$|In bis(oxazoline) {{complexes}} {{the metal}} is held {{close to the}} stereogenic centres, which will strongly influence the <b>enantioselectivity</b> of any process taking place there. However the C2‑symmetry of the ligand is also important in controlling this <b>enantioselectivity.</b>|$|E

25|$|N-Alkyl imines are {{generally}} more difficult to reduce with high <b>enantioselectivity</b> than N-aryl imines. Most catalyst systems that reduce N-alkyl imines enantioselectively are based on rhodium(I) or ruthenium(II).|$|E

25|$|Metolachlor is {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in the widely used herbicide Dual Magnum®. A key step in its industrial production involves the enantioselective reduction of an N-aryl imine.

Carreira has described particularly useful asymmetric methodology with silyl ketene acetals, noteworthy for its high levels of <b>enantioselectivity</b> and wide substrate scope.|$|E
25|$|Because the substituents {{attached}} to the imine nitrogen exert a profound influence on reactivity, few general catalyst systems exist for the enantioselective hydrogenation of imines and imine derivatives.

25|$|Many {{synthetic}} catalysts {{have been}} able to successfully employ this strategy to activate a variety of electrophiles. Using a chiral BINOL catalyst, for instance, the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction involving the addition of enones to aldehydes can be effected with high <b>enantioselectivity.</b> The nucleophile is an enolate-type species generated from the conjugate addition of PEt3 to the enone, and adds enantioselectively to the aldehyde coordinated to catalyst.|$|E
25|$|This {{transition}} state likely {{occurs because}} of favorable pi-stacking with the phenyl substituent. The <b>enantioselectivity</b> {{of the process}} is facilitated from the diene approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the phenyl substituent. The Diels-Alder reaction {{is one of the}} most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of natural products using the Diels-Alder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of six-membered rings(scheme 18).|$|E
25|$|The most-general {{method of}} {{asymmetric}} pyridine hydrogenation {{is actually a}} heterogeneous method, where asymmetry is generated from a chiral oxazolidinone bound to the C2 position of the pyridine.

25|$|Homochiral MOFs {{have been}} made by Lin and {{coworkers}} using 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl (BINAP), 1,1′-bi-2,2′-naphthol (BINOL) as a chiral ligands. These ligands can coordinate with catalytically active metal sites to enhance the <b>enantioselectivity.</b> A variety of linking groups such as pyridine, phosphonic acid, and carboxylic acid can be selectively introduced to the 3,3′, 4,4′, and the 6,6′ positions of the 1,1'-binaphthyl moiety. Moreover, by changing the length of the linker ligands the porosity and framework structure of the MOF can be selectivily tuned.|$|E
25|$|The use of cation-pi {{interactions}} {{has also}} been successfully implemented in reactions with synthetic catalysts. A combination of anion-binding and cation-pi strategies {{can be used to}} effect enantioselective cationic polycyclizations. In the transition state, it is proposed that the thiourea group binds chloride, while the aromatic system stabilizes the associated polyene cation. In support of this, increasing the size of the aromatic ring leads to improvements both in yield and stereoselectivity. The <b>enantioselectivity</b> correlates well with both the polarizability and the quadrupole moment of the aryl group.|$|E
25|$|The ideal {{conditions}} for imine hydrogenation {{depend on the}} nature of the substrate and catalyst system. Generally, higher pressures of hydrogen gas are needed in order to achieve reasonable reaction times; however, hydrogen pressure does not appreciably affect <b>enantioselectivity.</b> If the active catalyst is generated in situ, Schlenck techniques or a glove box should be employed. Parr shakers may be used for reaction pressures up to 4 bar, although precise temperature control is difficult to achieve in the reaction vessel. For higher hydrogen pressures, specialized autoclave equipment is required.|$|E

40|$|Various chiral zinc(II) {{complexes}} catalyze the asymmetric 1, 4 -addition of Grignard reagents to α,β-unsaturated ketones {{with high}} chemoselectivities (yields of 1, 4 -adducts, 83 - 99 %), high regioselectivities (1, 4 / 1, 2 ratios up to 499) and modest <b>enantioselectivities</b> (ee up to 33 %). A study of several factors, i. e. ligand, solvent, counterions, order {{and rate of}} additions, temperature, {{and the nature of}} Grignard reagents, that influence the regio- and <b>enantioselectivities</b> is given. Based on the addition of isopropylmagnesium halides to 2 -cyclohexenone as a model reaction, it was established that the highest <b>enantioselectivities</b> are reached with in situ prepared zinc complexes derived from optically active diamino alcohol ligands using lithium bases in tetrahydrofuran as the solvent. A mechanistic rationalization is given. ...|$|R
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is known as}} the Hajos-Parrish reaction (also known as the Hajos-Parrish-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction, referring to a contemporaneous report from Schering of the reaction under harsher conditions). Under the Hajos-Parrish conditions only a catalytic amount of proline is necessary (3mol%). There is no danger of an achiral background reaction because the transient enamine intermediates are much more nucleophilic than their parent ketone enols. This strategy offers a simple way of generating <b>enantioselectivity</b> in reactions without using transition metals, which have the possible disadvantages of being toxic or expensive.|$|E
25|$|Chirality {{is another}} {{property}} that a DNAzyme can exploit. DNA occurs in {{nature as a}} right-handed double helix and in asymmetric synthesis a chiral catalyst is a valuable tool in the synthesis of chiral molecules from an achiral source. In one application an artificial DNA catalyst was prepared by attaching a copper ion to it through a spacer. The copper - DNA complex catalysed a Diels-Alder reaction in water between cyclopentadiene and an aza chalcone. The reaction products (endo and exo) {{were found to be}} present in an enantiomeric excess of 50%. Later it was found that an enantiomeric excess of 99% could be induced, and that both the rate and the <b>enantioselectivity</b> were related to the DNA sequence.|$|E
25|$|Conversely to {{the case}} of olefins, {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation of enamines has favoured diphosphine-type ligands; excellent results have been achieved with both iridium- and rhodium-based systems. However, even the best systems often suffer from low ee's and a lack of generality. Certain pyrrolidine-derived enamines of aromatic ketones are amenable to asymmetrically hydrogenation with cationic rhodium(I) phosphonite systems, and I2 and acetic acid system with ee values usually above 90% and potentially as high as 99.9%. A similar system using iridium(I) and a very closely related phosphoramidite ligand is effective for the asymmetric hydrogenation of pyrrolidine-type enamines where the double bond was inside the ring: in other words, of dihydropyrroles. In both cases, the <b>enantioselectivity</b> dropped substantially when the ring size was increased from five to six.|$|E
