50|$|The first planar {{transistors}} {{had much}} worse characteristics than alloy <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> of the period, {{but as they}} could be mass-produced and alloy <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> could not, they cost much less and the characteristics of planar transistors improved very rapidly, quickly exceeding those of all earlier transistors and making earlier transistors obsolete.|$|R
25|$|CADET used 324 {{point-contact}} transistors {{provided by}} the UK company Standard Telephones and Cables; 76 <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> {{were used for the}} first stage amplifiers for data read from the drum, since point-contact transistors were too noisy. From August 1956 CADET was offering a regular computing service, during which it often executed continuous computing runs of 80 hours or more. Problems with the reliability of early batches of point contact and alloyed <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> meant that the machine's mean time between failures was about 90minutes, but this improved once the more reliable bipolar <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> became available.|$|R

50|$|The Early {{effect in}} bipolar <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> {{is named after}} Jim Early, who first {{characterized}} it and published a paper on it in 1952. The Early effect in bipolar <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> is due to an effective decrease in the base width because of the widening of the base-collector depletion region, resulting {{in an increase in}} the collector current with an increase in the collector voltage. The same type of length modulation in MOSFETs is also commonly referred to as Early effect.|$|R

25|$|A bipolar <b>junction</b> <b>{{transistor}}</b> (bipolar transistor or BJT) {{is a type}} of transistor {{that uses}} both electron and hole charge carriers. In contrast, unipolar transistors, such as field-effect transistors, only use one kind of charge carrier. For their operation, BJTs use two junctions between two semiconductor types, n-type and p-type.|$|E
25|$|Nanofuidic triode is a {{three-terminal}} {{double junction}} nanofluidic device composed of positive-charged alumina and negative-charged silica nanochannels. The device {{is essentially a}} three-terminal bipolar <b>junction</b> <b>transistor.</b> By controlling the voltage across emitter and collector terminals, one can regulate the ion current from base terminal {{to one of the}} other two terminals, functioning as an ionic single-pole, double-throw switch.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of the FET is its high gate to main current resistance, {{on the order of}} 100 MΩ or more, thus providing a high degree of isolation between control and flow. Because base current noise will increase with shaping time, a FET typically produces less noise than a bipolar <b>junction</b> <b>transistor</b> (BJT), and is thus found in noise sensitive electronics such as tuners and low-noise amplifiers for VHF and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. Because they are controlled by gate charge, once the gate is closed or opened, there is no additional power draw, as there would be with a bipolar <b>junction</b> <b>transistor</b> or with non-latching relays in some states. This allows extremely low-power switching, which in turn allows greater miniaturization of circuits because heat dissipation needs are reduced compared to other types of switches.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{with the}} {{reliability}} of early batches of transistors meant that the machine's {{mean time between failures}} was about 90 minutes, which improved once the more reliable <b>junction</b> <b>transistors</b> became available. The Transistor Computer's design was adopted by the local engineering firm of Metropolitan-Vickers in their Metrovick 950, in which all the circuitry was modified to make use of <b>junction</b> <b>transistors.</b> Six Metrovick 950s were built, the first completed in 1956.
