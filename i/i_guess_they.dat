500|$|After [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde", {{the final}} {{song in the}} medley, Beyoncé began {{to tell the story}} of how her first album came to be, stating [...] " [...] told me I didn't have one hit song on my album. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> were kinda right. I had five!". Beyoncé then {{continued}} with a slowed-down, jazzier version of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] allowing the orchestra to augment rather than transform the tracks. During the Ne-Yo penned [...] "Irreplaceable," [...] Beyoncé has the crowd assist her in her performance. After stating [...] "On April 4, 2008, somebody put a ring on it," [...] Beyoncé has the audience, which contained both men and women fliping their hands to [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{said that}} she had trouble convincing {{executives}} at Columbia Records to release the album. The singer recounted that it almost was not released: [...] "In 2003, I had my first solo album. But when I played it through for my record label, they told me I didn't have one hit on my album. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> were kinda right, I had five. [...] "Dangerously in Love", [...] "Naughty Girl", [...] "Me, Myself and I", [...] "Baby Boy" [...] and [...] "Crazy in Love"." [...] Since [...] "Dilemma" [...] was concurrently charting atop the Billboard Hot 100, Beyoncé's management released, [...] "Work It Out", one of the songs on the soundtrack to Austin Powers in Goldmember, instead of a single from Dangerously in Love to preclude it from possibly competing with the former.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the podium}} ceremony, {{in which two}} Brazilian drivers participated {{for the first time}} since the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, the top three {{finishers}} appeared in the obligatory press conference. Hamilton said that the decision to not make a pit stop during the safety car period was the team's decision: [...] "We had two very comfortable, two very decent stints and the team opted for me to stay out. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> thought I could pull out a gap but it was a 23 second gap I needed and I only had seven laps or something, so I don't know how that worked out." [...] Hamilton added that he felt that things looked good for the rest of the season, stating that [...] "if we [...] can continue with this momentum we have got we are looking very good".|$|E

500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>They</b> did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{think that}} when Dave and me first started playing, that the {{inspiration}} just came from our love {{of different types of}} music-you know, just our different loves of music.

500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E
500|$|Code: Veronica {{producer}} Shinji Mikami said [...] "Claire {{became a}} lot tougher than I Imagined. I thought she should look the same, but the game director made her that way because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we look back and say, 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> are both girls.' Which is good, because it means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E
500|$|The Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) of the New York City Police Department {{arrived to}} free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut, {{and a few others}} were bruised from being struck by flying debris. Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: [...] "I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over... The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> had ever been, because {{everybody}} else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill." [...] With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, [...] "Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon." [...] His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, [...] "All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously." ...|$|E
60|$|Bud and Bill and Herky {{walked off}} down the gorge. Perhaps they really went to find another place for the camp, for the present spot was {{certainly}} a kind of trap.

As the moments passed his face grew sullen.|$|R

500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for days and days, [...] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways. I don’t know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> can relate to it." [...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ... It's me, looking in the mirror, saying, 'I am my own worst [...] I do the worst damage to myself — {{more than anybody else}} can to do me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Philip and Mary Ann Hobel spent a {{long time}} seeking a {{distributor}} for Tender Mercies without any success. Duvall, who began to doubt the film would be widely released, was unable to help the Hobels because he was busy trying to find a distributor for Angelo My Love, a film he had written, directed and produced. Eventually, Universal Pictures agreed to distribute Tender Mercies. Test screenings for the film were held, which Beresford described as the most unusual he had ever experienced. The director said that the preview audiences appeared to be very engaged with the picture, to the point the theaters were so silent, [...] "if you flicked a piece of paper on the floor, you could hear it fall." [...] However, the post-screening feedback was, in Beresford's words, [...] "absolutely disastrous." [...] As a result, Universal executives lost faith in the film and made little effort to promote it. Foote said of the studio, [...] "I don't know that they disliked the film, I just think they thought it was inconsequential and of no consequence at all. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> thought it would just get lost in the shuffle." [...] Others in the film industry were equally dismissive; one Paramount Pictures representative described the picture as [...] "like watching paint dry".|$|E
500|$|Australian activist Julian Assange—the {{founder of}} WikiLeaks—appeared as himself. Many of his lines {{were written by}} Australian author Kathy Lette, {{who is one of}} Assange's friends. According to Lette, [...] "Julian and The Simpsons {{producers}} asked me to rewrite his scene and dialogue. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> just wanted me to add a little Aussie irony to the script. Julian does not suffer from an irony deficiency! I used to write a sitcom for Columbia Pictures, the long-running series The Facts of Life, so the producers knew I could fire off a quip or two." [...] In 2010, Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant to extradite Assange from Britain to Sweden for questioning in relation to sexual assault allegations made against him there. Assange was arrested in England, before being freed on conditional bail until a decision would be made {{as to whether or not}} he should be extradited to Sweden. Assange recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in England. Jean, who directed Assange's performance from Los Angeles, only acquired a phone number to call and received no information about the whereabouts of the activist. According to Jean in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had found out through a rumor that Assange wanted to appear on the show. Casting director Bonnie Pietila was therefore given the task to contact Assange and make sure the guest appearance could happen. The episode features no reference to Assange's legal situation at the time of his recording. Jean commented that he is [...] "a controversial figure, and there's a good reason he's controversial. There was discussion internally whether or not to have him on the show, but ultimately we went ahead and did it." [...] Groening has said in an interview that [...] "We [...] dare ourselves to do things and Julian Assange was a dare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said--and Nasmyth {{could just}} hear {{him through the}} roar of the fall--"it seems to me the thing could be done if you have nerve enough. Still, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> if <b>they</b> let you have the whole valley afterwards, you'd deserve it." [...] Then he seemed to laugh. [...] "I'll make my share one {{thousand}} five hundred dollars. In the meanwhile, if you have no objections, we'll get back again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you grampus!" [...] cried Nikel, laughing. [...] "Don't ye {{know that}} we is the purshooers, 'cause why? We're purshooin' the cap'en and crew of the Termagant at law, and means to purshoo 'em too, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> till <b>they</b> stumps up for that air whale. And they is the defendants, 'cause they're s'posed to defend {{themselves}} to the last gasp; but it ain't o' no manner o' use." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} troubled me, and I {{tried to}} avoid it. Crossing the hill we had by this time drawn near a hollow called the Toad's- hole, then gay and noisy with a caravan of gypsies. They were those same wild Lindsays, for whom Gavin had searched Caddam one eventful night, and as I saw them crowding round their king, a man well known to me, <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> what <b>they</b> were at.|$|R
2500|$|Moore also {{publicly}} criticised {{details of}} the script before the film's release, pointing to apparent laziness in the writing. [...] "They don't know what British people have for breakfast, they couldn't be bothered [...] 'Eggy in a basket' apparently. Now the US have 'eggs in a basket,' which is fried bread with a fried egg in {{a hole in the}} middle. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> thought we must eat that as well, and thought 'eggy in a basket' was a quaint and Olde Worlde version.", he stated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{songs for}} the debut album were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. Lead vocalist Ronnie Radke has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for days and days, [...] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways.

2500|$|... "I {{stood looking}} at the school— it looked so big! Just then the guards let some white {{students}} through. The crowd was quiet. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> were {{waiting to see what}} was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, I walked up to the guard who had let the white students in. He didn’t move. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared at me with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn’t know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, [...] "Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Surely Ayesha {{was talking}} to me! What did she say? What did she say? I could not catch her words, but I caught her {{laughter}} and knew that after her fashion {{she was making a}} mock of me. My eyelids were dragged down as though with heavy sleep; it was difficult to lift them. At last they were open and I saw Ayesha seated on her couch before me and--this I noted at once--with her lovely face unveiled. I looked about me, seeking Umslopogaas and Hans. But they were gone as <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>they</b> must be, since otherwise Ayesha would not have been unveiled. We were quite alone. She was addressing me and in a new fashion, since now she had abandoned the formal [...] "you" [...] and was using the more impressive and intimate [...] "thou," [...] much as is the manner of the French.|$|R
500|$|Verducci wrote, [...] "Rickey is {{the modern-day}} Yogi Berra, only faster." [...] Henderson himself is {{resigned}} to his persona: [...] "A {{lot of stuff}} they had me doing or something they said I had created, it's comedy. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's how <b>they</b> want to judge me, as a character." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who, me?" [...] asked Scraps, {{looking around}} the pretty room instead of at the girl. [...] "Oh, I came from a bed-quilt, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> That's what <b>they</b> say, anyhow. Some call it a crazy-quilt and some a {{patchwork}} quilt. But my name is Scraps--and now you know all about me." ...|$|R
2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to know how it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The last thing he said to me was, 'Keene, just before they go into the game, give them a good talk.' Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> did, and I am proud of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The few {{young women}} {{compared}} to {{number of young}} men led to the women's being paid unwanted attention. Maud's classmate, Jessie Mary, wrote that the [...] "oys (or young men as <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> call themselves) abound". She noted that girls were frequently ogled by the boys, who enjoyed teasing them. When a girl was late, the boys would loudly clap as she sat down. Each October, the freshman class would elect about twelve positions, including a president and vice president, a treasurer, a class essayist, and a marshal. The marshal was tasked with organizing parties and other social occurrences. Girls were generally barred {{from most of the}} positions. However, an annual tradition of the boys was to [...] "nominate the most precocious girl" [...] and then [...] "gossip about her viciously". Maud was nominated.|$|E
2500|$|The new line-up signalled {{a decisive}} change in musical policy - early songs are dropped {{and a more}} retro, rock 'n' roll sound, highly {{influenced}} by American 1960s surf music and garage rock emerged. Jack formed the self-funded label Ostrich GT and released the debut 7" [...] single [...] "Can't Get Enough", which showcased the band's rapidly developing Hot Rod aesthetic ("I've been around / The fuzz ran me downtown / They say I ran a red light / Oh well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>they</b> were right"). The single sold well at early gigs and a follow-up was soon issued. [...] "Chrysler 440" [...] continued the street racing theme while B-side [...] "Fuel Injection (it's better)" [...] reflected Jack's knowledge of classic cars ("I got a big block Ford / It had a carburettor / Now I've got fuel injection / It's better"). Jack's occasional Ostrich Club nights held in various venues around Doncaster saw the band develop a loyal following and a growing reputation as they headlined their own gigs and supported some bigger names.|$|E
60|$|MINNIE. One of the Pindar Church and the Other of the Pindar Shops. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> he'll {{understand}} <b>they</b> {{were from}} me, all right.

5000|$|As of February 2013, Bodyjar has {{performed}} as a support act for various touring bands in Australia, such as The Descendents. Read explained in an October 2013 interview that, following the Descendants tour, the band had [...] "a {{little bit of}} money in the bank" [...] and decided to write and record for a new album: [...] "we just thought let's write some songs and if they are good enough we can record them and if they're not then we can spend the money on beer <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> But <b>they</b> turned out really well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, James, I am {{thinking}} of no such foolishness. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that <b>they</b> will not be trying him for withstanding the watch, that's but a small matter; they will be sending him south for the king's ministers {{to get out of}} him what he knows about the Jacobite plot and the names of all concerned, and it's upon the road that we must get him out of their hands. Like enough they will only send four troopers with him, and we can easily master them somewhere in the dales." ...|$|R
