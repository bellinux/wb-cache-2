25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the corset has {{experienced}} periodic revivals, all which have usually originated in haute couture and have occasionally trickled through to mainstream fashion.

25|$|Post-operative {{pain relief}} {{is subject to}} change. Traditionally, pain relief has been {{provided}} by relatively mild narcotic analgesics such as Acetaminophen with codeine, for milder pain, and stronger narcotic analgesics for more severe pain. Recently (January 2011), the FDA reduced the recommended total 24-hour dose because of concern about liver toxicity from the Acetominophen component. An alternative {{is the use of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, themselves giving rise to concerns that their effect on platelets might increase the risk of post-operative bleeding. In turn, this <b>has</b> <b>renewed</b> interest in techniques other than traditional 'extra-capsular excision' in the hope that post-operative pain might be reduced.|$|E
25|$|Acts {{was read}} as a {{reliable}} history of the early church well into the post-Reformation era. By the 17th century, however, biblical scholars began to notice that it was incomplete and tendentious—its picture of a harmonious church is quite at odds with that given by Paul's letters, and it omits important {{events such as the}} deaths of both Peter and Paul. The mid-19th-century scholar Ferdinand Baur suggested that Luke had re-written history to present a united Peter and Paul and advance a single orthodoxy against the Marcionites. (Marcion was a 2nd-century heretic who wished to cut Christianity off entirely from the Jews). Baur continues to have enormous influence, but today there is less interest in determining Luke's historical accuracy (although this has never died out) than in understanding his theological program. In How Jesus Became Christian Canadian religious historian Barrie Wilson <b>has</b> <b>renewed</b> Baur's charge that Acts is a work of historical revisionism whose main purpose was to link Paul's new and separate Christ religion to Jesus and Judaism.|$|E

Valkyries highest-grossing territory was Germany, where it earned $3.7 million from 689 locations, averaging $5,311 per screen.

In 2005 he mocked the Australian captain Ricky Ponting for electing to bowl first on a batsman-friendly pitch, saying he was a [...] "nice man" [...] for being so generous to the England team. In 2006, he was initially receptive to the difficulties endured by Marcus Trescothick during his periods of stress-related illness; however, he was not always as amiable. In March 2008, recently dropped Steve Harmison attacked Boycott {{in an article in}} The Mail on Sunday where he referred to Boycott as a [...] "waste of space."

500|$|As {{a result}} of the series' success, Peter Jackson has become {{a major player in the}} film {{business}} (sometimes called a mogul) in the mold of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, in the process befriending some industry heavyweights like Bryan Singer and Frank Darabont. Jackson has since founded his own film production company, Wingnut Films, as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company. He was also finally given a chance to remake King Kong in 2005. The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as The Lord of the Rings series. Jackson has been called a [...] "favourite son" [...] of New Zealand. In 2004, Howard Shore toured with The Lord of the Rings Symphony, playing two hours of the score.

500|$|When the Tea Room {{was closed}} by the National Park Service on January 1, 1999, {{officials}} said they did so {{because of the potential}} fire hazard posed by operating a kitchen in the main park building and the possibility of insect or rodent damage to historic items in the mansion, as stated in the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS the previous year. While it [...] "may be a pleasant place to enjoy a meal... that is clearly less important than the need to preserve Hampton's buildings, objects and landscapes for future generations," [...] the Park Service stated. Officials of Preservation Maryland said they were [...] "disappointed" [...] by the restaurant's closure, saying it helped attract visitors to the historic site. The former chairwoman of the Hampton women's committee—which raises money for various projects at Hampton—also criticized the decision. Since 2006, the women's group <b>has</b> <b>renewed</b> efforts to have the Tea Room reopened, saying it would draw more visitors and repeat business from locals to the park.
