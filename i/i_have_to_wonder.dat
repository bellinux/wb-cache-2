40|$|Linda Young asks why Dawn Casey {{is leaving}} the National Museum DAWN CASEY {{is not the first}} Australian museum {{director}} of recent times to depart her post in a less-than-friendly atmosphere. The director and deputy of the Melbourne Museum were restructured out of their jobs last year. The director of the Western Australian Museum resigned and walked out of a council meeting in 1998 over plans to bring the museum into the Department of Culture and the Arts. Two directors of the Museum and Gallery of the Northern Territory left after altercations with their minister in the 1990 s; and {{it seems likely that the}} director of the Australian Museum in Sydney will not be appointed by its trust for another term, for reasons that might be summarised as leadership style. Casey’s case, however, is the most pernicious. It is one of the chestnuts of museology to ask whether the best director is a discipline specialist in the museum tradition or a purely rational manager. All of the above were museum people in art, history and palaeontology. Did it make a difference? As a museum historian myself, I feel the mystique of insider knowledge must add something to directorial capacity but, on the evidence above, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether it is mere sentimental prejudice. Casey’s qualifications for the top job at the National Museum were entirely managerial, demonstrated by the executive criterion of bringing in the National Museum on time and on budget. Thereafter she fulfilled the enabling role of the manager: overseeing program operations, planning future developments, managing the NMA’s bushfires - and she’s been efficient and effective. She brought a warm personal style to the role of the museum’s leader. Her staff of specialists in education, conservation, history, anthropology and archaeology describe an atmosphere of positive support for their work. She authorised their innovations in Australian museum topics, not because they were politically correct but because that’s where today’s mind-set is. Look at the new exhibition, ‘Outlawed’, which compares the world tradition of socially motivated bandits - an utterly original take on Ned Kelly. Casey is neither an academic nor an ideologue. She is the perfect public servant, guaranteed by three Public Service Medals. In the popular mind she could sound like a cardigan-wearing pen-pusher. However, in another dimension, beyond her own choosing, Casey is an inflammatory character. Because she is indigenous she knows some truths about the living frontier between white and black Australia. She doesn’t push a barrow about her personal experience but every now and then a reference to her grandmother, her father, her childhood, pops up in her speeches. It has never been said publicly - because appointment to APS jobs is on merit - but in the quiet way that these things are known (call it small-talk, call it gossip), the Aboriginal Casey’s tenure as director of the National Museum held unprecedented symbolic power. The 19 th century tradition of museums as the trophy-shelves of the imperial powers cast the natives of the colonies as primitives. Users of stone tools obviously needed redemption through the West’s religion and the West’s economy. Museums grew as the visible proof of this truth. In time, the settler-colonies perpetuated the tradition: each of the colonial (now state) museums in Australia holds large collections of ancient indigenous material (the NMA inherited its share from the Institute of Anatomy). This is why museums have been at the centre of the ‘history’ wars in recent years. They own much of the surviving evidence of indigenous knowledge, adaptation and history. For symbolic, small-p political reasons, it has been critical for Aboriginal people to reclaim the evidence. It’s happening in the US, in Canada, in New Caledonia, among the Ainu of Japan and the Sami of Scandinavia - wherever indigenes have been marginalised but where contemporary democracy asserts that all have equal rights. Throughout the 1990 s, Australian museums came to world-leading agreements with aboriginal people about both repatriating and continuing to safeguard ancient objects. At the same time, Australian historians explored different perspectives on black-white relations. Although it is not the only theme in Australian historiography, the history of aboriginal culture is an overwhelmingly important theme in Australian museology. Thus the tremendous significance of having an Aboriginal woman at the helm of Australia’s National Museum. It is not just the success story of a smart and determined person, achieving against the odds of leaving school at 14. Casey didn’t get the job because she is indigenous. But, because she is, the museum and the nation reflected some of the honour of the justice of recognising merit, regardless of colour or creed. Casey didn’t press a politically correct agenda on the museum because she’s indigenous. It was the approach not only of curators but of teams of academics who ‘stress-tested’ the original themes, which are the vibrant directions of current historiography. However, because she is indigenous the critical edge of some themes took on an acute personification. Casey hasn’t been dumped because she’s indigenous. But you have to wonder.

When a buyer carrying a Brass and Meyers checkbook loaded them in 1929 with 14,000 head of Texas yearlings, Brass depended on Bixby to find the rangeland.

Edward Brass died in 1929, leaving Meyers in full control of the Sandhills corporation. In the late 1920s with Bixby running 12,000 head of Brass and Meyers hereford cattle, 3000 head of his own hereford's and a large draft and quarter remuda the ranch prospered but during the depression of the 1930s, Meyers reduced the company's total number of cattle and Bixby's 13-year relationship with the Sandhills Corporation ended in 1937.
