It's in Hawaii, right? I can do that!'" [...] Cuse later commented, [...] "He's quite a good actor. People only think of him as the doobie-smoking '70s dude. But he played Tyne Daly's love interest in Judging Amy. C'mon!" ...|$|E
500|$|St. John was {{instructed}} by the show's directors to watch about fifteen episodes of Howarth's performances of Todd {{because they wanted}} him to portray Todd like Howarth did. St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth's style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, [...] "I needed {{to get a sense of}} who Todd was first, and that has to happen organically." [...] He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, [...] "I don't care what the other guy did. That's his time." [...] St. John felt that it was up to him to decide how to perform Todd. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> very arrogant and overconfident," [...] he stated, [...] "but it would be no fun to try to mimic somebody." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving Connecticut on a Sunday {{morning in}} 2007 for Monday Night Football in Pittsburgh, Scott had a {{stomachache}}. After the stomachache worsened, {{he went to}} the hospital instead of the game and later had his appendix removed. After testing the appendix, doctors learned that he had cancer. Two days later, he had surgery in New York that removed part of his colon and some of his lymph nodes near the appendix. After the surgery, they recommended preventive chemotherapy. By December, Scott—while undergoing chemotherapy—hosted Friday night ESPN NBA coverage and led the coverage of ABC's NBA Christmas Day studio show. Scott worked out while undergoing chemotherapy. Scott said of his experience with cancer at the time: [...] "One of the coolest things about having cancer, and I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> like an oxymoron, is meeting other people who've had to fight it. You have a bond. It's like a fraternity or sorority." [...] When Scott returned to work and people knew of his cancer diagnosis, the well-wishers felt overbearing for him as he just wanted to talk about sports, not cancer.|$|E

500|$|The {{characters}} and their stories {{served as an}} extension of the fantasy life Bannon developed as a child. They became her [...] "fantasy friends" [...] whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not feel she was free to live. [...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.' As easy as it might be if you were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It was terrifying.|$|E
2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E

60|$|And have I {{not told}} you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense?--now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.

2500|$|In {{speaking}} about the show in 2010, Bain reflected: [...] "We had some very good science fiction people as advisors who {{knew what they were}} talking about. For instance, they <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> up there wouldn't travel, and it would just be quiet up there. But then we wouldn't have a series, so we couldn't do that. There were various considerations that had to be made, but they were based on what is, or what was, known at the time. For all I know now it's out of date. I don't really know." ...|$|R

I shall be thankful to him all my life, but all the same, he ought to be at home when he is wanted, and I wonder he liked to fly off just when he had got his dear little boy back again.' ...|$|E
60|$|Whitey the Snowy Owl {{was sitting}} still {{to catch a}} dinner. I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> queer, but it was so. He knew that {{so long as he}} sat still, he was not likely to be seen. It was for this purpose that Old Mother Nature had given him that coat of white. In the Far North, which was his real home, {{everything}} is white for months and months, and any one dressed in a dark suit can be seen a long distance. So Whitey had been given that white coat that he might have a better chance to catch food enough to keep him alive.|$|E

Your {{profession}} is settled now irrevocably. You will be a writer, and a famous writer, and one reason why I have procured all these invitations for you, and encouraged you to accept them, has been because I want you to grasp life as a whole. You think that you are idling now. You are not. Every new experience you gain is of value to you. Hitherto you have only seen life through dun-coloured spectacles. I want you also to understand the other side. It is your business to know and grasp it from all points. Can't you see that I have found it a pleasure to help you to see that side of which you were ignorant?" ...|$|E

40|$|Defect {{detection}} in rotating {{machines in}} the early stages becomes more prioritized. In this respect, cheap, user-friendly and precise assessment techniques and tools need to be developed. This paper researches the feasibility of unbalance defect detection in rotating machines based on sound analysis. It is well <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> carries important information about the condition of rotating parts in rotating machines. Two rotating machines were analyzed to find the differences in sound pattern between a fully functional machine and a machine with unbalance defect. It has proven difficult to definitely determine the unbalance defect by using a simple signal processing technique. Further work in this area was suggested...|$|R

5000|$|Hart cobbled {{together}} a {{living with the}} money he earned as an adjunct professor and with grants and donations to Project Gutenberg. He supported himself by doing odd jobs and used an unpaid appointment at Illinois Benedictine College to solicit donations for the project.

It's sort of out of my hands and it has its reputation, so what can you do about it? There's a lot of it that I wish was {{slightly}} more elegantly written. Overall, I was pretty shocked.

5000|$|What is the {{difference}} between what something is, and how it appears? - e.g., [...] "sound is the variation of pressure that propagates through matter as a wave"Perhaps the most important topic the riddle offers is the division between perception of an object and how an object really is. If a tree exists outside of perception then there is no way for us to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the tree exists. So then, what do we mean by existence, what is {{the difference}} between perception and reality? Also, people may also say, if the tree exists outside of perception (as common sense would dictate), then it will produce sound waves. However, these sound waves will not actually sound like anything. Sound as it is mechanically understood will occur, but sound as it is understood by sensation will not occur. So then, how is it <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> as it is mechanically understood will occur if <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> is not perceived? ...|$|R

And I pulled everything I knew about it, which wasn’t much because I didn’t live there. It was all through media.

[...] Salazar unsuccessfully visited the Stanford Sleep Clinic and a cardiologist, had surgery, and trained in Kenya. In 1994 he said that [...] "For {{most of the last}} 10 years, I hated running.

Oftentimes this leads to successful bands, you know, creating a unique sound from a variety of influences, but unfortunately for the Donkey Show, I feel it was partly responsible for the demise of the band. we were all pretty young, stubborn, and eager to explore new opportunities.
