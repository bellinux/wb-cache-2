500|$|SL79 is a {{class of}} 40 {{articulated}} trams operated by the Oslo Tramway of Norway. The trams were {{a variation of the}} Duewag trams that had been developed by the German manufacturer since the 1950s. The six-axle vehicles are unidirectional with four doors on the right side. The trams can seat 77 passengers three and four abreast, with an additional 91 people able to stand. Power output is , provided by two motors on the two end bogies, that supplement a central unpowered <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie</b> located under the articulation. The trams are [...] long and [...] wide. They are capable of [...] and have standard gauge.|$|E

50|$|<b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies</b> (named after Wilhelm Jakobs, 1858-1942, a German railway engineer) are {{a type of}} {{rail vehicle}} bogie {{commonly}} found on articulated railcars and tramway vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Closeup of a <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie</b> {{between two}} {{sections}} of an articulated well car ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{articulated}} railcars, with bogies under the point between the carriages rather than two pivoting bogies under each carriage (see <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie).</b>|$|E
50|$|Instead {{of being}} {{underneath}} {{a piece of}} rolling stock, Jacobs bogies are placed between two carbody sections. The weight of each car is spread on {{one half of the}} <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Australia, <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies</b> {{were first}} used in 1984-5 on the B class Melbourne trams, used on two former {{suburban}} railways {{which had been}} converted to light rail operation.|$|R
50|$|Usually, two bogies are {{fitted to}} each carriage, wagon or locomotive, one at each end. An {{alternate}} configuration often {{is used in}} articulated vehicles, which places the <b>bogies</b> (often <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies)</b> under {{the connection between the}} carriages or wagons.|$|R
50|$|The GT4 was {{developed}} because the longer 6-axle articulated trams with <b>Jacob's</b> <b>bogies,</b> {{such as the}} GT6, were not suitable for the Stuttgart network, which had {{a large number of}} sharp curves and steep gradients due to that city's hilly topography.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie</b> can {{be found}} in trams (streetcars) such as the Tatra K2 and Oslo's SL79. The first 100% low floor tram with {{pivoting}} bogies, the Škoda ForCity, also uses modified Jacobs bogies.|$|E

50|$|According to Alstom, the {{advantages}} of the AGV are: increased seating area per train length (compared to a single-deck TGV); safety and maintenance advantages of the <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie</b> articulation design; as well as higher energy efficiency from permanent-magnet synchronous motors.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles {{featuring}} <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies</b> {{include the}} Alstom-made TGV and Eurostar trains, the Bombardier Talent series of multiple units, the LINT41, the Class 423 S-Bahn vehicles, the Canadian CN Turbo-Trains, several FLIRT trains, IC3 by Adtranz and the Škoda ForCity tram.|$|R

50|$|The {{structural}} {{requirements of}} Freiburg made {{it necessary for}} their own tram type to be created. This was because conventional trams with <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies</b> were not suitable for the partially narrow curved radii. Freiburg's trams {{were based on the}} type used in Mannheim, also produced by Duewag and built from 1969. This was based on the classic Duewag articulate tram from 1956. In contrast to conventional articulated trams, however, the centre of gravity of Freiburg's trams were not the <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies,</b> but underneath the middle section, into which two tram end parts were attached. In addition to the all-axle drive, which was easier to implement, a better structure gauge was also used, totalling 34 metres of length.|$|R
50|$|The {{trains are}} based on the DB Class 425 design, but made {{to meet the demands of}} the Sprinter. They use <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie,</b> which allow for thin and wide {{gangways}} between each coach. The units were built in Aachen (2400) and Krefeld (2600).|$|E
50|$|The {{basic unit}} of an AC train {{consisted}} of two articulated compartment carriages on six axles with motorised two-axle bogies under each cab end and a <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie</b> in the middle. The carriages, with doors {{on each side of}} the compartments, took their design and functionality from Prussian compartment carriages.|$|E
50|$|It {{was only}} after World War II that {{articulated}} cars were manufactured again; the first, small series of GT4 <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie</b> cars was deployed for Stuttgart in 1953 by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen.From 1956 on, Düsseldorfer Waggonfabrik (Düwag) manufactured large numbers of articulated tram cars for operators in Germany and abroad to replace old pre-war models.|$|E
50|$|From 1918 on, a few prototypes {{were built}} in Germany, for example a trailer car for Dresden in 1918 and two tramcars with <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies</b> for Duisburg in 1926. However, {{interest}} for these cars was low {{and the concept of}} articulation fell into obscurity.|$|R
5000|$|A Class 423 unit {{consists}} of four cars that share three <b>jacobs</b> <b>bogies</b> and can only be separated at maintenance facilities. The inner two cars are designated as Class 433. A 423 unit typically {{consists of}} the following cars, where x is the unit's number: ...|$|R
50|$|Three {{units were}} {{constructed}} by Windhoff, and four by Talbot, {{with the first}} unit operational in 1997; both were broadly similar in design with the same operating characteristics, the Talbot built vehicles (branded Talion) differed in having inner unpowered wagons articulated using <b>jacobs</b> <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{articulated}} trams have bogies located under articulations, a setup {{referred to}} as a <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie.</b> Often, low-floor trams are fitted with nonpivoting bogies and many tramway enthusiasts see this as a retrograde step, as it leads to more wear of both track and wheels and also significantly reduces the speed at which a tram can round a curve.|$|E
50|$|The {{two members}} of the ABDeh 6/6 class each had a pair of {{passenger}} car bodies connected together, and three twin axle bogies. Each body was mounted, at its outer end, on an outer bogie, via two side frames. At each body's other end, that body was connected, in combination with the other body, to a central <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie,</b> in each case via a central pedestal.|$|E
50|$|In the Škoda ForCity, {{which is}} the world's first 100% low floor tram with {{pivoting}} bogies, a <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie</b> supports the articulation between the two or more carbody sections. An articulated tram may be low-floor variety or high (regular) floor variety. Newer model trams may be up to 72 m long and carry 510 passengers at a comfortable 4 passengers/m2. At crush loadings this would be even higher.|$|E
25|$|TGVs have semi-permanently coupled {{articulated}} un-powered coaches, with <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies</b> {{between the}} coaches supporting both of them. Power cars {{at each end}} of the trains have their own bogies. Trains can be lengthened by coupling two TGVs, using couplers hidden in the noses of the power cars.|$|R
500|$|... 9900 and 9901-9903 were {{articulated}} trainsets, {{with common}} trucks (<b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies)</b> between each car. This caused operating problems, as train lengths {{could not be}} changed for demand and any single failure affected the entire train. All following power units were separate from their train, although four more articulated and semi-articulated carsets were built.|$|R
50|$|On this {{crossover}} {{between the}} tram (streetcar) and the high-speed train, <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies</b> {{occurred on the}} latest equipment of any significance, the two Electroliner trains (1941-76). They were suited for streets with tight curves, the Chicago El and running through the countryside at approximately 140 km/h. They served the Chicago-Milwaukee line and later the Philadelphia area.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in 1959, Maschinenfabrik Esslingen and Hansawaggon, {{the latter}} mainly in Bremen and in Munich, {{tried to get}} into the market with their Kurzgelenkwagen {{construction}} [...] - [...] however, in West Germany their market share remained small compared to the <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie</b> cars made by Düwag.The Hansawaggon design was copied later by CKD Tatra, which manufactured large numbers of KT4D tram cars based on this design for use in the GDR.|$|E
50|$|The new EW {{class was}} the first {{locomotive}} class in New Zealand to utilise the Bo-Bo-Bo wheel arrangement, which would subsequently be copied on the Mitsubishi DJ class and Brush EF class. However, the EW class was different in that the central <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie</b> was placed under the articulation of the two body halves with limited sideplay, whereas the DJ and EF classes have a single fixed body with sideplay in the central bogie.|$|E
50|$|In May 1936 the LBE began {{operating}} streamlined express trains with double-deck carriages on the Hamburg Hauptbahnhof-Lübeck-Travemünde Strand route, which attracted worldwide attention. They {{consisted of}} push-pull trains with control cars equipped with automatic Scharfenberg couplers and two units had a common <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogie.</b> The eight streamlined express trains with double-deck carriages were purchased from Waggon- und Maschinenbau AG Görlitz (WUMAG) and Linke-Hofmann. They were hauled by a fast, streamlined tender locomotive, {{which could be}} remotely controlled by the driver {{from the other end}} of the train.|$|E
50|$|It is a high-powered, {{light-weight}} {{vehicle with}} high acceleration for short- and medium-distance services with frequent stops. The aluminium superstructure was built {{as flat as}} possible, both to minimize drag and to ease automated cleaning. The acceleration is achieved by distributing traction motors among eight of the train's ten axles including {{two of the three}} <b>jacobs</b> <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 26 May 1934, {{one year}} after Fliegender Hamburger introduction, the Burlington Railroad set an average speed record on long {{distance}} with their new streamlined train, the Zephyr, at 124 km/h with peaks at 185 km/h. The Zephyr was made of stainless steel, and like the Fliegender Hamburger, was diesel powered, articulated with <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies,</b> and could reach 160 km/h as commercial speed.|$|R
5000|$|After {{intensive}} {{tests with}} the gas-turbine [...] "TGV 001" [...] prototype, and the electric [...] "Zébulon", in 1977, the SNCF placed {{an order to}} the group Alstom-Francorail-MTE for 87 TGV Sud-Est trainsets.They used the [...] "TGV 001" [...] concept, with a permanently coupled set of eight cars, sharing <b>Jacobs</b> <b>bogies,</b> and hauled by two electric power-cars, one at each end.|$|R
