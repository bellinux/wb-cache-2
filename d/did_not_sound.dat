5|$|Peter McConnell {{announced}} that the game's soundtrack would be fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra for the remastered version of the game being released in 2015. After the original Pro Tools sound files were recovered, McConnell found {{that some of the}} samples he had used originally <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> good, and the team opted to re-orchestrate the score.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{contacted}} The Washington Post and The New York Times {{to ask if}} {{they were}} interested in the material; the Post reporter <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> interested, and the Times did not return the call. Manning decided instead to pass it to WikiLeaks, and on February 3 sent them the Iraq and Afghan War logs via Tor. She returned to Iraq on February 11, with no acknowledgement from WikiLeaks that they had received the files.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his account}} of Irish monasteries in Germany, Hogan {{mentions}} an abbot of St. Martin's of Cologne, which {{was at the time}} an Irish institution: [...] "Beatus, Virgilius, Fridolinus <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> very Irish, yet all admit their nationality. German Protestant historians have no doubt about the Irish nationality of Clement the Heretic; yet Clement <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> particularly Hibernian." ...|$|R
5|$|The track {{had been}} patched up {{prior to the}} weekend's racing using a {{synthetic}} rubber compound, and it had remained secure throughout the practice and qualifying sessions, {{as well as the}} Grand-Am and Indy Lights races. However, the Dallara DW12's aerodynamic ground force effects acted to pull the compound out. After assessing the track conditions, {{the decision was made to}} attempt to repair the track and restart the race. Marshalls and track workers started to pull the loose strips up from the track, and a quick drying concrete was used to fill the troughs. The repairs were held up for a short time when a crew was despatched to collect more of the concrete, as the on-site resources had been used up, but eventually the race director was happy the race could restart. Kanaan and Power drove around to survey the repairs, acting as driver representatives, and although Kanaan particularly <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> confident that they would hold up, they agreed to try and continue racing. There was some confusion about the rules of the restart; no repairs were allowed, and the teams could change tires, but had to remain on the same compound. This led to J.R. Hildebrand suffering a one lap penalty as his car required repair work, and a number of drivers being angered at having to stay on the harder tires, which were the slower compound.|$|E
25|$|After the September 11 attacks, Hanjour's {{family in}} Saudi Arabia vehemently {{stated that they}} could not, and would not, believe he had been {{involved}} {{as one of the}} hijacker pilots, and also stated that he had phoned them just eight hours prior to the hijackings and his voice <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> strange or unusual at all.|$|E
25|$|The Felt {{theory was}} a strong one... Felt had a {{personal}} motive for acting. After the death of J. Edgar Hoover... Felt {{thought he was a}} leading candidate to succeed Hoover... The characteristics were a good fit. The trouble with Felt's candidacy was that Deep Throat in All the President's Men simply <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> to me like a career FBI man.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the station again became an {{important}} outlet for new Canadian music, with bands such as Barenaked Ladies, The Lowest of the Low, Rheostatics, and Sloan counting CFNY as their first major radio supporter. Unfortunately for the station's influence, alternative rock became the decade's dominant genre and so CFNY <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> as distinctive compared to other radio stations as it once had.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{he played}} three {{first-class}} matches for Lancashire, a County Championship match against Gloucestershire, a match against Australia in 1921, and a match against Cambridge University in 1922. Cricket Archive records him as having played for Denbighshire in Minor Counties cricket in the 1930s, though some {{research suggests that}} this is a different RA Lloyd, as the RA Lloyd who played for Denbighshire apparently looked nothing like a rugby player and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> Irish.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, two college bands {{from the}} University of the Philippines, Diliman {{were both in}} search of new members for a new group. Curfew, which {{consisted}} of Buddy Zabala on bass, Raimund Marasigan on drums and Marcus Adoro on guitars met up with Sunday School, which consisted of Ely Buendia on vocals and Raimund Marasigan as session drummer in December of the same year. Ely's first two college bands, Bluidie Tryste and Sunday School, were too unstable, so he posted an audition notice on a university message board. Only Raimund, Buddy, and Marcus {{showed up at the}} audition. According to an interview with myx, Raimund said he first auditioned as bassist while Buddy as drummer. But they noticed that it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> right, the two switched places.|$|E

25|$|If {{the reader}} has also {{received}} {{the benefit of}} the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.|$|E
25|$|Jeff Tweedy {{was invited}} to play at Chicago's Noise Pop festival, {{and was told that}} he could {{collaborate}} with a musician of his choosing. Tweedy chose Jim O'Rourke based on his fascination with O'Rourke's Bad Timing album. O'Rourke offered to bring drummer Glenn Kotche to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named Loose Fur. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but Tweedy was unsatisfied with them because he believed that the songs <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> like the ones he played with Loose Fur. Tweedy became such a fan of Kotche's playing style that he decided to dismiss Ken Coomer from the band in favor of Kotche. Tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced, which clashed with Jay Bennett's focus on the songs themselves. Because Bennett was mixing the album, this led to a series of arguments about how the album should sound between songs. Tweedy asked O'Rourke to remix several songs on the album that had been mixed by Bennett, which caused tensions within the band to escalate. The album was completed in June 2001, and Tweedy was insistent that it was in its final form. Tweedy also fired Jay Bennett around this time, believing (according to Jay Bennett) that Wilco should only have one core member. The band maintains that the firing of Jay Bennett was a collective decision.|$|E
500|$|In {{the scene}} in which Jimi Hendrix and Benjamin Franklin {{play a game of}} air hockey in Heaven, Hendrix was {{supposed}} to have a speaking line of his own to respond to Franklin's line. It was cut late during production because the voice actor for Hendrix <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> enough like Hendrix. Franklin's line was kept because [...] "nobody knows what he sounds like", whereas Hendrix had a distinct voice.|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, Hammond {{started making}} {{transistor}} organs. The first organ that bridged {{the gap between}} tonewheel and transistor was the X-66, introduced in May 1967. The X-66 contained just 12 tonewheels, and used electronics for frequency division. It contained separate [...] "vibrato bass" [...] and [...] "vibrato treble" [...] {{in an attempt to}} simulate a Leslie speaker. Hammond designed it as the company's flagship product, in response to market competition and to replace the B-3. However, it was considered expensive at $9,795 and it sold poorly. It <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> like a B-3.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Eve C. of RPGFan disliked the album, {{calling it a}} [...] "disappointment" [...] and citing that in her opinion it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> French, {{that many of the}} tracks were [...] "boring", and that the arrangements were [...] "mediocre". [...] Patrick Gann, however, said that he was impressed with the album, applauding the instrumentation and calling it [...] "quite the CD". Dave of Square Enix Music Online mostly agreed with Gann, calling it [...] "extremely diverse" [...] and full of [...] "inspired arrangements", marred only by a couple of disappointing tracks.|$|E
500|$|Several {{weeks after}} the {{completion}} of the recording sessions, stories ran in the Chicago Tribune and Newsweek that quoted sources claiming DGC considered the album [...] "unreleasable". As a result, fans began to believe that the band's creative vision might be compromised by their label. While the stories about DGC shelving the album were untrue, the band actually was unhappy with certain aspects of Albini's mixes. Specifically, they thought the bass levels were too low, and Cobain felt that [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] and [...] "All Apologies" [...] <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> [...] "perfect". Longtime R.E.M. producer Scott Litt was called in to help remix those two songs, with Cobain adding additional instrumentation and backing vocals.|$|E

500|$|Due to the high-pitch {{employed}} in the recording, Dickson reflected in later years that she [...] "never liked the original [...] for that reason. The song has seasoned over the years with my singing of it." [...] Dickson believed that she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> like herself on the song. While performing it later point of time on her concerts, Dickson sang it in her actual tone, saying that although the track [...] "might have been written for a teenage girl, but {{the experience of being}} abandoned by a man is one, women of all ages can relate to. I {{think you have to be}} honest with songs and with yourself." [...] The singer's music director Ian Lynn arranged the track differently which she performs currently.|$|E
500|$|Kramon {{wrote the}} {{original}} background music {{to convey the}} film noir themes. For the pilot, Thomas wanted [...] "a really atmospheric, kind of modern noir type of vibe", and Kramon used sounds {{similar to that of}} Air and Zero 7. Kramon used [...] "traditional sounds" [...] for the series, but also processed and filtered them. Among the instruments used were piano, vibraphone and guitar. When using an acoustic piano, Kramon would use compression so that it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> like a traditional piano. Live bass and percussion was also used, as Kramon did not like to program them. The main instrument used was guitar, but Kramon felt that piano was [...] "by far the most important instrument for working on TV shows, especially when you're doing everything yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Six major singles {{were issued}} from the album, led by [...] "SexyBack" [...] which was {{released}} on July 7, 2006, two {{months prior to the}} publication of the album. Regarding the song, Timberlake surmised he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> like he did before. [...] "SexyBack", which lacks his distinctive falsetto, is seen as a complete departure from Timberlake's recognized sound, and his management thought it might risk being unrecognizable as a [...] "Justin Timberlake song". But that risk nonetheless appealed to Timberlake, who reportedly insisted to have [...] "SexyBack" [...] released as the album's lead single. Jive Records executive Barry Weiss, who initially doubted the suggestion, later told in an interview in February 2007 that albeit an [...] "unusual record", it was a [...] "risk that clearly paid off".|$|E
