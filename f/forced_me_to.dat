Recent tabloid journalism claimed that during Jackson's trial, Blanca Francia, a former housekeeper of Jackson's, testified that she had witnessed Jackson showering with Robson when Robson was 8 or 9 years old, which Robson denied. In May 2013, Francia agreed to testify at Robson's lawsuit against Jackson at Robson's request.|$|E

He remembered, [...] "I know what the battle did for me: It <b>forced</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> confront my own residual self-loathing and stare it down {{once and for all}} by coming out." [...] Maupin used the next installment of Tales to have one of his gay characters come out to his parents who, by remarkable coincidence, Maupin had previously established as Florida citrus growers.|$|E
500|$|Georges Méliès as Professor Barbenfouillis. Méliès, a {{pioneering}} French film-maker and magician now {{generally regarded as}} {{the first person to}} recognize the potential of narrative film, had already achieved considerable success with his film versions of Cinderella (1899) and Joan of Arc (1900). His extensive involvement in all of his films as director, producer, writer, designer, technician, publicist, editor, and often actor makes him one of the first cinematic auteurs. Speaking about his work late in life, Méliès commented: [...] "The greatest difficulty in realising my own ideas <b>forced</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sometimes play the leading role in my films... I was a star without knowing I was one, since the term did not yet exist." [...] All told, Méliès took an acting role in at least 300 of his 520 films.|$|E

Inspiration came from the 1982 American experimental film, Koyaanisqatsi, which showed time-lapse footage of cities. Madonna's scenes were shot in early April 1998 at MTV's Times Square studios in New York and Los Angeles. Background scenes were shot in various cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London, Las Vegas, and Stockholm. Test shots taken in Stockholm were presented to Madonna, for conveying the idea behind the clip, but they were deemed good to be used in the final product.|$|E

[...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's one of the reasons I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E
500|$|Nurmi {{was married}} to socialite Sylvi Laaksonen from 1932 to 1935. Laaksonen, who was not {{interested}} in athletics, opposed Nurmi raising their newborn son Matti to be a runner and stated to the Associated Press in 1933, [...] "is concentration on athletics at last <b>forced</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go to the judge for a divorce." [...] Matti Nurmi did become a middle-distance runner, and later a [...] "self-made" [...] businessman. Nurmi's relationship with his son was termed [...] "uneasy". Matti admired his father more as a businessman than as an athlete, and the two never discussed his running career. As a runner, Matti was at his best in the 3000 m, where he equaled his father's time. In the famous race on 11 July 1957 when the [...] "three Olavis" [...] (Salsola, Salonen and Vuorisalo) broke the world record for the 1500 m, Matti Nurmi finished a distant ninth with his personal best, 2.2 seconds slower than his father's world record from 1924.

500|$|Robson {{appeared}} on The Today Show on May 16, 2013, {{to discuss the}} allegations. Robson told interviewer Matt Lauer that Jackson was [...] "a pedophile and a child sexual abuser" [...] who [...] "performed sexual acts on me and <b>forced</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> perform sexual acts on him" [...] over a seven-year period, beginning in 1990 when Robson {{was seven years old}} when he visited Jackson's Neverland Ranch for the first time. In a 1993 deposition Robson's mother, Joy Robson, said that Jackson had [...] "special friends", boys with whom he spent extra time with that he replaced each year, and that Wade was Jackson's [...] "special friend" [...] in 1990. In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other [...] "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred. Robson said in the Today Show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's [...] "complete manipulation and brainwashing" [...] of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson [...] "would call me every day and role play and tell me the same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] Robson was also a star witness for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial. He said that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Chile's October 16, 2006 {{vote in the}} United Nations Security Council {{election}} — with Venezuela and Guatemala deadlocked in a bid for the two-year, non-permanent Latin American and Caribbean seat on the Security Council — {{developed into}} a major ideological issue {{in the country and}} was seen as a test for Bachelet. The governing coalition was divided between the Socialists, who supported a vote for Venezuela, and the Christian Democrats, who strongly opposed it. The day before the vote the president announced (through her spokesman) that Chile would abstain, citing as reason a lack of regional consensus over a single candidate, ending months of speculation. In March 2007 Chile's ambassador to Venezuela, Claudio Huepe, revealed in an interview with teleSUR that Bachelet personally told him that she initially wanted to vote for Venezuela, but then [...] "there were a series of circumstances that <b>forced</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> abstain."

2500|$|Back in Paris, she was {{increasingly}} discontented with Perrin {{and the management}} of the Comédie Française. He insisted that she perform the lead in a new play, L'Aventurière by Emile Augier, a play which she thought was mediocre. When she rehearsed the play without enthusiasm, and frequently forgot her lines, she was criticized by the playwright. She responded, [...] "I know I'm bad, but not as bad as your lines." [...] The play went ahead, but was a failure. She wrote immediately to Perrin, [...] "You <b>forced</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play when I was not ready... what I foresaw came to pass... this is my first failure at the Comédie and my last." [...] She sent a resignation letter to Perrin, made copies, and sent them to the major newspapers. Perrin sued her for breach of contract; the court ordered her to pay 100,000 francs, plus interest, and she lost her accrued pension of 43,000 francs. She did not settle the debt until 1900. Later, however, when the Comédie Française theater was nearly destroyed by fire, she allowed her old troupe to use her own theater.|$|E

2500|$|Pisemsky {{spent the}} first ten {{years of his life}} in the small {{regional}} town of Vetluga where his father served as Mayor. Later he moved with his parents to the countryside. Pisemsky described the years he spent there in Chapter 2 of People of the Forties, an autobiographical novel in which he figured under the name of Pasha. Fond of hunting and horseback riding, the boy received scant education: his tutors were a local deacon, a defrocked drunkard, and a strange old man who was known to have toured the area for decades, giving lessons. Aleksey learned reading, writing, arithmetics, Russian and Latin from them. In his autobiography Pisemsky wrote: [...] "Nobody had ever <b>forced</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> learn, and I wasn't an avid learner, but I read a lot and that was my passion: by 14 I consumed, in translation, of course, most of Walter Scott's novels, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, Faublas, Le Diable boiteux, The Serapion Brethren, a Persian novel called Haggi Baba... As for children's books, I couldn't stand them and, as far as I remember now, considering them very silly." [...] Pisemsky wrote scornfully of his primary education and regretted failing to learn any languages besides Latin. He found in himself, however, a natural predisposition to mathematics, logic and aesthetics.|$|E
