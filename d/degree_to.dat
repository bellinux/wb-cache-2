5|$|The {{reductions}} were self-sufficient {{indigenous communities}} of 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually headed by two Jesuit priests and the cabildo (town council and cacique (tribal leader), who retained their functions {{and played the}} role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits. However, the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> which the Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> which they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.|$|E

40|$|The {{involuntary}} nystagmus {{movements of}} 16 -year-old monozygotic twins with tyrosinase negative oculocutaneous albinism were examined. On primary gaze both girls exhibited bilateral conjugate horizontal nystagmus, a jerk with extended foveation waveform, and similar frequencies (2. 0 Hz: 1. 9 Hz), although the fast phases were in opposite directions. The mean amplitudes differed markedly (6. 8 degrees: 3. 7 degrees), {{as did the}} position of the null zones (+ 20 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> + 30 degrees:- 25 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> - 35 <b>degrees)</b> and the widths of the neutral zones (- 25 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> + 20 degrees:- 25 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> - 35 <b>degrees).</b> Since the twins have identical genotypes these differences must have arisen from other sources...|$|R

This would be an experiment to see the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> which professional illustrators felt threatened. Flemming Rose, culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} and the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> which they could become emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business, including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the Arch of the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female {{member of the family}} honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Centred {{primarily}} in Western countries, {{those involved in}} the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.|$|E

50|$|Consider {{a target}} located 10 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> {{the left of}} the centerline. When the mirror is pointed to the left, the target appears to be close {{to the center of the}} mirror, and thus {{projects}} an image 5 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> {{the left of the}} centerline of the reticle. When it has rotated to point straight up, the relative angle of the target is zero, so the image appears 5 degrees down from the centerline, and when it is pointed to the right, 15 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> the left.|$|R

5|$|Heterodimeric {{antibodies}} have {{a greater}} range in shapes they can take and the drugs that {{are attached to the}} arms don’t have to be the same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.|$|E

5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter {{effect has}} been exploited to measure self-esteem. There {{are two types of}} self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem.
