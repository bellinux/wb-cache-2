25|$|This fish is an {{opportunistic}} feeder. Its diet includes planktonic, demersal, and benthic organisms. Copepods {{constitute the}} bulk of their diet. It serves as an important food source for several species of lionfish (Pterois spp.), the honeycomb grouper (Epinephelus merra), the crocodilefish (Cymbacephalus beauforti), the snowflake moray (Echidna nebulosa), the <b>estuarine</b> <b>stonefish</b> (Synanceia horrida), and the yellow-lipped sea krait (Laticauda colubrina).|$|E
50|$|Synanceia horrida, {{also known}} as the <b>estuarine</b> <b>stonefish</b> or {{regionally}} as simply stonefish, is a species of venomous fish of the family Synanceiidae. They are carnivorous ray-finned fish with venomous spines that lives on reef bottoms, camouflaged as a rock. They {{are one of the most}} venomous fish in the world, and are often included in private and public aquariums.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{potential}} {{costs of}} venom production may be significant to many marine venomous taxa. In general, the parameters {{that influence the}} rate of venom production are poorly understood, but seem {{to be related to}} feeding frequency. Methods: This study examines the effects of starvation on venom profile and venom yield on the <b>estuarine</b> <b>stonefish</b> (Synanceia horrida). In total, the venom of eight stonefishes was tested under two feeding regimes. Over a four week period, one of the two groups underwent an episode of suspended feeding, while the other was fed on a daily basis. The effect of time on venom replacement was determined by a paired T-test. ANOVA was performed to analyze differences in venom weight between fed and unfed treatments. Results: Nutritional suspension was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the quantity of venom produced. SDS-PAGE gel and FPLC revealed that the components of the venom collected from both groups were similar, indicating that four weeks is an adequate time to regenerate key venom components but not replenish initial venom quantities. Conclusions: Venom production was found to be affected by starvation...|$|E
40|$|Official Conference Proceedings Most of Singaporeâ€™s {{coastline}} {{has been}} modified by coastal development with variable influences on marine biodiversity. Marinas are typically {{designed as a}} semi-enclosed environment with a complex mix of structures that provide ecological niches throughout the water body. Water flow is inevitably reduced with a possible decline of water quality. This investigation was conducted to determine how marinas affect marine biodiversity. The three marinas studied- Marina at Keppel Bay (MKB), One Degree 15 Marina (ODF), Raffles Marina (RM) - all supported rich biodiversity. The combined 71 faunal taxa (two Classes, 10 Orders and 59 Families) from the soft bottom of all three marinas surveyed using the Ekman grab, were dominated by polychaetes (71. 4 %) and arthropods (16. 7 %; mainly crustaceans). The total fish species surveyed using customised traps was 49 from 31 Families, ranging from the very common and abundant fan-bellied filefish (Monacanthus chinensis) and eeltail catfish (Plotosus spp.), to the less commonly seen fishes such as the starry triggerfish (Abalistes stellatus) and <b>estuarine</b> <b>stonefish</b> (Synanceja horrida). Reef-associated fish species were more abundant at MKB and ODF, while estuarine species dominated at RM. Epibiotic diversity was evident on the artificial structures in all marinas. The submerged sides of berthing pontoons supported up to 107 taxa, dominated by ascidians, macroalgae and sponges. Corals also recruited naturally with 10 and 22 scleractinian genera established on pontoons at MKB and on seawalls at ODF, respectively. In general, fish and soft bottom macrobenthic abundance and diversity were comparable or higher within the marina compared to the adjacent open water. The findings indicate that modified coastal environments such as marinas can support diverse biological communities...|$|E
