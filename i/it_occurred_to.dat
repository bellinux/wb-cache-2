5|$|Several ancient English towns {{displayed}} the Royal Arms of England upon their seals and, when <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> them to adopt insignia of their own, used the Royal Arms, albeit with modification, as their inspiration. For instance, {{in the arms}} of New Romney, the field is changed from red to blue. Hereford changes the lions from gold to silver, and in the 17th century was granted a blue border charged with silver saltires in allusion to its siege by a Scottish army during the English Civil War. The town council of Faversham changes only the hindquarters of the three lions to silver. Berkshire County Council bore arms with two golden lions in reference to its royal patronage and the Norman kings' influence upon the early history of Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E
5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E

25|$|The {{pioneer of}} {{lacrosse}} in Victoria (and Australia as a whole) was a Canadian, Lambton L. Mount. He {{came to the}} Victorian goldfields as a fourteen-year-old {{with his family in}} 1853 {{but it was not until}} 1875 that he was moved to revive his early boyhood memories of lacrosse. After watching the football final between Carlton and Melbourne in that year <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him that lacrosse was a superior game.|$|E
25|$|The {{defining}} {{moment of the}} show came in 1993, when a rape victim, Lavinia Kerwick, rang GRS to air her feelings. For the first time <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Ryan that the story {{was more important than}} the question. Since then The Ryan Show became something of a national institution as the oldest show still running on 2fm. Despite repeated reshuffles which have seen all other presenters shifted around, RTÉ have never moved The Ryan Show from its traditional slot.|$|E
25|$|Cameron {{quit his}} job as a truck driver to enter the film {{industry}} after seeing Star Wars in 1977. When Cameron read Syd Field's book Screenplay, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him that integrating science and art was possible, and he wrote a 10-minute science-fiction script with two friends, titled Xenogenesis. They raised money, rented camera, lenses, film stock and studio then shot it in 35mm. They dismantled the camera to understand how to operate it and spent the first half-day of the shoot {{trying to figure out how}} to get it running.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the fact}} {{remained}} that Hazlitt had {{chosen not to}} follow a pastoral vocation. Although he never abandoned his goal of writing a philosophical treatise on the disinterestedness of the human mind, {{it had to be}} put aside indefinitely. Still dependent on his father, he was now obliged to earn his own living. Artistic talent seemed to run in the family on his mother's side and, starting in 1798, he became increasingly fascinated by painting. His brother, John, had by now become a successful painter of miniature portraits. So <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> William that he might earn a living similarly, and he began to take lessons from John.|$|E
25|$|After M.H. Klaproth had {{discovered}} the presence of potassium in leucite and lepidolite, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> L. N. Vauquelin that it was probably an ingredient likewise in many other minerals. Knowing that alum cannot be obtained in crystals without the addition of potash, he began to suspect that this alkali constituted an essential ingredient in the salt, and in 1797 he published a dissertation demonstrating that alum is a double salt, composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash. Soon after, J.A. Chaptal published the analysis of four different kinds of alum, namely, Roman alum, Levant alum, British alum and alum manufactured by himself. This analysis led to the same result as Vauquelin.|$|E
25|$|In 1637, Scotland {{was in a}} {{state of}} turmoil. King Charles I and William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, met with a reverse in their efforts to impose a new liturgy on the Scots. The new liturgy had been devised by a panel of Scottish bishops, {{including}} Archbishop Spottiswoode of St. Andrews, but a riot against its use was orchestrated in St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh, ostensibly started by Jenny Geddes. Fearing further measures on the part of the King, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Archibald Johnston (Lord Warriston) to revive the Negative Confession of 1581 in a form suited to the times. Together with the cooperation of Alexander Henderson, this National Covenant (as it was called) was finalized in early 1638.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the {{agreement}} between Ford, Cosworth and Lotus was binding on all parties, and Ford as the funder {{had no plans}} to sell or hire the DFV to any other teams. However, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Hayes that there was no competition: the Ferrari engine was underpowered; the BRM complex and too heavy; the Maserati unreliable; the Honda overweight; while Dan Gurney's Weslake motor was powerful but unreliable. Only Brabham's Repco V8 engine provided a usable combination of power, lightness and reliability, but its age and design left little room for further improvement. Hayes concluded that Ford's name could become tarnished if the Lotus were to continue winning against only lesser opposition, and that they should agree to use the unit in other teams, and hence potentially dominate Formula One.|$|E
25|$|The origins {{for a world}} expo for Brisbane {{commenced}} {{soon after}} James Maccormick MBE OAM, architect for the Australia Pavilion at Expo '67, Expo '70 and Expo '74, was commissioned to do an urban renewal study for Kangaroo Point in the early 70s. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Maccormick that an exposition would be an ideal catalyst for such a redevelopment, and he later hosted meetings with prominent Queensland business persons and government representatives to such purpose. With the Australian Bicentenary looming in 1988, other Australian capitals sought means by which to celebrate the event, including hosting of a Universal Exposition and/or Olympic Games. Sydney and Melbourne both made representations to the Federal Government for matching dollar for dollar funding for a Universal Exposition in the 1988 bicentennial year, however, citing {{the costs of the}} new Parliament House in Canberra, also to be opened in the same year, these proposals were knocked back.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 California {{attorney}} and Marshall Islands lobbyist Howard Hills, and Tony Sanchez, a former {{administrator of the}} Guam Superior Court, were indicted for unlawful influence, conspiracy for unlawful influence, theft of property held in trust, and official misconduct for allegedly authorizing 36 payments of $9,000 vis a vis a pre-existing contract between Hills and the Guam Superior Court, each written out to Hills, but funneled to Abramoff. Hills, trusting Sanchez as a court official at face value, assumed {{that this was a}} temporary circumstance and agreed to help facilitate transition for {{what he thought was a}} standard government contract between Abramoff and the court. For this Hills received no compensation. Before indictments or investigations were initiated, Hills halted his temporary contract with Abramoff and reported what he thought was potentially suspicious behavior to public officials when <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him that something may be wrong. In 2007, superseding indictments were issued against Hills and Sanchez, and in 2008 further related indictments were handed down against Abramoff and Abramoff's firm at the time, Greenberg Traurig. The charges against both attorney Howard Hills and Greenberg Traurig have since been dismissed.|$|E

25|$|During a June 2, 1875, {{experiment}} by Bell and {{his assistant}} Thomas Watson, a receiver reed {{failed to respond to}} the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was {{at the other end of}} the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Mr. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate. A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him that since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.|$|E
25|$|With {{recording}} deal form Under One Flag {{for three}} albums Acid Drkinkers was another Polish band attempted to tour outside home country. All throughout after Revolutions of 1989 musicians reserved their passport but after problems with visas <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> {{the group to}} eventually stop their efforts. Remain active only in Poland band received cult status with thirteen albums released, several of them noted on Polish Albums Chart. Other bands like Quo Vadis, and Alastor remain active in underground to incorporate in later years to their music groove, death or progressive metal. Egzekuthor splitup in 1992 after one album, reformed in 2002 to be disbanded in 2008 before second studio effort was released. While Hunter have waited till 1995 to release first album reached acclaim in Poland with 2000s albums. Although over the years moving away from strict thrash metal style Hunter received nomination to Fryderyk, an annual award in Polish music, within several records on Polish Albums Chart have been noted, with songs to receive regular airplay. In later years several thrash metal band heave been developed while {{not one of them}} received acclaim similar to those form the 1980s. Some of them include Geisha Goner (founded in 1990), Tuff Enuff (founded in 1992), Flapjack, Myopia (both founded in 1993), Horrorscope (founded in 1996), Virgin Snatch, Alkatraz (both founded in 2001).|$|E

500|$|Biller {{sought to}} give a more {{interesting}} look at the Borg, rather than simply focusing on their pursuit of assimilation. With this in mind, he thought of an idea based upon the Tower of Babel. He said that the Borg was a [...] "incredibly interwoven, complex community" [...] and [...] "once you knocked it all down you would have all these people who spoke different languages, and couldn't communicate with each other. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me {{that a group of}} ex-Borg would be a very interesting community to explore." [...] He wanted the potential reunification of the ex-Borg to be a moral dilemma. This was based on the growing favorable views of Communism in the Eastern bloc during the mid-1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn {{went on to}} {{make the}} sports comedy Pat and Mike (1952), the second film written {{specifically}} as a Tracy–Hepburn vehicle by Kanin and Gordon. She was a keen athlete, and Kanin later described this as his inspiration for the film: [...] "As I watched Kate playing tennis one day ... <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me that her audience was missing a treat." [...] Hepburn was under pressure to perform several sports to a high standard, many of which did not {{end up in the}} film. Pat and Mike was one of the team's most popular and critically acclaimed films, and it was also Hepburn's personal favorite of the nine films she made with Tracy. The performance brought her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.|$|E
