40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a {{four-year}} field study conducted at the Saskatchewan regional office of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, a large department of the Government of Canada. Over {{the course of the}} study, a sweeping government-wide accounting reform took place entitled the <b>Financial</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Strategy.</b> An ethnographic study was conducted that documented the management accounting processes in place at the regional office prior to the <b>Financial</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Strategy</b> reform, the organization’s adoption of the new accounting system associated with this initiative, and the state of the organization’s management accounting system once the implementation was complete. This research, therefore, captures in detail a management accounting change process in a public sector organization. This study employs an interpretive perspective and draws on institution theory as a theoretical framework. The concept of loose coupling and insights from the literature on professions were also employed in the explanation-building process for the case. This research contributes to institution theory and the study of management accounting change by recognizing conflicting institutional forces at the organizational level. An existing Old Institutional Economics-based conceptual framework for management accounting change is advanced and improved upon through {{the development of a new}} conceptual framework that incorporates the influence of wider institutional forces, the concepts of open and closed organizational systems and loose coupling, and the recognition of varying rates of change and institutionalization of organizational activity sets. Our understanding of loose coupling is enhanced by the interpretation of institutional influences developed in this study as is the role of professionalization as a normative influence in public sector organizations.

In recognition of the importance of FIS, various countries have started to invest massively in such a system. The World Bank has financed several projects worth billions of US dollars, which have been designed with a better focus on the quality of information to reduce the risk of fraud and improve system reliability. This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework that examines FIS effectiveness in reducing corruption in the public sector. The research approach draws on extant literature in <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> <b>strategies,</b> <b>information</b> systems quality, strategic information systems planning, and international anti-corruption strategies to identify determining factors of information quality, system quality, service quality, FIS characteristic effectiveness, and financial corruption reduction. Results of the literature review suggest 19 propositions and 5 main factors grouped into determinants, including information systems quality, information quality and service quality. Linking financial corruption reduction with anti-corruption strategy, the proposed framework adopts the anti-corruption strategy four-perspective approach to examine the impact of increasing transparency, increasing accountability, decreasing discretion, and low enforcement.

Banks as lenders to Medium Sized firms use the <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> in the credit assessment process. The availability {{and quality of the}} <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> depends on the information environment of the country. We have conducted a quantitative study where we examined 80 loan applications of the Medium Sized firms to the Big 4 private banks inPakistan. We collected the data of 80 loan applications by the Medium Sized firms of which in 40 cases, the banks granted loans and in 40 cases, the banks rejected the loan applications. We wanted to create a representative sample of the population that leads us to choose snowball sampling that is non-probability technique in our research to find the responsible persons in the banks who can give us our desired data. To get the desired data from the bank officials, we have used close ended questionnaire to collect the data on different variables of availability of <b>financial</b> <b>information,</b> the quality of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> and the verification of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> with relation to loan decisions. We have analyzed the impact of the availability of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> variables i. e. number of years’ financial statements, bank account statement, income tax return and audit on the loan decisions of the banks. Later, we analyzed the impact of the quality of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> on the loan decisions and on the verification process of the banks. We used univariate data analysis to summarize the data and to examine the descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation of the dataset. We also used Crosstabs in SPSS, Chi-square test and regression to find out the relationship between the <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> and loan decisions. We have conducted Chi-square to measure the statistical significance to check the p-value to accept or reject the hypotheses. We have found that if more number of years’ financial statements, income tax return and audit is available, the banks are more likely to make grant decision. However, bank account statement does not have any effect on the loan decisions of the banks. Later, we found that the banks are more likely to grant loans to Medium Sized firms if the quality of the <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> is not poor.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} the value relevance of non-financial performance information, {{within the context}} of the biotechnology industry. We also investigate the interactions between <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> and non-financial performance information. We develop six hypotheses that are specific to the biotechnology industry: H 1 : <b>Financial</b> <b>information,</b> after controlling for its sign, is value relevant. H 2 : A firm's product market status enhances the value relevance of <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> Reported by biotechnology firms. H 3 : Information about R&D expenditures (R&D inputs) has incremental value relevance over <b>financial</b> <b>information.</b> H 4 : Clinical trial information about a firm's drug portfolios (R&D outputs) has incremental value relevance over financial and R&D input information. H 5 : The incremental value relevance of information on a firm's drug portfolios is greater for drugs at more advanced stages than for drugs at earlier stages. H 6 : Information about a firm's business relations has incremental value relevance over its financial and R&D innovation information. We test these hypotheses using data of biotechnology firms collected from 1998 to 2001. Our findings indicate that, in the biotechnology industry, (1) <b>financial</b> <b>information,</b> after the control for its sign, is value relevant; (2) a firm's product market status can help investors better understand the value relevance of <b>financial</b> <b>information,</b> especially earnings; (3) R&D intensity (proxy for R&D inputs) is incrementally value relevant over financial information; (4) drug portfolios (proxies for R&D outputs) are incrementally value relevant over <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> and R&D intensity; (5) the incremental value relevance of drug portfolios is greater for drugs at more advanced stages than for drugs at earlier stages; (6) Alliances (a proxy for business relations) are incrementally value relevant over <b>financial</b> <b>information,</b> R&D intensity and drug portfolios. With respect to the interactions between <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> and non-financial performance information, we find that <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> can enhance the value relevance of non-financial performance information, while non-financial performance information, in turn, can enhance the value relevance of <b>financial</b> <b>information.</b> Based on these interactions, we suggest an interactive perspective for the evaluation and exploration of the value relevance of the two types of information. In addition, we propose a more reliable measurement of R&D innovation. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
