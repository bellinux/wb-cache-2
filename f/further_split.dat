5|$|The {{number of}} triarii was fixed at 600 per legion, there were usually 1,200 hastati and 1,200 principes per legion, {{with the rest}} being light {{infantry}} like the velites. In the standard legion {{around the time of}} the Second Punic War (218 -201 BC) there were 10 maniples of hastati, each having 120 hastati, with 40 velites attached. The maniples were <b>further</b> <b>split</b> into centuries, of 60 hastati and 20 velites, with the centurion of the hastati century commanding the velites as well.|$|E
5|$|As Co-Freemasonry {{spread in}} England from 1902, some members became alarmed by {{decisions}} {{taken by the}} governing body in Paris. There was a perceived threat to the ancient form of masonic ritual. Resignations resulted, in 1908, {{in the formation of}} a new Grand Lodge, which became the Honourable Fraternity of Antient Masonry, under a clergyman, the Rev. Dr. William Frederick Cobb, as Grand Master. His retirement after four years led to the election of a female Grand Master. Reverting to the original legal meaning of Brotherhood, the members have addressed each other as Brother since 1908. A <b>further</b> <b>split</b> occurred in 1913, when those wishing to include higher degrees, specifically the Royal Arch, left to form the Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons. Both societies are now exclusively female. The Honourable Fraternity of Antient Masonry restricted initiation to women and stopped admitting male visitors. The last male member left in 1935. The older society, having started working higher degrees, changed its name in 1958, appending the Order of Women Freemasons, as they are known today. Both bodies have lodges throughout the United Kingdom, and the Order of Women Freemasons also has lodges in Australasia, Zimbabwe, and Spain.|$|E

5|$|The {{club was}} later renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club. Badger digging {{required}} {{a different type}} of dog than fox hunting, and it is likely that Bull terrier stock was introduced to strengthen the breed, which may have caused the creation of a shorter legged variety of Jack Russell terrier that started to appear around this period. At the same time that a split was appearing between show and working Fox terriers, a <b>further</b> <b>split</b> was occurring between two different types of white terrier, both carrying Jack Russell's name. Heinemann was invited to judge classes for working terriers at Crufts with an aim to bring working terriers back into the show ring and influence those that disregard working qualities in dogs. These classes were continued for several years by various judges, but Charles Cruft dropped the attempt as the classes were never heavily competed. Following Heinemann's death in 1930, the kennel and leadership of the club passed to Annie Harris, but the club itself folded shortly before World War II.|$|E

Here they found that in E. coli, which has a known methylome, event windows of 5 base pairs long {{can be used to}} divide and statistically analyze the raw MinION electrical signals.

25|$|Also {{during this}} period the three {{contemporary}} branches of Ismailism formed. The first branch (Druze) occurred with the al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah.

Later {{to be known as the}} Druze, they believe Al-Hakim to be the manifestation of God and the prophesied Mahdi, who would one day return and bring justice to the world. The faith <b>further</b> <b>split</b> from Ismailism as it developed unique doctrines which often class it separately from both Ismailism and Islam.|$|E
