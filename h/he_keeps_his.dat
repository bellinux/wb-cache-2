5|$|David and Millie {{arrive in}} Rome, though <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> ability a secret. After talking, {{they share a}} kiss and have sex. They visit the Colosseum, where David meets Griffin (Jamie Bell), another Jumper. A group of Paladins appear, and Griffin casually kills them, then jumps away. David tries to leave with Millie, but he's {{detained}} by Italian police and questioned about the deaths. David's mother, Mary (Diane Lane), who had left {{him when he was}} five, appears and helps him escape. She urges him to leave Rome with Millie, to protect her. Millie, upset and afraid when David tries to skirt around the issue, demands to know the truth. David declines and puts her on a plane home.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> gloveless right hand warm. He retains {{a piece of his}} dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of the mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> head down and takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius {{may be able to}} use the inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Homer stays true to {{his word}} and remains calm. However, his new calm {{demeanor}} has taken away Bart's inspiration for his cartoon, so Bart and Milhouse set up a trap for Homer to trigger another outburst. Later, {{they go to the}} Internet company office, where they find the company has gone bankrupt. Homer reaches home and happens upon Bart's trap, but <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> calm throughout its run, causing lumps to develop on his neck. The trap ends with Homer falling into a pool full of green paint, prompting him to go berserk and storm through town. The police restrain him and Homer is admitted to the hospital. Dr. Hibbert arrives and tells Marge that Bart actually saved Homer's life by enraging him. Hibbert explains the lumps on his neck were actually boils caused by suppressed rage and would have otherwise overwhelmed his system. Homer thanks Bart by taking him fishing, where he continues to make his father angry.|$|E

Slug plants drugs on Becky. At Becky and Steve's 2nd wedding, the reception is raided by police, and Becky is arrested for drug possession. Steve hires lawyers to free Becky and after Steve and Becky find Slug and convince him {{to tell them what}} Hooch has on him that he would even consider framing Becky, they use it to blackmail Hooch into calling a truce and drop the charges.|$|E

As Dick is leaving Shoreby he sees Crookback holding his own against {{seven or eight}} Lancastrian assailants, and assists his victory. Dick's accurate knowledge of the Lancastrian forces in Shoreby aid Crookback in winning the battle that he wages later that day. Dick is also successful as one of Crookback's commanders. Crookback knights Dick {{on the field of}} battle and, following their victory, gives him fifty horsemen to pursue Sir Daniel, who has escaped Shoreby with Joanna.

Kemp continues to study science as he hopes to be admitted to The Royal Society. His scientific temperament makes him listen to the story Griffin tells him. He does not become hysterical nor does he behave like the locals. Griffin hopes Kemp would support him in his evil schemes and help him live a normal life, but Kemp is too decent to join him. He is repelled by Griffin's brutality and considers him insane and homicidal. He betrays Griffin to the police. <b>He</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> cool throughout the plot, when the final hunt for Griffin begins. Kemp helps in the final capture and killing of Griffin.|$|E
25|$|Her realm becomes {{known as}} the Val sans Retour (the Vale of No Return). Morgan's fancied good knights besides Lancelot include the rescued-but-abducted young Sir Alexander the Orphan (Alisaunder le Orphelin, a cousin of Tristan and Mark's enemy), whom she {{promises}} to heal, but he vows to rather castrate himself than to pleasure her, but promises her to defend the castle of Fair Guard (Belle Garde), {{where he has been}} held for a year, and then continues to guard it even when the castle was burnt down. In the Val sans Retour, Lancelot frees the many knights entrapped by Morgan from her power, including Morgan's own son Ywain and her former lover Guiomars who has been turned to stone by her for his unfaithfulness. Morgan captures Lancelot under her spell and keeps him prisoner in the hope Guinevere would go mad or die of sorrow, and otherwise torments the queen, causing her a great distress and making her miserable until the Lady of the Lake gives her a ring of protection from any power of Morgan. On one occasion, she lets the captive Lancelot go to rescue Sir Gawain when he promises to come back, and <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> word and does return; she eventually releases him when his health falters and he is near death.|$|E

500|$|Bojić began {{attending}} the Terazije Elementary School in 1898, {{and finished with}} excellent grades. He likely began writing poetry {{between the ages of}} eight and ten, and this caught the attention of some of his teachers. Jovan Dravić, who taught Serbian in Bojić's school, wrote: [...] "One of my pupils has been writing poetry since his first year of elementary school. His father, a shoemaker on Sremska Street, is very proud of his son's work. <b>He</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> poems locked away in a safe as great treasures, convinced that they are of immense value and proof of his son's brilliant future." ...|$|E

In 1865, {{early in his}} Paris stay, Hay penned [...] "Sunrise in the Place de la Concorde", a poem attacking Napoleon III for his reinstitution of the monarchy, {{depicting}} the Emperor as having been entrusted with the child Democracy by Liberty, and strangling it with his own hands.

500|$|Having {{just been}} {{released}} from Burnley, Pugh signed for League Two club Bury on a short-term contract on 23 March 2006, following a three-week trial. Bury were entangled in a relegation battle, and Pugh made his debut two days later after coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for Lewis Gobern in a 2–1 home win over Rochdale. He marked his first start for Bury with a goal from 10yards in a 1–1 away draw with Lincoln City on 15 April 2006, after which manager Chris Casper commented [...] "Mark's a good player and he's got a bright future if <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> feet on the ground". He finished the 2005–06 season by playing six matches and scoring one goal for the club. As {{a result of his}} good performances, and helped by the fact that Bury had survived relegation in 19th place, Bury manager Chris Casper offered him a new one-year contract at Gigg Lane; his first professional contract.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} a 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 56 metascore on Metacritic. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby, while quite {{critical}} of the film overall, praised Douglas' work as [...] "the funniest, canniest performance of his career". Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised it for allowing [...] "all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense. The movie can be followed by anybody, because the details of stock manipulation are all filtered through transparent layers of greed. Most {{of the time we}} know what's going on. All of the time, we know why". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "This time he works up a salty sweat to end up nowhere, like a triathlete on a treadmill. But as long as <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> players in venal, perpetual motion, it is great scary fun to watch him work out". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Jay Scott praised the performances of the two leads: [...] "But Douglas's portrayal of Gordon Gekko is an oily triumph and as the kid Gekko thinks he has found in Fox ('Poor, smart and hungry; no feelings'), Charlie Sheen evolves persuasively from gung-ho capitalist child to wily adolescent corporate raider to morally appalled adult". Rita Kempley in the Washington Post wrote that the film [...] "is at its weakest when it preaches visually or verbally. Stone doesn't trust the time-honored story line, supplementing the obvious moral with plenty of soapboxery".|$|E

500|$|Other, less obvious, {{elements}} of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled [...] "Upon Riches", {{which suggests that the}} poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry. Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was The Poet's Ramble After Riches, which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced the picture. Earlier impressions showed the poem as [...] "Poverty, A Poem", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written [...] "The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare" [...] in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled [...] "A View of the Gold Mines of Peru", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, the mug of beer sitting on the chair {{in the back of the}} room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects. Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>his</b> gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized.|$|E
