[...] Duchamp left a legacy to chess {{in the form of}} an enigmatic endgame problem he composed in 1943. The problem was included in the announcement for Julian Levi's gallery exhibition Through the Big End of the Opera Glass, printed on translucent paper with the faint inscription: [...] "White to play and win". Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem, with most concluding that there is no solution.|$|E

Billman was {{given the opportunity to}} study art in March and April in Antwerp. The journey gave inspiration for new motifs. But above all had the harbour environments strongly reminded him of his years as a sailor.

About the woodcut [...] Stoker watch goes over deck in the storm (1936/37) the artist said: [...] "I remember the first scene I got inspiration from. It was when the watch came up and the boat was filled with water and there they stood up to their necks in water, so to speak. That I thought, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> portray.
