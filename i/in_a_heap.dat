5|$|It was {{possible}} {{to look into the}} back yard from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heap,</b> from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E
5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> leach. This {{is done by}} percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E
2500|$|Ternary {{heapsort}} uses <b>a</b> ternary <b>heap</b> {{instead of}} <b>a</b> binary heap; that is, each {{element in the}} heap has three children. It is more complicated to program, but does a constant number of times fewer swap and comparison operations. [...] This is because each sifting step <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ternary <b>heap</b> requires three comparisons and one swap, whereas <b>in</b> <b>a</b> binary <b>heap</b> two comparisons and one swap are required. Two levels <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ternary <b>heap</b> cover 9 elements, doing more work with {{the same number of}} comparisons as three levels in the binary heap, which only cover 8.|$|R

25|$|Since the {{ordering}} of siblings <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> is not {{specified by the}} heap property, a single node's two children can be freely interchanged unless doing so violates the shape property (compare with treap). Note, however, that in the common array-based heap, simply swapping the children might also necessitate moving the children's sub-tree nodes to retain the heap property.|$|E
25|$|With one exception, pre-Hispanic {{pieces were}} not glazed, {{but rather the}} finish was made with a slip made of {{extremely}} fine clay. This slip often had mineral pigments added for color, which could be added before and/or after firing. Firing was done in an open fire or in a pit. Figurines were often done in the family hearth. Pots were fired <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> placed {{on the ground or}} in a pit and covered with wood. The use of this method for firing most often led to incompletely fired pots, with the notable exception of Fine Orangeware.|$|E
25|$|The first {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by a military commission, led by Lieutenant General Wilhelm Mohr and consisting of Captain Stein I. Eriksen, Police Inspector Liv Daae Gabrielsen and pilot Hallvard Vikholt. The wreckage was salvaged by MS Hugo Trygvasson starting on 16 March. The pieces of wreckage were hoisted on board and stored before being freighted to a hangar at Bodø Airport, where the {{investigation was}} carried out. Lack of space on board the ship meant that the wreckage was stored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> and could have suffered damage during loading and transport. Some of the technical analysis of the aircraft's components were carried out by de Havilland Canada and by Transport Canada.|$|E
5000|$|<b>In</b> {{computer}} science, <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> is <b>a</b> specialized tree-based {{data structure}} that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of node P {{is greater than}} the key of node C. <b>A</b> <b>heap</b> can be classified further as either a [...] "max heap" [...] or a [...] "min heap". <b>In</b> <b>a</b> max <b>heap,</b> the keys of parent nodes are always {{greater than or equal to}} those of the children and the highest key is in the root node. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> min <b>heap,</b> the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node.|$|R

25|$|Chappell, the {{grandson}} of Victor Richardson, had no doubt been weaned on tales of the Bodyline tour by his grandfather, {{one of the few}} Australian batsmen to fight it out with Larwood and his support bowlers. Forty years later, {{and it was time to}} pay back the Poms. When Keith Fletcher deflected a ball on to his cap and crumpled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> as it dropped just short of cover point, Ian Chappell probably thought his grandafther would approve if he had been alive to witness the carnage. One can only hope that the reaction of Vic Richardson – a combative, but essentially a cheerful, sporting cricketer – would have surprised Chappell.|$|E
25|$|James Anderson {{then took}} two early wickets, {{leading to a}} long bowling effort for him - he bowled 28 overs, but could not add to his wicket tally, while Usman Afzaal ran away to 147, adding 183 with Bilal Shafayat. Northamptonshire {{declared}} eight overs into the last day, with the score 400 for 6 to unleash their spinners on Lancashire's batting line-up - and they did so very successfully. Brown got his second five-for of the match, ending with match figures of ten for 135, and Monty Panesar also got three wickets as Lancashire collapsed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> for 103 - with only Chilton passing 20, in a reversal of fortunes from the first innings.|$|E
500|$|Their {{bodies were}} left <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heap,</b> and by 9:00a.m. a {{considerable}} crowd had gathered. The corpses were pelted with vegetables, spat at, urinated on, shot at and kicked; Mussolini's face was disfigured by beatings. An American eye witness described {{the crowd as}} [...] "sinister, depraved, out of control". After a while, the bodies were hoisted up on to the metal girder framework of a half-built Standard Oil service station, and hung upside down on meat hooks. This mode of hanging {{had been used in}} northern Italy since medieval times to stress the [...] "infamy" [...] of the hanged. However, the reason given by those involved in hanging Mussolini and the others in this way was to protect the bodies from the mob.

Daniel Oliver thought it [...] "very extraordinary", and even Darwin's old beetle-hunting rival Charles Babington, by then professor of botany at the University of Cambridge and inclined to oppose natural selection, called it [...] "exceedingly interesting and valuable... highly satisfactory in all respects. The results are most curious and the skill shown in discovering them equally so."

500|$|Thomas Sotinel of Le Monde {{started his}} review by recalling the {{irritation}} the film caused upon its world premiere in Cannes, and compared the cut {{he had seen}} there to the final version: [...] "In all honesty, the difference does not jump to my eyes. Of course, the film seems more consistent, {{but that may be}} because we've already traveled this maze once. While leaving, we might remain calmer, but still amazed by the mixture of exuberant invention and puerility." [...] A positive review came from L'Express, written by Laurent Djian, who compared the film to 2001: A Space Odyssey. He applauded how he found the strobe lights hypnotising in a way that influenced the perception of time. [...] "In 2010, no other filmmaker [...] than Gaspar Noé can shoot with such mastery, nor draw us into a vortex of sensations as vertiginous." [...] Ouest-Frances critic, on the other hand, was immensely bored by the film, and called it [...] "a padding of simple ideas, stereotypes and cliches <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heap</b> of contrived and vain images which think they're technical prowess. Soporific cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|Stop 2 landed, formed {{up into a}} sweep {{line and}} marched {{carefully}} to the north alongside a dry riverbed. As darkness fell, just as {{they came to a}} widening in the riverbed, they were suddenly fired upon by an unseen foe. All four men dropped to the ground to avoid being hit. The Canadian lance-corporal called for covering fire from Soares, which he provided as Lamb and Rok rose to their feet and cautiously moved forward. A dark figure suddenly ran across the soldiers' line of sight, between Lamb and the riverbed, and from a distance of about 16 paces Olivier reflexively swung his rifle around and let off a frenzied, imprecise burst of fire. Mortally wounded by two errant shots through the chest, Lamb stumbled, slumped to the ground and lay face-down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heap.</b> One of the bullets exited through the back of his body, smashing the radio he had been carrying. He died almost instantly. Meanwhile, the cadres ahead ran headlong into Stop 1, led by Sergeant Derrick Taylor, and were all killed in the ensuing fire fight. Taylor's stick sustained no casualties. When the battle was over, Stops 1 and 3 joined Olivier, Rok and Soares and waited beside Lamb's lifeless body all night until it could be evacuated by helicopter to the local hospital at Chipinga. The death was officially recorded as [...] "killed in action", with no reference to friendly fire.|$|E
