25|$|Most tasks {{featured}} on the show often have a constraint on them in regards to filming, in that production staff must get filming permission from a shop/establishment that the candidates wish to visit and do deals within, which can often be time consuming. An example {{of this can be}} found in this task, in that <b>Karen</b> <b>had</b> located several places for the tyre she sought, but could not visit them as the film crew following her team had no permission to film on these premises.|$|E

25|$|By 1965, <b>Karen</b> <b>had</b> been {{practicing}} the drums for a year, and Richard was refining his piano techniques under Pooler's tuition. Late that year, Richard {{teamed up with}} Jacobs, who played tuba and stand-up bass. With Karen drumming, the three formed the jazz-oriented Richard Carpenter Trio. Richard led the band and wrote all the arrangements, {{and they began to}} rehearse daily. He bought a tape recorder, and began to make recordings of the group. Originally, neither Karen nor Richard sang; Richard's friend Dan Friberg occasionally filled in on trumpet, along with guest vocalist Margaret Shanor.|$|E

The conflict continues as of 2008. In 2004, the BBC, citing aid agencies, estimates that up to 200,000 Karen have been driven from their homes during decades of war, with 120,000 more refugees from Burma, mostly Karen, living in refugee camps on the Thai side of the border. Many accuse the military government of Burma of ethnic cleansing. As {{a result of the}} ongoing war in minority group areas more than two million people have fled Burma to Thailand.|$|E
2500|$|Richard and Karen Carpenter {{signed to}} A Records on April 22, 1969, {{under the name}} [...] "Carpenters". Since Karen was 19 and underage, her parents had to co-sign.

2500|$|Following Karen's death, Richard has {{continued}} to produce recordings of the duo's music, including several albums of previously unreleased material and numerous compilations. The posthumous Voice of the Heart was released in late 1983 and included some tracks left off Made in America and earlier albums. It peaked at No.46 and was certified gold. Two singles were released, [...] "Make Believe It's Your First Time", a second version of a song <b>Karen</b> <b>had</b> recorded for her solo album, and [...] "Your Baby Doesn't Love You Anymore".|$|E
2500|$|In 2007 and 2009, {{the current}} {{owners of the}} former Carpenter family home on Newville Avenue, Downey, {{obtained}} city permits {{to tear down the}} existing buildings to make room for newer and larger structures, despite protests from fans. In February 2008, the campaign was covered in the Los Angeles Times. At that time an adjacent house that had once served as the band's headquarters and recording studio had already been demolished and the main house {{was on the verge of}} being demolished too. The original house was featured on the cover of Now & Then and was where <b>Karen</b> <b>had</b> died. In the words of one fan, [...] "this was our version of Graceland." ...|$|E
2500|$|Written by Bonnie Bramlett and Leon Russell, [...] "Superstar" [...] {{had been}} made popular by Rita Coolidge in 1970, but the Carpenters' version, {{released}} as a single in August 1971, became an international hit. In the liner notes for , Richard writes that he saw Bette Midler singing the song on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and felt {{that it would be}} a perfect fit for Karen's voice. Richard did have reservations about the lyrics, however, which he found a little too suggestive. After changing [...] "I can hardly wait to sleep with you again" [...] to [...] "I can hardly wait to be with you again," [...] he recorded Karen singing the song, reading the revised lyrics from a napkin. What wound up on the finished recording was the first time <b>Karen</b> <b>had</b> ever sung [...] "Superstar". After only the first take, Richard claimed that her performance was [...] "perfect" [...] as it was, and did not need repeating.|$|E

2500|$|Karen did {{not possess}} a {{powerful}} singing voice, but close miking brought out many nuances in her performances. Her lower register {{was warm and}} distinctive. Richard arranged their music {{to take advantage of}} this, though <b>Karen</b> <b>had</b> a three-octave vocal range. Richard's work with Karen was influenced by the music of Les Paul, whose overdubbing of the voice of wife and musical partner Mary Ford allowed her to be used as both the lead and harmony vocals. By multi-tracking, Richard was able to use Karen and himself for the harmonies to back Karen's lead. The overdubbed background harmonies were distinctive to the Carpenters, but it was the soulful, engaging sound of Karen's lead voice that made them so recognizable. Record executive Mike Curb said it was Karen's voice that took the Carpenters above straight pop music into pop rock. She was known as a [...] "one take wonder" [...] and could deliver a strong performance on the first attempt.|$|E
2500|$|On February 1, 1983, Karen and Richard met {{for dinner}} and {{discussed}} future plans for the Carpenters, including a return to touring. On February 3, Karen visited her parents, and discussed finalising her divorce to Burris. The following morning, her mother found her lying unresponsive {{on the floor of}} a walk-in closet, and she was rushed to hospital. After spending 20 minutes in a waiting room, a doctor entered to tell Richard and his parents that <b>Karen</b> <b>had</b> died. The autopsy stated that her death was caused by [...] "emetine cardiotoxicity due to or as a consequence of anorexia nervosa." [...] Under the anatomical summary, the first item was heart failure, followed by anorexia. The third finding was cachexia, which is extremely low weight and weakness and general body decline associated with chronic disease. Emetine cardiotoxicity implied that Karen abused ipecac syrup, although there was no evidence to suggest that she did as her brother and family never found ipecac vials in her apartment, even after her death.|$|E
