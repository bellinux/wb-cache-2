Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutation,</b> which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutation,</b> by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele.

5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutation).</b> The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{monogenic}} diseases {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal dominant mutation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies were examined in this study, one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutation.</b> Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E
40|$|<b>De</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> are {{recognized}} {{both as an}} important source of genetic variation and as a prominent cause of sporadic disease in humans. <b>Mutations</b> identified as <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> are generally assumed to have occurred during gametogenesis and, consequently, to be present as germline events in an individual. Because Sanger sequencing does not provide the sensitivity to reliably distinguish somatic from germline mutations, the proportion of <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> that occur somatically rather than in the germline remains largely unknown. To determine the contribution of post-zygotic events to <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations,</b> we analyzed a set of 107 <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> in 50 parent-offspring trios. Using four different sequencing techniques, we found that 7 (6. 5 %) of these presumed germline <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> were in fact present as mosaic mutations in the blood of the offspring and were therefore likely to have occurred post-zygotically. Furthermore, genome-wide analysis of "de novo" variants in the proband led to the identification of 4 / 4, 081 variants that were also detectable in the blood of one of the parents, implying parental mosaicism as the origin of these variants. Thus, our results show that an important fraction of <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> presumed to be germline in fact occurred either post-zygotically in the offspring or were inherited as a consequence of low-level mosaicism in one of the parents...|$|R

To address this, we evolve genetically diverse populations of budding yeast, S.  cerevisiae, consisting of diploid cells with unique haplotype combinations. We study the asexual evolution of these populations under selective inhibition with chemotherapeutic drugs by time-resolved whole-genome sequencing and phenotyping. All populations undergo clonal expansions driven by <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> but remain genetically and phenotypically diverse. The clones exhibit widespread genomic instability, rendering recessive <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> homozygous and refining pre-existing variation. Finally, we decompose the fitness contributions of pre-existing and <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> {{by creating a}} large recombinant library of adaptive mutations in an ensemble of genetic backgrounds.

2500|$|ALGS is an {{autosomal}} dominant multi-system disorder affecting several body systems including the liver, heart, skeleton, eye, facial structure, kidneys and vascular system. The most clinically significant concerns stem from liver, heart, vascular or renal problems. Mutations in JAG1 were first discovered {{to be responsible}} for ALGS by researchers at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the National Institutes of Health in 1997. Patients who are clinically consistent with the disorder usually have a mutation in JAG1 (94%), while a smaller 2% have a mutation in NOTCH2. Over half of individuals with mutations in the gene did not inherit it from either parent, and thus have a <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutation.</b> JAG1 mutation types include protein truncating (splice site, frameshift, and nonsense), missense, and whole gene deletions accounting for 80%, 7%, and 12% respectively. Since all mutation types lead to a patient phenotype, it is thought that haploinsufficiency for JAG1 is the likely disease mechanism of action. [...] Although individuals can have a range of mutation types in JAG1, all of the known mutations lead to loss of the function of one copy, and, there is no correlation between mutation type or location and disease severity. Though individuals with ALGS have several body systems affected, there is a subset of individuals with JAG1 mutations who present with tetralogy of fallot/pulmonary stenosis that do not show the other clinical signs of the syndrome. Given the variable expressivity of the disease, there may be other genetic or environmental modifiers present beyond the original JAG1 mutation.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>De</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> are a {{frequent}} cause of disorders related to brain development. We report {{the results of}} screening patients diagnosed with both epilepsy and intellectual disability (ID) using exome sequencing to identify known and new causative <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> relevant to these conditions. METHODS: Exome sequencing was performed on 39 patient-parent trios to identify <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations.</b> Clinical significance of <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> in genes was determined using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standard guidelines for interpretation of coding variants. Variants in genes of unknown clinical significance were further analysed {{in the context of}} previous trio sequencing efforts in neurodevelopmental disorders. RESULTS: In 39 patient-parent trios we identified 29 <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> in coding sequence. Analysis of <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> and inherited variants yielded a molecular diagnosis in 11 families (28. 2 %). In combination with previously published exome sequencing results in neurodevelopmental disorders, our analysis implicates HECW 2 as a novel candidate gene in ID and epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of exome sequencing as a diagnostic approach for ID and epilepsy, and confirm previous results regarding the importance of <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> in this patient group. The results also highlight the utility of network analysis and comparison to previous large-scale studies as strategies to prioritise candidate genes for further studies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{causes of}} {{intellectual}} disability remain largely unknown because of extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity. METHODS: We evaluated patients with intellectual disability to exclude known {{causes of the}} disorder. We then sequenced the coding regions of more than 21, 000 genes obtained from 100 patients with an IQ below 50 and their unaffected parents. A data-analysis procedure was developed to identify and classify <b>de</b> <b>novo,</b> autosomal recessive, and X-linked mutations. In addition, we used high-throughput resequencing to confirm new candidate genes in 765 persons with intellectual disability (a confirmation series). All mutations were evaluated by molecular geneticists and clinicians {{in the context of}} the patients' clinical presentation. RESULTS: We identified 79 <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> in 53 of 100 patients. A total of 10 <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> and 3 X-linked (maternally inherited) mutations that had been previously predicted to compromise the function of known intellectual-disability genes were found in 13 patients. Potentially causative <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> in novel candidate genes were detected in 22 patients. Additional <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> in 3 of these candidate genes were identified in patients with similar phenotypes in the confirmation series, providing support for mutations in these genes as the cause of intellectual disability. We detected no causative autosomal recessive inherited mutations in the discovery series. Thus, the total diagnostic yield was 16 %, mostly involving <b>de</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>De</b> <b>novo</b> <b>mutations</b> represent an important cause of intellectual disability; exome sequencing was used as an effective diagnostic strategy for their detection.

There is also a 50% chance their child will have two working copies of the gene, and would therefore, not have SCS. If both parents carry a single copy of the SCS gene mutation, then there is a 25% chance their child will have two gene mutation copies (so child would develop severe SCS), a 25% chance their child would have two normal copies of the gene (so would be completely normal), and a 50% chance their child would carry one gene mutation copy and 1 normal copy (so child may or may not display SCS).
