5000|$|Storage heaters {{usually have}} two {{controls}} - a charge control (often called [...] "input"), which controls {{the amount of}} heat stored, and the <b>draught</b> <b>control</b> (often called [...] "output"), which controls {{the rate at which}} heat is released. These controls may be controlled by the user, or may operate automatically once the user selects the target room temperature on a thermostat.|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} <b>draught</b> <b>control</b> system, as {{fitted to}} modern tractors, {{consists of a}} negative feed back control system that adjusts the working depth of mounted or semi mounted soil engaging implements {{in an attempt to}} regulate the draught requirements of the implement. The system has become important in agricultural production because it increases the efficiency of tractor operations in two ways. Firstly, by controlling the draught requirements of an implement the <b>draught</b> <b>control</b> system allows tractor engine efficiency to be optimised. Secondly, by transferring some of the weight of the implement onto the rear wheels of the tractor, wheel slip is reduced and controlled. This latter function, more than any other, was responsible for the major change in the design concept of tractors, permitting smaller, lighter tractors to do the same work as their heavier predecessors, pulling trailed implements. The control system has lead to the ability of relatively light weight tractors being able to maintain a high work rate (in terms of area cultivated in a given time) with acceptable working depth fluctuations, and without undue energy loss through wheel slip...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Tractors incorporate draught, controls for two reasons, to limit variations in implement depth and to limit fluctuations in the load, i. e. the draught force, imposed on the tractor by the implement. Efficient operation of this control is important because many farmers demand a consistent tillage depth and also, if the load is controlled, the tractor can be operated at its maximum output without excessive wheel slip or engine stall. The work for this thesis involved a theoretical investigation of <b>draught</b> <b>control</b> response {{and its effect on}} overall tractor performance. A computer model was devised to simulate <b>draught</b> <b>control</b> and its effect on dynamic performance of the tractor-implement combination. Input data for the simulation was provided by laboratory measurements. Two series of field work were carried out to measure response of a linkage force sensing experimental control to sinusoidal and random draught variations and the response of a control which sensed driveline torque. Comparisons between measured and predicted results, confirmed the validity of the theoretical analysis. Suggestions for improving control performance, particularly stability, are made and the likely improvement predicted using the computer simulation. Other possible methods of implement control or improvements to draught controls are discussed in relation to the likely requirements of future tractors...|$|E
5000|$|These {{furnaces}} had underground flues and chimneys {{with air}} holes {{to provide a}} strong air <b>draught</b> to <b>control</b> heat. [...] Fritting, pre-heating pots and annealing processes were undertaken in different sections of the furnace, elevated above the heat source.|$|R

50|$|A {{space is}} left in {{the centre of the}} {{water-tube}} banks for the firing chute. The firebox is top-fired (and lit) through this chute and there is no side firedoor. The lower part of the water-jacketed barrel surrounds the firebox. The narrow waterspace here encourages rapid steam raising. Firing is simple, with a thick fire relative to its area and fuel simply poured down. Beneath the grate is a water-filled ashpan, to prevent hot embers falling onto the road. <b>Draught</b> is <b>controlled</b> by a damper {{in the side of the}} ashpan, between the grate and the water tray.|$|R
50|$|Cebu International Port and Cebu Domestic Port serves {{container}} {{vessels and}} passenger ships with destinations {{around the country}} and the world. Cebu International Port is a multipurpose terminal covering an area of 10 hectares with 690 meters of berthing space and a <b>controlling</b> <b>draught</b> of minus 8.5 meters at MLLW. The Cebu Baseport - Domestic Zone is the area for the domestic transactions of different business coming from and going to the different island of the archipelago. It is dedicated to coastwise shipping with 3.5 kilometers of berthing space, 3 finger piers and 3 passenger terminals.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{introductory}} {{to the series}} of works presented in this special issue on the homeostasis and the signaling roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants. Upper half of this article briefly describes {{the history of the}} ROS study in the field of plant immunity research initiated by the observation that the attacks by pathogenic microorganisms possibly stimulate the burst of ROS production in the plant tissues. The topics covered in the series of works presented here include the plants' responses to abiotic oxidative stress (atmospheric ozone), regulation of seed germination, chemical interaction between parasitic and host plants and the <b>draught</b> tolerance, all <b>controlled</b> through homeostasis of ROS at biochemical and molecular biological levels. Lastly a discussion forum was proposed to further deepen our understanding of ROS behaviors in plants...|$|R
50|$|Transmission was 8 speed {{through a}} single clutch with {{the option of}} the Allis-Chalmers half shaft clutch to achieve 'live' power take-off. Converging three point linkage was powered by an engine mounted {{hydraulic}} pump giving hydraulic power whenever the engine was running regardless of transmission status. An hydraulic weight transfer system was built in to increase traction and a simple mechanical depth stop was provided on the earlier machines. Later machines, introduced mid-1963 and called 'Depthomatic' had a <b>draught</b> and position <b>control</b> system. Other modifications and options included improved gear ratios; a pick-up hitch; an increase in power through higher maximum revs and revised battery arrangement. An option on both models was the patent Allis-Chalmers PAVT rear wheels (Power Adjusted Variable Track),a system adopted by other manufacturers after patents expired. Production ended in 1968 and quite a few are still in use on farms in 2011. A few ED40s were exported to the USA. It's hard to say exactly how many {{made it to the}} US, but it seems most of them ended up in the Mid-Atlantic and South Eastern regions.|$|R
