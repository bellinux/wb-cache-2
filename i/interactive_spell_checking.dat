50|$|In general, spell {{checkers}} {{can operate}} {{one of two}} modes, the <b>interactive</b> <b>spell</b> <b>checking</b> mode or the batch spell checking. In the interactive mode, the spell checker detects and marks misspelled words with a squiggly underlining as the words are being typed. On the other hand, batch spell checking is performed on a batch-by-batch basis as the appropriate command is entered. Spell checkers, such as those used in Microsoft Word, can operate in either mode.|$|E
40|$|Collaborative content {{creation}} and annotation creates vast repositories {{of all sorts}} of media, and user-defined tags play a central role as they are a simple yet powerful tool for organizing, searching and exploring the available resources. We observe that when a user annotates a resource with a set of tags, those tags are introduced one at a time. Therefore, when the fourth tag is introduced, a knowledge represented by the previous three tags, i. e., {{the context in which the}} fourth tag is produced, is available and exploitable for generating potential correction of the current tag. This context, together with the "wisdom of the crowd" represented by the co-occurrences of tags in all the resources of the repository, can be exploited to provide <b>interactive</b> tag <b>spell</b> <b>check</b> and correction. We develop this idea in a framework, based on a weighted tag co-occurrence graph and on nodes relatedness measures defined on weighted neighborhoods. We test our proposal on a dataset coming from YouTube. The results show that our framework is effective as it outperforms two important baselines. We also show that it is efficient, thus enabling its use in modern tagging services...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} package {{is to increase the}} user friendliness of the existing batch <b>spelling</b> <b>checking</b> program, <b>SPELL.</b> This is done by first, rendering the existing system into an interactive one, and second, enhancing the system by incorporating corrective features. The resulting program, INTSPELL, not only identifies misspellings in the text, but is also capable of suggesting the the most likely corrections...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit {{the task of}} <b>spell</b> <b>checking</b> {{focusing}} on target word recovery. We propose a new approach that relies on phonetic information to improve the accuracy of clustering algorithms in identifying misspellings and generating accurate suggestions. The use of phonetic information is not new {{to the task of}} <b>spell</b> <b>checking</b> and it was used successfully in previous approaches. The combination of phonetics and cluster-based methods for <b>spell</b> <b>checking</b> was to our knowledge not yet explored and it is the new contribution of our work. We report an improvement of 8. 16 % accuracy when compared to a previously proposed <b>spell</b> <b>checking</b> approach...|$|R

40|$|Khmer is the {{official}} language of Cambodia. It is a complex language. Similar to Chinese, Japanese and Thai, Khmer words are written without spaces or other word delimiters. This is a major challenge in <b>spell</b> <b>checking</b> Khmer {{since there is no}} simple way to determine word boundaries. However, it is feasible to <b>spell</b> <b>check</b> Khmer. The process of <b>spell</b> <b>checking</b> Khmer is different from the <b>spell</b> <b>checking</b> process in other languages that have word delimiters like English. In Khmer, words are constructed from root words that are made up of consonantal clusters, which can be misspelled. In order to do the <b>spell</b> <b>checking,</b> first we need to find the approximate clusters of each input clusters. We then give the possible sequences of the consonantal clusters to a hidden Markov model. The model will give the score of every sequence of consonantal clusters. Based the possible sequences and their scores, we know the word boundaries, whether or not a word is correctly spelled and some alternative words if it is misspelled. i...|$|R
