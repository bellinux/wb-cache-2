40|$|SUMMARY: NMFS issues {{this final}} rule {{to amend the}} {{regulations}} implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP). This final rule revises the management measures for reducing the incidental mortality and serious injury to the Northern right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) in commercial fisheries to meet {{the goals of the}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The measures identified in the ALWTRP are also intended to benefit minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), which are not strategic, but are known to be taken incidentally in commercial fisheries. This final rule implements additional regulations for the fisheries currently covered by the ALWTRP (the Northeast sink gillnet, Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot, Mid-Atlantic gillnet, Southeast Atlantic gillnet, and Southeastern U.

40|$|A {{principle}} U. S. {{fisheries management}} concern is ensuring compliance with Endangered Species Act requirements to limit incidental takes of listed species to levels {{which do not}} result in potential jeopardy to existing population stocks. Part of the risk assessment process involves an analysis of historic takes (bycatch) of ESA-listed species relative to fishing effort. Sample bycatch per unit of effort (BPUE) ratios are used to gauge the take risk to ESA-listed species posed by future fishing effort. The rare-event nature of protected species takes complicates the interpretation of sample BPUE ratios. For illustration, a total of 23 leatherback turtles were incidentally taken by fishermen in the California-Oregon <b>drift</b> <b>gillnet</b> fishery from the 1990 through 2006 fishing seasons in 7733 sets of fishing effort, with from 0 to 5 leatherback takes per season over the entire period. Should one conclude the incidental take risk was significantly higher during the season with 5 leatherback turtle takes than in seasons with 0 takes? To address this and related inference problems, we specify a state space model which describes the pattern of observed takes as a Poisson process conditional {{on the level of}} fishing effort. A time-varying Poisson rate parameter, expressed as BPUE, measures the time-varying level of take risk. A Kalman filter for Poisson processes is used to estimate the intertemporal variation in take risk from California-Oregon <b>drift</b> <b>gillnet</b> fishery observer data. A key question regards attributing the observed pattern of takes to randomness which drives fluctuations in observed takes versus intertemporal variation in the level of take risk...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{requirements}} {{under the}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA),U. S. fishermen {{are required to}} take measures to reduce cetacean bycatch. However, the U. S. imports fisheries products from countries that have significant cetacean bycatch problems which fisherman are not required to mitigate. I examined case studies of the California/Oregon <b>drift</b> <b>gillnet,</b> American lobster and Atlantic cod fisheries to demonstrate the costs of U. S. cetacean bycatch reductions and their economic affect. The cost of cetacean bycatch reduction in the California/Oregon <b>drift</b> <b>gillnet</b> fishery represents 1. 9 - 4. 5 % of the fishery's total ex-vessel value. The annual cost to the lobster fishery is 0. 7 - 6. 3 % of the industry's value and 3. 3 % - 13. 3 % of the ex-vessel landings value of an Atlantic cod vessel using sink gillnets is going to cetacean bycatch mitigation. U. S. fishermen face a competitive disadvantage because they have to bear the costs for mitigating cetacean bycatch while their foreign competitors do not. The U. S. is importing products from foreign fisheries with serious bycatch problems. Foreign products are in direct competition with U. S. domestic in which U. S. fishermen have borne substantial costs to mitigate cetacean bycatch. The only way to protect marine mammals and maintain a competitive global fisheries market is to take action on an international level to reduce cetacean bycatch. To do this, influential countries like the U. S. need to support international negotiations and cooperation...|$|R
