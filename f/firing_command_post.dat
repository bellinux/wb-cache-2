50|$|The {{military}} {{battery is}} {{the location of}} two military emplacements, and includes a subterranean complex of infrastructures, {{in addition to a}} refectory, electricity room and a guardhouse, near the entranceway (the latter areas exposed). The spaces were constructed in reinforced concrete, integrating the two gun emplacements, a <b>firing</b> <b>command</b> <b>post</b> (PCT), two observation posts (PO), and six bunkers (four large and two small). Further, these spaces were linked by corridors and included lodgings, washrooms and a cistern for the garrison situated on the site.|$|E
5000|$|The two highest land {{elevations}} surveyed for Devils Battery observation posts were Flandrum Hill, Cow Bay and Caldwell Road between [...] "A-23" [...] barracks and [...] "Radio 16" [...] aircraft direction radar (Scott Drive). Each elevated {{point had}} a four-storey reinforced concrete Victoria Fortress Observation Post, with plotting rooms and telephones {{connected to the}} Halifax <b>fire</b> <b>command</b> <b>post.</b> Two other three-storey observation posts were erected, one at the new radar installation at Osborne Head, and the other above the hill behind the three turrets. Each look-out was manned with a crew of two on the top storey using a Depression position finder looking out towards the harbour for any suspicious targets.|$|R
50|$|In late 1939, at the {{beginning}} of World War II, the 8th Anti-Aircraft Battery placed some machine guns on the upper level of the tower. In August 1941 a two-storey concrete structure was placed on top of the tower to enable the tower to function as a <b>Fire</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Post,</b> in which role it remained until August 1944. On 20 April 1942 the tower received a No. 3 Mark 4 telescope and a No. 10 Director. On 1 May 1943 a Mark II Position Finder was added to the fire control equipment on the tower. Soldiers of the 3rd New Brunswick Coast Brigade manned the tower from 1941 until it ceased operations in 1944.|$|R
500|$|By the First World War, {{the guns}} {{installed}} at Hurst Castle in the 1870s were obsolete. The castle retained seventeen of them, as historian Coad states, wired up together [...] "like {{a collection of}} elderly blunderbusses", but the fort depended on its newer quick-firing weapons. During the war, Hurst's armament was controlled from Needles Battery, where a <b>Fire</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Post,</b> equipped with telegraphy, had been established. After the war, the guns {{were removed from the}} 16th-century part of the castle, which was passed into the national collection of the Ministry of Works in 1933, although some modernisation {{of the rest of the}} fortification took place in the 1930s. The [...] "low light" [...] was replaced by a new iron lighthouse in 1911.|$|R
50|$|One of Data General's {{significant}} {{customers at}} this time was the United States Forest Service, which starting in the mid-1980s used DG systems installed at all levels from headquarters in Washington, D.C. down to individual ranger stations and <b>fire</b> <b>command</b> <b>posts.</b> This required equipment of high reliability and generally rugged construction that could be deployed {{in a wide range}} of places, often to be maintained and used by people with no computer background at all. The intent was to create new kinds of functional integration in an agency that had long prized its decentralized structure. Despite some tensions, the implementation was effective and the overall effects on the agency notably positive. The introduction, implementation, and effects of the DG systems in USFS were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the RAND Corporation.|$|R
50|$|The total FRES fleet was to {{be divided}} into two main parts, the Utility Variant (FRES UV) and the Specialist Variant (FRES SV). These types were further broken down into various {{families}} of vehicles: The Utility Variant comprises protected mobility, command and control, light armoured support, repair and recovery and medical; the Specialist Variant comprises RECCE Block 1 (Scout, armoured personnel carrier, repair, recovery and Common Base Platform) and RECCE Block 2 (Joint <b>Fires</b> Direction, <b>Command</b> <b>Post</b> and Engineer Recce).|$|R
50|$|The fortifications {{were built}} from British designs adapted to New Zealand conditions. These {{installations}} typically included gun emplacements, pill boxes, <b>fire</b> <b>command</b> or observation <b>posts,</b> camouflage strategies, underground bunkers, sometimes with interconnected tunnels, containing magazines, supply and plotting rooms and protected engine rooms supplying {{power to the}} gun turrets and searchlights.|$|R
50|$|Very {{early on}} April 27 one of Beale's CAT colleagues, Allen Pope, brought a second CIA B-26 from Clark to Mapanget. Later that morning Pope flew to attack Morotai {{ahead of a}} Permesta amphibious assault while Beale flew to Ambon Island further south. Beale {{attacked}} Ambon City, the provincial capital, setting on <b>fire</b> a military <b>command</b> <b>post,</b> a fuel depot and a Royal Dutch Shell complex.|$|R
50|$|Brusilov {{decided to}} {{distribute}} his attack over {{the entirety of}} Southwest Front. He hoped to disorganise the enemy over such a large area that some point would fatally give way. He decided not to waste resources by saturation bombardment of worthless areas, but to use interdiction <b>fire</b> against <b>command</b> <b>posts,</b> road networks, and other critically important targets to degrade German command and control over the whole front. The noted German artillery commander, Georg Bruchmüller, having served opposite Brusilov's Front at this time, would learn from and adapt these tactics when planning the preparatory bombardment for Operation Michael on the Western Front in 1918. Brusilov was not even concerned with securing a great local advantage in manpower, permitting Divisions under his command {{to be transferred to}} other Fronts (so long as they attacked in support of his offensive).|$|R
40|$|Technology (FFAST) {{project is}} {{developing}} a data system to provide near-real-time forest fire information to fire management at the <b>fire</b> Incident <b>Command</b> <b>Post</b> (ICP). The completed conceptual design defined an integrated forest fire detection and mapping system that is based upon technology available in the 1990 's. System component technologies identified for an end-to-end system include airborne mounted thermal infrared (IR) linear array detectors, automatic onboard data georeferencing and signal processing, satellite communications links, and advanced data integration and display. The conceptual design detailed the preferred system configuration that warrants continued refinement and development for operational use in the 1990 's. The FFAST design will be the baseline {{for the next generation}} of forest fire detection and mapping systems after the year 2000.

5|$|The Soviets {{employed}} maskirovka (military deception) to mask defensive {{positions and}} troop dispositions and {{to conceal the}} movement of men and materiel. These included camouflaging gun emplacements, constructing dummy airfields and depots, generating false radio-traffic, and spreading rumours among the Soviet frontline troops and the civilian population in the German-held areas. Movement of forces and supplies {{to and from the}} salient took place at night only. Ammunition caches were carefully concealed to blend in with the landscape. Radio transmission was restricted and <b>fires</b> were forbidden. <b>Command</b> <b>posts</b> were hidden and motor transport in and around them forbidden.|$|R
40|$|A typical {{application}} {{field of}} Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is {{the collection of}} environmental data, which is sent to a base station. Routing protocols are needed to efficiently direct the information flows to the base station. Since sensor nodes have strict energy constraints, data gathering and communication schemes for WSNs need to be designed for an efficient utilization of the available resources. An emergency management scenario is investigated, where a sensor network is deployed as virtual lifeline for fire fighters entering a building. Besides of supporting their navigation, the virtual lifeline is also used for two further purposes. First it enables the exchange of short voice messages between <b>fire</b> fighter and <b>command</b> <b>post.</b> For this, a fast and reliable routing protocol (EMRO) has been developed based on a broadcasting scheme. Second, measuring data, like temperature and gas, in the environment and informing <b>fire</b> fighters and <b>command</b> <b>post</b> about it, is of high importance. For this purpose a network coding based data gathering algorithm has been designed. The feasibility of simultaneously using the virtual lifeline for data gathering and communication and thus the coexistence of a classical routing protocol with a network coding scheme is studied in this paper by means of simulation and real experiments. The resilience to packet loss and node failure, {{as well as the}} transmission delay are investigated by means of short voice messages for the communication part and temperature readings for data gathering...|$|R

500|$|The Japanese {{were not}} {{expected}} to make another effort until dark but at around 16:00 a Japanese patrol was discovered that had somehow managed to infiltrate the perimeter in broad daylight and penetrate to within [...] of General Chase's <b>command</b> <b>post.</b> A sniper <b>fired</b> on the <b>command</b> <b>post,</b> and <b>fire</b> was directed at the patrol. Major Julio Chiaramonte, S-2 (intelligence officer) of the task force, set out with four men to silence the sniper. As his party closed in, there were a series of explosions. Three Japanese had committed suicide with hand grenades, while another had committed seppuku with his sword. Fifteen dead officers and sergeants were counted, including Captain Baba, {{the commander of the}} Japanese battalion which made the attack the preceding night. The Japanese launched another attack on the perimeter at 17:00 but could make little progress in the face of American firepower.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 1990s, the DIVARTY {{remained}} in South Korea, conducting live <b>fire</b> and <b>command</b> <b>post</b> exercises aimed at deterring North Korean aggression, and remained ready to respond should deterrence fail. During 1990, the DIVARTY converted its three direct support cannon battalions from 3 x 6 (3 firing batteries of six howitzers each) to 3 x 8 organization, and converted a 8-8 FA from M198 towed howitzers to M109A2 self-propelled howtizers. In October 1991, the DIVARTY closed Firebase 4P3, the Army's last active firebase, {{and turned the}} DMZ mission to the Republic of Korea Army. During 1992, the DIVARTY inactivated 1-4 FA and B/6-32 FA. In 1993, the DIVARTY activated Battery A, 38th Field Artillery as a separate MLRS battery. In 1996, 8th Battalion, 8th FA reflagged to the 2nd Battalion, 17th FA. In 1997, both 1-15 FA and 2-17 FA fielded M109A6 Paladin howitzers. During 1997, the DIVARTY fielded Improved Position Determining System MLRS launchers in C/6-37 FA, and assisted the ROK Army with fielding its initial MLRS battalion, bringing the capability to deliver ATACMS Block 1A missiles.|$|R

40|$|There {{are usually}} some places within a forest {{that do not}} have {{adequate}} communication coverage due to line-of-sight or other reasons. These areas are generally known by the foresters and radio technicians and allowances are made for that when working or traveling in those areas. However, when wildfire or other emergencies occur, communications are vital because wildfires can require hundreds of firefighters and cover thousands of acres. During these emergency operations, the existing communications are not adequate and complete radio systems are moved into the area for the conduct of <b>fire</b> communications. Incident <b>command</b> <b>posts</b> (ICPs) and <b>fire</b> camps are set up in remote locations and there is constant need for communications in the fire area and to agency headquarters and dispatch offices.

5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of Operation Barbarossa, Boldin was the deputy of Gen. Dmitry Pavlov, commander of the Western Military District. Both men saw clear indications of the impending attack, but their warnings to the High Command were ignored. Late on June 22, Pavlov ordered Boldin by phone to mount a counter-attack against German forces advancing on Grodno. Boldin flew in a light aircraft under heavy <b>fire</b> to the <b>command</b> <b>post</b> of 10th Army near Bialystok. In the prevailing chaos {{it was impossible to}} carry out any effective attack, and by June 27 the 3rd, 4th and 10th Armies were all encircled west of Minsk. Boldin, {{at the head of a}} small group, spent the next 45 days fighting for survival behind enemy lines. Finally, on August 10, leading a total of 1,650 officers and men, his group broke through to Soviet lines near Smolensk.
