40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the stability of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of lipid membranes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liquid-ordered phase (<b>lo</b> phase) against a detergent, Triton X- 100. We found that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of high concentrations of Triton X- 100, the structure of GUVs and LUVs of dipalmitoyl-PC (DPPC) /cholesterol (chol) and sphingomyelin (SM) /chol membranes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lo</b> phase was stable and no leakage of fluorescent probes from the vesicles occurred. We also found that ether-linked dihexadecylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) membranes containing more than 20 mol% cholesterol were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lo</b> phase, and that DHPC/chol-GUV and DHPC/chol-LUV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lo</b> phase were stable and no leakage of internal contents occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of Triton X- 100. In contrast, octylglucoside solution could easily break these GUVs and LUVs of <b>the</b> <b>lo</b> phase membranes and induced internal contents leakage. These data indicate that GUVs and LUVs of <b>the</b> <b>lo</b> phase membranes are very valuable for practical use...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 2 D-ELDOR {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} employed {{to study the}} dynamic structure of <b>the</b> liquid-ordered (<b>Lo)</b> phase versus that of the liquid-crystalline (Lc) phase in multibilayer phospholipid vesicles without (Lc) and with (Lo) cholesterol, using end-chain and headgroup labels and spin-labeled cholestane. <b>The</b> spectra are <b>in</b> most cases found to be dramatically different for these two phases. Thus, visual inspection of the 2 D-ELDOR spectra provides a convenient way to distinguish <b>the</b> two phases <b>in</b> membranes. Detailed analysis shows these observations are due to increased ordering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lo</b> phase and modified reorientation rates. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lo</b> phase, acyl chains undergo a faster rotational diffusion and higher ordering than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lc phase, whereas spin-labeled cholestane exhibits slower rotational diffusion and higher ordering. On the other hand, <b>the</b> choline headgroup <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lo</b> phase exhibits faster motion and reduced but realigned ordering versus the Lc phase. The microscopic translational diffusion rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lo</b> phase are significantly reduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of cholesterol. These results are compared with previous studies, and a consistent model is provided for interpreting them <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dynamic structure of <b>the</b> <b>Lo</b> and Lc phases...|$|R

40|$|A new {{membrane}} probe, {{based on}} the perylene imide chromophore, with excellent photophysical properties (high absorption coefficient, quantum yield (QY) ≈ 1, high photostability) and excited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visible domain is proposed {{for the study of}} membrane rafts. Visualization of separation between <b>the</b> liquid-ordered (<b>Lo)</b> and <b>the</b> liquid-disordered (Ld) phases can be achieved in artificial membranes by fluorescence lifetime imaging due to the different decay times of <b>the</b> membrane probe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two phases. Rafts on micrometer-scale in cell membranes due to cellular activation can also be observed by this method. The decay time of <b>the</b> dye <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lo</b> phase is higher than in organic solvents where its QY is 1. This allows proposing a (possible general) mechanism for the decay time increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lo</b> phase, {{based on the}} local field effects of the surrounding molecules. For other fluorophores with QY < 1, the suggested mechanism could also contribute, in addition to effects reducing the nonradiative decay pathways, to an increase of the fluorescence decay time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lo</b> phase. ...|$|R
