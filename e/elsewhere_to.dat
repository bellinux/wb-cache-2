5|$|According to a World Bank report, the key {{to success}} of private sector {{participation}} in the Colombian water sector has been the development of homegrown solutions, and, at times, skillfully adapting models used <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> the particular circumstances and culture of Colombia.|$|E
5|$|In 1854 William Gibbs {{commissioned}} John Gregory Crace, {{an architect}} {{he was already}} using <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>to</b> redesign and decorate the principal rooms at Tyntesfield.

5|$|It {{lost its}} {{position}} when {{the roads were}} improved, making it practical for factors from Liverpool and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> travel into Wales and purchase cloth directly from the makers, and became irrelevant when the Industrial Revolution made trade guilds obsolete. Today it survives as a charity that runs almshouses in Shrewsbury.|$|E
5000|$|Southern Mansi was {{recorded}} from area {{isolated from the}} other Mansi varieties. Around 1900 a couple hundred speakers existed; in the 1960s it was spoken only by a few elderly speakers, and it has since then gone extinct. It had strong Tatar influence and displayed several archaisms such as vowel harmony, retention of [...] (elsewhere merged with [...] ), [...] (<b>elsewhere</b> deaffricated <b>to</b> [...] ), [...] (<b>elsewhere</b> fronted <b>to</b> [...] or diphthongized) and [...] (<b>elsewhere</b> raised <b>to</b> [...] ).|$|R

5|$|Later, a {{new wave}} of architects, who would master the Baroque sentiments, aware of Rococo {{interior}} styles beginning <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> gain an ascendancy over Baroque, would go on to develop the flamboyance, freedom, and movement that are synonymous with the term Sicilian Baroque today.|$|E
5|$|The 22nd Jagannatha Ratha-yatra Krishna Festival {{took place}} in Glastonbury on Sunday 4 October 2015. Devotees of the Krishna Consciousness {{movement}} travelled to the town from London, Bath, Bristol and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> join with locals in a procession and Kirtan.|$|E
5|$|As farmers {{worldwide}} {{respond to}} higher crop prices {{in order to}} maintain the global food supply-and-demand balance, pristine lands are cleared to replace the food crops that were diverted <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> biofuels' production. Because natural lands, such as rainforests and grasslands, store carbon in their soil and biomass as plants grow each year, clearance of wilderness for new farms translates to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Due to this change in the carbon stock of the soil and the biomass, indirect land use change has consequences in the GHG balance of a biofuel.|$|E

5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Originally the {{operation}} was due to begin on January 1, but poor ice conditions on the Neva caused the offensive to be delayed until January 10–12. A number of measures were taken to prevent the details of {{the operation}} being revealed to the Germans. Only a limited number of senior officers were involved in the planning, all redeployments took place in bad weather or at night and simulated attack preparations were made <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> confuse the German side.|$|E
5|$|The Ahnenerbe (Ancestral Heritage Organization) {{was founded}} in 1935 by Himmler, and {{became part of the}} SS in 1939. It was an {{umbrella}} agency for more than fifty organizations tasked with studying the German racial identity and ancient Germanic traditions and language. The agency sponsored archaeological expeditions in Germany, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Tibet, and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> search for evidence of Aryan roots, influence, and superiority. Further planned expeditions were postponed indefinitely {{at the start of the}} war.|$|E
50|$|According to MGM records, {{the film}} earned $1,645,000 in North America and $2,450,000 <b>elsewhere,</b> leading <b>to</b> {{a loss of}} $272,000.|$|R

5|$|The Sinhalese {{alphabet}} (Sinhalese: සිංහල අක්ෂර මාලාව) (Siṁhala Akṣara Mālāva) is an alphabet {{used by the}} Sinhalese {{people in}} Sri Lanka and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> write the Sinhalese language and also the liturgical languages Pali and Sanskrit. The Sinhalese alphabet, {{which is one of}} the Brahmic scripts, a descendant of the ancient Indian Brahmi script closely related to the South Indian Grantha script and Kadamba alphabet.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{proportion}} of elderly {{persons in the}} district {{may be attributed to}} the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building boom of the 1960s: the children of these residents moved <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling. The skewed malefemale ratio is probably an artifact of the differential between male and female lifespans in Lithuania (male average lifespan in Lithuania was 66 years in 2004, as against 78 for females), according to the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|The line Ashes, Ashes {{in colonial}} {{versions}} of the rhyme is claimed to refer variously to cremation of the bodies, the burning of victims' houses, or blackening of their skin, and the theory has been adapted {{to be applied to}} other {{versions of the}} rhyme. In its various forms, the interpretation has entered into popular culture and has been used <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> make oblique reference to the plague.|$|E

5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One {{was a failure}} to recognize after {{the first wave of}} attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Holocaust during World War II, German Nazis used gas vans at Chelmno {{extermination}} camp and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several death camps such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in action T4, the euthanasia programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and disabled people before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by IG Farben in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers {{of people in the}} gas vans and the special gas chambers used in the death camps such as Treblinka. Exhaust fumes from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.|$|E
5|$|Invasive plants include {{fountain}} grass, tamarisk, Malta starthistle, {{and many}} others, but {{by far the}} most severe threat to the native ecosystem is buffelgrass. This drought-tolerant plant, native to parts of Africa and Asia, was imported to the United States in the 1930s and planted near Tucson and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> create cattle forage and to control erosion. First detected in the park in 1989, it has dispersed widely in both districts. Competing with other plants for sustenance, buffelgrass fills the empty spaces normally found between native desert plants and creates a significant fire hazard. The noxious weed, considered impossible to completely eliminate, is managed in some areas of the park and in Tucson residential zones by hand-pulling and, during periods of wet weather, application of glyphosate-based herbicides.|$|E

5|$|Major General Ariel Sharon's 143rd Armored Division {{was given}} the {{critical}} tasks of opening the corridors and laying the bridges. His division included Tuvia Raviv's 600th Armored Brigade, Colonel Amnon Reshef's 14th Armored Brigade, and the 'Haim' Brigade commanded by Colonel Haim Erez. Major General Abraham Adan's 162nd Armored Division was tasked with crossing the canal and achieving an encirclement with its 300 tanks. The division included Colonel Natke Nir's 217th Armored Brigade, Colonel Gabi Amir's 460th Armored Brigade and Aryeh Keren's 500th Armored Brigade. A paratrooper brigade would be transferred to Adan's division {{during the course of}} the battle. Kalman Magen's 252nd Armored Division would initially launch diversionary attacks <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> draw attention from Sharon's operations at Deversoir. Thereafter the division would hold and secure the corridor and bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{vegetables}} {{were collected}} from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic crops from <b>elsewhere</b> <b>to</b> add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown {{all over the world}} as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food, to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned, harvesting the crop is followed by grading, storing, processing, and marketing.|$|E
5|$|Al-Ma'mun {{had made}} no {{official}} provisions for his succession. His son, al-Abbas, was old enough and had acquired experience in the border wars with the Byzantines, but had not been named heir. According to the account in al-Tabari, on his deathbed, al-Ma'mun dictated a letter nominating his brother, rather than al-Abbas, as his successor, and Abu Ishaq was acclaimed as Caliph on 9 August, {{with the name of}} al-Mu'tasim. It is impossible to know whether this reflects actual events, or whether the letter was an invention and Abu Ishaq merely took advantage of his proximity to his dying brother, and al-Abbas's absence <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>to</b> propel himself to the throne. As Abu Ishaq was the forefather of all subsequent Abbasid caliphs, historians had little desire to question the legitimacy of his accession, {{but it is clear that}} his position was far from secure: a large part of the army favoured al-Abbas, and a delegation of soldiers even went to him and tried to proclaim him as the new Caliph. Only when al-Abbas himself refused, whether out of weakness or out of a desire to avoid a civil war, and himself took the oath of allegiance to his uncle, did the soldiers acquiesce to al-Mu'tasim's succession. The precariousness of his position is further evidenced by the fact that al-Mu'tasim immediately called off the expedition, abandoned the Tyana project and returned with his army to Baghdad, which he reached on 20 September.|$|E
