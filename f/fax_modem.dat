25|$|In 1991, Rockwell {{introduced}} a low-cost chipset supporting the new 14,400bit/s V.32bis standard, along with similar V.32 and V.22bis (2400bit/s) versions, {{all of which}} supported MNP, V.42bis and, optionally, 9600bit/s V.29 <b>fax</b> <b>modem</b> capabilities. Their system was introduced commercially in the SupraFAXModem 14400, which {{went on to become}} a runaway bestseller. Soon there were literally hundreds of similar models on the market, and Rockwell's competitors also rushed in with similar chipsets of their own.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} WinFax PRO 4.0 in March 1994 brought {{together}} {{a number of}} key features and technologies. It introduced an improved OCR engine, introduced improvements aimed specifically at mobile fax users, better on-screen fax viewing capabilities and a focus on consistency and usability of the interface. It also included {{for the first time the}} ability to integrate directly with popular new email products such as [...] and Microsoft Mail. It was preceded by a Workgroup version of the same product, which allowed a number of users to share a single <b>fax</b> <b>modem</b> on a networked system. The stand-alone version of the product was also later bundled with a grayscale scanner, and sold as WinFax Scanner.|$|E
2500|$|An {{animated}} {{version of}} Scully, which featured the voice acting of Anderson, would appear on season 8 of The Simpsons, in the episode [...] "The Springfield Files", {{as well as}} Canadian animated series Eek! The Cat, on the episode [...] "Eek Space 9". The animated television series ReBoot featured characters <b>Fax</b> <b>Modem</b> and Data Nully, obvious spoofs of Mulder and Scully, in the episode [...] "Trust No One". Anderson provided her voice work for the episode, but co-star Duchovny declined.|$|E
50|$|Medical systems {{continue}} to use this technology into the 21st century, but many home and business users dropped the use of <b>fax</b> <b>modems</b> in favor of high speed internet.|$|R
5000|$|Windows Fax and Scan Allows {{computers}} with <b>fax</b> <b>modems</b> to {{send and receive}} fax documents, as well as scan documents. It is not available in the Home versions of Windows Vista, but {{is available in the}} Business, Enterprise and Ultimate editions.|$|R
50|$|As {{shown in}} the diagram below, a T.38 gateway is {{composed}} of two primary elements: the <b>fax</b> <b>modems</b> and the T.38 subsystem. The <b>fax</b> <b>modems</b> modulate and demodulate the PCM samples of the analog data, turning the sampled-data representation of the fax terminal’s analog signal to its binary translation, and vice versa. The PSTN network samples the analog signal of a voice or modem signal (it doesn’t know the difference) 8,000 times per second (SPS), and encodes them as 8-bit data bytes. This means 8000 samples-per-second times 8-bits per sample, or 64,000 bits per second (bit/s) to represent the modem (or voice) data in one direction. For both directions the modem transaction consumes 128,000 bits of network bandwidth.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fax</b> <b>modem</b> {{chips and}} data modem chips - Conexant's <b>fax</b> <b>modem</b> chips with VoIP support add <b>fax</b> <b>modem</b> {{functionality}} to multi-function printers. The low-power chips support v.34 packet connectivity over enterprise networks, per the ITU-T G.1050 Network model for evaluating multimedia transmission performance over Internet Protocol. [...] Data modem chips are deployed {{in point of}} sale terminals.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>fax</b> <b>modem</b> {{enables a}} {{computer}} to transmit and receive documents as faxes on a telephone line. A <b>fax</b> <b>modem</b> is like a data modem but is designed to transmit and receive documents to and from a fax machine or another <b>fax</b> <b>modem.</b> Some, but not all, fax modems do double duty as data modems. As with other modems, fax modems can be internal or external. Internal fax modems are often called fax boards.|$|E

5000|$|WinFax PRO 3.0 was {{launched}} in November 1993 for Windows 3.x machines. This {{was followed by a}} version for Macintosh systems. This version of this product saw long life as a [...] "non-PRO" [...] version that was bundled with various <b>fax</b> <b>modems</b> by the end of its product cycle.|$|R
50|$|Delrina was a Canadian {{software}} company, {{which was}} founded in 1988 and was subsequently acquired by the American software firm Symantec in 1995. The company sold electronic form products, including PerForm and FormFlow, but was best known for its WinFax software package, which enabled computers equipped with <b>fax</b> <b>modems</b> to transmit copies of documents to standalone fax machines or other similarly equipped computers.|$|R
50|$|InfoImaging {{claimed a}} {{capacity}} of 40kB per sheet of paper using its image encoding of files, extended to 110kB (between two <b>fax</b> <b>modems)</b> in the 2.0 version. InfoWorld's reviewer found that the 1.0 version could compress both a 90kB Word document and a 302kB image file to less than 40kB, so the files could each be faxed as a single page.|$|R

25|$|Digital {{data can}} be encoded and {{transmitted}} via FM by shifting the carrier's frequency among a predefined set of frequencies representing digits - for example one frequency can represent a binary 1 and a second can represent binary 0. This modulation technique is known as frequency-shift keying (FSK). FSK is widely used in <b>modems</b> and <b>fax</b> <b>modems,</b> and {{can also be used}} to send Morse code. Radioteletype also uses FSK.|$|R

50|$|A typical (Group III) fax {{transmission}} {{requires a}} two-way conversation between two modems (that is, each participant must both transmit and receive). Each modem {{may be part}} of a “fax machine” incorporating an image scanner and a printer. A demodulator can only be used to observe a conversation between two <b>fax</b> <b>modems,</b> usually to record the image transmitted. It cannot be used to receive a fax transmission in the usual sense, because a sending modem cannot transmit an image without first negotiating a connection with a receiving modem.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{with the}} {{integration}} of faxing devices into computers via <b>Fax</b> <b>modems</b> the automated answering of voice calls by a computer went live via specific software, like e.g. TalkWorks. These systems allowed for quite elaborate voice box systems, navigated via dual-tone multi-frequency signaling, allowing a computer on a (single) telephony line {{to sound like a}} professional telephony system with hierarchical fax and message boxes with an automatic call distributor, where a caller might deposit his messages, leave his faxes behind, might listen to specific messages, or start a fax-back service.|$|R
5000|$|Global Village was {{a leading}} {{manufacturer}} [...] of easy-to-use <b>fax</b> <b>modems</b> and other telecommunications products for the Apple Macintosh platform. It {{was one of the}} few manufacturers to support the Mac's RS422 serial ports without requiring an adaptor. Major product lines included the TelePort series of high speed desktop dialup modems, the PowerPort series of internal PowerBook modems as well as a series of modems that connected to the Mac's ADB port. Many of its products were bundled with the Macintosh Performa series of computers and it was the manufacturer for the internal modem in the PowerBook 500 series.|$|R
50|$|Canada and the United States have {{experienced}} {{rapid growth in}} the number of area codes, particularly between 1990 and 2005. There are two main reasons for this. First, there is the increasing demand for telephone services (particularly resulting from widescale adoption of <b>fax,</b> <b>modem,</b> and mobile phone communications).|$|E
50|$|DID {{service is}} also used by fax servers. A {{telephone}} line is terminated at a telephone interface (<b>fax</b> <b>modem)</b> of a computer that runs fax server software. A set of digits of the assigned phone numbers are used to identify {{the recipient of the}} fax. This allows many recipients to have an individual fax number, even though there is only one fax machine available.|$|E
50|$|With Windows Fax and Scan {{users with}} {{computers}} that have fax modems can {{send and receive}} faxes, and fax scanned documents. Without a <b>fax</b> <b>modem,</b> users can email scanned documents and forward faxes as email attachments from their computer. WFS supports one-click scanning of documents from locally connected scanners, network-connected scanners and multifunction devices. Even though this {{can be used for}} most types of documents, WFS is optimized for scanning, viewing and storing text documents.|$|E
50|$|A {{telephony}} {{system based}} on host media processing (HMP) is one that uses a general-purpose computer to process a telephony call’s media stream rather than using digital signal processors (DSPs) to perform the task. When telephony call streams started to be digitized for time-division-multiplexed (TDM) transport, processing of the media stream, to enhance it in some way, became common. For example, digital echo cancellers were added to long-haul circuits, and transport channels were shaped to improve modem performance. Then, in the mid-‘80s, computer-based systems that implemented messaging, for example, used DSPs to compress the audio for storage, and fax servers used DSPs to implement <b>fax</b> <b>modems.</b>|$|R
50|$|On June 2, 2009, the PSC again {{postponed}} permissive dialing {{of the new}} 364 area code, to January 1, 2012. Mandatory {{dialing to}} 364 was still left undetermined. The split was suspended indefinitely on August 13, 2010 with no permissive dialing date. In December 2010, relief was suspended completely and {{was believed to be}} dead. These subsequent delays of the implementation of the 270 / 364 area code split were due to further use of number conservation measures, including mandatory and expanded number pooling, as well as a weakened economy and a reduced usage of telephone numbers dedicated for use by computer and <b>fax</b> <b>modems.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{canonical}} {{format is}} used by the Telephony API (TAPI), a Windows programming interface for dial-up <b>fax,</b> <b>modem,</b> and telephone equipment. Depending on the user's current location, the Windows' Dial-Up Networking (DUN) component applies a set of dialing rules to transform the canonical phone number into a locally dialable calling sequence for the modem device. The dialing rules may include variable-length dialing for area code, trunk access and international access prefixes, central office/service access numbers, and calling cards tone numbers.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, Everex shipped {{its first}} hard drive, tape backup and {{graphics}} product. Seven years later, with an ever expanding product line, annual revenues totaled over $436 million and the workforce topped 2,200 employees. In 1985, Everex began shipping personal computers under private labels {{such as the}} popular IBM-AT compatible System 1800. Three years later the STEP computer line launched, introducing cutting edge 286 and 386-based computing to a mass audience. In addition to computer systems, high-performance file servers and a UNIX-based operating system (ESIX), the company produced tape drives, graphics boards, data and <b>fax</b> <b>modems,</b> memory enhancement products, network boards, desktop publishing products, disk drive and tape driver controllers and monitors.|$|R
50|$|Fax Over IP (FoIP) can {{transmit}} and receive pre-digitized documents at near realtime speeds using ITU-T recommendation T.38 to send digitised images over an IP network using JPEG compression. T.38 {{is designed to}} work with VoIP services and often supported by analog telephone adapters used by legacy fax machines that need to connect through a VoIP service. Scanned documents are limited {{to the amount of}} time the user takes to load the document in a scanner and for the device to process a digital file. The resolution can vary from as little as 150 DPI to 9600 DPI or more. This type of faxing is not related to the e-mail to fax service that still uses <b>fax</b> <b>modems</b> at least one way.|$|R
50|$|Error {{correction}} mode (ECM) is {{an optional}} transmission mode built into Class 1/2/2.0 fax machines or <b>fax</b> <b>modems.</b> ECM automatically detects and corrects {{errors in the}} fax transmission process that are sometimes caused by telephone line noise. The page data is divided into {{what is known as}} Octets (small blocks of data). Once the receiver has received all the Octets it examines them (using check-sums) and then advises the transmitting fax of any Octets that are in error. The transmitter then need only resend the blocks in error rather than the whole page. This generally means an ECM coded fax {{will be more likely to}} succeed on a noisy line. ECM is the norm rather than the exception. Some fax machines have the capability to enable or disable this function.|$|R
