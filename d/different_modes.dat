5|$|It {{is usually}} {{possible}} for a mechanical part to vibrate {{in a number of}} <b>different</b> <b>modes,</b> however the design will be based on a particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode. As well as the straightforward longitudinal mode some others which are used include flexural mode, torsional mode, radial mode and drumhead mode.|$|E
5|$|The data pins in the {{standard}} plugs are actually recessed in the plug compared to the outside power pins. This permits the power pins to connect first, preventing data errors by allowing the device to power up first and then establish the data connection.

5|$|The {{modality}} of {{an action}} refers to <b>different</b> <b>modes</b> in which one can participate in an action, for example: being the one who carries out the act itself; being one who instigates another to perform the act; or being one who gives permission, approval or endorsement of an act.|$|E

The service was terminated in June 2012, however the PlayStation 3 HD version features the online mode. Multiplayer features three <b>different</b> <b>modes</b> of play available on all of the maps and has a selection of the weapons from the single-player game. As well as the multiplayer mode, it has many other differences compared to its predecessors such as higher quality graphics, larger worlds, and drivable vehicles. The voice cast from the previous game return as their respective characters, and new actors were hired to voice the new characters.|$|E
5|$|Transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area is {{reliant on}} a complex {{multimodal}} infrastructure consisting of roads, bridges, highways, rail, tunnels, airports, and bike and pedestrian paths. The development, maintenance, {{and operation of}} these <b>different</b> <b>modes</b> of transportation are overseen by various agencies, including the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. These and other organizations collectively manage several interstate highways and state routes, two subway networks, two commuter rail agencies, eight trans-bay bridges, transbay ferry service, local bus service, three international airports (San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland), and an extensive network of roads, tunnels, and paths such as the San Francisco Bay Trail.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} two dozen public transit {{agencies}} in the Bay Area with overlapping service areas that utilize <b>different</b> <b>modes,</b> with designated connection points between the various operators. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), a heavy rail/metro system, operates in four counties and connects San Francisco and Oakland via an underwater tube. Other commuter rail systems link San Francisco with the Peninsula and San Jose (Caltrain), San Jose with the Tri-Valley Area and San Joaquin county (ACE), and Sonoma with Marin county (SMART). In addition, Amtrak provides frequent commuter service between and San Jose and the East Bay with Sacramento, and long distance service {{to other parts of}} the United States. Muni Metro operates a hybrid streetcar/subway system within the city of San Francisco, and VTA operates a light rail system in Santa Clara county. These rail systems are supplemented by numerous bus agencies and transbay ferries such as Golden Gate Ferry and the San Francisco Bay Water Transit Authority. Most of these agencies accept the Clipper Card, a reloadable contactless smart card, as a universal electronic payment system.|$|E

25|$|Most {{processors}} have {{at least}} two <b>different</b> <b>modes.</b> The x86-processors have four <b>different</b> <b>modes</b> divided into four different rings.

Ring 1 and Ring 2 are rarely used, but could be configured with different levels of access.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{transition}} from steady, spatially uniform-flow to nonuniform and time-dependent gas axial velocity profiles in an axial flow compression system. Local bifurcation analysis of the uniform-flow solution reveals a series of bifurcations to traveling waves of <b>different</b> <b>mode</b> number {{as a function of}} throttle opening. The number of bifurcating modes is found to depend on the gas viscosity parameter, an effect introduced in this work. Using the local approximations of the bifurcating solutions as starting points of our numerical analysis, we uncover a complicated scenario of secondary bifurcations ultimately resulting in parameter ranges where locally asymptotically stable stalled-flow solutions of <b>different</b> <b>mode</b> number coexist...|$|R
