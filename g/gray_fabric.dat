The formal uniform for Starfleet officers {{on the ground is}} shown to be a mid-gray in color and a similar style to the red uniforms worn by the Academy cadets in the first film. A more informal uniform jumpsuit is worn at various points by several characters (including Kirk and Scotty). These jumpsuits have high collars and are made of a dark <b>gray</b> <b>fabric,</b> with triangles of transparent plastic at the collarbones which show the color of the officer's regular uniform shirt beneath.

50|$|The Malwa {{culture is}} {{characterized}} by a distinctive pottery known as the Malwa ware. It is a black-painted-red pottery which is made of fine orange buff paste and is wheel thrown. It usually has a thick slip that is orange red in color and the designs are painted in purplish to brown-black pigment. The design elements are of great variety. Besides simple linear patterns, there also occur elaborate designs employing geometrical patterns painted into panels or registers. These include either hatched or solid triangles or diamonds in rows, concentric circles, and loops. In addition to the geometric patterns, there are some interesting animal motifs such as deer. The painted ornamentation is usually confined to the upper half of the vessels. The commonest shape in this ware is the typical Indian lota or a small water vessel with a globular body and high neck, sometimes with an outcurve rim. Jars with a flaring mouth and a variety of bowls and dishes are also common. While many of the characteristic shapes of the Malwa ware are present at Inamgaon, the drinking goblet or the chalice is conspicuously absent. A new shape is a vessel with a tubular spout which might be the result of contact with the Neolithic farmers from the south who used such spouted vessels. The Malwa ware is associated with coarse red and <b>gray</b> <b>fabrics</b> and a small amount of black burnished pottery.|$|R

5000|$|The Ayla-Axum amphorae are narrow conical amphoras {{that were}} {{named after the}} widest range of finds in the Red Sea. Subsequent {{findings}} since the mid- 1990s indicate, however, that the amphoras originate in Byzantine, or even early Islamic, Aqaba. Hence, the preferred nomenclature is now [...] "Aqaba Amphora." [...] The Ayla-Axum/Aqaba amphora type has parallels from at least three terrestrial sites in Eritrea and Ethiopia: Aksum, where amphora sherds with <b>gray</b> <b>fabric</b> were found by the Deutsche Aksum Expedition (Zahn 1913: 208); Matara dating to the 4th through 7th centuries (Anfray 1990: 118); and Adulis (Paribeni 1907: 551) examples of which are {{on display in the}} National Museum in Asmara. Other examples have been found at Berenike in Egypt, where the amphoras date firmly to an early 5th century context in what may be the best stratified examples (Hayes 1996: 159-61); from Aqaba in Jordan where many examples have been found, including their kilns; on The Shipwreck at Black Assarca Island, Eritrea (Pedersen 2008; Pedersen 2000); and in the Mediterranean such as on the late 6th-century shipwreck at Iskandil Burnu, Turkey, as well as in Spain and Carthage in strata datable from the mid-fourth to the sixth centuries (Keay 1986: 356, 358, 471).

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to impart flame-retarding {{properties}} to the cotton fabric, post-grafting phosphorylation reactions on grafted cotton fabric were carried out. Photochemical graft copolymerisation of 4 -vinyl pyridine (4 -VP) onto cotton fabric using benzophenone as photosensitiser was carried out. Maximum percentage of grafting Pg, (18. 50 %) was obtained under optimum conditions; irradiation time 75 min, 0. 5 ml of benzophenone, [4 -VP]= 748. 71 x 10 - 2 mole/l and 5 ml {{of water in the}} reaction mixture. Aliphatic alcohols of varying chain length decreased percentage of grafting. The pendant pyridine rings of the 4 -VP grafted cotton fabric were converted to pyridinium chloride followed by the reaction with acrylamide to give 2 -amido-ethylpyridiniumchloride. This was subjected to phosphorylation reaction with PCl 3 /petroleum ether. The phosphorylated grafted cotton fabric burns only in the presence of flame with very slow propagation of the flame (only 3. 8 cm 2) was found to burn of the total area of 147 cm 2 with 0. 12 g of the ash content.

40|$|Conventionally, {{cotton fabric}} is {{subjected}} {{to a series of}} separate pretreatment processes such as desizing, scouring, and bleaching to remove natural and added impurities for satisfactory dyeing and finishing. When the sole purpose is to improve the dye uptake, cotton fabric {{is subjected to}} yet another separate process called causticization, a treatment of cotton fabric at reduced concentration of caustic soda (110 - 150 g/L) compared to mercerization. All these processes i. e. desizing, scouring, and bleaching are lengthy and require large amount of water, energy, chemicals, and time which lead to increase in cost and productivity loss. In this paper, a combined desizing, scouring, bleaching and causticization process with shorter processing time is reported. Single factor randomized experimental design was used for process optimization. Based on experiments, the optimum recipe consisted of padding the <b>gray</b> cotton <b>fabric</b> using a twodip, two-nip technique in a bath containing NaOH 140 g/L; Sodium Per Borate (SPB) 40 - 45 g/L; wetting agent 1 g/L, batching for 30 min at room temperature and washing the treated fabric with 1 g/L emulsifier twice for 15 minutes each at boil with 3 % owf SPB added during the second wash, rinsed with hot and cold water and air dried. The results showed excellent wettability, good degree of whiteness, minimum loss of tensile strength and higher dye uptake compared to uncausticized commercially bleached cotton fabric...|$|R

40|$|Human {{resource}} management {{is one of}} the factors that determine {{the success or failure of}} the company. In order to determine the role and contribution of human resources in achieving success, of course necessary performance measurement. Employee performance is influenced by several factors, including the culture of work, work discipline and occupational health and safety (K 3). Including employee performance degradation caused by the work culture that has not been fully implemented, the lack of discipline of employees and service to lack of K 3. PT Apac Inti Corpora is a company engaged in the field of textile products such as yarn, <b>gray</b> <b>fabric</b> and denim fabric. This research aims to know and explain the influence of positive work culture, discipline of work and employee performance against K 3 remains part of the production unit spinning 2 PT Apac Inti Corpora. This research is explanatory research type approach uses against 79 respondents with Incidental technique. Data collection techniques in the research using interview techniques, questionnaire and the study of librarianship. The data obtained were analyzed quantitatively using a cross-tabular analysis tools, test validity, reliability test, a simple linear regression, multiple linear regression and hypothesis testing by t-test and F-test as well as using the help application programs SPSS 20. 0 for Windows. Results of the statistical analysis shows the work culture, work discipline and K 3 has a positive influence on performance of employees. Seen from the calculation of the coefficients of the regression test, where the influential work of cultural 0, 098, discipline working effect of 0. 125, K 3 and influential of 0, 496. From these results it is known that the greatest influence affecting performance variable (Y) is K 3 variables (X 3). Advice that can be given in this research to enhance implementation of the cultural work by conducting briefings on a regular basis so that culture can be lived and practiced. Companies need to improve discipline by giving sanction expressly and reprimand for employees, whereas for the implementation of K 3 enterprises need to increase socialization and simulation of safety. As well as the need for continued research by companies or parties outside the company about other free variables that can provide an additional contribution to improving the performance of employees...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this design {{was to create a}} garment that is {{beautiful}} but also practical. The look is inspired by grunge but also by romanticism and the occult. I wanted to portray a completely simplistic garment {{in a way that makes}} it seem so much more profound and adaptable to any style the wearer chooses to portray. Process: I found my initial inspiration by looking at Dark Beauty magazine, a gothic fashion magazine. From there, I searched on various online databases and put inspirational images into a design Pinterest board. The images combined to create a tribal but celestial mood, with an otherworldly etherealness. After I had the mood concrete, I began looking to my favorite clothing websites like Dolls Kill and Nasty Gal to decide what kind of garment I might want to construct. These websites have out of the norm looks and an overall grunge, alternative feel, while still accommodating to many style tribes. All of this considered, I decided to create a romper with a tied back and small ruffle details on the shoulders and bottom hem. Techniques: To make this design a reality, I used flat patterning and draping to create a pattern. From the pattern, I made a sample, which I then fitted to my model. Once the fit was perfected, I created the final garment which you see today. Contribution to fashion or innovation used: My contribution to fashion is the creation of a piece of clothing that can seamlessly adapt to many different style tribes. Materials: Lightweight <b>gray</b> cotton <b>fabric,</b> all-purpose thread, invisible zipper. This is one in a line of three garments; the entire line can be seen at the Apparel, Textiles, and Merchandising spring fashion show, May 30, at 3 : 00 p. m. and 7 : 00 p. m. in Milo Smith Theater in McConnell Hall...|$|R

The British GL was offered with either the tricot or textile upholstery based on the exterior paint color chosen. Velour upholstery was offered instead of tweed on the Australian GX. The European and Australian versions were also available as a limited, premium editions, called GX Gala in Europe, and GX Heritage in Australia offering gray leather on the Euro-spec sedans and extended roof wagons, and only on the sedan for the Australian-spec Liberty Heritage. The European DL, which was {{very similar to the}} Japanese-spec Ei model, was very basic; items that weren't offered were a tachometer, power windows and central locking, a radio, individual 60:40 rear folding seatbacks on the sedan, and AWD was not available on the DL. The Euro-spec DL also didn't have plastic wheel covers, and instead was identical to the Japanese-spec Ei, with silver painted steel wheels and a silver plastic lug nut cover. The European DL also didn't have paint on the front or rear bumper covers, and remained in their natural state of black plastic.|$|R
5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of <b>gray</b> or brown <b>fabric,</b> with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|R
