5|$|Some of the Rangers and Scouts went on bond drive tours {{around the}} United States and {{also met with}} President <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt.

Today the park features a variety of campsites, cabins, hiking and recreational activities.|$|E
5|$|The port's modern name did {{not come}} into {{widespread}} use until 1925; the current port was constructed in 1932 under the governorship of <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt during the Great Depression.

Today the grain elevator is the largest in the United States east of the Mississippi River; the port has the tallest harbor crane in the state of New York.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{reportedly}} {{killed three}} {{people on the}} island. An unidentified schooner capsized off Port Antonio with all hands lost, in spite of efforts to rescue the imperiled crew.

5|$|Unlike {{the other}} Iowa-class battleships, New Jersey was named by President <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt to repay a {{political}} debt, to then-New Jersey Governor Charles Edison.

5|$|After {{signing the}} Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942 on 26 May Molotov left for Washington, D.C., United States. Molotov met with <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and {{ratified}} a Lend-Lease Treaty between the USSR and the US.

5|$|After {{the start}} of the war with Japan, President <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt signed an order for {{internment}} of all the people of Japanese ancestry who lived on the West Coast. About 1,700of them lived in Portland, and some had farms or businesses near the slough. When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center (Expo Center) in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{has been}} elected ten times to the Security Council. It has contributed troops to UN {{peacekeeping}} efforts in the Middle East, the former Belgian Congo, Cyprus, Mozambique, Angola, and more recently East Timor and Haiti. Brazil {{is one of the}} main contributors to the UN regular budget. Prior to the UN's founding in 1945, <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt lobbied for Brazil to be included on the Security Council, but the UK and the Soviet Union refused.|$|E
5|$|Four {{men have}} become President of the United States {{after serving as}} Governor of New York: Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt, and six were Vice President of the United States.

Two {{governors}} have been Chief Justice of the United States: John Jay held that position {{when he was elected}} governor in 1795, and Charles Evans Hughes became chief justice in 1930, two decades after leaving the governorship.|$|E
5|$|German {{operations}} in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign. In November 1943, <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran. The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma Campaign, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.|$|E
5|$|He {{developed}} a reputation for honesty, diligence {{and the ability to}} testify effectively before legislative hearings and to speak clearly to the press. In 1936, he cofounded the American Labor Party, a pro-union political party active in New York, along with David Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, partly as a vehicle to organize support for the re-election that year of President <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt and mayor Fiorello La Guardia among socialists in the union movement.|$|E
5|$|Hoover Dam is a {{concrete}} arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, {{on the border}} between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt. Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947. Its construction {{was the result of a}} massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The dam was named after President Herbert Hoover.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, he was {{transferred}} to Fort Myer in Virginia. While stationed there, Matthews {{and some of his}} troops were escorts for King George VI and his wife Queen Elizabeth when they came to visit President <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt at the White House. He earned acclaim for his horse shows, which helped sell war bonds during World War II and he tended to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's personal horses. He also played on the polo team while stationed in the state.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt’s Secretary of Commerce, Daniel Roper, {{appointed}} Flanders to the Business Advisory Council, {{which was}} created to provide input to the administration on matters affecting business. The Council then made Flanders chairman of the Committee on Unemployment. This committee recommended addressing the problem both geographically and by industry. Flanders reported, however, that when the committee made its recommendations President Roosevelt was preoccupied with augmenting the Supreme Court and ultimately chose the undistributed profits tax instead—a choice that Flanders felt discouraged capital investment.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Truman {{was named}} Missouri's {{director}} for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of the Civil Works Administration) {{at the request of}} Postmaster General James Farley. This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to <b>Franklin</b> <b>D.</b> Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal patronage jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power. It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.|$|E
