5|$|The missing depth is not {{the only}} factor that the critics deplore. An {{important}} feature of Michelangelo's work which, in many places, has disappeared forever is the painting of the eyeballs. Eyes appear in many instances to have been painted buon <b>fresco.</b> Wherever they have not been painted buon <b>fresco</b> but added a secco, they have been removed by the restorers.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} technique employed was <b>fresco,</b> {{in which}} the paint is applied to damp plaster. Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{one of the most}} competent and prolific of Florentine <b>fresco</b> painters, {{at the time that the}} latter was employed on a <b>fresco</b> cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. At the outset, the plaster, , began to grow mold because it was too wet. Michelangelo had to remove it and start again. He then tried a new formula created by one of his assistants, Jacopo l'Indaco, which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition.|$|E
5|$|Victor <b>Fresco,</b> the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop a show about the disconnection between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach their kids to be moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to <b>Fresco,</b> Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. <b>Fresco</b> stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base Veridian Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name {{was based on the}} idea that a person is better off if they are Ted, that essentially the average person wants to be Ted. <b>Fresco</b> has stated that he wasn't a fan of the show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Frescoes</b> {{were painted}} {{in the same year}} as the church was opened. This {{is one of the few}} {{examples}} of the 12th-century <b>frescoes</b> in Russia. In 1445, some of the <b>frescoes</b> were renovated, with the emphasis on the careful reproduction of the old ones. Most of the original <b>frescoes</b> were lost in the 17th century. Some of them were removed from the walls and left under the new floor. These were discovered in the 20th century and restored. In 1780, some of the old <b>frescoes</b> were discovered on the walls. In total, about 20% of the original <b>frescoes</b> survived.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ceiling is}} {{decorated}} with five <b>frescos</b> that cover [...] which are the second largest ceiling <b>frescoes</b> (after the Pažaislis Monastery) in Lithuania. The three smaller <b>frescoes</b> above the organ form a triptych from Saint Peter's life: healing a cripple, escape from prison, and vision of a sheet with animals. The other two <b>frescoes</b> depict Quo vadis? and Peter's confrontation with Simon Magus. These <b>frescoes</b> are of a rather simple composition, poorly executed, and lack background detail, but the figures are expressive, making complex, dynamic, almost theatrical movements. The authorship of the <b>frescoes</b> is unknown. Vladas Drėma attributed them to Martino Altomonte, while Mieczysław Skrudlik suggested Michelangelo Palloni. Mindaugas Paknys, using surviving written records, disproved both hypothesis and attributed the <b>frescoes</b> to Johann Gotthard Berchhoff. Two other <b>frescoes</b> by a different author decorate the sacristies. They depict Jesus saving Saint Peter from drowning and a vision of Stanisław Kazimierczyk.|$|R
5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes {{on the theme of}} Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as <b>fresco</b> was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint on the theme of Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's <b>fresco</b> was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to paint a replacement on the theme of Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement <b>fresco.</b> Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E

5|$|Because he was {{painting}} <b>fresco,</b> the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for <b>fresco</b> painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E

5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon <b>fresco,</b> that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
