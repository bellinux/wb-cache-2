50|$|All {{stations}} in the IBSS compete for beacon transmission every aBeaconPeriod time units. This time period is called a beacon period (BP). At {{the beginning of each}} BP, there is a beacon generation window consisting of w + 1 slots each of length aSlotTime. Each station calculates a random delay uniformly distributed in w and is scheduled to transmit a beacon when the <b>delay</b> <b>timer</b> expires. If a beacon arrives before the random <b>delay</b> <b>timer</b> has expired, the station cancels the pending beacon transmission and the remaining random delay. Upon receiving a beacon, a station sets its TSF timer to the timestamp of the beacon if the value of the timestamp is later than the station’s TSF timer.|$|E

50|$|The {{new digital}} <b>delay</b> box <b>timers</b> used decimal or {{binary coded decimal}} {{thumbwheel}} switches to set countdown timer values in digital logic. The thumbwheels also fed back a visual numerical value that the race car driver could use to help him calculate proper settings. A popular early digital unit of this type was designed and produced by Robert Furrow (B. F. Electronics of Weatherford, Oklahoma). Robert Furrow's delay box utilized a quartz crystal for timing accuracy and Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) integrated circuits. Furrow's digital delay box was a substantial improvement in accuracy and ergonomics but suffered in reliability. In the United States many B.F. Electronics <b>delay</b> <b>timers</b> were sold Nationwide.|$|R

The plan was to drop a team of saboteurs by parachute; they were {{to break into the}} {{transformer station}}, attach bombs and incendiaries with <b>delay</b> <b>timers.</b> The bombs would wreck the transformers and the incendiaries would set fire to the transformer cooling oil to complete the destruction.|$|R
50|$|A {{time-delay}} {{combination lock}} is most commonly a digital, electronic combination lock {{equipped with a}} <b>delay</b> <b>timer</b> that delays the unlocking of the lock by a user definable delay period, usually less than one hour. Unlike the time lock, which unlocks at a preset time (as {{in the case of}} a bank vault), time-delay locks operate each time the safe is unlocked, but the operator must wait for the set delay period to elapse before the lock can be opened. Time delay safes are most commonly used in businesses with high cash transactions. They are used in banks like Nationwide, HSBC and Halifax.|$|E
50|$|These {{machines}} {{may also}} be directed by sensors located in the bump bars which, on contact with objects such as a wall, cause a reverse in direction, with a small offset allowing it to move one machine's width over on each crossing of the pool. The <b>delay</b> <b>timer</b> is an important feature for many pools, as many switch off a number of circulation pumps during the night to allow suspended particles to settle {{on the bottom of}} the pool; after a couple of hours the pool cleaner begins its cleaning cycle. This cleaning cycle is set up to complete before the pumps are turned back on. Though not necessary for adequate pool cleaning, this feature saves energy and improves cleaning efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Seward {{supplied}} {{an electronics}} technician, Sgt. Walker, and two mechanics, {{all of whom}} arrived {{the next day and}} immediately set about building a display in Halifax BB360. The basic idea was to use the <b>delay</b> <b>timer</b> that reduced the size of the centre-zero as a switch; the existing display would receive returns exactly as it had before, with everything before that timer being suppressed, while a new display would receive everything before that time, and could be adjusted so the centre-zero filled the display. This would result in one display showing everything in the air, and a second providing a ground map exactly as before. The first experimental system flew on 27 May with a Mosquito providing a target. The Mosquito clearly appeared on the display, and photographs of the display caused much excitement.|$|E

50|$|Delay boxes began {{appearing}} in drag race {{cars in the}} 1980s. The early units were timers in a sheet metal box with an analog potentiometer and lock nut to establish a setpoint with no readout or feedback to the driver. These early units used a resistor / capacitor charging scheme to trigger a unijunction transistor to release an electromechanical relay. Such drag racing delay timers are very crude by today's standards. Nolen (IKE) Hamma is credited with introducing such early devices to drag racing. (currently DBA as Digital Delay, INC.) Ike Hamma is deceased. His family is assigned a patent for a type of <b>delay</b> <b>timer,</b> his son Charlie Hamma is the current president of Digital Delay Inc., a manufacturer of drag racing timers. Other entities contributed to delay box technology and also have Intellectual Property. Some of these other entities have delay box patents (Reid and Furrow), some entities did not pursue patents for their inventions even though their inventions may have predated those of known patent holders.|$|E
5000|$|... "Delay Box" [...] is {{a common}} slang term used in drag racing to {{describe}} an on-board timer which is a Transmission Brake <b>Delay</b> <b>Timer.</b> A transbrake forces the race car to remain stationary at the starting line, in gear, regardless of how much engine power is applied. When the visual signal is given to start the race, the driver triggers the delay box to begin timing (precisely counting down). If the driver does not interrupt this timing device, the car is launched down the race track at the instant the timer expires (counts to zero). Delay box use was very controversial in the 1980s and 1990s, as it removed {{a portion of the}} advantages more experienced racers had. There was a period where technologists added and concealed homemade circuitry inside a delay box that violated some racing associations rules. Racing associations have imposed strict limits on delay boxes today, with manufacturers having to submit to an approval process, which has drastically reduced the number of makers of these devices.|$|E

40|$|Real-time systems, {{characterized}} {{by a set of}} timings con-stants (internal <b>delays,</b> <b>timers,</b> clock speeds), need to be perfectly reliable. Formal methods can prove their correct-ness but, if one of the timing constants changes, verifica-tion needs to be restarted from scratch. Also, variations of some delays (even infinitesimal) may lead to the specifica-tion violation. It is thus interesting to reason parametrically, and synthesize constraints on the timing constants seen as parameters to formally guarantee the specification. We pro-pose here an attempt to distribute a synthesis algorithm, the behavioral cartography, and we evaluate two work distribu-tion algorithms.

The study involved two seperate field assessments. The objective of the first test was to assess and effectively quantify the potential ``wasted-light`` hours associated with different occupant and space types associated with occupancy sensor control installations. These quantities are the primary factor in determining actual lighting energy savings associated with occupancy lighting control.

40|$|A recent {{model for}} testing systems with {{multiple}} timers is extended to compute proper input delays and timeout settings, and {{is applied to}} several types of timers required in a testing procedure. In the model, any transition in the specification can be made conditional {{on a set of}} running timers. Depending on the path taken to reach an edge, the values of the timer variables may render the traversal of the edge infeasible. The presented modeling technique, combined with the INconsistencies DEtection and ELimination (INDEEL) algorithms, allows the generation of feasible test sequences. The model also o#ers the flexibility to define timer lengths as variables, and have the INDEEL find the appropriate timer ranges.

40|$|Femtocell {{technology}} has been proposed to offload user data traffic from the macrocell to the femtocell and extend the limited coverage of the macrocell in Mobile Communications Networks (MCNs). In existing commercial femtocell/macrocell networks, a widely accepted solution to configure the Location Areas (LAs) is to partition the femtocells overlapped with a macrocell into small groups and to assign each group with a unique LA ID {{different from that of}} the macrocell. Such configuration can reduce the paging cost in the mobility management, but increases registration signaling overhead due to discontinuous coverage of femtocells. To reduce signaling overhead in the femtocell/macrocell network, we propose a Delay Registration (DR) algorithm that postpones the registration until the <b>delay</b> <b>timer</b> expires when the MS moves into the overlapped femtocell. Analytical models and simulation experiments are proposed to investigate the performance of the DR algorithm. Our analytical models are general enough to accommodate various MS mobility behaviors. Our study can provide guidelines for the operators to set up a <b>delay</b> <b>timer</b> to reduce signaling overhead while sustaining the traffic offloading capability of the femtocell...|$|E

40|$|Interrupt {{coalescing}} is {{a proven}} technique for reducing CPU utilization when processing high IO rates in storage and networking controllers. Virtualization introduces {{a layer of}} virtual hardware whose interrupt rate can be controlled by the hypervisor. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a virtual interrupt coalescing scheme for virtual SCSI hardware controllers in a hypervisor. We use the number of commands in flight from the guest to dynamically set our interrupt coalescing rate. Compared to existing techniques in hardware, our work does not rely on high resolution interrupt <b>delay</b> <b>timers</b> and thus leads to a very efficient implementation in a hypervisor. Furthermore, our technique is generic and therefore applicable to all types of disk IO controllers which, unlike networking, don’t receive anonymous traffic.

40|$|Pigeons' pecks were {{reinforced}} {{according to}} a variable-interval schedule. A delay-of-reinforcement procedure was then added to the schedule, or a yoked-control procedure was arranged where the reinforcers occurred independently of responding according to the same variable-interval schedule. During the delay-of-reinforcement procedure, the first peck after a reinforcer was scheduled began a <b>delay</b> <b>timer</b> and the reinforcer was delivered {{at the end of}} the interval. No stimulus change signalled the delay interval and responses could occur during it, so that the obtained delays were often shorter than those scheduled. Responding under this procedure was highly variable but, in general, behavior was substantially reduced even with the shortest delay used, 3 sec. In addition, the rates maintained by delayed reinforcement were only slightly greater than those maintained by the yoked-control procedure, suggesting that adventitious pairings of response and reinforcer were responsible for some of the maintenance of behavior that did occur. The results challenge recent conceptions of reinforcement as involving response-reinforcer correlations and re-emphasize the role of temporal proximity between response and reinforcer...|$|E

A natural consequence of this practice is that the interconnected power systems are likely to swing following faults and other disturbing events. Power swing relays are traditionally used to block distance relays from tripping line circuit breakers if the swing {{is not likely to}} cause dynamic instability but open the interconnecting lines if the systems are likely to become unstable. This is achieved by using <b>delay</b> <b>timers</b> but deciding on the delays is a very difficult, complex and judgmental issue. This paper presents a new approach for use in out-of-step relays.
