25|$|A leg {{break is}} bowled by holding the cricket {{ball in the}} palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the wrist is rotated to the left and the ball flicked by the ring finger, giving the ball an {{anti-clockwise}} spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the left from the bowler's perspective; this is to the right from the batsman's point of view, or towards the off side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the leg side, and this is where <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> name leg break, meaning it breaks away from the leg. The turn is mostly when the ball pitches.|$|E

[...] Varietys Geoff Berkshire said the film is [...] "Grim, gritty and ultra-violent", called Dredd a [...] "badass of few words", and wrote that Urban [...] "does a fine job embodying the more mythic qualities of Dredd as an upright law enforcer no lowlife would want to confront."

[...] Projectiles are also typically much cheaper and smaller, allowing for many more to be carried (they have no guidance systems, and rely on the railgun to supply their kinetic energy, rather than providing it themselves). [...] The speed, cost, and numerical advantages of railgun systems may allow them to replace several different systems in the current layered defense approach. A railgun projectile without the ability to change course can hit fast-moving missiles at a maximum range of [...] As is the case with the Phalanx CIWS, unguided railgun rounds will require multiple/many shots to bring down maneuvering supersonic anti-ship missiles, with the odds of hitting the missile improving dramatically the closer <b>it</b> <b>gets.</b> <b>The</b> Navy plans for railguns to be able to intercept endoatmospheric ballistic missiles, stealthy air threats, supersonic missiles, and swarming surface threats; a prototype system for supporting interception tasks is to be ready by 2018, and operational by 2025.
