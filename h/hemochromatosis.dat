5|$|Hemingway's {{behavior}} during his final {{years had been}} {{similar to that of}} his father's before he killed himself; his father may have had the genetic disease <b>hemochromatosis,</b> due to which the inability to metabolize iron culminates in mental and physical deterioration. Medical records made available in 1991 confirm that Hemingway had been diagnosed with <b>hemochromatosis</b> in early 1961. His sister Ursula and his brother Leicester also killed themselves. In addition to being affected by his physical ailments, Hemingway's health was compromised by his having been a heavy drinker for most of his life.|$|E
5|$|Other {{specific}} {{underlying causes}} {{are treated as}} normally. For example, <b>hemochromatosis</b> is treated by venesection, the regular removal of a fixed amount of blood. Eventually, this decreases the iron levels {{in the body and}} improves the function of the organs in which iron has accumulated.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests that}} may {{assist in the}} {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism, especially if no tumor is found on the MRI scan, are ferritin (elevated in <b>hemochromatosis),</b> angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels (often elevated in sarcoidosis), and human chorionic gonadotropin (often elevated in tumor of germ cell origin). If a genetic cause is suspected, genetic testing may be performed.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been reports in other genetic conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta type 1, {{autosomal}} dominant polycystic kidney disease and pseudoxanthoma elasticum, α1 antitrypsin deficiency and hereditary <b>hemochromatosis,</b> but evidence for these associations is weaker. Genetic studies in other connective tissue-related genes have mostly yielded negative results. Other abnormalities to the blood vessels, such as fibromuscular dysplasia, {{have been reported in}} a proportion of cases. Atherosclerosis does not appear to increase the risk.|$|E
25|$|The city {{is known}} internationally as the {{headquarters}} of the Canadian <b>Hemochromatosis</b> Society, and also as the city where the National Annual <b>Hemochromatosis</b> Awareness Month was initiated by former Mayor G. H. Blair in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{causes of}} {{hepatitis}} include alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, <b>hemochromatosis,</b> and Wilson's disease. In alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, a co-dominant mutation in {{the gene for}} alpha-1-antitrypsin results in the abnormal accumulation of the protein within liver cells, leading to liver disease. <b>Hemochromatosis</b> and Wilson's disease are both autosomal recessive diseases involving abnormal storage of minerals. In <b>hemochromatosis,</b> excess amounts of iron accumulate in multiple body sites, including the liver, {{which can lead to}} cirrhosis. In Wilson's disease, excess amounts of copper accumulate in the liver and brain, causing cirrhosis and dementia.|$|E

25|$|Chronic iron {{toxicity}} {{is usually}} the result of more chronic iron overload syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes. In such cases the iron stores of an adult may reach 50grams (10 times normal total body iron) or more. Classic examples of genetic iron overload includes hereditary <b>hemochromatosis</b> (HH) and the more severe disease juvenile <b>hemochromatosis</b> (JH) caused by mutations in either the gene RGMc gene, {{a member of a}} three gene repulsive guidance molecule family, (also called hemojuvelin (HJV), and HFE2), Hemojuvelin, or the HAMP gene that encodes (an iron regulatory peptide). The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult <b>hemochromatosis,</b> which make up most of the genetic iron overload disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of <b>hemochromatosis,</b> they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.|$|E
25|$|For example, <b>hemochromatosis</b> is {{the name}} given to several {{different}} heritable diseases with the same outcome, excess absorption of iron. These variants all reflect a failure in a metabolic pathway associated with iron metabolism, however mutations that cause <b>hemochromatosis</b> can occur at different gene loci. Mutations have occurred at each locus many times, and a few such mutations have become widespread in some population. The fact that multiple loci are involved is the primary cause for the variant forms of <b>hemochromatosis</b> and its outcome. This variation is caused not by compound heterozygosity, but rather {{by the fact that}} several different enzyme defects can cause the disease. Clinically, most cases of <b>hemochromatosis</b> are found in homozygotes for the most common mutation in the HFE gene. But at each gene locus associated with the disease, there is the possibility of compound heterozygosity, often caused by inheritance of two unrelated alleles, of which one is a common or classic mutation, while the other is a rare or even novel one.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{patients}} with cirrhosis, alcohol consumption is to be avoided. Also, screening for <b>hemochromatosis</b> may be beneficial for some patients.|$|E
25|$|Hereditary <b>hemochromatosis.</b> Usually {{presents}} with {{a family}} history of cirrhosis, skin hyperpigmentation, diabetes mellitus, pseudogout, or cardiomyopathy, all due to signs of iron overload.|$|E
25|$|Some liver {{diseases}} {{may cause}} porphyria {{even in the}} absence of genetic predisposition. These include <b>hemochromatosis</b> and hepatitis C. Treatment of iron overload may be required.|$|E
25|$|For some genetic diseases, {{environmental}} cofactors are {{an important}} determinant of variation and outcome. In the case of <b>hemochromatosis,</b> penetrance is incomplete, even for the classic HFE mutation, and is affected by gender, diet, and behaviors such as alcohol consumption. Compound heterozygotes are often observed only through subclinical symptoms such as excess iron. Disease is rarely observed in such compound heterozygotes unless other causal factors (such as alcoholism) are present. As a result, compound heterozygosity for <b>hemochromatosis</b> may be more common than diagnosis based on pathology would suggest.|$|E
25|$|The HFE gene {{is located}} on short arm of {{chromosome}} 6 at location 6p21.3 Unusually, the official gene symbol (HFE for High Iron Fe) is not an abbreviation of the official name (<b>hemochromatosis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{inherited}} disorders {{have been}} linked to osteoporosis. These include osteogenesis imperfecta, Marfan syndrome, <b>hemochromatosis,</b> hypophosphatasia (for which it is often misdiagnosed), glycogen storage diseases, homocystinuria, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, porphyria, Menkes' syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa and Gaucher's disease.|$|E
25|$|When {{the liver}} is involved, alpha-1-antitrypsin {{deficiency}} and Wilson's disease tend to present as hepatitis in the neonatal period or in childhood. <b>Hemochromatosis</b> typically presents in adulthood, {{with the onset}} of clinical disease usually after age 50.|$|E
25|$|Hypogonadism, a {{decrease}} in male sex hormones may manifest as impotence, infertility, loss of sexual drive, and testicular atrophy, and can result from primary gonadal injury or suppression of hypothalamic/pituitary function. Hypogonadism is associated with cirrhosis due to alcoholism or <b>hemochromatosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{occurs in}} the setting of chronic liver inflammation, and is most closely linked to chronic viral {{hepatitis}} infection (hepatitis B or C) or exposure to toxins such as alcohol or aflatoxin. Certain diseases, such as <b>hemochromatosis</b> and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, markedly increase the risk of developing HCC. Metabolic syndrome and NASH are also increasingly recognized as risk factors for HCC.|$|E
25|$|Other {{blood tests}} are usually done to {{differentiate}} from other causes of arthritis, like the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, full blood count, kidney function, liver enzymes and other immunological tests (e.g., antinuclear antibody/ANA) are all performed at this stage. Elevated ferritin levels can reveal <b>hemochromatosis,</b> a mimic of RA, or {{be a sign of}} Still's disease, a seronegative, usually juvenile, variant of rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Free {{radicals}} {{may also}} be involved in Parkinson's disease, senile and drug-induced deafness, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's. The classic free-radical syndrome, the iron-storage disease <b>hemochromatosis,</b> is typically associated with a constellation of free-radical-related symptoms including movement disorder, psychosis, skin pigmentary melanin abnormalities, deafness, arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. The free-radical theory of aging proposes that free radicals underlie the aging process itself. Similarly, the process of mitohormesis suggests that repeated exposure to free radicals may extend life span.|$|E
25|$|Liver abscesses {{are often}} acute conditions, with common causes being pyogenic and amoebic. Chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis, {{may be a}} cause of liver failure, a state where the liver is unable to {{compensate}} for chronic damage, and unable to meet the metabolic demands of the body. In the acute setting, {{this may be a}} cause of hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. Other causes of chronic liver disease are genetic or autoimmune disease, such as <b>hemochromatosis,</b> Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Cirrhosis is most {{commonly}} caused by alcohol, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Typically, {{more than two}} or three alcoholic drinks per day over a number of years is required for alcoholic cirrhosis to occur. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has a number of causes, including being overweight, diabetes, high blood fats, and high blood pressure. A number of less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, <b>hemochromatosis,</b> certain medications, and gallstones. Diagnosis is based on blood testing, medical imaging, and liver biopsy.|$|E
25|$|Human iron {{metabolism}} is the set {{of chemical}} reactions that maintain human homeostasis of iron at both the systemic and cellular level. The control of this necessary but potentially toxic metal {{is an important part}} of many aspects of human health and disease. Hematologists have been especially interested in systemic iron metabolism because iron is essential for red blood cells, where most of the human body's iron is contained. Understanding iron metabolism is also important for understanding diseases of iron overload, such as hereditary <b>hemochromatosis,</b> and iron deficiency, such as iron deficiency anemia.|$|E
25|$|Mangels et al. write that, {{because of}} the lower {{bioavailability}} of iron from plant sources, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences established a separate RDA for vegetarians and vegans of 14mg for vegetarian men and postmenopausal women, and 33mg for premenopausal women not using oral contraceptives. Supplements should be used with caution after consulting a physician, because iron can accumulate {{in the body and}} cause damage to organs. This is particularly true of anyone with <b>hemochromatosis,</b> a relatively common condition that can remain undiagnosed.|$|E
25|$|In May 2003, Schmitz {{became ill}} and was {{diagnosed}} with Hereditary <b>Hemochromatosis,</b> a genetic disorder which had been poisoning Schmitz's internal organs since birth, resulting in over a dozen disorders. As Schmitz's conditions worsened, his ability to continue working on the site, which had previously been a 60+ hour job, declined. In 2007, Schmitz's contract with Yahoo! Movies ended, and online publication of Greg's Previews of Upcoming Movies was halted. Schmitz's health improved, and in January 2008, Schmitz began writing online again as a weekly columnist for Rotten Tomatoes, and in May 2008, began writing as a contributing columnist for Fandango.|$|E
25|$|Cys282Tyr (or C282Y) is a {{mutation}} in the HFE gene {{that has been}} linked to most cases of hereditary <b>hemochromatosis.</b> Genetic techniques indicate that this mutation occurred roughly 60–70 generations ago or between 600 and 800 CE, assuming a generation length of 20 years. The regional distribution of this mutation among European populations indicates that it originated in Southern Scandinavia and spread with Viking expansion. Due to the timing of the mutation and subsequent population movements, C282Y is very prominent in Great Britain, Normandy, and Southern Scandinavia although C282Y has been found in almost every population that has been in contact with the Vikings.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to a systemic bacterial infection, the immune system initiates {{a process known as}} iron withholding. If bacteria are to survive, then they must obtain iron from their environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called siderophores and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a metabolic price they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against most bacterial infections; there are some exceptions however. TB causing bacterium can reside within macrophages which are an iron rich environment and Borrelia burgdorferi utilises manganese in place of iron. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with <b>hemochromatosis,</b> are more susceptible to some bacterial infection.|$|E
25|$|Predictive and presymptomatic testing: Predictive and presymptomatic {{types of}} testing {{are used to}} detect gene {{mutations}} associated with disorders that appear after birth, often later in life. These tests can be helpful {{to people who have}} a family member with a genetic disorder, but who have no features of the disorder themselves at the time of testing. Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person's chances of developing disorders with a genetic basis, such as certain types of cancer. For example, an individual with a mutation in BRCA1 has a 65% cumulative risk of breast cancer. Hereditary breast cancer along with ovarian cancer syndrome are caused by gene alterations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Major cancer types related to mutations in these genes are female breast cancer, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and male breast cancer. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by a gene alteration on the gene TP53. Cancer types associated with a mutation on this gene include breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), leukemia and brain tumors. In the Cowden syndrome there is a mutation on the PTEN gene, causing potential breast, thyroid or endometrial cancer. Presymptomatic testing can determine whether a person will develop a genetic disorder, such as <b>hemochromatosis</b> (an iron overload disorder), before any signs or symptoms appear. The results of predictive and presymptomatic testing can provide information about a person’s risk of developing a specific disorder, help with making decisions about medical care and provide a better prognosis.|$|E
500|$|Iron uptake is tightly {{regulated}} by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake. Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people {{as a result of}} a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6 and leads to abnormally low levels of hepcidin, a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in mammals. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders, known medically as <b>hemochromatosis.</b> Many people have an undiagnosed genetic susceptibility to iron overload, and are not aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, people should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor. <b>Hemochromatosis</b> is estimated to be the cause of 0.3 to 0.8% of all metabolic diseases of Caucasians.|$|E
