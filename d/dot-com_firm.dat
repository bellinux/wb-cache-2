40|$|A {{number of}} {{researchers}} have demonstrated that rather than simply dispersing, the Internet in fact has exhibited an uneven spatial pattern throughout the United States and world. Although {{the use of the}} Internet is rapidly decentralizing, the majority of Internet industry firms remain concentrated in key locations in the United States. This pattern of uneven territorial distribution of the Internet industry is demostrated in this paper with the introduction of two new indicators, the location of top web sites and the location of <b>dot-com</b> <b>firms.</b> This paper uses this distribution as the dependent variable in a multivariate regression of a number of regional attributes that are often used to explain the location of new and innovative industries.

Housing prices in New Economy markets are found to be higher, peakier and more volatile than in old economy markets. Homeownership rates are found to be lower in new economy metro areas while crowding is found to be higher. Although the distribution of housing values, cost, and rents was more equal in New Economy markets, the cause would seem to be differences in metro area income levels, with poorer MSA's having greater inequalities. Regression analysis is used to identify the contribution of traditional supply and demand factors such as job growth, income, residential construction, as well as New Economy indicators, to housing market outcomes. Rather than being fundamentally different, New Economy housing markets are found to be faster and more extreme versions of traditional housing markets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of supply-side and demand-side factors on the compensation of information technology (IT) professionals and considers the human capital and institutional explanations. We focus on returns to an MBA and the IT-related experience of IT professionals and use the largest data set of IT professionals that has been compiled to date in the United States to answer our research questions. We find that firms pay a significant premium for an MBA. Although firms value the IT experience of IT professionals, they value an MBA significantly more. The {{results of this study}} cast doubt on the belief that IT skills have a large firm-specific component. Although IT experience is valued more than non-IT experience for IT professionals, firms value IT experience at other firms much more than they value firm-specific IT experience. Likewise, contrary to popular perception, we do not find evidence for complementarities between an MBA education and IT experience. Among institutional effects, firms in IT and IT-intensive industries pay significantly more to IT professionals than do other <b>firms,</b> and <b>dot-com</b> <b>firms</b> also paid a significant premium in 1999 and 2000. However, these firms do not value an MBA or firm-specific IT experience any more than other firms. We discuss the implications of these findings for further research, for firms' compensation practices, and for individual IT professionals.

40|$|Natural history depicts {{evidence}} {{of the dynamics of}} evolution, while fossil records permit the examination of change over time. Such records inform us also that change is never easy and does not occur without casualties. It seems that parallel observations may be advanced as the Internet and widespread use of information and communication technologies (ICT) have brought about new organizational forms, entirely new ways of organizing, as well as enabling novel processes. One casualty reflective of an evolutionary era is the <b>dot-com</b> <b>firms</b> that have gone bust. As firms are moving along the evolutionary path of understanding and implementing these developments we need {{to come to grips with}} their design, management and impact. This contribution examines electronic markets and related off-shoots as a coordination form and macro-structure of information and communication systems within the electric power market. The basic notion of 'electronic market' is explored briefly. We recognize several forms in which such markets manifest themselves. The author emphasizes the role of competition in electronic markets, as well as the newly found role of intermediaries. Electronic markets in the electricity industry are examined in some detail, i. e. the electronic trading of electricity. This market demonstrates nicely the opportunities, but also potential pitfalls of electronic trading of this commodity, especially given relatively recent experiences with the electricity supply situation in the State of California, as well as the demise of Enron. A number of patterns, trading practices and regulatory concerns are highlighted. At the same time though similar underlying problems are applicable in all industrialized nations and selected examples are provided. electronic markets, electronic business, competition, regulation, electricity industry,...|$|R

40|$|Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy 2009 This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Organizations of Science and InnovationThere is great academic and policy interest in identifying and tracking emerging technologies and industries. New industries, which combine knowledge in new and novel ways, are associated with innovation and entrepreneurial activities. Most importantly, emerging industries provide the platform for future economic growth. The gales of innovation and technological change which Schumpeter so colorfully described as driving economic growth are due, in large part, to the emergence of new technology and the evolution of industrial activities. Most notably, emerging industries tend to cluster spatially as advantages accrue to those at the locus of creative activity and opportunity. Emerging industries, however, by their very nature do not fit neatly into existing classification schemes. We are constantly looking at categories that described past activity while trying to predict and anticipate the future. With existing data there is simply no good way to identify emerging industries. Thus, our ideas of emerging industries amount to the usual suspects favored with extensive media coverage: biotechnology, nanotechnology and <b>dot-com</b> <b>firms.</b> Although consequential, these industries are likely atypical, and our understanding of technological change [...] specifically how new industries emerge and their relationship to existing activity [...] would be greatly enhanced if we were to have systematic quantitative methods of identifying groups of firms engaged in similar new technologies or process or using new business models. Moreover, there is little theory to assist places as they attempt to anchor new industries and harness their economic potential. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a new look at the geographic and industrial anatomy of an emerging science-based industry. We use the example of the industrial applications of optical science, which arguably has characteristics of a general purpose technology. Optics is the study of light and the ways that light interacts with matter. Although its origins coincide with the earliest scientific inquiry, modern optical science is an enabling technology applied to a variety of intermediate markets [...] telecommunication equipment, medical devices, scientific instruments, semiconductors, imaging and reproduction, defense and security, and retail logistics. Known by various names including opto-electronics, and photonics, which may reflect the developmental stages of the technology, optical science is arguably a platform technology that is transformative in its economic effect, with a growth rate 3. 5 times faster than other major technologies (International Society for Optical Engineering, 2006). One hundred and fifteen degree-granting academic programs in the U. S. are dedicated to optical science and there are a large number of interdisciplinary institutes or focus areas in traditional academic departments. The optics industry is noted to cluster spatially, especially around academic centers of excellence (Holton, 2000). And there are case studies that provide the genesis of individual optics clusters (Hendry et al., 2000; Sydow et al., 2007; Waits, 2000). There is little empirical work, however, that examines the range of optical science applications and its geographic distribution. Moreover, there are many places that are attempting to develop clusters related to optics while there is a limited understanding of what contributes to the vibrancy of existing geographic concentration for this specific industry. The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a discussion of the theory related to the geographic clustering of economic activity, especially the reasons associated with the geographic clustering of inventive activity. So much has been written about industrial clusters over the past ten years that it is perhaps more instructive to consider omissions in the literature, such as the lack of attention to how spatial concentrations of firms are differentiated and the relative paucity of understanding about how existing industry structure influences the adaption and potential to further innovate incorporating breakthrough technology. Section III presents the case for studying optical science as an emerging industry and introduces a new methodology to define an emerging industry. Section IV examines the geographic distribution of optical science, finding strong evidence of geographic concentrations of inventive activity with significant variation in place-specific industrial activity. Section V provides a specific focus on what we define as self-designated clusters â those places that are trying to define an identity and economic development strategy around the optics industry. Section VII summarizes and concludes...|$|R
