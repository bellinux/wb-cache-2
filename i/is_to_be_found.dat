5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in churches and monasteries, there are {{examples in the}} secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E
5|$|Bronze age {{archaeology}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> {{in abundance}} {{in the surrounding}} area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a mile to the North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet. Iron Age archaeology is also well represented, for example in the souterrain nearby Warddykes Cemetery and at West Grange of Conan, {{as well as the}} better-known examples at Carlungie and Ardestie.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{churches have}} existed in Greater Manchester since the Anglo-Saxon era, but no {{significant}} Saxon features remain in its listed churches, {{and the only}} Norman material <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in StLeonard, Middleton. The churches in this list fall into two main groups: those originating mainly from the medieval period, which are in Gothic style, and churches built during the 19th and 20thcenturies, mainly in Gothic Revival style, {{with only a few}} churches created between these periods. Gothic churches originating from the medieval era include Manchester Cathedral, StMary, Radcliffe, and StWerburgh Old Church, Warburton. Churches from the 19thcentury include some of the finest works of the leading architects of the period: George Gilbert Scott (StMark, Worsley), Alfred Waterhouse (StElisabeth, Reddish), George Frederick Bodley (StAugustine, Pendlebury), and Charles Barry (All Saints, Whitefield). Built between these periods was the Neoclassical church of StAnn, Manchester. All the above examples are Anglican churches. There are two Roman Catholic churches in the list: Joseph A.Hansom's Holy Name of Jesus, Manchester, and E.W.Pugin's All Saints, Urmston, and one church built for the Christian Scientists, the Edgar Wood Centre.|$|E
5|$|It was in {{this period}} that the {{national}} flag emerged as a common symbol. The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, {{first appeared in the}} Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on seals used during the late 13th century; including on one particular example used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century. The earliest reference to the Saint Andrew's Cross as a flag <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in the Vienna Book of Hours, circa 1503.|$|E

5|$|Moving roughly eastwards, Garston Street, {{also in the}} valley-bottom, {{consists}} of a long row of weavers' and other artisans' cottages dating from the 17th century. The eastern end of this area, adjacent to Kilver Street, is now occupied by the cider breweries. Across Kilver Street (the A37) is Kilver Court, which {{over the course of}} the 20th century has been a factory, the headquarters of the Showerings brewing business, and then the headquarters of a leather-goods manufacturer, Mulberry. Behind are the , originally built by Showerings for the recreation of their staff and set against the backdrop of part of the Charlton Viaduct. The gardens are now open to the public. On the eastern edge of the town is Charlton where there are former breweries and mills, now converted into a trading estate, and right on the edge of the town <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> Charlton House, a luxury hotel and spa.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, Felix Schlag was {{announced}} as the winner. His design featured {{the portrayal of}} Jefferson which would be used on the nickel until 2004, closely conforming to the former president's bust by sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. However, the model differs from the nickel that was struck for circulation because it featured a view of Monticello from an angle, and a style of lettering officials did not like; Schlag was required to change both. Either through a misunderstanding or an oversight, Schlag did not include his initials in the design; {{they would not be}} added until 1966. Production began on October 3, 1938; they were released into circulation on November 15. According to contemporary accounts, the Jefferson nickel was initially hoarded, and it was not until 1940 that it was commonly seen in circulation.|$|E
5|$|This {{crocodile}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in the freshwater swamps, {{marshes and}} lakes of New Guinea, {{particularly in the}} interior. It {{has been known to}} enter brackish waters such as those of the Fly River estuary but is very rare in coastal areas, and never found {{in the presence of the}} competing saltwater crocodile (C. porosus). The animal was first described from the Sepik River area in the north of Papua New Guinea. A separate population is found in the southern half of the island, with a range that extends from southeastern Papua New Guinea to the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. It is separated from the northern population by the New Guinea Highlands, a mountain range that runs along the centre of the island. DNA analysis has revealed these to be genetically separate populations, and there are some differences in their morphology and behavior. There are estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000 New Guinea crocodiles in the wild.|$|E

5|$|The {{adoption}} of Middle Scots by the aristocracy {{has been seen}} as building a shared sense of national solidarity and culture between rulers and ruled, although the fact that north of the Tay Gaelic still dominated may have helped widen the cultural divide between highlands and lowlands. The national literature of Scotland created in the late medieval period employed legend and history {{in the service of the}} crown and nationalism, helping to foster a sense of national identity, at least within its elite audience. The epic poetic history of the Brus and Wallace helped outline a narrative of united struggle against the English enemy. Arthurian literature differed from conventional versions of the legend by treating Arthur as a villain and Mordred, the son of the king of the Picts, as a hero. The origin myth of the Scots, systematised by John of Fordun (c. 1320-c. 1384), traced their beginnings from the Greek prince Gathelus and his Egyptian wife Scota, allowing them to argue superiority over the English, who claimed their descent from the Trojans, who had been defeated by the Greeks. The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on seals used during the late thirteenth century; including on one particular example used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286.
