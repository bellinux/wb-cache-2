The produced {{hydrogen and oxygen}} can permeate across the membrane, referred to as crossover. Mixtures of both gases at the electrodes result. At the cathode, oxygen can be catalytically reacted with hydrogen on the platinum surface of the cathodic catalyst. At the anode, hydrogen and oxygen do not react at the <b>iridium</b> <b>oxide</b> catalyst. Thus, safety hazards due to explosive anodic mixtures hydrogen in oxygen can result. The supplied energy for the hydrogen production is lost, when hydrogen is lost due to the reaction with oxygen at the cathode and permeation from the cathode across the membrane to the anode corresponds.

We synthesize PtIrOx/C electrocatalysts of different atomic compositions dispersed on Carbon Vulcan XC- 72 R (R) by using the fast polyol method assisted by microwaves. Afterwards, PtIrOx/C was potentiodynamically decorated by Rh (Rh/PtIrOx/C). The NPs are characterized by energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrooxidation of glycerol was investigated in acid medium by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The electrochemical stability of Rh/PtIrOx/C NPs was evaluated by following a degradation test protocol, which consists in exhaustive cyclic voltammetries. Our results show that the presence of <b>iridium</b> <b>oxides</b> in the architecture of platinum enhances the electrochemical stability of the catalyst by avoiding agglomeration effects. Moreover, the presence of rhodium catalyzes the glycerol electrooxidation reaction. These results help understanding the role of Rh and IrOx in the glycerol electrooxidation and provide new insights for designing nanomaterials with improved stability and activity.

In particular, j_ eff = 1 / 2 bands on a honeycomb lattice provide a pathway to realize Kitaev's exactly solvable spin model. However, since current wisdom requires strong atomic SOC to make j_ eff= 1 / 2 bands, studies have been limited to <b>iridium</b> <b>oxides.</b> Contrary to this expectation, we demonstrate how Kitaev interactions arise in 4 d-orbital honeycomb α-RuCl_ 3, despite having significantly weaker SOC than the <b>iridium</b> <b>oxides,</b> via assistance from electron correlations.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, a novel type of potentiometric dissolved oxygen sensor was introduced. The transduction {{principle of the}} sensor {{is based on the}} modulation of the work function of an <b>iridium</b> <b>oxide</b> film by the ratio of IrIII/IrIV oxide in the film. This ratio depends on the oxygen concentration in the solution, so that the work function of the <b>iridium</b> <b>oxide</b> {{is a measure of the}} amount of dissolved oxygen. The work function changes are determined by using the <b>iridium</b> <b>oxide</b> film as the gate contact of a MOSFET.

In the present paper, a reducing current of constant magnitude is in addition externally applied to the <b>iridium</b> <b>oxide</b> film, so that an overpotential is generated. The influence of this overpotential on the sensor signal is studied and it is shown that the sensitivity towards oxygen increases compared to the equilibrium potential.

We explore emergent behavior in quantum many-body systems, including symmetry-breaking orders, quantum spin liquids, and unconventional superconductivity. Our study is cemented by a particular class of Mott-insulating materials, centered around a family of two- and three-dimensional <b>iridium</b> <b>oxides,</b> whose honeycomb-like lattice structure admits peculiar magnetic interactions, the so-called Kitaev exchange. By analyzing recent experiments on these compounds, we show that this unconventional exchange is the key ingredient in describing their magnetism, and then {{use a combination of}} numerical and analytical techniques to investigate the implications for the phase diagram as well as the physics of the proximate three-dimensional quantum spin liquid phases. These long-ranged-entangled fractionalized phases should exhibit special features, including finite-temperature stability as well as unconventional high-Tc superconductivity upon charge-doping, which should aid future experimental searches for spin liquid physics. Our study explores the nature of frustration and fractionalization which can arise in quantum systems in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling...|$|R
