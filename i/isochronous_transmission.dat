50|$|IEEE 1394a {{offers a}} couple of {{advantages}} over the original IEEE 1394-1995. 1394a is capable of arbitration accelerations, allowing the bus to accelerate arbitration cycles to improve efficiency. It also allows for arbitrated short bus reset, in which a node can be added or dropped without causing a big drop in <b>isochronous</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{high-speed}} Medium Access Control protocol based on ATM for multimedia services. This protocol supports both <b>isochronous</b> and asynchronous <b>transmission</b> services in high-speed by guaranteeing the Quality of Service for various applications with different access modes, especially the isochronous access mode for isochronous services. A simple address scheme, which {{can provide a}} simple interface with B-ISDN and supports connection-oriented/connectionless and broadcasting transmissions {{as well as the}} cell reutilization, is also discussed. The performance is briefly investigated by simulation studies...|$|R
40|$|Digital movie systems offer great {{perspectives}} for multimedia applications. But {{the large}} amounts of data involved {{and the demand for}} <b>isochronous</b> <b>transmission</b> and playback are also great challenges for the designers {{of a new generation of}} file systems, database systems, operating systems, window systems, video encoder/decoder and networks. Today's research prototypes of digital movie systems suffer from severe performance bottlenecks, resulting in small movie windows, low frame rates or bad image quality (or all of these!). We consider the performance problem to be the most important problem with digital movie systems, preventing their widespread use today. In this paper we address performance issues of digital movie systems from a practical perspective. We report on performance experience gained with the XMovie system and new algorithms and protocols to overcome some of these bottlenecks...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to get insight into the use of Firewire as a field bus for {{real-time}} control. A characterization of Firewire’s asynchronous transmission has been made by testing the point-to-point roundtrip in a 3 -node Firewire network. The results show Firewire’s asynchronous transmission between 2 PC/ 104 stacks, using FCP (Functional Control Protocol) as the way of implementing, can transfer data in an average latency between 100 µs and 140 µs, depending on the data payload. The maximum variation in this latency is 20 µs. During this project, it is also found that while the payload is increased, the roundtrip time does not show a significant increase: it rises only around 40 µs from 1 byte payload to 449 bytes payload. So the bus is used most efficiently when the packet is fully loaded. To get a complete insight of Firewire, it is recommended to implement Firewire’s <b>isochronous</b> <b>transmission</b> and examine its applicability for real-time control also. And to use Firewire as a field bus in a real distributed control system with a plant is als...|$|E
