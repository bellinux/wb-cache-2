5|$|Tottenham, {{also of the}} Premier League, {{began by}} facing Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>at</b> White Hart Lane. After a goalless first half, Jorge Grant gave the {{visitors}} from the Championship {{the lead in the}} 65th minute. Substitute Ryan Mason equalised six minutes later, and Spurs eventually won 3–1 after two late goals from Roberto Soldado and another substitute, Harry Kane.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{species of}} birds {{are found in the}} <b>forest</b> <b>at</b> least part of the year. Bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Swainson’s hawk and the prairie falcon are birds of prey that are relatively common. Waterfowl such as Western grebe, Northern pintail, Great blue heron and Barrow’s goldeneye have stable populations and rare sightings of Trumpeter swans are reported. pheasant, ruffed grouse and wild turkey are widely distributed across the open sage lands. Harlequin duck and northern goshawk are generally rare but management plans were implemented to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{went into}} the match having lost their {{previous}} matches. Liverpool lost 1–0 to Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>at</b> the City Ground on 23 March 1996, where the winning goal was scored by midfielder Steve Stone. The defeat was Liverpool's first in 21 matches in all competitions. On the same day, Newcastle were beaten 2–0 by Arsenal—their third defeat in five league matches. Newcastle's loss allowed Manchester United to move three points ahead {{at the top of}} the league the following day after striker Eric Cantona scored the winning goal against Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation {{ranges from}} scrub <b>forests</b> <b>at</b> the foothills, up to {{ubiquitous}} expanses {{of tea and}} coffee estates, to spice (pepper, cardamom, cinnamon) plantations and finally to the dense evergreen <b>forests</b> <b>at</b> the top.|$|R
5000|$|The {{wilderness}} has vegetation {{typical of}} the southern Rocky Mountains with Ponderosa Pine and Pinyon <b>forests</b> <b>at</b> lower elevations, mixed conifers and aspens at the middle elevations, spruce-fir <b>forests</b> <b>at</b> higher elevations, and alpine tundra above treeline.|$|R
50|$|<b>Forests</b> <b>at</b> {{different}} latitudes and elevations form {{distinctly different}} ecozones: boreal forests near the poles, tropical forests near the equator and temperate <b>forests</b> <b>at</b> mid-latitudes. Higher elevation areas tend to support forests {{similar to those}} at higher latitudes, and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition.|$|R
5|$|Dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) of the timbers {{has enabled}} precise dating of the track, showing {{it was built}} in 3807 BC. This dating led to claims that the Sweet Track was the oldest roadway in the world, until the {{discovery}} in 2009 of a 6,000-year-old trackway built in 4100 BC, in Plumstead, near Belmarsh prison. Analysis of the Sweet Track's timbers has aided research into Neolithic Era dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the River Trent and a submerged <b>forest</b> <b>at</b> Stolford enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and their relationship with the climate of the period.|$|E
5|$|Edwin faced Penda and Cadwallon at the Battle of Hatfield in {{the autumn}} of 632 or 633 and was {{defeated}} and killed. For a time his body was (allegedly) hidden in Sherwood <b>Forest</b> <b>at</b> a location that became the village of Edwinstowe (trans. Edwin's resting place), his head being eventually buried at York {{and the rest of his}} body at Whitby. Of his two grown sons by Cwenburh of Mercia, Osfrith died at Hatfield, and Eadfrith was captured by Penda and killed some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Late at night, Hilarion mourns at Giselle's {{grave in}} the forest, but is frightened {{away by the}} arrival of the Wilis, the ghostly spirits of maidens betrayed by their lovers. The Wilis, led by their merciless queen Myrtha, haunt the <b>forest</b> <b>at</b> night to seek revenge on any man they encounter, forcing their victims to dance until they die of exhaustion.|$|E

5|$|Level Mountain can be ecologically {{divided into}} three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a largely {{destroyed}} Abies lasiocarpa forest on its flanks and a Picea glauca <b>forest</b> <b>at</b> its base. An extensive wild animal community once thrived {{in the area of}} Level Mountain. This included a wide range of animal species with caribou being the most abundant. Humans had arrived at Level Mountain by the early 1900s, followed by geological studies of the massif in the 1920s. This remote area of Cassiar Land District has a relatively dry environment compared to the Coast Mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 2015 {{he joined}} Championship club Bolton Wanderers on a month's loan to provide {{competition}} for Andy Lonergan after Ádám Bogdán was ruled {{out with an}} ankle injury picked up in training. On 21 February 2015 he made his Bolton debut {{as a substitute for}} the injured Lonergan as Wanderers lost 4–1 to Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>at</b> the City Ground. He played nine Championship games for Bolton before his loan expired on 4 April.|$|E
5|$|Since 2010, Leicester City's biggest away {{following}} {{was at an}} FA Cup {{match against}} Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>at</b> the City Ground in 2012; 8,000 travelling Foxes fans went to the match, with the scoreline finishing 0–0. At home matches, Leicester have gained notability for their atmosphere. Since the club moved to their current stadium in 2002 following the exit of Filbert Street, average home attendances have never dropped below 20,000, {{even when they were}} relegated to League One in 2008 {{for the first time in}} their history.|$|E

5|$|The climate, {{and as a}} result, {{the flora}} and fauna, of Pinkham Notch varies greatly with elevation. As {{elevations}} increase {{on the walls of}} the notch, climate and ecosystems change to those of increasingly northern occurrence. Biomes range from a low-elevation northern hardwood <b>forest</b> <b>at</b> the base of Mount Washington to alpine-Arctic vegetation near the summit comparable to vegetation found at the latitude of Labrador.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of M-110 {{was at a}} junction with US31 near Parkdale on {{the northern}} boundary {{of the city of}} Manistee. From there, the trunkline traveled north along Lake Shore Road near Lake Michigan. Along the way, the highway passed through the unincorporated community of Parkdale. The landscape contains fields as the roadway approaches the <b>forest</b> <b>at</b> Orchard Beach State Park. M-110 continues past the park and terminated at an intersection with Kott Road.|$|E
5|$|These {{highlands}} are {{renowned for}} their great natural beauty, with famous tourist destinations such as Nyanga, Troutbeck, Chimanimani, Vumba and Chirinda <b>Forest</b> <b>at</b> Mount Selinda.

50|$|In Panama, {{the species}} occurs in humid montane <b>forests</b> <b>at</b> {{elevations}} of 1100 - 1440 m above sea level. In Colombia {{it occurs in}} humid montane <b>forests</b> <b>at</b> elevations of about 900 m asl. It is a diurnal species often found along rocky sections of forest streams, but also further away from streams than other Colostethus species.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the steep}} {{elevation}} increase around the pass, the vegetation graduates from sub-tropical <b>forest</b> <b>at</b> its base, to a temperate region, to a {{wet and dry}} alpine climate, and finally to cold tundra desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the region has little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (Rhododendron anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. The meadows include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{introduces}} Scully to Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), an FBI {{specialist in}} ritualistic crime, shortly before Mulder's deceased body suddenly {{appears in a}} <b>forest</b> <b>at</b> night. Following Mulder's funeral, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is threatened by Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) that he must kill Scully's baby before it is born. Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley), a multiple abductee who disappeared {{on the same night}} as Mulder, is returned deceased but his dead body is resurrected and restored to full health. Mulder also returns from death, with Scully supervising his recovery. Fully rejuvenated, Mulder investigates several X-Files, against orders to do so, but soon gets fired, leaving Doggett in charge of the cases. Mulder continues to provide input in an unofficial capacity.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the sale}} of Jimmy Case, Kennedy began to become disillusioned with Liverpool, and was sent off twice {{in the space of}} a few weeks early in the 1981–82 season – the first red cards of his career. He made his final league {{appearance}} for the club on 5 December, when he scored in a 2–0 win over Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>at</b> the City Ground. His final cup game for the club came eight days later, in a 3–0 defeat to Brazilian side Flamengo in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium. He was replaced in the team by Ronnie Whelan. Liverpool went on to win the league title after finishing four points ahead of second-place Ipswich Town, and Kennedy's 15 league appearances in the first half of the campaign were enough to earn him another league championship medal. Sunderland attempted to sign him on loan in January 1982, but were denied by Liverpool, and Kennedy could not agree personal terms with manager Alan Durban so was not signed by Sunderland on a permanent transfer.|$|E

5|$|Germany: The {{species is}} known from two {{different}} areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western Baden-Württemberg. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels close to this site. The species is also known from the Kyffhäuser hill range of Thuringia in central Germany, an island of relatively warm habitat with some unusual wildlife. There, bats were caught near a spring in a karst landscape amid oak-dominated deciduous forest. The species was also recorded in deciduous <b>forest</b> <b>at</b> a former Soviet military training site in eastern Thuringia. M.alcathoe has also been recorded in the nearby states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, where it occurs in mixed deciduous forest. Many Saxony-Anhalt records are from near water. However, the species was also recorded {{in the center of}} the city of Chemnitz in Saxony.|$|E
5|$|He {{formed a}} {{productive}} forward partnership with Jackie Sewell in the 1948–49 campaign, and scored 23 goals in 40 league and cup appearances. County finished in mid-table despite scoring 102 goals, 15 more than champions Swansea. Stollery was sacked and upon Lawton's suggestion the club appointed Eric Houghton as manager after Lawton {{turned down the}} role as player-manager. Lawton and Sewell's understanding grew throughout the 1949–50 campaign, and Lawton finished as the division's top-scorer with 31 goals in 37 league games as County won promotion as champions, seven points ahead of second-placed Northampton Town. Promotion was secured with a 2–0 win over local rivals Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>at</b> Meadow Lane on 22 April.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the storm, the hardest hit {{residents}} faced food shortages and lacked access to clean water, in an area already facing ongoing food shortages. In response, the World Food Programme and other agencies of the United Nations created a program to feed about 350,000people in the region over three months, providing about 5,900tons of food. In the months after the storm, roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and potatoes {{to compensate for the}} damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition. In the subsequent years, about 40% of the <b>forest</b> <b>at</b> Manombo that regrew following Gretelle was of foreign nature, which threatened the original plants in the region.|$|E
