5|$|The launch had {{originally}} been scheduled <b>for</b> <b>August</b> 4, 1983, and was later rescheduled <b>for</b> <b>August</b> 20. The requirement to conduct testing with the TDRS system required a delay of ten days for the system to be ready, during which the stack remained on the launch pad. During the on-pad delay, Hurricane Barry (1983) hit the Florida coastline, making landfall {{just south of the}} Kennedy Space Center on the morning of August 25. The storm had only been identified two days earlier, and {{there was no time to}} roll Challenger back from the pad; the decision was made to secure the launch stack and ride out the storm.|$|E
5|$|According to Professor Picotti, who {{extensively}} {{researched the}} conclave {{and came to}} the conclusion that simony had occurred, no accounts of papal income and expenditure exist in the registers of Introitus et Exitus <b>for</b> <b>August</b> 1492, and debts from the Apostolic Camera to Cardinals Campofregoso, Domenico della Rovere, Sanseverino, and Orsini appeared soon afterwards. The Spannocchi bank, which housed much of Borja's wealth, was said to have nearly crashed after the conclave due to the velocity of transactions.|$|E
5|$|Completion of {{the ship}} was {{originally}} scheduled for March 1945, but it was rescheduled <b>for</b> <b>August</b> because of delays. Work continued until 16 March 1945, but it was ordered to halt when she was 80% complete {{to concentrate on the}} construction of small submarines needed to defend Japan against an American invasion. She was anchored in Ebisu Bay, near Sasebo, and surrendered there on 2 September {{along with the rest of}} the Japanese military. Ibuki was scrapped in Sasebo Naval Arsenal Drydock No. 7, 22 November 1946 – 1 August 1947.|$|E

Officials in Mississippi suggested that about 100,000people evacuate the coastal counties.

Two run-offs for special legislative elections scheduled <b>for</b> <b>August</b> 25 were postponed.|$|E

5|$|In December 1966, the AS-205 {{mission was}} canceled, since the {{validation}} of the CSM would be accomplished on the 14-day first flight, and AS-205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft. Its Saturn IB was allocated to the dual mission, now redesignated AS-205/208 or AS-258, planned <b>for</b> <b>August</b> 1967. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were promoted to the prime AS-258 crew, and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the Apollo 1 backup crew.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for {{the timing}} of the second bombing was {{delegated}} to Tibbets. Scheduled <b>for</b> <b>August</b> 11 against Kokura, the raid was moved earlier by two days to avoid a five-day period of bad weather forecast to begin on August 10. Three bomb pre-assemblies had been transported to Tinian, labeled F-31, F-32, and F-33 on their exteriors. On August 8, a dress rehearsal was conducted off Tinian by Sweeney using Bockscar as the drop airplane. Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was designated for the August 9 mission.|$|E

5|$|The Jamaican general {{election}} scheduled <b>for</b> <b>August</b> 27 was postponed until September 3, {{at which point}} they went ahead as planned. Opponents accused Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller of unnecessarily extending {{the state of emergency}} (and related curfews) to maintain her political control as predictions at the time suggested that she and her party would be ousted by the opposition. She and her party ultimately did lose the election, although Dean's light damage was not thought to have been a major factor.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} was located {{north of the}} Bahamas on August26, with a broad area of {{cyclonic}} turning located east of northern Florida. Atmospheric pressures were falling in the region, and gale force winds were recorded by 12:00UTC on August27. Based on the structure, {{it is estimated that}} the frontal low developed into a tropical storm by 18:00UTC that day. Ship reports in the region suggested peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). There was very dry air {{on the west side of}} the system, unusual <b>for</b> <b>August,</b> and the radius of maximum winds was around 115mi (185km), suggesting that the structure could have been akin to a subtropical cyclone. The storm continued to the northwest, making landfall very near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at 02:00UTC on August28. It spread rainfall across the Carolinas, later enhanced by Hurricane Able just days later, while cities reported winds of around 35mph (55km/h). The storm weakened over land and dissipated late on August28 over eastern Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Because Helm died so {{soon after}} taking office, a special {{election}} {{for the remainder of}} his term was set <b>for</b> <b>August</b> 1868. Democrats held a convention in Frankfort on February 22, 1868 and nominated Stevenson to finish out Helm's term. R. Tarvin Baker, formerly Stevenson's opponent in the election for lieutenant governor, was the choice of the Republicans. The Republicans faced many disadvantages, including the national party's persecution of President Johnson and a lack of local organization in many Kentucky counties. Despite Stevenson's shortcomings as a public speaker, he was elected in a landslide—115,560 to 26,605. At the time, it was the largest majority obtained by any candidate in a Kentucky election.|$|E
5|$|Beryl made {{landfall}} in a {{sparsely populated}} region of northeast Mexico, so no official reports of tropical storm force winds were recorded. Moisture from Beryl brought 0.8 in (20.1mm) {{of rain in}} Corpus Christi, Texas and 0.5in (13.7mm) in Brownsville, Texas in a 48-hour period between August 14 and August 16. The highest winds from these stations {{were no more than}} 28mph (46km/h). Cloud cover and rainfall resulted with cool high temperatures in southern Texas. Brownsville had a high temperature of 84˚F (28.9˚C) on August 15. This broke the record for the coolest maximum temperature in Brownsville <b>for</b> <b>August</b> 15; the previous record was 85˚F (29.4˚C) set in 1881.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled <b>for</b> <b>August</b> 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
