For Charles, the victory, which {{occurred}} within visual {{range of the}} Vienna ramparts, won him support from the hawks, or the pro-war party, in the Hofburg. [...] The Austrian victory at Aspern-Essling proved that Napoleon could be beaten. His force had been divided (Davout's corps had never made it over the Danube), and Napoleon had underestimated the Austrian strength of force and, more importantly, the tenacity the Austrians showed <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> that of Essling, when Klenau marched his force across open country under enemy fire. After Aspern-Essling, Napoleon revised his opinion of the Austrian soldier.|$|E
