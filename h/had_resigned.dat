5|$|Mubarak {{initially}} gave concessions, {{including the}} dissolution of parliament, agreeing to oversee a process of reform, and promising not to run for reelection in September2011. The protesters, however, were not satisfied and by February8 there were widespread calls for Mubarak's resignation. On the night of 10February, Mubarak gave a speech {{in which it was}} expected he would step down. Anger erupted when he stated plans to merely delegate some of his power.

5|$|The {{conversion}} of the ecclesiastic see to a dynastic realm ruled by a Protestant prince challenged the principle of ecclesiastical reservation, which was intended to preserve the ecclesiastical electorates from this very possibility. The difficulties of such a conversion had been faced before: Hermann von Wied, a previous prince-elector and archbishop in Cologne, had also converted to Protestantism, but <b>had</b> <b>resigned</b> from his office. Similarly, Gebhard's predecessor, Salentin von Isenburg-Grenzau had indeed married in 1577, but <b>had</b> <b>resigned</b> from the office prior to his marriage. Furthermore, {{the reason for his}} marriage—to perpetuate his house—differed considerably from Gebhard's. The House of Waldburg was in no apparent danger of extinction; Gebhard was one of six brothers, and only one other had chosen an ecclesiastical career. Unlike his abdicating predecessors, when Gebhard converted, he proclaimed the Reformation in the city of Cologne itself, angering Cologne's Catholic leadership and alienating the Catholic faction in the Cathedral Chapter. Furthermore, Gebhard adhered not to the teachings of Martin Luther, but to those of John Calvin, a form of religious observation not approved by the Augsburg conventions of 1555. Finally, he made no move to resign from his position as Prince-elector.|$|E

5|$|When he <b>had</b> <b>resigned</b> as {{governor}} in 1785, Hancock was again elected as a {{delegate to the}} Continental Congress, known as the Confederation Congress after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781. Congress had declined in importance after the Revolutionary War, and was frequently ignored by the states. Congress elected Hancock to serve as its president, but he never attended because of his poor health {{and because he was}} not interested. He sent Congress a letter of resignation in 1786.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Hawaii, Bush {{settled on the}} island of Kauai. In 1880, he was listed as the tax collector of Kawaihau, Kauai. In 1882, his older brother in his capacity as Minister of Interior appointed him Road Supervisor for the District of Hanalei to replace Christian Bertlemann, who <b>had</b> <b>resigned.</b> In 1887, Bush converted to Mormonism and was ordained an elder after two years; he took an active part in missionary work in the islands. He became the bishop of the Latter-day Saints ward in Kealia and hosted LDS historian Andrew Jenson during his 1895 visit to Kauai. In around 1894, Bush married a young girl at Lahaina, traveling to Kona after their marriage.|$|E

Murphy insisted that Evers <b>had</b> <b>resigned</b> as manager, which Evers denied. Evers insisted he was a free agent, but the league {{assigned}} him to the Braves. He signed a four-year contract at $10,000 per season ($ in current dollar terms), with a $20,000 signing bonus.|$|E

The Yildirim Army Group's German commander, General Erich von Falkenhayn, was replaced by the German General Otto Liman von Sanders. The commander of the Eighth Army, Kress von Kressenstein, was replaced by Djevad Pasha and Cemal commander of the Ottoman Army, appointed Cemal Kucjuk Pasha to command the Fourth Army.

5|$|Although Tyler's {{family was}} dear to him, during his {{political}} rise {{he was often}} {{away from home for}} extended periods. When Tyler chose not to seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 1821 because of illness, he nevertheless expressed concern as he anticipated the proper education his growing family. While in office it was difficult to practice law being away in Washington part of the year, and his plantation was also more profitable when Tyler was available to manage it himself. By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he <b>had</b> <b>resigned</b> himself to spending part of the year away from his family. Still, he sought to remain close to his children through letters.|$|E
5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier <b>had</b> <b>resigned</b> so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E

5|$|As the Browns {{climbed to}} the top of the NFL, {{speculation}} began to mount that Brown might return to the Buckeyes. Wes Felser <b>had</b> <b>resigned</b> as the team's coach, and Brown was seen as a possible replacement. But Brown had also alienated many Ohio State alumni by failing to return to the school after World War II and for signing away players including Groza before their college eligibility expired. He interviewed with the university's athletic board on January 27, 1951, but the board unanimously rejected Brown in favor of Woody Hayes, who was unanimously endorsed by the board of trustees.|$|E

The next season, he was the {{head coach of the}} freshman team, and in 1923 he was retained by new head coach Wallace Wade as the line coach once again through the end of his tenure at Alabama in 1930. During the Wade era, Crisp was an assistant coach for the 1925, 1926 and 1930 squads that each captured a share of the national championship.|$|E
5|$|Garrard was {{regarded}} as a strong chief executive who surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors. His friend, John Edwards, and his son, William Garrard, were both in the state senate and kept him abreast of issues there. He showed {{that he was willing to}} continue with Shelby's direction for the state by re-appointing Secretary of State James Brown, but the aging Brown retired in October 1796, only a few months into Garrard's term. Garrard then appointed Harry Toulmin, who <b>had</b> <b>resigned</b> the presidency of Transylvania Seminary in April due to opposition from the institution's more conservative trustees. Although he did not retain outgoing Attorney General John Breckinridge, who had sided with Logan in the disputed gubernatorial election, Garrard still frequently consulted with him on complex legal questions.|$|E
