The incidence of corporate income tax has {{been a matter of}} considerable ongoing controversy for decades.

5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of <b>federal</b> <b>taxes,</b> and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

5|$|Other {{accounts}} {{describe the}} indictment of 24 men for high treason. Most of the accused had eluded capture, so only ten men stood trial for treason in federal court. Of these, only Philip Wigle and John Mitchell were convicted. Wigle had beaten up a tax collector and burned his house; Mitchell was a simpleton who had been convinced by David Bradford to rob the U.S. mail. Both men were sentenced to death by hanging, but they were pardoned by President Washington. Pennsylvania state courts were more successful in prosecuting lawbreakers, securing numerous convictions for assault and rioting. While violent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, political opposition to the tax continued. Opponents of internal taxes rallied around the candidacy of Thomas Jefferson and helped him defeat President John Adams in the election of 1800.

40|$|The {{growing public}} {{dissatisfaction with the}} current <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> system and the ongoing {{national}} debt crisis are generating serious consideration of alternative consumption tax systems, especially the value-added tax (VAT). This study examines the distributional effects of the current <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> system and the alternative VAT system under both annual income and lifetime income approaches. The results support prior findings that under the annual income approach, the <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> system is progressive while the alternative VAT system (broad-based and narrow-based) is regressive. Under the lifetime income approach, both the <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> system and the narrow-based VAT systems (zero rating on necessities) are progressive, while the broad-based VAT system is still regressive. But the current <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> system is significantly more progressive than the narrow-based VAT systems by using bootstrap methodology. Furthermore, the study shows that the progressivity level of the current <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> system is not decreasing, instead significantly increasing between years 2005 and 2009. Also, when only considering households who paid payroll taxes (working families as defined in the paper), the current <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> system is significantly less progressive, even proportional for year 2005, under the annual income approach. progressive taxation; regressive taxation; annual income; lifetime income; bootstrap methodology; distribution effects; <b>federal</b> <b>tax</b> system; value-added tax; VAT; consumption taxes...|$|R
