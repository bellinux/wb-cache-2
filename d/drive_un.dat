To mitigate such problems, in most legal systems special facilities have been created, either by policymakers or by insurance companies, {{to deal with}} risks that {{are very difficult to}} insure or are even considered uninsurable on the commercial market. We (1) provide an overview of special schemes in several European countries, (2) examine the potential advantages of reducing the number of uninsured drivers and investigate the influence of the special schemes on the decision of individuals to <b>drive</b> (<b>un)</b> insured, (3) examine the consequences of these schemes for the incentives of drivers and (4) discuss the social costs of the special schemes...|$|E
50|$|From the start, the {{deployed}} tactical {{fighters and}} bombers to Japan and South Korea were effective. On 10 July a North Korean armored column was trapped at a bombed-out bridge near Pyongtaek. F-80 Shooting Stars, B-26 Invaders, and F-82 Twin Mustangs destroyed 117 trucks, 38 tanks, and seven half-tracks. This attack, along with others, gutted North Korea's single armored division. Had it survived, the North Korean force {{could have easily}} punched through the United Nations (UN) defensive line at Pusan and <b>driven</b> <b>UN</b> Command (UNC) forces into the sea.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1950, Chinese armies had <b>driven</b> <b>UN</b> {{forces out}} of North Korea and had begun to invade the South. The Sabres were forced to {{evacuate}} Kimpo and return to Japan which {{put them out of}} range of the action up at the Yalu. Even though the Yalu was now out of range, on 14 January, an F-86A detachment appeared at Taegu (K-37) to participate as fighter bombers to try to halt the Chinese advance. The F-86A was not very successful in the fighter-bomber role, being judged much less effective than slower types such as the F-80 and the F-84.|$|R

United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal.

5000|$|In early April 2008, riots {{broke out}} over {{the high cost of}} food; since 2007, prices for a number of {{essential}} foods, including rice, had risen by about 50%. As the riots continued, rioters attacked the presidential palace on April 8 but were <b>driven</b> away by <b>UN</b> soldiers. [...] On April 9, Préval called for calm; he said that high food prices were a problem around the world, but that the problem would not be solved by destroying stores, {{and he said that he}} had [...] "ordered Haitian police and UN soldiers to put an end to the looting". Despite demands for all taxes on food imports to be lifted, Préval said that he could not do so because the money was greatly needed; he pledged to increase food production in Haiti so that the country would not be so dependent on imports, but this fell short of what many protesters demanded. On April 12, the Senate voted to remove Prime Minister Alexis from office, and Préval announced that the price per 23 kg of rice would be reduced from $51 to $43. According to Préval, the rice would be subsidized with international aid, and the private sector was willing to reduce the price by $3. He also said that he was going to seek Venezuelan assistance in improving the economic situation.|$|R

40|$|The 2 d XY model {{exhibits}} {{an essential}} phase transition, which was predicted long ago [...] - by Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless (BKT) [...] - to be <b>driven</b> by the (<b>un)</b> binding of vortex [...] anti-vortex pairs. This transition {{has been confirmed}} for the standard lattice action, and for actions with distinct couplings, in agreement with universality. Here we study a highly unconventional formulation of this model, which belongs to the class of topological lattice actions: {{it does not have}} any couplings at all, but just a constraint for the relative angles between nearest neighbour spins. By means of dynamical boundary conditions we measure the helicity modulus Upsilon, which shows that this formulation performs a BKT phase transition as well. Its finite size effects are amazingly mild, in contrast to other lattice actions. This provides one of the most precise numerical confirmations ever of a BKT transition in this model. On the other hand, up to the lattice sizes that we explored, there are deviations from the spin wave approximation, for instance for the Binder cumulant U_ 4 and for the leading finite size correction to Upsilon. Finally we observe that the (un) binding mechanism follows the usual pattern, although free vortices do not require any energy in this formulation. Due to that observation, one should reconsider an aspect of the established picture, which estimates the critical temperature based on this energy requirement.

[...] According to Egeland, in his memoir A Billion Lives (2008), this [...] "stingy" [...] quote {{was taken out of}} context by the press as directed at tsunami relief, when in fact Egeland was addressing the long and ongoing <b>drive</b> by the <b>UN</b> for all OECD nations to contribute 0.7% of GNP to humanitarian efforts. Initial response by the White House to Egeland's quote, taken out of context by the press as a direct attack on the United States (which at the time had only donated $15 million), was very negative. However, Egeland subsequently clarified his remarks, and all was forgiven, although Egeland became the focus of a negative campaign online. However the [...] "stingy" [...] quote did in fact help increase the number of donations.

40|$|Purpose of paper: This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} civil society in {{the recent history of}} drug policy reform. It focuses on the UN drugs control system, which is designed to regulate certain ‘scheduled’ or listed substances internationally. It provides new light on recent reformist discourses and strategic agendas and how they related to the reality of UN politics and international relations. It questions the idea that the UN General Assembly Special Session on Drugs (UNGASS) in 2016 was a failure in terms of outcomes. It concludes by suggesting that the true outcomes of the UNGASS process will initially be obscured by the complexity of national-international drug policy dialectics, but may eventually prove more tangible and enduring than proposed formal systemic reforms. Design/methodology/approaches: The paper {{examines the}} historical role of civil society in the UN drug control system. It highlights that although civil society {{played a key role in}} the early formation of the system, this role diminished over time as the system professionalised. Meanwhile, as a new reformist movement emerged in the 1990 s challenging the status quo, the article traces this movement through the early UNGASS process, the decline of the reformist era and the eventual UNGASS outcomes. It concludes with a critical evaluation of civil society strategies and the relationship between idealistic strategies and the realities of national and international politics. Findings: Rather than a failure of outcomes, UNGASS represented a failure of assumptions, strategic vision and ultimately expectations on the part of reform optimists. These groups ultimately created and became captive to a goal of formal systemic reforms, or treaty revisions, underpinned by a dogmatic assumption of ‘the inescapable logic of reform necessity’. This logic argued that highlighting treaty ‘breaches’ and contradictions would be a sufficient condition to <b>drive</b> a formal <b>UN</b> system-wide re-evaluation of drug control. These failures of strategic assumptions and vision ultimately resulted in the sense of ‘failure’ of UNGASS 2016 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Spiralling {{troop levels}} and lost lives have echoes from Indochina, {{according}} to Simon Adams THE DEATH of Sergio Vieira de Mello, along with twenty {{other people in}} the United Nations building in Baghdad, has probably crippled what remaining hope still existed in Washington that the Iraq War really ended when President Bush proclaimed it over on 1 May. More than 60 US soldiers have been killed since then. And still the Americans keep desperately clutching at straws - Iraqi resistance will end with the death of Uday and Qusay, it will end when Saddam is captured, it will end when they wipe out the few remaining supporters of the old regime. It will not end. American soldiers will continue to die in Iraq as long as the US continues to occupy the country. They will die because they are seen as the most recent invaders of Iraq in an ancient history of conquest and resistance that stretches back across {{the rise and fall of}} several civilizations. They will die because they are viewed by many Iraqis as armed colonisers, not as liberators. They will die because the US has so far mightily failed to deliver on its pre-invasion promise to bring peace, prosperity and democracy to Iraq. One of the crucial things that the recent suicide bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad revealed is the difference of perception between ‘the West’ and ‘the rest’ regarding the United Nations. To the American, European and Australian governments the UN was an impediment to ‘regime change’ in Iraq. The UN Security Council refused to give its blessing to a unilateral strike by the United States, and leading UN figures were critical of the relentless US <b>drive</b> to war. <b>UN</b> arms inspectors publicly challenged US and British claims that Iraq possessed extensive ‘weapons of mass destruction’ (correctly, it has now been proven). As a result, the ‘blue helmets’ were regarded as libertarian hand-wringers in Washington, and as an obstacle to making the world a better place post- 9 / 11. Viewed from this perspective, the bombing of the UN’s Baghdad headquarters was an unprovoked terrorist attack on innocent humanitarian aid workers. In many Islamic countries, meanwhile, the UN is viewed as little more than an appendage of US foreign policy. It should be recalled that it was under the aegis of the UN that the first Gulf War against Iraq was fought in 1991, that the country was divided with its ‘No Fly Zones’ and Kurdish autonomous region, and that the sanctions, arms inspections and ‘Oil for Food’ programs were managed. To literally millions of people in the Arab world and beyond, the United Nations is not a neutral humanitarian organisation but a key participant in the US-led campaign against Iraq. For these people, the Baghdad suicide bombing was a blow struck against sanctions, humiliation and acquiescence to Western occupation of an Arab country. Writing at the time of the US-led invasion of Iraq, I argued that the ‘ghosts of Vietnam’ would haunt Washington. I was criticised by some readers for my defeatism. And yet, watching Donald Rumsfeld and his polished generals at a recent press conference fielding questions regarding a potential increase in the number of US ground forces in Iraq, one couldn’t help but think that the scenario was faintly reminiscent. Already people are wondering how many more US soldiers it will take before Iraq is pacified. During the Vietnam War, with its escalating enemy ‘body counts’ and US body-bags, the same issues of spiralling troop levels and lost lives were politically contentious and publicly divisive. Similarly, US popular support for the continuing occupation of Iraq is weakening, along with the morale of the soldiers. On July 16 Good Morning America broadcast a controversial interview with soldiers from the US Third Infantry Division. They spoke of their disappointment at becoming an occupation force. One called for Donald Rumsfeld’s resignation. Another, a Sergeant, said that US soldiers were ‘mentally and physically exhausted to the point that some hoped they would get wounded so they could go home’. Again, the ghosts of Vietnam. If George W. Bush is wondering about the future of his occupation of Iraq he only needs to look back to the Vietnam War. Only this time the resistance to US occupation is fed by nationalism and Islam rather than nationalism and communism. It scarcely matters how many more troops he sends - the resistance will not end because it is created by the humiliations and disappointments associated with occupation itself. This war, which was allegedly fought to prevent Iraq from becoming a terrorist training camp, has actually succeeded in turning it into one. Iraq is now a nation whose US-led administration is incapable of delivering essential services and where foreign Islamic extremists are able to infiltrate across borders to come kill ‘infidels’. It is a nation where legitimate domestic grievances can easily feed into illegitimate acts of terrorism, like the UN suicide bombing. President Bush’s statement that the attack on the UN was the work of ‘enemies of the civilized world’ does nothing to bridge the political gulf which now exists between so many Iraqi people and their US occupiers. Even under Saddam Hussein’s brutal dictatorship people still had some semblance of personal security (as long as they did not criticise the regime) and access to basic services (water, electricity, etc). Many Iraqis are now asking what’s the point of liberation from Saddam if they are to suffer rampant lawlessness, the collapse of essential services, and an occupying army which is rapidly coming to the conclusion (as in Vietnam) that every civilian is a potential enemy or suicide bomber. The resulting cycle of violence will only further poison both American and Iraqi hearts and minds. There was a moment when Baghdad first fell to US Marines that was broadcast live around the world. A small crowd of Iraqis were attempting to pull down a statue of Saddam Hussein and they were eventually assisted in doing so by a US tank crew. As the assembled Iraqis watched, and the world’s media zoomed in, one of the US soldiers clambered to the top of the statue and rubbed a US flag in the face of a bronze Saddam. After a few seconds the US flag was taken down and an Iraqi flag was diplomatically handed up to take its place. Arguably, the entire US occupation of Iraq was revealed - and lost - in that moment.
