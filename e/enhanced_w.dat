40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the review by Mubagwa and w xco-workers 1 {{on the effects of}} adenosine on the cardio-vascular system. In this review the diagnostic effects of adenosine in arrhythmias were discussed. We would like to present some additional, clinically important effects and adverse effects of adenosine, focusing on arrhythmias. 1. Adenosine can not only unmask pre-excitation but in some cases can abolish pre-excitation due to the direct inhibitory effect on decremental pathway conduction con-w xtaining AV node-like structure 2. 2. The therapeutic and diagnostic role of adenosine in wide-complex tachycardia was described in the review, but it may also be added that it could cause life-threatening conditions by precipitating atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-w xParkinson-White syndrome 3. 3. Adenosine is a very useful drug in distinguishing between ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias and among the different forms of supraventricular tachycardias. In addition, adenosine may provoke potentially dangerous arrhythmias by accelerating the heart rate due to <b>enhanced</b> <b>w</b> x. sympathetic tone in atrial flutter 4 Fig. 1. 4. Another possibly important clinical value of adeno-sine is help in distinguishing between ventricular extrasys-tole and parasystole by causing temporary SA or AV w x. block, or by terminating parasystolic activity 5 Fig. 2...|$|E

The rich spatial-temporal-semantic information of individuals embedded in these geo-annotated short messages provides exciting {{opportunity to develop}} many context-aware applications in ubiquitous computing environments. Example applications include contextual recommendation and contextual search. To obtain accurate recommenda-tions and most relevant search results, {{it is important to}} capture users ’ contextual information (e. g., time and location) and to understand users ’ topical interests and intentions. While time and location can be readily captured by smartphones, understanding user’s interests and intentions calls for effective methods in modeling user mobility behavior. Here, user mobility refers to who visits which place at what time for what activity. That is, user mobility behavior modeling must consider user (Who), spatial (Where), tem-poral (When), and activity (What) aspects. Unfortunately, no previous studies on user mobility behavior modeling have considered all of the four aspects jointly, which have complex interdependencies. In our pre-liminary study, we propose the first solution named W 4 (short for Who, Where, When, and What) to discover user mobility behavior from the four aspects.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} the gadopentetate dimeglum ine-enhanced MR features of recurrent m edulloblastom a. METHODS: The postsurgical gadopentetate dimeglumine- enhanced MR im-ages of 48 patients (206 head examinations) w ith prior resection of m edulloblastoma were retrospectively evaluated for enhancem ent {{in the brain}} parenchym a, meninges (dura, pia-arach-noid), and ventricles. RESULTS: Nineteen patients had recurrent tumor as determined by cl inica l course and positive imaging studies. Seventeen patients w ith recurrent disease had intracranial enhancement predominating in the pia-a rachnoid (63 %) or as a focal nodular bra in lesion (26 %). Three of these patients also had intraventricular m etastases. None of the clinically healthy patients had these findings. One patient had recurrent tumor presenting within the fourth ventricle. Only 3 of 8 intraventricular lesions observed in the 4 patients initially <b>enhanced</b> <b>w</b> ith gadopentetate dimeglumine. Another patient with recurrent disease had extensive sk eletal m etastases without involvement of the central nervous system.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand {{for the provision of}} cleaner safer water. In the last 5 years, the global water supply industry has spent > £ 57 billion on purification treatments. With {{an increasing}} population and energy costs, investment is predicted to increase over the next 10 years. Moreover, the industry is attempting to move towards more efficient and sustainable processes for the treatment {{of a wide range of}} contaminants. This project focuses on two novel sustainable technologies for remediation of common waste water contaminants: photoelectrocatalysis (pathogens and 2, 4 -DCP) and biosorption (heavy metals - HMs). The application of semiconductor photocatalysis in waste water treatment has been intensively investigated over the past decade. These studies mainly involve nano dimensional titanium dioxide as a photocatalyst using ultra-violet light as an energy source. However, practical applications are still limited by its poor visible light activity. In this study a photoelectrocatalytic batch cell (PECB) and photoelectrocatalytic fuel cell with a flow through configuration (PECFC) containing a visible light active tungsten trioxide (W 03) photocatalyst have been optimised and assessed for contaminant remediation. The potential for the PECB to disinfect a surrogate human pathogen, the lux-marked E. coli HE 101 pUCD 607, is investigated in Chapter 3. Disinfection experiments indicated that a > 99 % decrease in CFU/rnl occurred within 15 min. Although, this experiment showed that bacterial disinfection can be achieved by light alone (photolysis), the results indicated that disinfection rates were enhanced considerably by using the immobilised thin film W 03 photoelectrocatalyst. This alternative catalyst was further assessed in a flow through PECFC system. The combination of the visible light <b>enhanced</b> <b>W</b> 03 and the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology to remediation of 2, 4 -DCP in waste waters is investigated in Chapter 4. Degradation of 2, 4 -DCP was monitored over a period of 24 hrs. A total decrease of 74 % in 2, 4 -DCP concentration was observed, from which ea. 54 % were accountable to photoelectrocatalytic degradation processes and 20 % due to losses by adsorption or volatilisation. This decreased further to > 98 % removal over 6 days. A combination of chemical (HPLC) and bacterial biosensor (lux-marked Escherichia coli HB 101 pUCD 607) toxicity responses confirmed degradation of the parent compound with a concomitant increase in toxicity due to formation of intermediates, respectively. The reduction in 2, 4 -DCP concentration was observed to follow first order kinetics assuming a perfect flow model for the PECFC. However, more work is required to improve sustain ability of this technique as reduced efficiency of the PECFC occurred with prolonged use of the MEA (potentially due to occlusion of the catalytic sites), leading to loss of membrane conductivity. A major constraint with PECFC is the presence of eo-contaminants such as HMs that limit the efficiency of the MEA. Therefore, Chapter 5 assesses the efficacy and mechanisms for a sustainable biosorbent (distillery spent grain - DSG) to remove HMs from contaminated waters. A batch system was employed to determine the sorption of five different HMs from aqueous solution to DSG. Adsorption occurred up to a saturation point of 11. 8, 14. 1, 11. 2, 38. 1 and 14. 6 mg of Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn / g DSG, respectively. Adsorption for all HMs conformed to the Freundlich isotherm model, indicating heterogeneity of the DSG surface. The sorption of HM followed the pseudo- second-order kinetic model, indicating that the rate-controlling step in the process was chemical interaction between the HM ions and the functional groups on the DSG surface. An increased sorption efficiency of the DSG occurred with increased storage time as decomposition of the organic matrix resulted in increased number of active sorption sites. However, deterioration in the aesthetic quality of the DSG meant that a balance was required between optimum performance and ease of handling in the application of this material; an optimum storage period of 3 months has been proposed. The batch equilibrium sorption experiments estimated sorption under optimal conditions where there was no limiting rate of interaction between HM and DSG active sites. A leaching set up more reminiscent of a 'real life' in-stream remediation scenario is assessed in Chapter 6. Successful sorption of all five HMs was observed but this was significantly reduced compared to batch equlibia. Moreover, an assessment of the effect of competing ions (NaCl) on HM sorption efficiency of the DSG indicated that increasing the ionic strength of the HM solution generally resulted in a decrease in HM sorption capacity of DSG at lower initial HM concentrations but the opposite effect was observed at the highest initial HM concentration. Sequential extractions, carried out on the BM-laden DSG after leaching experiments indicated that all five HMs studied were strongly bound within the organic matrix of the DSG as < 10 % of the sorbed HMs were loosely bound on labile or exchangeable sites. A preliminary investigation of DSG as a potential sorbent for 2, 4 -DCP is described in Chapter 7. For two concentrations (16. 3 and 40. 75 mg/l), 66. 0 - 68. 9 - % and 39. 6 - 44. 3 % of the 2, 4 -DCP was removed in batch and leaching experimental set-ups, respectively. The W 03 photoelectrocatalytic fuel cells (batch PECB and continuous flow PECFC) and waste-derived biosorbent investigated during the course of this study are both promising emerging technologies for sustainable waste water treatment technologies. Moreover, there is potential for both technologies to act as complementary systems in a treatment train with the DSG deployed upstream of the PECFC (Chapter 8). This DSG- PECFC arrangement could potentially improve the efficiency of the PECFC to degrade organic contaminants, as the DSG will sorb both HM and organic pollutants, thereby reducing the contaminant concentration load stream entering the PECFC. This proposed set-up could in principle be adapted for application in-line of existing waste water treatment systems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|The quantum {{correction}} to the conductivity in disordered quantum wires with linear Rashba spin-orbit coupling is obtained. For quantum wires with spin-conserving boundary conditions, {{we find a}} crossover from weak anti- to weak localization as {{the wire}} width W is reduced using exact diagonalization of the Cooperon equation. This crossover {{is due to the}} dimensional dependence of the spin relaxation rate of conduction electrons, which becomes diminished, when the wire width is smaller than the bulk spin precession length $L_{SO}$. We thus confirm previous results for small wire width, $W/L_{SO}<= 1 $ [PRL 98, 176808 (2007) ], where only the transverse 0 -modes of the Cooperon equation had been taken into account. We find that spin helix solutions become stable for arbitrary ratios of linear Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling in narrow wires. For wider wires, the spin relaxation rate is found to be not monotonous as function of wire width: it becomes first <b>enhanced</b> for <b>W</b> on the order of the bulk $L_{SO}$ before it becomes diminished for smaller wire widths. In addition, we find that the spin relaxation is smallest {{at the edge of the}} wire for wide wires. The effect of the Zeeman coupling to the magnetic field perpendicular to the 2 D electron system is studied and found that it shifts the crossover from weak anti- to weak localization to larger wire widths $W_c$. When the transverse confinement potential of the quantum wire is smooth (adiabatic), the spin relaxation rate is found to be <b>enhanced</b> as <b>W</b> is reduced. We find that only a spin polarized state retains a finite spin relaxation rate in such narrow wires. Thus, we conclude that the injection of polarized spins into nonmagnetic quantum wires should be favorable in wires with smooth confinement potential. Finally, in wires with tubular shape, corresponding to transverse periodic boundary conditions, we find no reduction of the spin relaxation rate. Comment: 20 pages, 16 figure...|$|R

W nucleus formation before the film growth is also enhanced and the nuclei on the Si surface which has a lower hydrogen concentration are of a higher density and a smaller size.

W is required for heterochromatin condensation, demonstrating that H 2 A. W plays critical roles in heterochromatin organization. Similarities in conserved motifs between H 2 A. W and another H 2 A variant in metazoans suggest that plants and animals share common mechanisms for heterochromatin condensation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTransglycosylation (TG) {{activity}} {{of a family}} GH 18 chitinase from the cycad, Cycas revoluta, (CrChiA) was modulated by removing or introducing a tryptophan side chain. The removal from subsite + 3 through mutation of Trp 168 to alanine suppressed TG activity, while introduction into subsite + 1 through mutation of Gly 77 to tryptophan (CrChiA-G 77 <b>W)</b> <b>enhanced</b> TG activity. The crystal structures of an inactive double mutant of CrChiA (CrChiA-G 77 W/E 119 Q) {{with one or two}} N-acetylglucosamine residues occupying subsites + 1 or + 1 /+ 2, respectively, revealed that the Trp 77 side chain was oriented toward + 1 GlcNAc to be stacked with it face-to-face, but rotated away from subsite + 1 in the absence of GlcNAc at the subsite. Aromatic residues in the aglycon-binding site are key determinants of TG {{activity of}} GH 18 chitinases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Penn <b>West</b> <b>enhanced</b> oil {{recovery}} pilot project {{is located in}} the Pembina Oil Field in west-central Alberta, Canada, with CO 2 injection into the 20 m thick Cretaceous Cardium Formation at a depth of 1650 m below surface. Time-lapse processing of the surface seismic monitoring data collected between March 2005 and March 2007 yielded no significant changes in P-wave seismic amplitudes or traveltimes between monitor and baseline surveys after ∼ 40, 000 t of CO 2 had been injected. A small amplitude change in the Cardium Formation and deeper events were detected by a fixed geophone array in an observation well. We conclude that partial or full saturation of the reservoir pore space was restricted to the most permeable sandstone members of the Cardium Formation. The seismic data indicates that no leakage of CO 2 has occurred into shallow aquifers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Historically, western equine {{encephalomyelitis}} virus (WEEV) caused large equine and human epidemics in the Americas from Canada into Argentina. Despite recent <b>enhanced</b> surveillance for <b>West</b> Nile virus, {{there have been few}} reports of equine or human cases and little documented enzootic activity of WEEV. During the past three years, WEEV has been active again in California, but without human or equine cases. In the current study, we compared host and vector competence of representative WEEV isolates made during each decade over the past 60 years using white-crowned sparrows, house sparrows, and Culex tarsalis Coquillett as representative hosts. Results indicated limited time-related change in virulence among WEEV strains in birds and little difference in vector competence in Cx. tarsalis. Although temporal and spatial genetic changes have been documented, these seem to present limited phenotypic change in host competence and cannot explain the absence of equine and human cases...|$|R
40|$|The static {{electromagnetic}} {{properties of}} the W boson, Δκ and Δ Q, are calculated in the T-parity and non T-parity littlest Higgs model (LHM) including terms up {{to the order of}} (v/f) ^ 4, with v the standard model (SM) vacuum expectation value and f the scale of the global symmetry breaking. There are contributions from the virtual effects of the new heavy particles and also from the new corrections to the SM vertices, which depend on the mixing parameter c and decrease quickly as f increases. Depending on the value of c, the partial contributions to Δκ and Δ Q can add constructively or destructively. The terms of the order of (v/f) ^ 4 are subdominant but they can add constructively and can <b>enhance</b> the <b>W</b> form factors for f < 1 TeV. In general the size of the W form factors is very suppressed in the LHM without T-parity as the constraints on the scale f from electroweak precision measurements are very tight. The LHM with T-parity has no such constraints and it allows for values of W form factors similar to those found in other weakly coupled SM extensions, though they are out of the expected sensitivity of future measurements at the LHC. We also discuss the possibility that there is some enhancement due to the interactions arising from the strongly interacting ultraviolet completion of the LHM. Comment: 19 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
