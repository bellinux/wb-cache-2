40|$|We {{evaluated}} <b>ergasilosis</b> seasonal dynamics at two reservoirs (Hubenov, Korycany) in the Morava River Basin (Czech Republic). Samples of {{fish were}} obtained at monthly intervals between April and October 2014. In total, 189 fish of 11 species were caught using electrofishing and seine nets. Highest overall values for E. sieboldi infection intensity and abundance were recorded at Hubenov in June and September. Prevalence ranged between 80 and 100 %. Two highest peaks of infection intensity and abundance were recorded at Korycany in May {{and the second}} around September and October, prevalence ranging between 33 and 100 %. As the nauplius and copepod stages of arthropods form part of the zooplankton assemblage, they will be found at highest numbers in reservoirs with low predatory pressure, i. e. where predatory fish suppress zooplanktonophagic fish species...|$|E
