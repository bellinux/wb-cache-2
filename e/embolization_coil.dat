Methods An objective, quantitative image analysis protocol was developed to determine the volumes of aneurysms and coil masses during initial and follow-up visits from 3 D rotational angio-grams. The population consisted of 15 recurrence and 12 non-recurrence control aneu-rysms initially completely coiled at a single center. An investigator sensitivity study was performed to assess the objectivity of the methods. Paired Wilcoxon tests (p< 0. 05, one-tailed) were performed to assess for aneurysm and coil growth.

40|$|Objective : We {{evaluated}} {{the result of}} the endovascular treatment of paraclinoid ICA aneurysm with Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC). Methods : Since October 1997 to July 2005, Twenty-four cases of paraclinoid ICA aneurysms were treated by endosaccular GDC embolization. The age ranged from 26 to 70 years, with a mean of 51 years, which consisted of 22 women and 2 men. The aneurysm size ranged from 2. 5 to 16 mm, with an average of 6. 3 mm. Results : Angiographic results immediately after the treatment were complete occlusion (CO) in 6 patients, neck remnant (NR) in 3 patients, and partial occlusion (PO) in 15 patients. Fifteen PO cases improved to CO in 10 cases and NR in 1 case at the 6 months follow-up angiography. Two large aneurysms had resulted in recurrence at the follow-up and 1 patient needed additional coil <b>embolization.</b> <b>Coil</b> migration to parent artery and TIA occurred in one patient as a complication. Conclusions : We can treat all 24 cases by endovascular treatment and it is thought to be a less invasive and efficient treatment for this location. The neck of paraclinoid ICA aneurysm is frequently and relatively wide, and balloon assisted technique is frequently necessary for the successful treatment. Silent thrombo-embolic events related to the endovascular procedure were evaluated by high signal intensity (HSI) on Diffusion weighted image (DWI-MRI), 48 hours after the procedure.

40|$|PurposeTo {{describe}} {{our experiences}} with the treatment of visceral artery aneurysms (VAA) by transcatheter <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> and to propose indications for treating VAA by this method. MethodsWe treated 22 patients with VAA by coil embolization; 9 had splenic-, 7 renal-, 4 pancreaticoduodenal arcade-, and 2 proper hepatic artery aneurysms. All nine splenic artery aneurysms patients presented with chronic hepatitis-C; four had hepatocellular carcinoma. Of the seven renal artery aneurysms patients, four were hypertensive and three had rheumatoid arthritis. Both pancreaticoduodenal arcade artery aneurysms patients manifested severe stenosis of the celiac axis. Our transcatheter <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> procedure includes <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> and coil-packing of the aneurysmal sac, preserving the native arterial circulation. ResultsTranscatheter <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> with aneurysm packing was technically successful in 16 (72. 7 %) of the 22 patients and the native arterial circulation was preserved. Postprocedure angiograms confirmed complete disappearance of the VAA. In four of the nine splenic artery aneurysm patients, the native arterial circulation was not preserved. In one renal artery aneurysm patient, stenosis at the aneurysmal neck necessitated placement of a stent before transcatheter <b>coil</b> <b>embolization.</b> Magnetic resonance angiographs obtained during the follow-up period (mean 27 months) demonstrated complete thrombosis of the VAA in all 22 patients.

40|$|Background Transcatheter renal artery {{embolization}} is {{an effective}} and minimally invasive treatment option for acute renal bleeding. Early post-interventional complications include groin hematoma, incomplete <b>embolization,</b> <b>coil</b> misplacement and coil migration. Late complications are rare and mostly related to coil migration. Case presentation A 22 -year-old woman {{with a history of}} recurrent stone disease and a lumbal meningomyelocele underwent bilateral open pyelolithotomy for bilateral staghorn calculi. Post-operatively, acute hemorrhage of the left kidney occurred and selective arterial coil embolization of a lower pole interlobular renal artery was performed twice. Four years after this intervention the patient presented with a new 15. 4 mm stone in the lower calyx of the left kidney. After two extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy treatments disintegration of the stone was not detectable. Therefore, flexible ureterorenoscopy was performed and revealed that the stone was adherent to a partially intraluminal metal coil in the lower renal calyx. The intracalyceal part of the coil and the adherent stone were successfully removed using the holmium laser. Conclusion Therapy-resistant nephrolithiasis was caused by a migrated metal coil, which was placed four years earlier for the treatment of acute post-operative renal bleeding. Renal coils in close vicinity to the renal pelvis can migrate into the collecting system and trigger renal stone formation. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy seems to be inefficient for these composite stones. Identification of these rare stones is possible during retrograde intrarenal surgery. It also enables immediate stone disintegration and removal of the stone fragments and the intraluminal coil material...|$|E

Methods 					Eleven commonly used interventional, catheter-based devices including stents, septal occluders, vascular plugs and embolization coils made from either stainless steel or nitinol were evaluated ex-vivo at both 1. 5 T and 3 T. Pulse sequences and protocols commonly used for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) were evaluated, including 3 D high-resolution MR angiography (MRA), time-resolved MRA, 2 D balanced-SSFP cine and 2 D phase-contrast gradient echo imaging (GRE). We defined the signal void amplification factor (F) as the ratio of signal void dimension to true device dimension. F 1 and F 2 were measured in the long axis and short axes respectively of the device. We defined F 3 as the maximum extent of the off-resonance dark band artifact on SSFP measured in the B 0 direction. The effects of field strength, sequence type, orientation, flip angle and phase encode direction were tested. Clinical CMR images in 3 patients with various indwelling devices were reviewed for correlation with the in-vitro findings. 				 				 					 						Results 					F 1 and F 2 were higher (p< 0. 05) at 3 T than at 1. 5 T for all sequences except 3 D-MRA. Stainless steel devices produced greater off-resonance artifact on SSFP compared to nitinol devices (p< 0. 05). Artifacts were most severe with the stainless steel Flipper detachable <b>embolization</b> <b>coil</b> (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN), with F 1 and F 2 10 times greater than with stainless steel stents. The orientation of stents changed the size of off-resonance artifacts by up to two fold. Sequence type did influence the size of signal void or off-resonance artifact (p< 0. 05). Varying the flip angle and phase encode direction did not affect image artifact. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					Stainless steel embolization coils render large zones of anatomy uninterpretable, consistent with predictions based on ex-vivo testing. Most other commonly used devices produce only mild artifact ex-vivo and are compatible with diagnostic quality in-vivo studies. Knowledge of ex-vivo device behavior can help predict the technical success or failure of CMR scans and may preempt the performance of costly, futile studies...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: When {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms {{and common}} iliac artery (CIA) aneurysms undergo concomitant endovascular repair, endograft limb extension into the {{external iliac artery}} is often necessary. Usually, the internal iliac artery (IIA) is coil embolized {{in such a case}} to prevent endoleak. It has been our practice to coil embolize the IIA only in cases where there is not adequate stent graft seal in the CIA immediately proximal to the IIA origin (effectively sealing the entire IIA origin). In this study, we evaluated the outcomes of this approach. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 204 consecutive endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center from 1996 to 2001. Computed tomographic angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction was the primary preoperative imaging modality, and the decision to cover the IIA without concomitant coil embolization was based before surgery on the presence of adequate graft oversizing (≥ 10 % to 15 %) in the most distal 5 mm of CIA and 15 mm of proximal external iliac artery, respectively. Results: The IIA was occluded 33 times in 31 patients. In 22 cases (67 %), the IIA was covered without coil embolization (COVER group). The remaining 11 patients (33 %) with inadequate graft oversizing in the CIA underwent IIA coil <b>embolization</b> (<b>COIL</b> group). The follow-up periods for the COVER and COIL groups were 19 ± 2 months and 10 ± 3 months, respectively. All operations in both groups were technically successful without evidence of endoleak at completion angiography. No endoleaks, graft migrations, or aneurysm enlargements were associated with the covered or coiled IIAs during the follow-up period. No clinical sequelae were seen in the COVER group, with the exception of buttock claudication in six patients (27 %) that resolved completely in five patients. In the COIL group, five patients (45 %) had buttock claudication. In addition, one case of buttock necrosis and one case of ischemic neuropathy occurred in the COIL group. Conclusion: Covering the IIA without coiling effectively excluded the CIA aneurysm in every case and was associated with a low incidence rate of complications compared with coil embolization. With detailed preoperative imaging and patient selection, IIA coil embolization may not be necessary in as many as two thirds of patients who need IIA occlusion.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{compare the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of coil <b>embolization</b> (<b>COIL)</b> to Amplatzer vascular plug embolization (PLUG) to achieve internal iliac artery (IIA) occlusion prior to endovascular aortiliac aneurysm repair (EVAR). MethodsData from consecutive patients who underwent IIA embolization prior to EVAR over a 6 -year period (2004 - 2010) were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, treatment modalities, and outcomes were compared. ResultsFrom January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2010, a total of 53 patients underwent percutaneous embolization of 57 IIAs prior to EVAR. Twenty-nine IIAs underwent COIL and 28 IIAs underwent PLUG embolization. Patient demographics and risk factors were similar between the two groups. Patients underwent repair for aneurysmal dilation of the infrarenal aorta {{in conjunction with the}} common or internal iliac arteries (n = 35, 62 %) or isolated iliac artery aneurysms (n = 19, 38 %). A significantly greater number of embolization devices were used in the COIL group (5. 8 ± 3. 8 vs 1. 1 ± 0. 4; P <. 0001). Patients undergoing PLUG embolization demonstrated significantly shorter procedure times (118. 4 ± 64. 7 minutes vs 72. 6 ± 22. 4 minutes; P =. 008) and fluoroscopy times (32. 6 ± 14. 6 vs 14. 4 ± 8. 6 minutes; P =. 002). However, radiation dose between the groups did not differ (COIL: 470, 192. 7 ± 190, 606. 6 vs PLUG: 300, 972. 2 ± 191, 815. 7 mGycm 2; P =. 10). Overall periprocedural morbidity did not differ between the groups (COIL: 11 % vs PLUG: 6 %; P = 1. 0), and there were no perioperative mortalities or severe complications. Nontarget embolization occurred in two COIL and no PLUG cases (COIL: 6. 9 % vs PLUG: 0 %; P =. 49). Patient-reported buttock claudication at 1 month was 17. 2 % for COIL and 39. 3 % for PLUG patients (P =. 08). At last follow-up, persistent buttock claudication was reported in 13. 8 % of COIL and in 14. 3 % of PLUG embolizations (P = 1. 0). There {{was no significant difference in}} charges for the embolization material, operating room, or overall hospital charges (COIL: 44, 720 ± 19, 153 vs 37, 367 ± 10, 915; P =. 22). Lastly, zero endoleaks in the COIL group and three in the PLUG group (P =. 40) were detected on the most recent follow-up computed tomography imaging. No endoleak was related to the site of IIA embolization. ConclusionsCOIL and PLUG embolization both provide effective IIA embolization with low complication rates when used for EVAR. Buttock claudication did occur in approximately one-third of patients but resolved in half of those affected. PLUG embolization took significantly less time to perform and required decreased fluoroscopy times. Based on outcomes and cost-analysis, COIL and PLUG embolization are equivalent methods to achieve IIA occlusion during EVAR...|$|E

Nur eine Läsion hatte Score 8 und war benigne. Der ppv für die Indikation zur Biopsie betrug 31 %. Einziges hinsichtlich Dignität statistisch signifikantes Einzelkriterium war die Läsionsform. Bei der MRT-gesteuerten Spiralmarkierung betrug die technische Erfolgsrate 98 % und die Rate der Markierungen mit maximal 10 mm Abstand zur Läsion 98 %. Schlussfolgerungen: Nur MRT-sichtbare Mammaläsionen können mittels Göttinger Score standardisiert beurteilt und ihre Dignität zur Entscheidung über das weitere Procedere abgeschätzt werden. Wegen o. g. Malignomraten wird folgende Übertragung des Göttinger Scores in die BI-RADS-Kategorien vorgeschlagen: Score 3 = BI-RADS 3; Score 4 und 5 = BI-RADS 4 a; Score 6 bis 8 = BI-RADS 4 b; keine Einstufung in BI-RADS-Kategorie 5. Score 3 -Befunde können mittels MRT verlaufskontrolliert werden, dagegen sollten alle Läsionen ab Score 4 histologisch untersucht werden. Bei präparateradiografisch dokumentierter Spiralentfernung nach exakter Läsionsmarkierung und offener Biopsie kann bei benignem histologischen Korrelat für die MRT-Läsion auf eine routinemäßige MRT-Kontrolle auch bei Befunden >Score 4 verzichtet werden. Objectives: The {{objectives}} of these study were {{to evaluate the}} evidence of the Göttinger Score at only MRI-detectable breast lesions, create an algorithm für patient managemant and assess the practicability and accuracy of MRI-guided localization with coil and following open biopsy. Materials and methods: From 1. August 2002 to 31. December 2005, n= 211 MRI-guided localization procedures with modified <b>embolization</b> <b>coil</b> were performed at the Breast-Centre at Tübingen University. Complete data for retrospective study were available for n= 100 cases. Statistical analysis was performed for criteria of the Göttinger Score and its translation into corresponding BI-RADS categories with histopathologic correlation. Results: The rate of malignancy for lesions with score 4 was 18. 2 %, for score 5 32. 2 % and for score 6 and 7 each 50 %. All lesions with score 3 were benign. There was only one lesion with score 8 and it was benign. Overall ppv of indication for biopsy is 31 %. The lesion form was the only single criterion significantly correlate with histology. The MRI-guided lesion localization with coil was successful in 98 % of cases. The maximum distance of 10 mm between marker and lesion was achieved in 98 % of successful procedures. Conclusions: Using the Göttinger Score it is possible to assess breast lesion detectable only on MRI and to estimate the probability of malignancy. So the core can be helpful for the decision about further processing. Based on rates of malignancy found in this study the following translation of the Göttinger Score into BI-RADS classification is suggested: score 3 = BI-RADS 3; score 4 and 5 = BI-RADS 4 a; score 6 to 8 = BI-RADS 4 b; no using of the BI-RADS category 5. All lesions with score 3 can be followed up by MRI only, but histological examination is necessary for all lesions with a score from 4 to 8. MRI for follow up of lesions with a score from 4 to 8 after open biopsy with benign histopathological finding is not necessary if lesion localisation with coil was exact and if the extraction of the coil is documented by radiography of specimen...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{presence}} of a cerebral aneurysm remnant after surgical clipping {{is associated with a}} risk of regrowth or rupture. For these re-curred aneurysms, <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> can be considered as a treatment option. We retrospectively reviewed cases of ruptured or regrown aneur-ysms after clipping treated by endovascular <b>coil</b> <b>embolization.</b> Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with ruptured or recurred aneurysm after clipping, who underwent <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> between January 1995 and December 2013. We evaluated clinical information and the outcomes of these cases. Results: Eight patients were treated by endovascular <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> af-ter surgical clipping. Six aneurysms were located in the anterior communi-cating artery, one in the posterior communicating artery, and one in the middle cerebral artery bifurcation. All patients were initially treated by sur-gical clipping because of a ruptured aneurysm. Aneurysm recurrence at the initial clipping site was detected in all cases. The median interval from initial to second presentation was 42 months. In four patients, aneurysms were detected before rupture and the four remaining patients presented with recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage. All patients were treated by <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> and showed successful occlusion of aneur-ysms without complications. Conclusion: Endovascular <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> can be a safe and successful treatment option for recurred aneurysms after clipping. J Cerebrovasc Endovasc Neurosurg...|$|R

40|$|After <b>coil</b> <b>embolization,</b> recanalization in {{cerebral}} aneurysms adversely influences long-term prognosis. Proliferation of endothelial cells on {{the coil}} surface {{may reduce the}} incidence of recanalization and further improve outcomes after <b>coil</b> <b>embolization.</b> We aimed to map the expression of proliferating tissue over the aneurysmal orifice and define the temporal profile of tissue growth in a swine experimental aneurysm model. We compared the outcomes after spontaneous thrombosis with those of <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> using histological and morphological techniques. In aneurysms that we not coiled, spontaneous thrombosis was observed, and weak, easily detachable proliferating tissue was evident in the aneurysmal neck. In contrast, in the <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> group, histological analysis showed endothelial-like cells lining the aneurysmal opening. Moreover, immunohistochemical and morphological analysis suggested that these cells were immature endothelial cells. Our results indicated the existence of endothelial cell proliferation 1 week after <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> and showed immature endothelial cells in septal tissue between the systemic circulation and the aneurysm. These findings suggest that endothelial cells are lead to and proliferate in the former aneurysmal orifice. This is the first examination t...|$|R

40|$|Background: Follow-up imaging after <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> of visceral artery aneurysms is {{important}} for detecting recanalization. However, CT examination is susceptible to coil artifacts, which sometimes {{makes it difficult to}} assess recanalization. We report 2 cases where recanalization was successfully visualized using time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography after <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> of visceral artery aneurysms (one case of right internal iliac artery aneurysm and one case of splenic artery aneurysm). Repeat <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> was successfully performed. Case Report: Case 1. An 80 -year-old male patient with right internal iliac artery (IIA) aneurysm underwent <b>coil</b> <b>embolization.</b> Aneurysm was located at the bifurcation of the right IIA and therefore, after making a femorofemoral bypass, the distal part of the right IIA, aneurysm and the common iliac artery were embolized with a coil. One year later, the size of the aneurysm seemed to have increased on CT. However, the details were not determined because of metal artifacts. Thus, timeresolved MRA was performed and showed minute vascular flow inside the aneurysm. Angiography was subsequently performed and blood flow inside the aneurysm was visualized similar to the findings in time-resolved MRA. <b>Coil</b> <b>embolization</b> was performed once more and vascular flow inside the aneurysm disappeared. Case 2. A 36 -year-old male patient with a splenic artery aneurysm underwent coil packing with preservation of splenic artery patency. Four years later, coil compaction was suspected in a CT scan, but CT could not evaluate recanalization because of severe metal artifacts. Angiography was subsequently performed, showing recanalization of the aneurysm as did the time-resolved MRA. Therefore, <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> of the aneurysm and splenic artery was performed again. Conclusions: Follow-up imaging after <b>coil</b> <b>embolization</b> of visceral artery aneurysms {{is important}} for detecting recanalization. However, it is sometimes difficult to assess recanalization with CT because of artifacts caused by metal. In our cases, recanalization of aneurysms was clearly shown by timeresolved MRA and re-embolization was successfully performed. In conclusion, time-resolved MRA appears to be useful in assessment of recanalization of visceral artery aneurysms after <b>coil</b> <b>embolization...</b>|$|R
