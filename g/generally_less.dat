5|$|After the Second World War, {{the use of}} radar made {{camouflage}} <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> effective. However, camouflage {{may have}} helped to protect US warships from Vietnamese shore batteries using optical rangefinders.|$|E
5|$|Critics have {{disagreed}} {{on which}} poem {{in the group}} is strongest. Frost at Midnight is usually held in high esteem, while Fears in Solitude is <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> well regarded.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, radar made {{camouflage}} <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> effective, though coastal {{boats are}} sometimes painted like land vehicles. Aircraft camouflage too {{came to be}} seen as less important because of radar, and aircraft of different air forces, such as the Royal Air Force's Lightning, were often uncamouflaged.|$|E

5|$|Immature red wattlebirds are <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> flamboyant. Juveniles {{have much}} less {{prominent}} wattles, brown irises, a pale crown {{and much less}} yellow on the belly. They moult into first immature plumage {{within a few months}} of leaving the nest. First immature birds are more similar to adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, wattles larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.|$|E
5|$|Lead metal {{has several}} useful {{mechanical}} properties, including high density, low melting point, ductility, and relative inertness. Many metals {{are superior to}} lead {{in some of these}} aspects but are <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> common and more difficult to extract from parent ores. Lead's toxicity has led to its phasing out for some uses.|$|E
5|$|The Kuiper belt was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the source of the Solar System's ecliptic comets. However, studies of the region since 1992 have shown that the orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and that ecliptic comets originate from the scattered disc, where orbits are <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> stable.|$|E

50|$|The {{climate is}} <b>generally</b> mild, <b>less</b> {{so in the}} higher Harz regions to the south-west.|$|R
50|$|The Tomorrow People (1960), a {{psychological}} mystery, is <b>generally</b> thought <b>less</b> emotionally powerful than her earlier work.|$|R
5|$|The film is {{localized}} {{to accommodate}} international audiences: in the Japanese version, for example, Riley is disgusted by green bell peppers, {{rather than by}} broccoli (the only topping offered by the local pizzeria), to {{reflect the fact that}} broccoli is <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> undesirable to Japanese children.|$|E
5|$|The left-wing preoccupations {{were also}} an {{important}} feature of Libertatea. Its opening manifesto called for a large-scale social reform, which it claimed {{was more important to}} Romanians than any National Liberal project to recover Transylvania from its Austro-Hungarian overlord. It enlisted contributions, <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> political than those at Seara, from literary figures such as Vinea, Demostene Botez, I. Dragoslav, Adrian Maniu and I. C. Vissarion.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{oxidation}} state for sodium is +1. It is <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> reactive than potassium and more reactive than lithium. Sodium metal is highly reducing, {{with the standard}} reduction potential for the Na+/Na couple being −2.71 volts, though potassium and lithium have even more negative potentials.|$|E
50|$|While special {{elections}} <b>generally</b> see <b>less</b> voter participation, {{turnout was}} 35.3%, higher than 2014's midterm between Marino and Hall-Long.|$|R
25|$|Throughout history two-handed swords have <b>generally</b> been <b>less</b> {{common than}} their one-handed counterparts, one {{exception}} being their common use in Japan.|$|R
50|$|Fu {{continued}} to be written after {{the demise of the}} Song dynasty, but these later fu have <b>generally</b> received <b>less</b> scholarly attention.|$|R
5|$|Tippett {{maintained}} his pacifist beliefs, while becoming <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> public in expressing them, and from 1959 {{served as president}} of the Peace Pledge Union. In 1977 he made a rare political statement when, opening a PPU exhibition at St Martin-in-the-Fields, he attacked President Carter's plans to develop a neutron bomb.|$|E
5|$|Trained {{cockatoos}} {{are sometimes}} seen in bird shows in zoos. They are <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> motivated by food than other birds; some may more respond to petting or praise than food. Cockatoos {{can often be}} taught to wear a parrot harness, enabling their owners to take them outdoors. Cockatoos {{have been used in}} animal-assisted therapy, generally in nursing homes.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, the {{universal}} adoption of radar made traditional camouflage <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> effective, {{and led to}} development of stealth ships, a form of radar camouflage. However, camouflage may have helped United States warships avoid hits from Vietnamese shore batteries which used optical rangefinders. Some U. S. Navy PTF boats were camouflaged experimentally in 1975 with green overall, broken up by patterns of gray and black. USS Freedom, a littoral combat ship, is however {{said to be the}} first U.S. Navy ship to have camouflage reminiscent of that used in the World Wars.|$|E
50|$|In Afghanistan, a woman <b>generally</b> has <b>less</b> {{than five}} years of {{education}} and will probably not live to be 45 years old.|$|R
5000|$|Designing a {{centralised}} database is <b>generally</b> much <b>less</b> {{complex than}} designing a distributed database, as distributed database systems {{are based on}} a hierarchical structure.|$|R
60|$|That {{names are}} far more useful than things, being more <b>generally</b> understood, <b>less</b> liable to objections, of greater circulation, besides occupying much less room.|$|R
5|$|Calhoun was not openly religious. He {{was raised}} Calvinist but was {{attracted}} to Southern varieties of Unitarianism {{of the sort that}} attracted Jefferson. Southern Unitarianism was <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> organized than the variety popular in New England. He was generally not outspoken about his religious beliefs. After his marriage, Calhoun and his wife attended the Episcopal Church, of which she was a member. In 1821 he became a founding member of All Souls Unitarian Church in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{integrating}} is easiest with two rats of young age, <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> {{than six months}} old. The process of integrating is most difficult with two or more adult male rats, as adult males are {{the least likely to}} accept new cage mates, especially after an alpha has been established. Unless there is an issue integrating rats together, owners should always keep them in a group of at least three, as rats live in packs and a pack starts with three animals.|$|E
5|$|Trollope {{expected}} his {{depiction of}} a fallen woman to be controversial, and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it. But the anticipated controversy never materialised, and contemporary reviewers tended to ignore that subplot, focussing instead on the courtship in the novel. Reviews were <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> than positive; many reviewers and readers who had acquired a taste for Trollope from the 1850s60s Barchester novels were unhappy about the darker tone of later novels such as this one.|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{moonlight}} photography often uses exposures {{of several}} minutes. Digital cameras <b>generally</b> have <b>less</b> reciprocity failure, but do show image noise in low light.|$|R
5000|$|Production <b>generally</b> {{suffered}} <b>less</b> {{from direct}} hits on factories, which were rare, but from attacks on suppliers and consequent shortages {{of material and}} construction tools.|$|R
30|$|The {{plasma cell}} or disseminated form of Castleman disease may show hepatosplenomegaly, ascites and lymphadenopathy, which <b>generally</b> shows <b>less</b> {{enhancement}} {{than in the}} localised form [23].|$|R
5|$|Cockatoos are {{recognisable}} by the showy crests and curved bills. Their plumage is <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> colourful {{than that}} of other parrots, being mainly white, grey or black and often with coloured features in the crest, cheeks or tail. On average they are larger than other parrots; however, the cockatiel, the smallest cockatoo species, is a small bird. The phylogenetic position of the cockatiel remains unresolved, other than that {{it is one of}} the earliest offshoots of the cockatoo lineage. The remaining species are in two main clades. The five large black coloured cockatoos of the genus Calyptorhynchus form one branch. The second and larger branch is formed by the genus Cacatua, comprising 11 species of white-plumaged cockatoos and four monotypic genera that branched off earlier; namely the pink and white Major Mitchell's cockatoo, the pink and grey galah, the mainly grey gang-gang cockatoo and the large black-plumaged palm cockatoo.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include obesity and smoking, both of which are more {{prevalent}} in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E
5|$|In Polistes exclamans, equal {{sex ratio}} is {{obtained}} when only 46.3% of investment {{is devoted to}} females as female wasps are 1.16 times larger than male wasps. In a study done by Strassmann, {{it was found that}} sexual investment is female biased, especially during years of high predation and when nests are <b>generally</b> <b>less</b> successful. It has been seen that in Polistes exclamans, females are produced before males. This female investment bias may result from the ability of females to become either a worker or a reproductive (this is more adaptive for the nest as it gives the nest increased flexibility compared to that of males and may be important for overall nest success) or because females provide the colony with greater nest defense. Furthermore, even when the original queen is no longer present, the sexual investment is still biased towards females, which is not expected given the genetic implications of a new queen.|$|E
50|$|Some {{players will}} use a two-handed {{forehand}} when they need a sure-fire in. The constricted movement will <b>generally</b> generate <b>less</b> power, but more racket head control.|$|R
50|$|A typical adult has a blood {{volume of}} {{approximately}} 5 liters, with females <b>generally</b> having <b>less</b> blood volume than males. Blood volume is {{regulated by the}} kidneys.|$|R
50|$|Betterment for Business is a turnkey 401(k) {{platform}} {{aimed at}} mid-market employers. It {{uses the same}} underlying investment strategy and <b>generally</b> costs <b>less</b> than most traditional 401(k) plans.|$|R
