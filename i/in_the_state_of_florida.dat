5|$|Starfish are in {{some cases}} taken from their habitat and sold to {{tourists}} as souvenirs, ornaments, curios or for display in aquariums. In particular, Oreaster reticulatus, with its easily accessed habitat and conspicuous coloration, is widely collected in the Caribbean. In the early to mid 20th century, this species was common along the coasts of the West Indies, but collection and trade have severely reduced its numbers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida,</b> O. reticulatus is listed as endangered and its collection is illegal. Nevertheless, it is still sold throughout its range and beyond. A similar phenomenon exists in the Indo-Pacific for species such as Protoreaster nodosus.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the 1928 Okeechobee {{hurricane}} in Florida included at least 2,500fatalities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida,</b> making this the second deadliest tropical cyclone {{in the history of}} the United States, behind only the 1900 Galveston hurricane. The hurricane originated from a tropical depression that formed near Dakar, Senegal, on September6. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean, the cyclone struck the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas as a powerful hurricane. Early on September17, the storm made landfall near West Palm Beach, Florida, as a Category4 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Thereafter, it moved further inland across the Southeastern United States and became extratropical over North Carolina on September20, before the remnants lost their identity over Ontario on September21.|$|E

It was the most intense tropical cyclone to affect the United States during the season, with a minimum central pressure of 954 mbar (28.18 inHg) at landfall. The cyclone originated from an easterly wave near the Leeward Islands, and it rapidly intensified to a hurricane near the Bahamas. It strengthened to a major hurricane northwest of Nassau, Bahamas, and it struck West Palm Beach, Florida as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds near 130mph (210km/h) and peak gusts near 160mph (260km/h) above the surface. It turned north over the Florida peninsula, and it transitioned to an extratropical low pressure area over New England. The tropical cyclone inflicted $52,000,000 (1949 USD) in damage, most of which was incurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Florida.</b> It was the costliest storm of the season.|$|E
