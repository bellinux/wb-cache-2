40|$|This {{research}} examines {{differences in}} earnings structure between Communist and post-Communist Czech Republic and Slovakia using {{four sets of}} similar micro-data. It presents hypotheses about how earnings dispersion returns <b>to</b> <b>education</b> and returns <b>to</b> experience will change across regimes and tests those hypotheses using earnings equations. From approximately 2. 5 percent in 1984, the return <b>to</b> <b>education</b> increased <b>to</b> approximately 5 percent by 1993. During that period, returns to experience fell. Though women have higher returns <b>to</b> <b>education,</b> returns for men increased more across regime change. Those with academic secondary education experienced a particularly large earnings increase. Earnings structure changes appear larger in the Czech Republic than in Slovakia.

50|$|In Europe, Article 2 of {{the first}} Protocol of 20 March 1952 to the European Convention on Human Rights states that the right <b>to</b> <b>education</b> is {{recognized}} as a human right and is understood to establish an entitlement <b>to</b> <b>education.</b> According <b>to</b> the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right <b>to</b> <b>education</b> includes the right to free, compulsory primary education for all, an obligation <b>to</b> develop secondary <b>education</b> accessible <b>to</b> all in particular by the progressive introduction of free secondary education, {{as well as an}} obligation to develop equitable access <b>to</b> higher <b>education</b> in particular by the progressive introduction of free higher <b>education.</b> The right <b>to</b> <b>education</b> also includes a responsibility <b>to</b> provide basic <b>education</b> for individuals who have not completed primary <b>education.</b> In addition <b>to</b> these access <b>to</b> <b>education</b> provisions, the right <b>to</b> <b>education</b> encompasses also the obligation to eliminate discrimination {{at all levels of the}} educational system, to set minimum standards and to improve quality. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has applied this norm for example in the Belgian linguistic case.
