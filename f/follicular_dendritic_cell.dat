40|$|BACKGROUND: Follicular lymphoma, the {{neoplastic}} {{counterpart of}} germinal center B cells, typically recapitulates a follicular architecture. Several observations {{point to the}} crucial role of the cellular microenvironment in the development and/or progression of follicular lymphoma cells in vivo. The aim of our study was to characterize the spontaneous apoptosis of follicular lymphoma cells in vitro, and the modulation of this apoptosis by <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells.</b> DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a cell line derived from <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> to model the functional interactions of these cells and lymphoma cells in co-culture. Follicular lymphoma cells were isolated from tissue biopsies. Apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry and apoptotic pathways were investigated by western blotting. RESULTS: The spontaneous apoptosis of follicular lymphoma cells in vitro involves the activation of caspases- 3 and - 8 but not of caspase- 9, occurs despite persistent high levels of BCL- 2 and MCL- 1, and is associated with down-regulation of c-FLIP(L). Spontaneous apoptosis of follicular lymphoma cells is partially prevented by co-culture with the <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells,</b> which prevents activation of caspase- 8, caspase- 3 and induces an upregulation of c-FLIP(L). Using neutralizing antibodies, we demonstrated that interactions involving CD 54 (ICAM- 1), CD 106 (VCAM- 1) and CD 40 are implicated in this biological process. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> constitute a useful tool to study the functional interactions between follicular lymphoma <b>cells</b> and <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in these protective interactions {{may lead to the}} identification of therapeutic agents that might suppress the survival and growth of follicular lymphoma cells.

Centroblasts form following exposure to <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-15, 8D6, and BAFF and stimulation from helper T cell interactions between their CD40 ligand and the B cell CD40 induces centroblasts to express activation-induced cytidine deaminase, leading to somatic hypermutation.|$|E
50|$|In humans, FDC-SP {{was first}} found within <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> {{isolates}} from the tonsil, and later {{was found to}} be specifically expressed within the periodontal ligament. FDC-SP expression can be induced in human FDC-like cell lines by exposure to tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Exposure of human peripheral blood cells to LPS can also result in FDC-SP expression, but TNF exposure does not cause FDC-SP expression and similarly LPS exposure does not cause expression within FDC-like cell lines. Expression in mouse splenocytes can be induced by LPS in a similar manner to that of human peripheral blood cells.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> sarcoma {{discovery}} information on the effect of chemotherapy and radiation on it was nonexistent. The best physicians could do was try existing chemotherapeutic agents. With no evidence of the clinical benefit of chemotherapy, many of the first cases were treated solely with complete resection and/or radiation. However, 12 of 31 patients who had surgery alone as primary treatment relapsed. Of the patients who received surgery and radiation 2 of 8 relapsed. It became apparent that better treatment options were necessary. Being so similar to lymphomas, physicians began using a common leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma chemotherapy regimen on FDCS patients: CHOP.|$|E

40|$|CD 137 (also {{known as}} 4 - 1 BB and TNFRSF 9) {{is a member}} of the tumor {{necrosis}} factor receptor superfamily. Originally identified as a costimulatory molecule expressed by activated T cells and NK cells, CD 137 is also expressed by <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells,</b> monocytes, mast cells, granulocytes, and endothelial cells. Anti-CD 137 immunotherapy has recently shown promise as a treatment for solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies in preclinical models. We defined the expression of CD 137 protein in both normal and neoplastic hematolymphoid tissue. CD 137 protein is expressed by <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> in the germinal center and scattered paracortical T cells, but not by normal germinal-center B cells, bone marrow progenitor cells, or maturing thymocytes. CD 137 protein is expressed by a select group of hematolymphoid tumors, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, T-cell and NK/T-cell lymphomas, and <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> neoplasms.

50|$|<b>Follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> sarcoma (FDCS) is an {{extremely}} rare neoplasm. While the existence of FDC tumors was predicted by Lennert in 1978, the tumor wasn’t fully recognized as its own cancer until 1986 after characterization by Monda et al. It accounts for only 0.4% of soft tissue sarcomas, but has significant recurrent and metastatic potential and is considered an intermediate grade malignancy. The major hurdle in treating FDCS has been misdiagnosis. It is a newly characterized cancer, and because of its similarities in presentation and markers to lymphoma, both Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin subtypes, diagnosis of FDCS can be difficult. With recent advancements in cancer biology better diagnostic assays and chemotherapeutic agents {{have been made to}} more accurately diagnose and treat FDCS.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{receiving}} an unidentified stimulus, the maturing B cells (centroblasts) migrate {{from the dark}} zone to the light zone and start to express their antibody on the cell surface and at this stage {{are referred to as}} centrocytes. The centrocytes {{are in a state of}} activated apoptosis and compete for survival signals derived from <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> and TFH cells. This rescue process, known as germinal center selection, is believed to be dependent on the affinity of their surface antibody to the antigen. Such that, a B cell that has successfully gained mutations that confer a higher affinity surface antibody towards antigen gains a survival advantage over lower affinity B cell clones and those that have gained deleterious mutations. Cyclic re-entry into the dark zone once again as centroblasts allows a chance for otherwise non-selected B cell mutants to gain more mutations in order to improve affinity towards antigen. Interactions with T cells are also believed to prevent the generation of autoreactive germinal center B cells.|$|E
50|$|Desmosomes are {{intercellular}} junctions that tightly link adjacent cells. Desmoplakin is an obligate {{component of}} functional desmosomes that anchors intermediate filaments to desmosomal plaques. In cardiomyocytes, desmoplakin forms desmosomal plaques with the intermediate filament desmin, whereas in endothelial cells cytokeratin type intermediate filaments are recruited, and vimentin in arachnoid and <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> types. Both types of intermediate filaments attach in a lateral fashion to desmoplakin {{to form the}} plaque. In cardiac muscle, desmoplakin is localized to desmosomes in intercalated discs. Desmoplakin isoform DPI is highly expressed and is thought {{to play a role}} in both the assembly and stabilization of desmosomes; its role is critical, as desmoplakin knockout mice display embryonic lethality. In mice overexpressing a C-terminal mutated desmoplakin protein, desmoplakin binding to desmin is disrupted in cardiac muscle and hearts display abnormal intercalated disc formation and structure. Much has been learned regarding desmoplakin function from mutations in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, where mutations in specific binding domains alter desmoplakin binding to plakoglobin or desmin and result in cell death and dysfunction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Angioimmunoblastic T-cell {{lymphoma}} {{is characterized}} by a paracortical proliferation of medium to large neoplastic T cells, often with clear cytoplasm, in a background of arborizing high endo-thelial venules, many surrounded by <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> (FDCs). IHC staining may be applied to highlight these extrafollicular FDCs, traditionally using CD 21, or CD 23. Several alternative FDC markers have been described, including CNA. 42, cystatin A/acid cysteine pro-teinase inhibitor (ACPI, involved in antigen presentation), and fascin (an actin binding protein). The authors stained a collection of 45 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas with CD 21, CD 23, CNA. 42, cystatin A, and fascin for direct comparison of FDC staining char-acteristics in this setting. CD 21 highlighted the expected <b>dendritic</b> network of <b>cell</b> processes, within residual follicles and outside of follicles, often adjacent to proliferating vessels. CD 23 exhibited similar staining quality but was less sensitive than CD 21. CNA. 42 showed only diffuse weak labeling of FDCs. Cystatin A stained the cytoplasm of <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> within and outside of follicles; however, staining was often not sharply localized to <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> pro-cesses, and scoring was further complicated by reactivity with other cell types in over half of the cases. Likewise, fascin stained a variety of cell types, including strong staining of interdigitating dendritic-like cells, moderate staining of endothelial cells, and only weak staining of <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> within and outside of follicles. Thus, CD 21 remains the most reliable marker of <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cells</b> in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma...|$|R

40|$|Injection of heat-killed Escherichia coli into rats {{results in}} massive loss of IgM + ve, IgD - ve B {{cells from the}} {{marginal}} zones of their spleen within 4 hr.

40|$|Objective: <b>Follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> sarcoma is a {{rare disease}} with a {{non-specific}} and insidious presentation that is further complicated by difficult diagnostic and therapeutic assessment. Methods: The database PubMed was searched for reports of <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> sarcoma between 1986 (first case published) and 2012. All of the articles presenting informations regarding one or more cases of <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> sarcoma {{of the head and}} neck region, in patients less than 18 years of age, were included. The reference lists for pertinent reports were also scanned to ensure that all relevant literature was included. Results: We present a case of a 14 year-old girl, with a 2 -month history of a right-sided level II neck mass. After a carefull radiologic evaluation the mass was resected combined with a right selective neck dissection. Histology with immunohistochemical staining was positive for <b>follicular</b> <b>dendritic</b> <b>cell</b> sarcoma. No recurrence was seen after 31 months follow-up.
