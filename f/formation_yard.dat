40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} a {{specific}} hub location problem, which arose from a strategic decision problem for network design of wagonload traffic in German railway logistics. The strategic objective {{is to determine the}} location, size, and function of <b>formation</b> <b>yards,</b> and the connections between them. These strategic decisions define the network structure and hence, the costs and efficiency of the network. In this paper, we extend a formulation developed earlier. We also do some preprocessing tests to reduce the complexity. The resulting IPs are implemented in GAMS and solved with CPLEX for several test data sets...|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} {{equipped}} with a single siding goods yard on the down side of the <b>formation.</b> The <b>yard</b> was {{to the north of}} the passenger station, with no goods shed or fixed loading facilities.

50|$|The {{marshalling}} yard takes up {{an area of}} 280 hectares, has a length of 7,000 metres and a maximum width of 700 metres. When it opened it had a total track length of 300 kilometres and there were six signal boxes, 825 sets of points, 100 home, 115 distant and 688 shunting signals. As a two-sided shunting facility, Maschen has two train <b>formation</b> <b>yards.</b> The north-south system has a set of 48 departure sidings {{and a set of}} 16 reception sidings; the south-north system consists of a set of 64 departure sidings and a set of 17 reception sidings. Both systems are supplemented by storage and marshalling sidings. In addition, there is an eight-road main repair shop for the repair of goods wagons and an engine shed for the maintenance of electric and diesel-driven goods train locomotives with a two-road inspection hall and numerous open-air storage sidings.Two signal boxes are responsible for the yard, one for each system. Separate signal boxes that had been built for the marshalling sidings were closed again in 1983.|$|R

But Larry Brown, Harvard's senior quarterback, set a Harvard standard for touchdown passes in The Game. Neil Rose, Ryan Fitzpatrick, a future NFL starting quarterback, and Chris Pizzotti would each toss four touchdowns versus Yale in 2001, 2003, and 2007, respectively, matching Brown.|$|R

The Detroit Free Press wrote: [...] "The individual work of Sparks in his open field running and all-around generalship easily stood out as the brightest feature to the somewhat disappointing tussle." [...] The Michigan Alumnus wrote of Sparks: [...] "e looks like the real find of the season. He was the hardest man on the team to stop, and his dodging runs from punt <b>formation</b> gained many <b>yards</b> for Michigan." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of dipnoan, Chirodipterus potteri, is described, based {{on a series of}} {{juvenile}} tooth plates with attached bone from two localities in New South Wales, Australia. Most of the material comes From the Upper Devonian (Fammenian) Coffee Hill Member of the Catombal Range, west of Orange. and some from the Upper Devonian (Frasnian) Paling <b>Yard</b> <b>Formation,</b> at Gap Creek. The new taxon provides additional insights into the fine structure and the development of chirodipterid tooth plates, and includes some anomalous specimens. Tooth plates are based on a form of interdenteonal dentine with irregular denteons containing circumpulpar dentine, surrounded by mantle dentine and enamel. and ankylosed to the underlying jaw bones. Analysis of the material indicates that the tooth plates of chirodipterid lungfish are not members of the dentine plated clade, but have tooth plates that are based, as in most other dipnoan species, on the fusion of radiating rows of initially separate cusps in the young juvenile to form a crushing or grinding structure in the adult...|$|R
5000|$|When Reiter {{took over}} as Wesleyan's {{football}} coach in 1903, the forward pass was not permitted under college football rules. However, when the rules changed for the 1906 season, Reiter was ready to introduce his overhand spiral forward pass technique. Reiter contended that the first modern forward pass in college football was thrown by Sammy Moore to Irwin van Tassel on October 3, 1906, in a game between Wesleyan and Yale in 1906. Van Tassel later described the historic play to the United Press:"I was the right halfback, and on this <b>formation</b> played one <b>yard</b> back of our right tackle. The quarterback, Sam Moore, took the ball from center and faded eight or 10 yards back of our line. Our two ends angled down the field toward the sidelines as a decoy, and I slipped through the strong side of our line straight down the center and past the secondary defense. The pass worked perfectly. However, the quarterback coming up fast nailed me as I caught it. This brought the ball well into Yale territory, about the 20-yard line." ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} mathematical optimization for the multistage {{train formation}} problem, {{which at the}} core is the allocation of classification <b>yard</b> <b>formation</b> tracks to outbound freight trains, subject to realistic constraints on train scheduling, arrival and departure timeliness, and track capacity. The problem formulation allows the temporary storage of freight cars on a dedicated mixed-usage track. This real-world practice increases {{the capacity of the}} yard, measured in the number of simultaneous trains that can be successfully handled. Two optimization models are proposed and evaluated for the multistage train formation problem. The first one is a column-based integer programming model, which is solved using branch and price. The second model is a simplified reformulation of the first model as an arc-indexed integer linear program, which has the same linear programming relaxation as the first model. Both models are adapted for rolling horizon planning and evaluated on a five-month historical data set from the largest freight yard in Scandinavia. From this data set, 784 instances of different types and lengths, spanning from two to five days, were created. In contrast to earlier approaches, all instances could be solved to optimality using the two models. In the experiments, the arc-indexed model proved optimality on average twice as fast as the column-based model for the independent instances, and three times faster for the rolling horizon instances. For the arc-indexed model, the average solution time for a reasonably sized planning horizon of three days was 16 seconds. Regardless of size, no instance took longer than eight minutes to be solved. The results indicate that optimization approaches are suitable alternatives for scheduling and track allocation at classification yards...|$|R
5000|$|Another coach {{sometimes}} {{credited with}} popularizing the overhead spiral pass in 1906 is former Princeton All-American [...] "Bosey" [...] Reiter. Reiter {{claimed to have}} invented the overhead spiral pass while playing professional football as a player-coach for Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics of the original National Football League (1902). [...] While playing for the Athletics, Reiter was a teammate of Hawley Pierce, a former star for the Carlisle Indian School. Pierce, a Native American, taught Reiter to throw an underhand spiral pass, but Reiter had short arms {{and was unable to}} throw for distance from an underhand delivery. Accordingly, Reiter began working on an overhand spiral pass. [...] Reiter recalled trying to imitate the motion of a baseball catcher throwing to second base. After practice and experimentation, Reiter [...] "discovered he could get greater distance and accuracy throwing that way." [...] In 1906, Reiter was the head coach at Wesleyan University. In the opening game of the 1906 season against Yale, Reiter's quarterback Sammy Moore completed a forward pass to Irvin van Tassell for a thirty-yard gain. The New York Times called it [...] "the prettiest play of the day", as Wesleyan's quarterback [...] "deftly passed the ball past the whole Yale team to his mate Van Tassel."

50|$|Michigan's first {{touchdown}} {{came on a}} 29-yard {{pass from}} Harry Kipke to Irwin Uteritz. Uteritz injured his ankle on the play and was replaced at quarterback by Ray Knode. Paul Goebel place-kicked for the extra point. On Michigan's second scoring drive, Kipke accounted for most of Michigan's 56 yards, and Knode ran for the touchdown from the one-yard line. Goebel again place-kicked for the extra point. At {{the start of the}} second quarter, Michigan drove 53 yards for its third touchdown. The drive featured runs of 16 and 18 yards by Kipke around the ends and a 17-yard gain on a pass from Kipke to Jackson Keefer. Franklin Cappon carried the ball across the goal line for the touchdown. Goebel missed the extra point, and Michigan led, 20-0. Later in the quarter, Michigan drove 66 yards for its fourth touchdown.

50|$|Task Force 116 {{focused on}} instituting a curfew on all {{waterways}} {{for the first}} months of action, hence devoting much of its time to searching Vietnamese sampans and junks on the river. During this time the sailors and PBRs stuck to strict rules of engagement that permitted the boats to use deadly force only after fired upon by the enemy, but as time went on tactics on both sides changed. Not only did the VC adapt to frequent daytime patrols by conducting a majority of their operations at night to use the cover of dark, but they also attempted to blend in with heavy commercial traffic during peak daylight hours. Correspondingly, the communist forces began to hide contraband, including weapons and supplies, beneath false-bottomed floors and on the underside of their sampans. Patrolling of the Rung Sat Special Zone was particularly difficult for Task Group 116.2, due to the large open areas on the South China Sea as well as the maze-like meanderings of the Long Tau River through the sector. These factors granted the VC with ample opportunities to plant mines in hopes of obstructing traffic. The mining of the Panamanian ship SS Eastern Mariner, along with the attempted mining of two other ships in Nha Be, on 26 May 1966 merely underlined the substandard security in the area during the early operations of Game Warden. The tactics employed by Task Force 116 followed a general framework during Operation Game Warden, however several adaptations were instituted to properly deal with constantly changing enemy strategies as well the treacherous terrain. Patrol boats would frequently pair up and travel in a column <b>formation</b> about 400-600 <b>yards</b> apart, a distance close enough to cover one another but far enough away to increase the effectiveness of their radars while also minimizing the threat of an effective riverside ambush. Similar to most patrolling missions, the PBRs would approach suspicious watercraft from an angle that maximized the number of weapons the boat could bear on the potential target. Searches were carried out as close to midstream as possible in order to minimize the PBRs vulnerability to surprise attacks from the riverbanks. Once the nighttime curfew was in effect, encounters occurring at night were more likely than not hostile. Task Force 116 developed numerous effective tactics throughout Operation Game Warden including the silent or drifting patrol, which called for the PBRs to speed into their patrol zone upstream, cut the engines, and allow the current to carry them through their assigned sections of river in hopes of catching the enemy off guard. Unlike other units, much of Task Force 116’s development came from trial and error since it had no predecessor to draw intelligence or tactics from. For example, LSTs were primarily positioned in the South China Sea near the river mouths, however this proved impractical because the choppy sea in those locations was too rough for the small PBRs. Therefore, to accommodate the patrol boats the LST’s were moved further up river, eventually as far as the Bassac-Mekong crossover (less than 20 nautical miles from the Cambodian border).|$|R
