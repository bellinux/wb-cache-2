5|$|In Islam, doves and {{the pigeon}} family {{in general are}} {{respected}} and favoured because they {{are believed to have}} assisted the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad, in distracting his enemies outside the cave of Thaw'r, in the great Hijra. A pair of pigeons had built a nest and laid eggs at once, and a spider had woven cobwebs, which in the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> the night made the fugitives believe that Muhammad could not be in that cave.|$|E
5|$|The Agni Purana {{mentions}} only 4 hells. Some texts mention 7 hells: Put ("childless", for the childless), Avichi ("waveless", {{for those}} waiting for reincarnation), Samhata ("abandoned", for evil beings), Tamisra ("darkness", where <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> hells begin), Rijisha ("expelled", where torments of hell begin), Kudmala ("leprous", the worst hell {{for those who}} are going to be reincarnated) and Kakola ("black poison", the bottomless pit, {{for those who are}} eternally condemned to hell and have no chance of reincarnation).|$|E
5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed that man is a liar and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> error.|$|E

5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> night are all factors which can reduce the {{visibility}} of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Garretson, set out of Guánica {{with his}} men towards Yauco with the {{intention}} of capturing the Yauco rail terminus that ran between that town and the City of Ponce, the largest city in the southern region of the island. Garretson and his men arrived in the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> night and was informed by his scouts of the possibility of a hostile situation at the Hacienda Desideria. He ordered the Illinois company and two companies (companies L and M) of the 6th Massachusetts to occupy a small hill on his right that overlooked the hacienda.|$|E
5|$|The {{screening}} {{forces of}} each side blundered {{into each other}} during the early morning <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> 16 December in heavy weather.

A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper's ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty's forces.|$|E

5|$|The visible {{scars from}} the impacts {{could be seen}} on Jupiter for many months. They were {{extremely}} prominent, and observers described them as even more easily visible than the Great Red Spot. A search of historical observations revealed that the spots were probably the most prominent transient features ever seen on the planet, and that although the Great Red Spot is notable for its striking color, no spots of the size and <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> those caused by the SL9 impacts have ever been recorded before.|$|E
5|$|U-28s fifth war patrol {{took place}} from 11 August to 17 September 1940 {{and was one}} of Kuhnke's most productive. In August, she sank two ships for 5,500tons. On 10 September, U-28 found and tracked Convoy OA 210. In the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> early morning on 11 September, U-28 {{attacked}} the convoy and claimed two large freighters (13,000tons each) sunk and caused damage to a 10,000ton tanker, bringing Kuhnke's total for the patrol to five ships for 30,000tons. However, during the postwar analysis, he was only credited with sinking a 2,000ton Dutch freighter and damaging a 4,700ton British freighter; which, combined with his earlier sinkings, brought his total to four ships for 9,945tons. On his return to Lorient Kuhnke was awarded the Knight's Cross for his work.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight into the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E

5|$|In July 1940, the 2nd New Zealand Division {{was sent}} to Mersa Matruh. The cavalry regiment, camped at Garawla, dug the outer {{anti-tank}} ditch along the Wadi Naghamish (later known as the Kiwi Canal). That month, volunteers from the regiment joined the Long Range Desert Patrol, and the regiment's base came under air attack. In the pre-dawn <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> 15 July, Italian bombers attempting to bomb the NAAFI dump were driven off by anti-aircraft fire from the regiment. During the night of 18 July, regimental anti-aircraft guns mistakenly fired on a damaged Bristol Blenheim. The regiment received orders to move to Baggush and build fortifications, completing the move on 1 September; the following day, it began constructing defences at Maaten Baggush. After finishing the task within a week, it {{was transferred to the}} rear area at El Daba. The regiment defended No.2 sector of the Baggush Box. After Operation Compass, the Allied offensive against Italian positions in Egypt and Libya, began on 9 December, several Italian Fiat M11/39 tanks were left behind at Nibeiwa. The regiment was ordered to salvage the tanks and on 15 December, Lieutenant H. A. Robinson led a party of 25 other ranks to Nibeiwa for the task. Div Cav received Marmon-Herrington Armoured Cars, replacing its obsolete Light Tanks Mk II and Mk III, and was transferred to Helwan in January 1941. The mortally ill Pierce was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Carruth on 22 February and C Squadron joined the regiment at Helwan on 5 March.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler {{made for}} Frenchman’s Creek but {{four of his}} eleven boats, “misled by the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> the night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current, fell below, near the bridge and were forced to return”. Nevertheless, Boerstler’s seven {{remaining}} boats forced a landing, opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment. Boerstler led the attack, shooting with his pistol a British soldier {{who was about to}} bayonet him. Bartley's outnumbered force retired, pursued to the Frenchman's Creek Bridge by the Americans, who took two prisoners. Boerstler's men were then attacked by Captain Bostwick’s two companies of Norfolk Militia, who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry. After an exchange of fire in which Bostwick’s force lost 3 killed, 15 wounded and 6 captured, the Canadians retreated. Boerstler now encountered another problem: many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman’s Creek bridge were in the four boats that had turned back and those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore. Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John Waring to “break up the bridge by any means which they could find”. Waring had torn up {{about a third of the}} planking on the bridge when it was learned from a prisoner that “the whole force from Fort Erie was coming down upon them”. Boerstler quickly re-embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo, leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E
