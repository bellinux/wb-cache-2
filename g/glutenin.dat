The high quality of pasta is attributed to its specific structure, obtained after successive structural changes of the two main semolina components, starch and proteins, gliadins and <b>glutenins,</b> in presence of water. The present study was conducted to examine the contributions of gliadins, <b>glutenins</b> and starch to the structure and functionality of gluten by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

50|$|Gliadin (a type of prolamin) is a {{class of}} {{proteins}} present in wheat and several other cereals within the grass genus Triticum. Gliadins, which are a component of gluten, are essential for giving bread the ability to rise properly during baking. Gliadins and <b>glutenins</b> are the two main components of the gluten fraction of the wheat seed. This gluten is found in products such as wheat flour. Gluten is split about evenly between the gliadins and <b>glutenins,</b> although there are variations found in different sources.|$|R
2500|$|Another major {{component}} of durum wheat is protein which plays {{a large role in}} pasta dough rheology. [...] Gluten proteins, which include monomeric gliadins and polymeric <b>glutenin,</b> make up the major protein component of durum wheat (about 7580%). As more water is added and shear stress is applied, gluten proteins take on an elastic characteristic and begin to form strands and sheets. The gluten matrix that results during forming of the dough becomes irreversibly associated during drying as the moisture content is lowered to form the dried pasta product.|$|E
2500|$|The limited {{potential}} for land expansion for cultivation worried Borlaug, who, in March 2005, stated that, [...] "we {{will have to}} double the world food supply by 2050." [...] With 85% of future growth in food production having to come from lands already in use, he recommends a multidisciplinary research focus to further increase yields, mainly through increased crop immunity to large-scale diseases, such as the rust fungus, which affects all cereals but rice. His dream was to [...] "transfer rice immunity to cereals such as wheat, maize, sorghum and barley, and transfer bread-wheat proteins (gliadin and <b>glutenin)</b> to other cereals, especially rice and maize".|$|E

Anti-gliadin antibodies have been found to synapsin I Omega-gliadin and the HMW <b>Glutenin</b> subunit antibodies have been found most commonly in individuals with exercise-induced anaphylaxis and Baker's allergy, and represent a potent class of gluten allergens. Non-glutinous proteins in wheat are also allergens, these include: LTP (albumin/globulin), thioredoxin-hB, and wheat flour peroxidase.

40|$|The wheat storage {{proteins}} {{have the}} most important role in defining functional properties of flour. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the wheat storage proteins profiles and relative amount by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). 13 wheat cultivars grown at Agricultural Institute Osijek were investigated. As compared to the other wheat storage protein fractions the average proportion of albumins and globulins was the least (19. 03 %). The albumins and globulins chromatogram profiles were different regarding subunits number (19 - 22) with constant retention time from 7 to 15 minutes. Within gliadins group hidrophobic α- (8 - 10 subunits) and γ- gliadins (6 - 9 subunits) were dominant, while the subunits number of hydrophilic gliadins varied from 1 to 3 for ω 5 - and 3 to 6 for ω 1, 2 - gliadins. According to obtained results α- and γ- gliadins were dominant components of gliadins group in relation to minor ω 5 - and ω 1, 2 - gliadins. The LMW <b>glutenins</b> with 16 to 19 subunits were dominant proteins of <b>glutenins</b> group compared with the HMW <b>glutenins</b> whose subunits number varied from 4 to 6.

40|$|The {{technological}} {{quality of}} wheat from or-ganic farming differs in many aspects from the technological quality of wheat from conventional farming. The most significant differences {{are in the}} content of crude protein in the grain dry mat-ter and in the parameters that characterize the wheat protein complex quality. Higher nitrogen levels require a later vegetation phase, when the grain is forming and maturing. In organic farming with absence of fast-effect industrial fertilizers, a nitrogen deficit and a lower accumulation of wheat storage proteins are frequently experienced (Prugar 1999). Wheat storage (gluten) proteins create up to 80 % from a total amount of wheat grain (Shewry et al. 2000). Technologically, <b>glutenins</b> and gliadins are the most important wheat storage proteins. Their proportion and amount in wheat grain is variable and changes with the total protein content, grow-ing conditions, genetic disposition of variety and process of grain maturing (Branlard et al. 2000, Shewry et al. 2000). The gluten quality for the specific final utilization is determined especially by the optimal storage proteins combination. Each of them affects rheology in a unique way – dough viscosity and tensibility are affected by gliadins, elasticity by <b>glutenins</b> (Bushuk and Bekes 2002). Gliadins create heterogeneous mixture of one-chain polypeptides; they are proteins with the lowest nutritional value in the way of amino-acid composition. <b>Glutenins</b> are not as heterogeneous as gliadins; depending on their electrophoretic mobility to the HMW and LMW (Low Molecular Weight) <b>glutenins</b> subunits could be distinguished. HMW <b>glutenins</b> subunits with the molecular weight of about 80 000 – 120 000 Da create circa 25 – 35 % of The effect of organic and conventional growing systems on quality and storage protein composition of winter whea...|$|R

2500|$|Wheat {{gliadins}} {{and potentially}} oat avenins {{are associated with}} another disease, known as wheat-dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) {{which is similar to}} baker's allergy as both are mediated by IgE responses. In WDEIA, however, the ω-gliadins or a high molecular weight <b>glutenin</b> subunit, and similar proteins in other Triticeae genera enter the blood stream during exercise where they cause acute asthmatic or allergic reaction. [...] One recent study of ω-gliadins demonstrated these gliadins are more similar to the bulk of oat avenins than α/β or γ gliadins but, so far, oat avenins have not been linked to WDEIA. Wheat may specifically induce WDEIA and certain chronic urticaria because the anti-gliadin IgE detects ω5-gliadins expressed by most of the Gli-B1 alleles but almost no responses prolamins extracted from rye or wheat/rye translocates.

50|$|<b>Glutenin</b> and gliadin are {{functional}} proteins {{found in}} wheat bread {{that contribute to}} the structure of bread. <b>Glutenin</b> forms interconnected gluten networks within bread through interchain disulfide bonds. Gliadin binds weakly to the gluten network established by <b>glutenin</b> via intrachain disulfide bonds. Structurally, bread can be defined as an elastic-plastic foam. The <b>glutenin</b> protein contributes to its elastic nature, as it is able to regain its initial shape after deformation. The gliadin protein contributes to its plastic nature, because it demonstrates non-reversible structural change after a certain amount of applied force. Because air pockets within this gluten network result from carbon dioxide production during leavening, bread can be defined as a foam, or a gas-in-solid solution.|$|E

50|$|Wheat flour, in {{addition}} to its starch, contains three water-soluble protein groups (albumin, globulin, and proteoses) and two water-insoluble protein groups (<b>glutenin</b> and gliadin). When flour is mixed with water, the water-soluble proteins dissolve, leaving the <b>glutenin</b> and gliadin to form the structure of the resulting bread. When relatively dry dough is worked by kneading, or wet dough is allowed to rise for a long time (see no-knead bread), the <b>glutenin</b> forms strands of long, thin, chainlike molecules, while the shorter gliadin forms bridges between the strands of <b>glutenin.</b> The resulting networks of strands produced by these two proteins are known as gluten. Gluten development improves if the dough is allowed to autolyse.|$|E

40|$|Northwestern European {{consumers}} {{like their}} bread to be voluminous {{and easy to}} chew. These attributes require a raw material that is rich in protein with, among other characteristics, a suitable ratio between gliadins and <b>glutenins.</b> Achieving this is a challenge for organic growers, because they lack cultivars that can realise high protein concentrations under the relatively low and variable availability of nitrogen during the grain-filling phase common in organic farming. Relatively low protein content in wheat grains thus needs to be compensated by {{a high proportion of}} high-quality protein. Organic farming therefore needs cultivars with genes encoding for optimal levels of <b>glutenins</b> and gliadins, a maximum ability for nitrogen uptake, a large storage capacity of nitrogen in the biomass, an adequate balance between vegetative and reproductive growth, a high nitrogen translocation efficiency for the vegetative parts into the grains during grain filling and an efficient conversion of nitrogen into high-quality proteins.

40|$|Bakery {{products}} with desirable texture possess the proper balance between elasticity and viscosity. These two rheological properties are generally contributed by the polymeric glutens formed by <b>glutenins</b> and gliadins {{with the addition}} of water. However, the native <b>glutenins</b> and gliadins in wheat flour might not possess the chemistry that could contribute to the desirable rheological properties. Therefore, an additive should be used to modify the flour. In this study, addition of L-cysteine, a reducing agent, caused flour dough to be less elastic or more extensible. The extent of this effect is more profound in the strong wheat cultivars (Hollis (HRS), Norpro (HRS) and Trego (HW)) than in weaker wheat cultivar (Stephens (SW)) and commercial bread flour. Microbial transglutaminase at 16, 000 ppm caused a significant increase in elasticity as agreed from both extension test and creep-recovery tests.
