But mostly, my children and my wife, who often had to endure my absence for long periods of time. This is not just for me, but <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>involved</b> in my career,” Morales said.< As reported on April 25, 2013 by badlefthook.com, Morales plans to fight two times in 2013 in July and November.

[...] Hendricks said that Joan's motivation was [...] "protection [...] her child." [...] Hendricks felt that Joan saw herself as an equal in a way to the other partners after going through with the deal, as Joan had seen them do worse things over her thirteen years in employment.|$|E

500|$|The album sold {{a million}} copies in the United States, and five million worldwide. Taraborrelli felt that at that moment, riding on Madonna's coattails proved {{profitable}} <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>involved,</b> including Warner Bros. Records, which notched up big sales with a compilation soundtrack album that was basically a showcase for its marginal artists. But still they wanted to [...] "milk-in" [...] the success of Madonna, a view shared by Peter Guber and Jon Peters, executive producers of the film. Hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was the appropriate thing to do, since it would promote both the soundtrack and the film, as well as Madonna's successful third studio album True Blue, released the year before. As Madonna's first world tour, Who's That Girl ended up being a resounding success, although by its end, Madonna declared {{that she did not}} want to hear any of her songs again and she did not know whether she would ever write another one. [...] "I returned feeling so burned out and I was convinced that I wouldn't go near music for quite a while", she said.|$|E
500|$|On November 10, 2010, the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) {{unveiled}} a new format for selecting the NHL All-Star teams: the traditional conference format {{was replaced by}} a [...] "fantasy draft." [...] Fans voted for six players, from either conference (three forwards, two defencemen and one goaltender), and the NHL selected another 36 players, for a total of 42 players. The chosen players then appointed two captains; the NHL and NHLPA, with input from the players, named two alternate captains for each team. Each team had two forwards and one defenceman as its captain and alternates. The captains and alternates selected their team members in a fantasy-style draft held on January 28, 2011. The first pick was determined by a coin toss, with alternating picks after the first. Teams consisted of three goaltenders, six defencemen and 12 forwards. Although the draft rules did not dictate a strict order in which positions had to be filled, to guarantee the final picks were not constrained by having to satisfy roster composition rules, the teams' three goaltenders had to be chosen by the end of round ten, and all defencemen had to be chosen by the end of round 15. According to NHL Vice President of Hockey and Business Development Brendan Shanahan, the new format was introduced to add excitement and intrigue into all the events, while make it more fun <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>involved.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} shot by Gregg Toland, {{credited}} simply as [...] "Gregg", who was simultaneously working {{as an assistant to}} cinematographer George Barnes at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio. It {{was one of the first}} films for Toland, who later received acclaim for his cinematography on such films as The Grapes of Wrath (1939) and Citizen Kane (1941). The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra cost $97 ($ today) to make, which was covered entirely by Florey. The budget was composed of $55 ($ today) for development and printing, $25 ($ today) for negatives, $14 ($ today) for transportation, and $3 ($ today) for store props, most of which cost five or ten cents individually. From the development costs, the salary expenses <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>involved</b> in the film totaled $3. Toland had use of a Mitchell camera during filming, which allowed for some shots that would have been impossible with the DeVry carema, including about 300 feet of closeups. Additional camerawork was done by Paul Ivano, and Taves has in fact argued that Ivano was primarily responsible for much of the film's camerawork, with Toland handling primarily the close-ups. The film was shot on 35 mm film, over a period of three weeks in late 1927, filmed mostly on weekends. No subtitles are used in the film. Only two captions are used, each with one word – [...] "DREAMS" [...] and [...] "SUCCESS" [...] – but they are created not through subtitles, but by reflecting moving light through cardboard cutouts, creating words among the shadows.|$|E

40|$|Information sharing between {{mental health}} workers, consumers, carers, family and {{significant}} others Queensland HealthA {{message from the}} Director of Mental Health Perhaps {{the most important thing}} we do when we become involved in the life of someone who lives with a mental illness is show them respect and dignity by doing our utmost to understand them as a unique individual and not merely as someone who experiences symptoms or who uses our mental health services. The best way we can do this is by getting to know them and having meaningful discussions with them about their hopes and dreams and what matters to them. Nearly everyone who experiences a mental illness wants the opportunity to involve in their recovery the people who are important to them and play a significant part in their lives. However, {{to be able to help}} the consumer, these people also need to be provided with timely information and support. To find a way of making our commitment to this approach more practical, we developed the Consumer, Carer and Family Participation Framework.

2500|$|On 20 October 1937 King George and Queen Elizabeth visited Halifax. This was a {{cause for}} much celebration {{throughout}} the town and surrounding areas and large crowds of well wishers arrived to see them. Richardson, {{was in charge of}} the Policing arrangements and he followed up his success of 1926 by producing another, this time larger, list of procedures. Many more surrounding Forces were involved, so great clarity and understanding was required by the men. In the booklet he produced instructions <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>involved</b> in the procession of the King and Queen through the town.

Street closures-Funeral processions-crowd control-possible crowd surges-erecting barriers and taking them down-Police Signal lights-street telephones boxes-Police deportment-do not salute- Rights of photographers, First Aid, and the Mounted Police had a special extra set of instructions. [...] It is possible to read through the booklet and know exactly who was where doing what by time and location within minutes. Each book had a unique number which the involved policeman signed for, and at the back is a message to say each copy MUST be returned to the Chief Constable of Halifax at the end of the day. Reading the booklet headings it appears the Royals safety was being taken more seriously perhaps than before. A photograph was taken and published in the Halifax Guardian showing the King and Queen with Chief Constable Richardson, the Mayor and other local Dignitaries.|$|E
2500|$|Jeepster dropped Snow Patrol in 2001, a {{decision}} that was criticised by Hot Press magazine as brainless. By July 2001, many major labels had started showing interest in Snow Patrol, but the band were cash-strapped and had no record deal. Lightbody sold {{a major part of}} his record collection to raise money to keep the band going. Lightbody calls the time [...] "miserable", but was confident of getting signed to another label quickly. However, the music scene in the United Kingdom had turned its attention to American bands and British bands were not getting signed. The band spent this time constantly writing songs. Lightbody, bored at this point, assembled The Reindeer Section, a Scottish supergroup, and found a record label to release the group's recordings. Quinn said that though the time was hard <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>involved</b> except for Nathan, the question of splitting up never arose. It was during this time the band wrote [...] "Run" [...] (which had been around since 2000) in a room on an acoustic guitar, which later became the band's breakthrough single. The band's [...] "low point" [...] came when they played a concert to 18 people at a popular strip club in High Wycombe. The show took place in a shoddy VIP area, and the management had to unscrew poles used by pole dancers to make space for the band to play, something that Gary would later joke about whilst performing at a sold out Wembley Arena. Quinn calls the show [...] "horrendous". Desperate for attention, the band raised £200 to nominate themselves for a Mercury Prize, but failed to get shortlisted.|$|E
