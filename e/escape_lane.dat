50|$|The road {{is part of}} the A39, {{a long-distance}} road across the north coast of Somerset and Cornwall, though it is not a main through route here. Porlock Hill is not {{recommended}} for caravans or HGVs, who are strongly advised to seek another route. Cyclists are advised to dismount. The road has two <b>escape</b> <b>lanes</b> along its descent, to handle runaway vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Between Zirl and Leithen the {{northern}} carriageway of the Seefelder Straße (the uphill carriageway) is closed to caravans with a permitted total weight of over 750 kg {{and the whole}} of the road between Zirl and Scharnitz is barred for lorries over 7.5 tonnes with the exception of local lorry traffic. Due to the steep gradient there are several <b>escape</b> <b>lanes</b> between Leithen and Zirl that branch off the downhill carriageway; they runn slightly uphill so that in an emergency, vehicles, especially lorries, can be braked by the gravel roadbed. The gradient also means that bicycles are not permitted on the downhill carriageway; although they are allowed to climb the road, this is not recommended due to the high levels of traffic.|$|R
50|$|The county's last {{remaining}} emergency <b>escape</b> <b>lane</b> (a sand trap for vehicles unable to brake) was removed in 2014 after being deemed both obsolete and potentially dangerous; it was {{located at the}} foot of Hopton Bank (on the A4117).|$|E
50|$|Two notable {{inclines}} {{are named}} — the stretch from Hopton Wafers to Doddington is Hopton Bank; whilst {{the road from}} Clee Hill Village down to Henley is named Angel Bank. Hopton Bank had Shropshire's last remaining emergency <b>escape</b> <b>lane</b> (a sand trap for vehicles unable to brake) towards its lower end in Hopton Wafers; this was however removed in 2014 having become obsolete.|$|E
50|$|A runaway truck ramp, runaway truck lane, <b>escape</b> <b>lane,</b> {{emergency}} escape ramp, or truck {{arrester bed}} is a traffic device that enables vehicles which are having braking problems to safely stop. It is typically a long, sand- or gravel-filled lane {{connected to a}} steep downhill grade section of a main road, and is designed to accommodate large trucks or buses. The ramp allows a moving vehicle's kinetic energy to be dissipated gradually in a controlled and relatively harmless way, helping the operator to stop it safely without a violent crash.|$|E
50|$|Erik Davidsen is {{immediately}} drawn towards Miranda, {{the young woman}} from Jamaica, and Eglantine, her pre-school daughter by Jeffrey Lane. He soon falls head over heels {{in love with the}} dark-skinned woman {{while at the same time}} watching what he perceives to be the slow but steady deterioration of his own self. Gently rejected by Miranda, he has enough willpower left to go on a date with a sexy colleague and, for purely physical reasons, starts an affair with her. As the story progresses, however, he is more and more pulled into the quagmire of events surrounding Miranda, Inga, and himself. At one point he catches a burglar in his empty house at night, is surprised to see it is Lane, confused when the <b>escaping</b> <b>Lane</b> takes a photo of him wearing nothing much but wielding a hammer, and shocked when, months later, he recognizes the image at one of Lane's exhibitions with a caption saying, Head Doctor Goes Insane.|$|R

50|$|After the shootings, Bieber <b>escaped</b> down Dib <b>Lane,</b> {{and stole}} a car at gunpoint outside a betting shop further down the road. This caused some {{confusion}} in initial news reports of the shootings, which state that the shooting itself happened outside the betting shop.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 32 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 8 - 11 July 2013 "Transport and Sustainable Infrastructure", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Very {{little research has been}} done in South Africa on the speeds of trucks on downgrades. However, a thorough knowledge of this subject is essential {{in a number of areas}} namely the justification of arrestor beds and <b>escape</b> <b>lanes</b> for run-away trucks, the development of speed profiles on roads and the provision of passing lanes on downgrades. In a recent study in the Western Cape the speeds of trucks were measured on various downgrades related to mountain passes. Two types of downgrades were investigated namely those that are followed by a straight section of road on an upgrade and those that are followed by a section with restricted horizontal alignment and sight distance. Since it was not possible to determine the mass of the trucks the number of axles was used as a substitute for the size of the trucks. The paper will describe the data collection, analyses and the results of the analyses for the two different cases and the different axle classes. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference. The material was published using Adobe Acrobat 10. 1. 0 Technology.

50|$|The movie {{opens with}} a distressed woman being chased through a {{tropical}} forest by an unknown pursuer. It is soon revealed that the woman is attempting to <b>escape</b> from Frank <b>Lane,</b> an American running an illegal child sex ring operation in Brazil. Upon being recaptured, she is taken back to Lane's home and executed {{in front of the}} other slaves, as punishment for her actions.|$|R
5|$|The {{captured}} Lane expresses {{his belief}} that Jones is helping the prime universe to defeat the parallel one. Olivia tries to convince him of Jones' true intentions. Eventually, Lane agrees to show the Fringe team a location where he once met with Jones. The team raids the site but finds nothing; meanwhile, <b>Lane</b> <b>escapes</b> custody using his abilities. With only hours left until {{the next set of}} quakes, as projected by a watch that Lane was wearing, plans are made to shut down the bridge before this time runs out.|$|R
50|$|Lane sailed {{alongside}} Robert Sample, who captained {{the other}} vessel England had refitted. They sailed to the Caribbean, looting several ships before careening their vessels. That November they sailed to Brazil “and {{did a great}} deal of mischief,” plundering Portuguese ships. They were approached by a Portuguese man-of-war (“a very unwelcome guest to them”) who chased the two pirates. Sample was forced to beach his ship and was captured. <b>Lane</b> <b>escaped</b> the man-of-war but he and his crew perished when the Queen Anne’s Revenge was lost offshore with all hands.|$|R

Sample was unable to evade the warship and tried to escape by beaching the Flying King. 12 of its crew had been killed; the Portuguese captured the rest, hanging 38, almost all of whom were English.|$|R
40|$|Solid {{barriers}} represent {{danger for}} the driver in case of traffic <b>lane</b> <b>escape.</b> This threat can be represented by a drainage ditch culvert face. The access bridge is not usually conspicuous enough near the traffic lane so that the driver could ditch and crash this barrier {{in case of an}} exceptional situation such as avoidance manoeuvres. This work deals with a technical solution of access bridges with an integrated deformation zone which was designed on the ground of a detailed analysis of current types of the construction. The new technical solution was proved by means of a numerical simulation of passenger car impact and compared with the current design of culvert faces. </p...|$|R
50|$|Garry and Lane {{accompanied}} Congressman Leo Ryan and his delegation {{on their}} investigation of Jonestown in November 1978. On November 18, 1978, Garry and <b>Lane</b> <b>escaped</b> potential harm at Jonestown by talking their way past Temple security {{at a house}} {{to which they were}} sent that was located some distance from Jonestown's pavilion. That day, 918 people died in Jonestown and Georgetown, which comprised the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a non-natural disaster until the incidents of September 11, 2001. In addition, five people were murdered by Temple members at a nearby airstrip, including Congressman Ryan, who became the only Congressman murdered {{in the line of duty}} in United States history.|$|R
5000|$|Lane was an {{opponent}} of slavery early in life, and came to support Henry Clay while he lived in Kentucky. At age 20, he delivered an anti-slavery speech to the Colonization Society in October 1831. In the speech he declared, [...] "The History of all times admonishes us that no man or community of men can be kept forever in slavery." [...] While Lane opposed to expansion of slavery {{he was not in}} favor of abolition, but like Henry Clay he believed that over time slavery would died out if it was prevented from spreading. In 1833 he married to Pamela Bledsoe Jameson. The couple had no children, and his wife was killed in a stage coach accident 1842; <b>Lane</b> <b>escaped</b> the accident with only minor injuries.|$|R
25|$|Former UN {{employee}} Gerry Lane, {{his wife}} Karin {{and their two}} daughters are in heavy Philadelphia traffic when the city is overrun by zombies. As chaos spreads, the <b>Lanes</b> <b>escape</b> to Newark, New Jersey and take refuge in an apartment, home to a couple with a young son, Tommy. UN Deputy Secretary-General Thierry Umutoni—an old friend of Gerry's—sends a helicopter that extracts the Lanes and Tommy to a U.S. Navy vessel in the Atlantic where scientists and military personnel are analyzing the worldwide outbreaks. Dr. Andrew Fassbach posits that the plague is a virus, and that development of a vaccine depends on finding the origin. Gerry reluctantly agrees to help Fassbach find the outbreak's source after it is made clear {{that he and his}} family will be removed from the ship if he does not.|$|R
5000|$|At 7:38 p.m on September 11, 2014, {{eight days}} before his 20th birthday, <b>Lane</b> <b>escaped</b> from Allen Correctional Institution in Lima, Ohio, along with two other inmates. The three inmates escaped using a {{makeshift}} ladder to scale a fence during recreation hours. Thirty-three-year-old Lindsey Bruce was quickly captured afterwards. Lane and the other inmate, identified as 45-year-old Clifford Opperud of Carlisle, Ohio, who was serving a 12-year sentence for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and kidnapping, remained at large. Police conducted searches at a wooded area and a residential neighborhood near the prison, and considered him and Opperud as [...] "potentially armed and dangerous". Nearby residents were advised to lock their doors and stay inside their homes. Dina Parmertor, Daniel Parmertor's mother, reacted to the escape, saying, [...] "I'm disgusted that it happened. I'm extremely scared and panic stricken. I can't believe it." ...|$|R
5000|$|An 1967 episode [...] "The Chimp Who Made it Big" [...] of The New Adventures of Superman {{was another}} version of the Titano story. A {{collision}} of a Kryptonite meteor and a uranium asteroid crash near the capsule Toto was in causes it to lose control. Superman saves the capsule and brings it down to Earth. When Lois Lane reports at the rocket base, Toto bursts from the capsule and transforms into Titano. He grabs Lois Lane and Superman tries to stop him but is hit by the giant ape's Kryptonite eye beams. When the military fires missiles at Titano, Superman protects him from the attack. Titano then <b>escapes</b> with Lois <b>Lane</b> while Superman pursues them. He makes a shield of lead and then knocks out Titano. A headline in the Daily Planet newspaper states that the Kryptonite's effects on Titano wore off and he was restored to his normal size. A clip from this episode was broadcast in the first test episode of Sesame Street.|$|R
5000|$|Cassandra {{delivers}} to Lane {{a warning}} that the prophets gave her, though he is skeptical. Nevertheless, the warning leads Lane to discover the decoding facility where Alexander's staff uses Rostenburg's program. No one else is in the facility at the time, but Lane sees that the program is running, and leafs through printouts of previously deciphered codes. Seeing Lane on a surveillance feed, Alexander and Dominic go to confront him. A disillusioned Lane accuses Alexander of [...] "following the code like a script," [...] and being behind the Israeli bombings. Confessing to Lane's charges, Alexander asks him to be [...] "my spokesman for this new world, my visionary, my prophet." [...] Believing himself {{to be the only}} rightful aspirant to the position, Dominic pulls his gun on Lane, who flees. Firing repeatedly at Lane, Dominic inadvertently shoots Alexander in the head, mortally wounding him. Dominic immediately alerts security, claiming that Lane shot Alexander and fled. <b>Lane</b> <b>escapes</b> Alexander's compound, but becomes the target of a worldwide manhunt. Alexander is pronounced dead at a local hospital.|$|R
2500|$|Because revenge was a {{principal}} {{motive for the}} attack, Quantrill’s raiders entered Lawrence with lists of men to be killed and buildings to be burned. Senator James H. Lane {{was at the top}} of the list. Lane was a military leader and chief political proponent of the jayhawking raids that had cut a swath of death, plundering, and arson through western Missouri (including the destruction of Osceola) in the early months of the Civil War. <b>Lane</b> <b>escaped</b> death by racing through a cornfield in his nightshirt.

50|$|In Morrison's {{next story}} arc, Batman takes Robin {{with him to}} the Island of Mister Mayhew where he learns that the {{organization}} the Black Glove is out to kill him. After a two-issue interlude in the Batman title crossover The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul, the true history of the three ghosts was revealed. The third ghost showed up at police headquarters looking for Commissioner Vane and killed a number of officers. Batman, who had started a love affair with Jezebel Jet as Bruce Wayne, was attacked by the ghost {{on the roof of the}} headquarters. His heart stopped and he had visions of old cases of his which had many unexplained phenomena as well as a vision of Joe Chill, the thief who had murdered his parents when he was a child. When he awoke from the visions, he was a captive of the ghost. As the man talked to him, Batman remembered from where the ghosts had come. What Batman thought was a hallucination turned out to be a forgotten memory in which three men were chosen from the police force to train with Batman to replace him should anything ever happen to him. During the test, Batman had himself isolated so that a Doctor Simon Hurt could study his moves and what drives him. When the three replacement Batmen came in to challenge him, Batman took them down easily. Dr. Hurt decided that the three Batmen needed to be driven by rage and sorrow to become like Batman. The first, Josef Muller, was an ace marksman as a cop, but had both hands broken by Batman in their fight causing him to have to retire. Hurt killed the third man's, whose name was Lane, family, and began adding Venom and monster serum to Branca, the second man's, diet until he was driven to kill his own family in rage. Doctor Hurt put hypnotic suggestions into Batman's head to help him forget the whole experience and dismiss it as a bad dream. The three replacement cops were hidden away to await the day they would return. Batman is eventually able to <b>escape,</b> but <b>Lane</b> warns him that Hurt is after him and his luck would soon be gone. This leads into the Batman R.I.P. storyline.|$|R
6000|$|Elizabeth {{had sworn}} to having asked {{a man to}} point out the way to London after she <b>escaped</b> into the <b>lane</b> beside Mrs. Wells's house. A man, Thomas Bennet, swore that on January 29, 1753, he met 'a miserable, poor wretch, about half-past four,' 'near the ten-mile stone,' in a lane. She asked her way to London; 'she said she was affrighted by the tanner's dog.' The tanner's house was about two hundred yards nearer London, and the {{prosecution}} made much of this, as if a dog, with plenty of leisure and a feud against tramps, could not move two hundred yards, or much more, if he were taking a walk abroad, to combat the object of his dislike. Bennet knew that the dog was the tanner's; probably he saw the dog when he met the wayfarer, and it does not follow that the wayfarer herself called it 'the tanner's dog.' Bennet fixed the date with precision. Four days later, hearing of the trouble at Mrs. Wells's, Bennet said, 'I will be hanged if I did not meet the young woman near this place and told her the way to London.' Mr. Davy could only combat Bennet by laying stress on the wayfarer's talking of 'the tanner's dog.' But the dog, at the moment of the meeting, was probably well in view. Bennet knew him, and Bennet was not asked, 'Did the woman call the dog [...] "the tanner's dog," [...] or do you say this of your own knowledge?' Moreover, the tannery was well in view, and the hound may have conspicuously started from that base of operations. Mr. Davy's reply was a quibble.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2013 {{feature film}} Man of Steel, Sub-Commander Faora-Ul is portrayed by actress Antje Traue. In the film, she is Zod's lieutenant, and is sentenced to 300 cycles in the Phantom Zone along with Zod and his forces. After Krypton's destruction, Faora {{and the other}} prisoners are freed from the Phantom Zone, and search for Kal-El and the Codex, a device {{containing}} the genetic code for all future Kryptonians, which were able to escape the planet's destruction due to Jor-El's last-minute actions. After finding him on Earth, Faora is responsible for bringing Kal-El and Lois Lane aboard Zod's ship upon Zod altering the deal with the U.S. Military. She was present when Zod explains to Superman about Krypton and its failed colonies. After Superman and Lois <b>Lane</b> <b>escape,</b> Faora and another powerful Kryptonian grunt named Nam-Ek confront Kal-El and the U.S. Military in Smallville, but are defeated when Kal-El manages to break her helmet. After Zod begins terraforming the Earth with a world engine retrieved from a Kryptonian Colony that they visited before arriving to Earth, Faora {{and all the other}} Kryptonians (except Zod) are sent back to the Phantom Zone. As in the comics, Faora is a major threat to Kal-El in hand-to-hand combat, easily outfighting him at first. Kal-El is able to hold his own against her and Nam-Ek, since the two Kryptonians have yet to attain heat vision and flight and he is stronger than they are due to his longer exposure to solar radiation. Faora is taken out of the fight when Colonel Hardy crashes the airplane they are on into Zod's ship, sending them back into the Phantom Zone. Gal Gadot, who portrays Wonder Woman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, revealed in an interview that she was offered the part of Faora in the film, but turned it down due to her pregnancy at the time.|$|R
