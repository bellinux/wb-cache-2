500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I {{have no idea where}} that came from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder if I made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy he wanted {{to come back to the}} team. He said [...] "When <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E
5000|$|He {{became the}} {{producer}} of The Mousetrap in 1994. During his time managing the St. Martin's Theatre, he had got to know The Mousetraps producer, Peter Saunders. Waley-Cohen said, [...] "When Saunders wanted to retire {{at the age of}} 80, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to me". Mousetrap Productions, of which Waley-Cohen is the sole director, is licensed to produce the play by Mathew Prichard, Agatha Christie's grandson, to whom she gave the rights to The Mousetrap when he was nine.|$|E

[...] "The {{guy at the}} other end asked whether I was calling from Quangang district as soon as <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> He said that he had already received a large number of complaints about the oil refinery since it began operating in May." [...] The man told him that nothing could be done at that level, as the plant was one of the leading chemical enterprises in the nation. (Approved by State Council in 2007) ...|$|E

5000|$|The track [...] "Entrance" [...] {{starts off}} Exit {{with a comment}} on the {{diversity}} of the album from talk show host John Salley. He asks k-os, [...] "With all this different stuff on this one album, what is it?" [...] Then, as the track number changes on the LCD display, k-os begins his answer. [...] "Fantastique" [...] itself is more of an introduction piece than [...] "Entrance" [...] is. The second track introduces k-os and characterizes him. In this song, he puts forth his mission statement. He raps that he was happy with his metaphorical girl named Wise, and that he was content with his own wisdom until the [...] "phone rang," [...] which he decided to ignore. Upon the next ringing, however, <b>he</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and heard the man on the other end calling him to arms, because [...] "hip-hop is dying." [...] Though at this point he has characterized himself as something of a rap savior, the chorus depicts him as a humble person. The major talking point of verse two is the first mention of his aversion to pimps and those who objectify other humans, rapping, [...] "pimps just react to things, men make 'em happen." ...|$|E

40|$|This week 2 ̆ 7 s Podcast {{features}} Louis Altazan, President of AGCO Automotive Corporation in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Louis discusses {{his introduction}} to Dr. Deming and his philosophies, his 2 ̆ 2 aha 2 ̆ 2 moment, and the long-term thinking and trust that must be established to succeed. Louis starts with a brief introduction of AGCO, and his feeling that the automotive industry could be doing better. After toiling for 10 years with various philosophies, it was the 1980 NBC documentary 2 ̆ 2 If Japan Can, Why Can 2 ̆ 7 t We 2 ̆ 2 that hit home with him. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and called Dr. Deming. And as they say 2 ̆ 2 the rest is history. 2 ̆ 2 Louis began implementing Deming 2 ̆ 7 s 14 points right away. His biggest 2 ̆ 2 aha 2 ̆ 2 moment was that 2 ̆ 2 I was the problem. 2 ̆ 2 Once he realized this, he called a meeting to apologize and things started to get better right away. Louis removed everyone from the 2 ̆ 2 flat rate 2 ̆ 2 pay system {{and put them on}} salary. This helped his staff change their focus from short-term thinking and profits to long-term thinking and trust. Louis warns that you can 2 ̆ 7 t apply some part of Dr. Deming 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy and not others - that 2 ̆ 2 it 2 ̆ 7 s a cohesive system that all works together. 2 ̆ 2 Done this way you will start seeing improvement almost immediately, but the real benefits will be felt about 20 years down the road.
