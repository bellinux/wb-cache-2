5|$|The <b>flatness</b> problem (also {{known as}} the oldness problem) is an {{observational}} problem associated with a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric (FLRW). The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial curvature depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative, if its density {{is less than the}} critical density; positive, if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be flat.|$|E
5|$|Wright {{designed}} the Taliesin structure {{two years after}} leaving his first wife and home in Oak Park, Illinois with a mistress, Mamah Borthwick. The design of the original building {{was consistent with the}} design principles of the Prairie School, emulating the <b>flatness</b> of the plains and the natural limestone outcroppings of Wisconsin's Driftless Area. The structure (which included an agricultural and studio wing) was completed in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from <b>flatness,</b> but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from <b>flatness</b> is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E
5|$|The City of Manila is {{situated}} {{on the eastern shore}} of Manila Bay, on the western edge of Luzon, 1300 km from mainland Asia. One of Manila's greatest natural resources is the protected harbor upon which it sits, regarded as the finest in all of Asia. The Pasig River flows through the middle of city, dividing it into the north and south. The overall grade of the city's central, built-up areas, is relatively consistent with the natural <b>flatness</b> of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} monopole objection {{was raised in}} the late 1970s. Grand unified theories predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as {{magnetic monopole}}s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by cosmic inflation, which removes all point defects from the observable universe, {{in the same way that}} it drives the geometry to <b>flatness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending into the background so as to become hard to see (this covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and pattern {{to break up the}} animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour to create the illusion of <b>flatness,</b> which relates mainly to general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} theory, {{a number of}} mysteries and {{problems}} have arisen {{as a result of}} the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic monopole problem, and the <b>flatness</b> problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.|$|E
5|$|Draught camel {{are used}} for several {{purposes}} including ploughing, processing in oil mills and pulling carts. There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the <b>flatness</b> of its feet could be indicators. It {{may be used for}} ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks. The draught camel can plough at around , and should not be used for more than six hours a day four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon. The camel is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and hardiness.|$|E
5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their <b>flatness.</b> The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from <b>flatness</b> might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E
5|$|Kentrosaurus {{was a small}} stegosaur. It had {{the typical}} dinosaurian body bauplan, characterised by a small head, a long neck, short forelimbs and long hindlimbs, and a long, {{horizontal}} and muscular tail. Typical stegosaurid traits included the elongation and <b>flatness</b> of the head, the powerful build of the forelimbs, erect and pillar-like hindlimbs {{and an array of}} plates and spikes running along both sides of the top mid-line of the animal. Only a single complete tooth was known when Hennig published his monography in 1925. Later, a part of a dentary, the tooth-bearing bone of the front lower jaw, was found, which bears a just emerging tooth, and some tooth fragments were recovered from matrix sticking to other bones. The deep dentary is almost identical in shape to that of Stegosaurus, albeit much smaller. Similarly, the tooth is a typical stegosaurian tooth, small with a widened base and vertical grooves creating five ridges.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the <b>flatness</b> of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E
5|$|The {{hexagonal}} structure {{has a point}} group 6mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), and the space group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 {{is close to the}} ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074nm for Zn2+ and 0.140nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface <b>flatness</b> and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.|$|E
5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats {{at different stages of}} completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The <b>flatness</b> of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} asympotic <b>flatness</b> in {{gravitation}} physics {{has been criticized}} on both theoretical and technical grounds.|$|E
25|$|Surface quality {{measures}} the deviations from a perfect, ideal surface. Increasing the surface quality reduces distortion, artifacts, and aberration in images, and helps increase coherence, collimation, and reduce unwanted divergence in beams. For plane mirrors, {{this is often}} {{described in terms of}} <b>flatness,</b> while other surface shapes are compared to an ideal shape. The surface quality is typically measured with items like interferometers or optical flats, and are usually measured in wavelengths of light (λ). A normal household-mirror made with float glass may have <b>flatness</b> tolerances as low as 9--14λ per inch, equating to a deviation of 5600 through 8800 nanometers from perfect <b>flatness.</b> Precision ground and polished mirrors intended for lasers or telescopes may have tolerances as high as λ/50 (1/50 of the wavelength of the light, or around 12 nm).|$|E
25|$|Complexity is a {{separate}} issue from <b>flatness</b> of rate structures. Also, in the United States, income tax laws are often used by legislatures as policy instruments for encouraging numerous undertakings deemed socially useful — including the buying of life insurance, the funding of employee health care and pensions, the raising of children, home ownership, development of alternative energy sources and increased investment in conventional energy. Special tax provisions granted for any purpose increase complexity, irrespective of the system's <b>flatness</b> or lack thereof.|$|E
25|$|The 3rd Earl, {{approached}} Humphry Repton to remodel {{the grounds}} of the Castle, however, Repton turned down the commission due to the <b>flatness</b> of the estate, which he found daunting.|$|E
25|$|According to Lacey, bin Baz {{changed his}} mind about the earth's <b>flatness</b> after talking to Prince Sultan bin Salman Al Saud who had spent time in a space shuttle flight in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Guth's {{first step}} to {{developing}} his theory of inflation occurred at Cornell in 1978, when he attended a lecture by Robert Dicke about the <b>flatness</b> problem of the universe. Dicke explained how the <b>flatness</b> problem showed that something significant was missing from the Big Bang theory at the time. The fate of the universe depended on its density. If {{the density of the}} universe was large enough, it would collapse into a singularity, and if the actual density of the matter in the cosmos was lower than the critical density, the universe would increasingly get much bigger.|$|E
25|$|Early medieval Christian {{writers in}} the early Middle Ages felt little urge to assume <b>flatness</b> of the earth, though they had fuzzy {{impressions}} of the writings of Ptolemy, Aristotle, and relied more on Pliny.|$|E
25|$|There were methodological {{problems}} with Hubble's survey technique {{that showed a}} deviation from <b>flatness</b> at large redshifts. In particular, the technique did not account for changes in luminosity of galaxies due to galaxy evolution.|$|E
25|$|The last, the Uwharrie range, {{sometimes}} {{presents a}} succession of elevated ridges, then a number of bold and isolated knobs, which often appear higher than they actually are, due to the relative <b>flatness</b> of the surrounding terrain.|$|E
25|$|Models of {{physical}} phenomena in general relativity (and allied physical theories) generally arise {{as the solution}} of appropriate systems of differential equations, and assuming asymptotic <b>flatness</b> provides boundary conditions which assist in setting up and even in solving the resulting boundary value problem.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Face {{was best}} known {{for his role in the}} 1970s, 80s and 90s in the {{development}} of the technologies and the design/installation practices that became the world standard for the specification, control and measurement of the <b>flatness</b> and levelness of concrete.|$|E
25|$|While this is less obvious, {{it turns}} out that invoking {{asymptotic}} <b>flatness</b> allows physicists to import sophisticated mathematical concepts from algebraic geometry and differential topology in order to define and study important features such as event horizons {{which may or may not}} be present.|$|E
25|$|The {{assertion}} that the Cubist depiction of space, mass, time, and volume supports (rather than contradicts) the <b>flatness</b> of the canvas was made by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler as early as 1920, but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially by Clement Greenberg.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flatness</b> of {{the local}} terrain and {{proximity}} to the bay have made flooding a recurring problem for the area. Baytown and surrounding communities once relied on groundwater for its needs, but severe land subsidence has forced much the city to turn to ground-level water sources.|$|E
25|$|In metric {{theories}} of gravitation such as general relativity, {{it is usually}} not possible to give general definitions of important physical concepts such as mass and angular momentum; however, assuming asympotical <b>flatness</b> allows one to employ convenient definitions which do make sense for asymptotically flat solutions.|$|E
25|$|Two of the {{technological}} innovations developed at The Face Companies {{under his leadership}} were recognized with NOVA Awards, the highest international honor for innovation in construction. Those innovations were Concrete Slab <b>Flatness</b> / F-Number System (1990) and The Lightning Switch Wireless Electric Switch (2006). , no other company had been the sole developer {{of more than one}} NOVA-winning innovation.|$|E
25|$|Highway {{fatalities}} {{have decreased}} nationally, but by 2001, had increased in Florida and locally. Officials {{were focused on}} setting and enforcing speed limits and widening the local turnpike. The <b>flatness</b> of the area prevented runoff during rainstorms and caused cars to hydroplane. The highway department has taken measures to re-engineer roads to avoid hydroplaning. Fatalities reached a high of 99 in 2007. In 2009 there were 51 fatalities.|$|E
25|$|In December 1981, Guth read a {{paper from}} Moscow {{physicist}} Andrei Linde {{saying that the}} whole universe is within just one bubble, so nothing is destroyed by wall collisions. This conclusion was made using a Higgs field with an energy graph that was originally proposed by Sidney Coleman and Erick Weinberg. Guth discussed this with Linde, who had independently been working on bubble inflation, but without considering the <b>flatness</b> problem. Linde and Guth eventually exchanged papers on the subject.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{scattered}} uninhabited small oases, usually {{linked to}} the major depressions, where water can be found by digging to a few feet in depth. In the west there is a widely dispersed group of oases in unconnected shallow depressions, the Kufra group, consisting of Tazerbo, Rebianae and Kufra. Aside from the scarps, the general <b>flatness</b> is only interrupted {{by a series of}} plateaus and massifs near the centre of the Libyan Desert, around the convergence of the Egyptian-Sudanese-Libyan borders.|$|E
25|$|The first {{settlers}} of Fuerteventura {{are believed}} to have come from North Africa. The word Mahorero (Majorero) or Maho is still used today to describe the people of Fuerteventura and is derived from the ancient word 'mahos', a type of goatskin shoe worn by these original inhabitants. They lived in caves and semi-subterranean dwellings, some of which have been excavated, revealing remnants of early tools and pottery. In antiquity, the island was known o.a. as Planaria, in reference to the <b>flatness</b> of most of its terrain.|$|E
25|$|While the {{comparative}} <b>flatness</b> of Western Siberia {{was at least}} fairly well served by the gigantic Ob–Irtysh–Tobol–Chulym river system, the mighty rivers of Eastern Siberia - the Yenisei, the upper course of the Angara River (the Angara below Bratsk was not easily navigable because of the rapids), and the Lena - were mostly navigable only in the north-south direction. An attempt to partially remedy the situation by building the Ob-Yenisei Canal was not particularly successful. Only a railway could be a real solution to the region's transport problems.|$|E
25|$|Nail growth record {{can show}} the history of recent health and {{physiological}} imbalances, and {{has been used as}} a diagnostic tool since ancient times. Deep transverse grooves known as Beau's lines may form across the nails (not along the nail from cuticle to tip) and are usually a natural consequence of aging, though they may result from disease. Discoloration, thinning, thickening, brittleness, splitting, grooves, Mees' lines, small white spots, receded lunula, clubbing (convex), <b>flatness,</b> and spooning (concave) can indicate illness in other areas of the body, nutrient deficiencies, drug reaction or poisoning, or merely local injury.|$|E
