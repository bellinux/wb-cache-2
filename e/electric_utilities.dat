5|$|On October8, the {{remnants}} of Laura reached the Netherlands. At the time, its rain bands began interacting with a cold front associated with a well-developed low west of Norway, dropping up to 113mm (4.4in) of precipitation in the northwestern Netherlands. Consequently, streets and homes {{in the village of}} Hippolytushoef were reportedly inundated. The large amounts of precipitation broke the daily and monthly rainfall records for October, which were previously set in 2006. Gradually passing through Norway, {{the remnants}} of the storm caused significant damage to <b>electric</b> <b>utilities.</b> As a result, more than 10,000 people lost power in southern parts of the country.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} real effects of parent firm {{diversification}} on their <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> operating companies over the period, 1990 - 2003. Since <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> operating companies produce a single homogenous product, we can better measure their Total Factor Productivity and make valid comparisons of productivity across firms. We find that, {{consistent with a}} diversification discount, greater parent diversification is associated with lower productivity across <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> operating companies. However, the productivity of the <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> operating companies improves with greater parent diversification over time. Diversification appears to provide an alternative channel to divert investment dollars away from overinvestment in the core electric business. Finally, {{we find that the}} improvement in the productivity of the <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> operating companies from greater parent firm diversification over time is limited to financially constrained firms. This suggests that when managers have no resources to waste, {{it is more likely that}} any diversification activities are carefully planned and undertaken for strategic purposes that can help to increase productivity of the core business. ...|$|R
5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and <b>electric</b> <b>utilities,</b> metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{was born}} in Indiana in 1892; both his parents were lawyers, and he also became one. He served in World War I but was not sent to France until {{the final days of}} the war, and saw no action. Willkie settled in Akron, Ohio, where he was {{initially}} employed by Firestone, but left for a law firm, becoming one of the leaders of the Akron bar. Much of his work was representing <b>electric</b> <b>utilities,</b> and in 1929 Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C), a utility holding company. He was rapidly promoted, and became corporate president in 1933. Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C, and announced plans for a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) that would supply power in competition with C Between 1933 and 1939, Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress, in the courts, and before the public. He was ultimately unsuccessful, but sold C's property for a good price, and gained public esteem.|$|E
