5|$|There is however little {{evidence}} for any trace fossils in the Ediacaran Period, which may speak against the active grazing theory. Further, {{the onset of}} the Cambrian Period is defined by the appearance of a worldwide trace fossil assemblage, quite <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> activity-barren Ediacaran Period.|$|E
5|$|This {{secretion}} process {{occurs in}} {{all types of}} mammalian milk, including human and bovine. However, it is <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lipid secretion mechanism used by all other non-mammary cells.

5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> active site, that bind to {{molecules}} in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in}} the conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux {{through the rest of the}} pathway.|$|E

5|$|Although {{theoretically}} a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi {{dominated the}} RCC, {{although some of}} the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses. Gaddafi remained the government's public face, with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970. All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.|$|E
5|$|An {{enduring}} theme {{during and}} after the oil boom has been a reluctance among Texans to relinquish their identity and a stubbornness in maintaining their cultural heritage in the face of drastic changes to the state brought by the sudden wealth. Despite its growth and industrialization, Texas culture in the mid-20th century remained <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other industrial centers of the nation.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue.|$|E

5|$|Basic to {{the second}} group is a clade {{consisting}} of both species sofar included in Ploceus that live on Madagascar, P. nelicourvi and P. sakalava, and these are morphologically very <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> remaining species. These two species could in future be assigned to the genus Nelicurvius that was erected by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850, but which was merged with Ploceus later on. This second group further contains the genera Malimbus and Anaplectes, and all remaining Ploceus species.|$|E

The people of southwestern Gaul and northeastern Hispania (roughly present-day Aquitaine and Navarre) were {{regarded}} by Julius Caesar as ethnically <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Celts, and the Aquitanian language they spoke was Vasconic like Basque, judging from place names. The Aquitani adopted Latin under Roman rule.|$|E
5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues (or R) was a musical {{movement}} that developed in the United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a peak in the mid-1960s. It overlapped with, but was <b>distinct</b> <b>from,</b> <b>the</b> broader British beat and more purist British blues scenes, attempting to emulate the music of African American blues and rock and roll pioneers, such as Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. It often placed greater emphasis on guitars and was often played with greater energy.|$|E

However, Himantura tutul is genetically distinct, reproductively isolated, and partly <b>distinct</b> morphologically <b>from</b> <b>the</b> leopard whipray Himantura leoparda {{with which it}} was previously confused, and both are morphologically and genetically <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> H. uarnak.

5|$|Folk {{music is}} {{sometimes}} divided into several spheres of geographic influence, a classification system of three regions, southern, central and northern, proposed by Alan Lomax in 1956 and often repeated. Additionally, Curt Sachs proposed {{the existence of}} two quite distinct kinds of folk music in Europe: continental and Mediterranean, and others have placed the transition zone from the former to the latter roughly in north-central Italy, approximately between Pesaro and La Spezia. The central, northern and southern parts of the peninsula each share certain musical characteristics, and are each <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> music of Sardinia.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy pygmy {{hippopotamus}} and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, <b>distinct</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hippos on the African continent, {{and they would have}} been much better runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of Malagasy hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E
5|$|French Creole {{music is}} most famously {{associated}} with Martinique and Guadeloupe, though {{the islands of}} Saint Lucia and Dominica are also home to French Antillean music.

The quadrille is a potent symbol of French Antillean culture.|$|E
