50|$|Although {{it is easy}} {{to compare}} {{aircraft}} on simple numbers such as maximum speed or service ceiling, an examination of the flight envelope will reveal far more information. Generally a design with a larger area under the curve will have better all-around performance. This is because when the plane is not flying {{at the edges of the}} envelope, its extra power will be greater, and that means more power for things like climbing or maneuvering. General aviation aircraft have very small <b>flight</b> <b>envelopes,</b> with speeds ranging from perhaps 50 to 200 mph, whereas the extra power available to modern fighter aircraft result in huge <b>flight</b> <b>envelopes</b> with many times the area. As a tradeoff however, military aircraft often have a higher stalling speed. As a result of this the landing speed is also higher.|$|E

50|$|Aircraft have a <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> that {{describes}} its safe performance limits {{in regard to}} such things as minimum and maximum operating speeds, and its operating structural strength. <b>Flight</b> <b>envelope</b> protection calculates that <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> (and adds a margin of safety) and uses this information to stop pilots from making control inputs that would put the aircraft outside that <b>flight</b> <b>envelope.</b> For example, if the pilot uses the rearward side-stick to pitch the aircraft nose up, the control computers creating the <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> protection will prevent the pilot pitching the aircraft beyond the stalling angle of attack. As a result, even if the pilot tried to apply more and more rearward control, the <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> protection would cause the aircraft to ignore this command. <b>Flight</b> <b>envelope</b> protection can in this way increase aircraft safety by allowing the pilot to apply in an emergency maximum control forces while not {{at the same time}} inadvertently putting the aircraft outside the margins of its operational safety.|$|R

5000|$|People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) - 59 Su-27 fighters, {{consisting}} of 33 Su-27SKs and 26 Su-27UBKs as of January 2013. 78 Flankers were delivered under three separate contracts by the Russian KnAAPO and IAPO plants. Delivery {{of the aircraft}} began in February 1991 and finished by September 2009. The first contract was for 20 Su-27SK and 4 Su-27UBK aircraft. The deal, known as '906 Project' within China, saw the Su-27 exported to a foreign country for the first time. In February 1991, an Su-27 performed a flight demonstration at Beijing's Nanyuan Airport. The official induction to service with the PLAAF occurred shortly thereafter. China found some of the delivered Su-27UBKs are [...] "second-handed", consequently Russia delivered 2 more Su-27UBKs to China as a compensation. Chinese Su-27 pilots described its performance as [...] "outstanding" [...] in all aspects and <b>flight</b> <b>envelopes.</b> Differences over the payment method delayed {{the signing of the}} second, identical contract. For the first batch, 70% of the payment had been made in barter transactions with light industrial goods and food. Russian Federation argued that future transactions should be made in US dollars. In May 1995, Chinese Central Military Commission Vice Chairman, Liu Huaqing visited Russia and agreed to the term, on a condition that the production line of Su-27 be imported. The contract was signed the same year. Delivery of the final aircraft from the second batch, which consists of 16 Su-27SKs and 8 Su-27UBKs occurred in July 1996. In preparation for the expanding Su-27 fleet, the PLAAF sought to augment its trainer fleet. On 3 December 1999, a third contract was signed, this time for 28 Su-27UBKs. All 76 of the aircraft featured strengthened airframe and landing gear - result of the PLAAF demands that the fighter has a [...] "usable" [...] air-ground capability. As a result, the aircraft are capable of employing most of the conventional Air-to-Ground ordnance produced by Russia. Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) increased to 33,000 kg (72,750 lb). As is common for Russian export fighters, the active jamming device was downgraded; Su-27's L005 ECM pod was replaced with the L203/L204 pod. Furthermore, there were slight avionics differences between the batches. The first batch had N001E radar, while the later aircraft had N001P radar, capable of engaging two targets at the same time. Additionally, ground radar and navigational systems were upgraded. The aircraft are not capable of deploying the R-77 [...] "Adder" [...] missile due to a downgraded fire control system, except for the last batch of 28 Su-27UBKs.|$|E

40|$|Aircraft {{dynamics}} at high {{angles of}} attack due to loss {{of stability and}} control essentially limits its manoeuvrability. Modern control systems implement <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> protection {{at the cost of}} maneuverability to improve safety in these conditions. <b>Flight</b> <b>envelope</b> boundaries, which are set taking into account deterioration of stability and controllability due to separated flow, can be expanded by appropriate design of control laws.

Ill. (some col.) Aircraft have a manufacturer prescribed operating <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> for safe operation. exceeding these limits {{can result in}} unrecoverable departures or even structural failure. Numerous commercial aircraft accidents {{in the past have}} been attributed to loss-of-control (LOC) resulting from exceeding the safe operating <b>flight</b> <b>envelope.</b> Hence, real-time knowledge of the safe operating <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> is essential for safe flight operation, a problem known as dynamic <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> assessment. This dissertation explores dynamic <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> assessment from a control theoretic perspective. Two notions of the <b>flight</b> <b>envelope,</b> namely, the reachable sets and the region-of-attraction analysis are investigated. The NASA generic transport model (GTM) aircraft dynamics is used as an application problem. Linear and nonlinear techniques for <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> assessment are formulated in the linear matrix inequality (LMI) and sum-of-squares (SOS) framework, respectively. LMI and SOS problems are computationally tractable convex optimization problems for which many semi-definite programming solvers are available. This thesis also investigated fault detection and isolation strategies. Commercial jet transport aircrafts make extensive use of active controls. Faults or failures in the flight control system (FCS) elements like sensors or control effectors can lead to catastrophic failure. Model-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) filters can provide analytical redundancy by reliably detecting such faults in the system. Practical application of model-based FDI filters is limited so far due to poor performance, false alarms and missed detection arising out of uncertain dynamics of the aircraft, effect of nonlinearities in the system and the influence of closed-loop controllers. An application of closed-loop metrics to assess worst case FDI filter performance {{in the presence of a}} controller and uncertain dynamics is presented. Longitudinal GTM dynamics are considered. An H∞ FDI filter and a geometric filter design are compared using the metrics and the results validated through simulation. This research was expanded to include synthesis, real-time implementation and flight validation of robust FDI filters for a small uninhabited aerial vehicle. The influence of different closed-loop controllers on FDI filter performance is investigated. A comparison is presented between simulation of the predicted FDI filter performance and flight experiment results...|$|R
