25|$|Near {{the end of}} 1803, {{a number}} of people claimed to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> even been {{attacked}} by a ghost in the Hammersmith area of London, a ghost believed by locals to be the spirit of a suicide victim. On 3 January 1804, a member of one of the armed patrols set up {{in the wake of the}} reports shot and killed a bricklayer, Thomas Millwood, mistaking the white clothes of Millwood's trade for a ghostly apparition. The culprit, a 29-year-old excise officer named Francis Smith, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, commuted to one year's hard labour.|$|E
25|$|A fact {{important}} to the later development of the steam locomotive by others was that, in 1797 and 1798, Richard Trevithick came to live in Redruth {{next door to the}} house where William Murdoch lived (1782 to 1798). Trevithick would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> been influenced by Murdoch's experiments, and would certainly have been aware of his work in this area. There is also a story told by Murdoch's son John of a visit by Trevithick and Andrew Vivian to see a model engine in 1794: The model of the wheel carriage engine was made in the summer of 1792 and was then shown to many of the inhabitants of Redruth – about two years after Trevithick and A. Vivian called at my father's house in Redruth... My father mentions that... on that day they asked him to show his model of the wheel carriage engine which worked with strong steam and no vacuum. This was immediately shown to them in a working state.|$|E
25|$|The {{diplomatic}} unrest {{around this}} question disturbed De Witt no end. His initial relations with Louis {{had been very}} amicable. In 1662 he renewed the old alliance with France, as we <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>and</b> this alliance was helpful in the conflict with England and Munster, when the French sent auxiliary troops to help shore up the Dutch eastern defenses in 1665. Except for the Caribbean, France did not {{take part in the}} war with England. As a matter of fact the new French West India Company, formed in 1664, took Cayenne by force away from the WIC in 1665, but the Dutch were forced to grin and bear this, because of the ongoing war with England at the time. But the way Louis was acting in the matter of the Spanish Netherlands made De Witt anxious that the old partition treaty should not become operational. It offered a number of equally unpalatable prospects for the Dutch: unwanted incorporation of Antwerp (the blockade of which was now enshrined in the peace treaty of 1648 with Spain) would open up that city's trade; and a resurgent France as an immediate neighbor would necessitate the building up of the standing army, an expense the regents wanted to avoid at all costs.|$|E

The South African national cricket captain, Graeme Smith, said that he wanted Kieswetter to return to play cricket in South Africa; rather than directly inviting him to play for the South Africa national cricket team, he stated that [...] "the challenge is to get him back into our franchise system first, but he is certainly someone we <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> would like {{to get back into the}} system". Kieswetter repeated his desire to play international cricket for England.|$|E
500|$|A third {{account was}} made by a private named John Shaw who was in Washington's regiment, but not present at the affair. [...] His account, based on {{detailed}} accounts from others who were present, was made in a sworn statement on August 21; the details on Tanacharison's role in the affair are confirmed in a newspaper account printed on June 27. [...] In his account, the French were surrounded while some still slept. [...] Alerted by a noise, one of the Frenchmen [...] "fired a Gun upon which Col. Washington gave the Word for all his Men to fire. [...] Several of them being killed, the rest betook themselves to flight, but our Indians haveing gone round the French ... they fled back to the English and delivered up their Arms ... Some Time after the Indians came up the Half King took his Tomahawk and split the Head of the French Captain haveing first {{asked if he was}} an Englishman and haveing been told he was a French Man. [...] He then took his Brains and washed his Hands with them and then scalped him. [...] All this ... has heard and never heard it contradicted but knows nothing of it from his own Knowledge". [...] Shaw's narrative is substantially correct on a number of other details, including the size and composition of both forces. [...] Shaw also claimed to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> counted the dead, numbering 13or 14.|$|E

Part of this success was due to his unique offensive system, the same system that countless coaches use today. John Wooden stated, [...] "I believe my system is perfectly suited to counter all the modern defenses I <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>and</b> that includes run-and-jump, 1–3–1 trapping, box-and-one, triangle-and-two, and switching man-to-man." ...|$|E

2500|$|From November 1803, {{a number}} of people in the Hammersmith area claimed to <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>and</b> some to have been {{attacked}} by, a ghost. Local people said the ghost was of a man who had committed suicide the previous year, and had been buried in Hammersmith churchyard. [...] The contemporary belief was that suicide victims should not be buried in consecrated ground, as their souls would not then be at rest. The apparition was described as being very tall and dressed all in white, but was also said to wear a calfskin garment with horns and large glass eyes at other times.|$|E
2500|$|We have {{described}} what optical solitons are and, using mathematics, {{we have seen}} that, {{if we want to}} create them, we have to create a field with a particular shape (just sech for the first order) with a particular power related to the duration of the impulse. But what if we are a bit wrong in creating such impulses? Adding small perturbations to the equations and solving them numerically, it is possible to show that mono-dimensional solitons are stable. They are often referred as [...] solitons, meaning that they are limited in one dimension (x or t, as we <b>have</b> <b>seen)</b> <b>and</b> propagate in another one (z).|$|E
2500|$|He died in Canberra aged 80, on 1 August 2011. Ian Pieris, a {{contemporary}} Sri Lankan who played under Goonesena at Cambridge, said: “Gamini was easily the best leg-spinner I <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>and</b> {{probably the best}} all-round cricketer this country produced after the War. He had a keen cricket brain, and as a captain, stood heads and shoulders above his contemporaries in England {{at a time when}} there were captains in the counties such as Peter May (Surrey), Colin Cowdrey (Kent) and Cyril Washbrook (Lancashire) to name a few. He always led from the front be it in bowling, batting or fielding. Gamini would throw himself totally into the game and never gave up. Sadly, Sri Lanka was not able to make proper use of his cricketing brain.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Beyond the Black Rainbow {{has been}} praised for its visual style. Cosmatos {{declared}} that his [...] "modernist" [...] {{use of color}} was influenced by Michael Mann's Manhunter (1986) and The Keep (1983). The blue hue cinematography – the [...] "night mode" [...] as Cosmatos dubbed it – {{was inspired by the}} freezer room scene in John Carpenter's Dark Star (1974). Norm Li cited other references: Daft Punk's Electroma (2006), Dario Argento's Suspiria (1977), and George Lucas' THX 1138 (1971). A number of reviewers noted similarities between BtBR and Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968) and A Clockwork Orange (1971). [...] "I love Stanley Kubrick, and <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>and</b> probably internalized, all of his work, but any similarity was not my intent", explained Cosmatos. Critics have also compared Beyond the Black Rainbow to Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972), Ken Russell's Altered States (1980), and Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void (2010). Of the latter, the director deemed it [...] "a very interesting, very beautiful film." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{an exhilarating}} flight, Carter arrives at last at the abode of the gods, but finds it empty. Finally a great {{procession}} arrives with much fanfare, {{led by a}} pharaoh-like man who explains to Carter that the gods of earth have seen the city of Carter's dreams and decided to make it their home, and have thus abandoned Kadath. The gods walk no more {{in the ways of}} gods, and have become instead mere denizens of the jewelled city Carter had glimpsed in his dreams. The pharaoh commands Carter to find this city, so that the natural order might be restored. [...] "It is not over unknown seas," [...] he says, [...] "but back over well-known years that your quest must go; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sun-drenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes. For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> loved in youth... These things you saw, Randolph Carter, when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime, and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love."

2500|$|However, {{soon the}} hopes of the Dutch peace-mongers were dashed with the {{re-appointment}} of Sir George Downing as English ambassador in The Hague. Downing had also represented the Commonwealth since 1657, but switched his support to the new régime in time. He was not {{a friend of the}} Dutch, as they well knew. On his return he immediately started meddling in Dutch internal affairs by stoking up Orangist sentiment and by undermining De Witt where possible. The situation was ripe for this, as the Princess Mary had made great advances since August, 1660, convincing Zeeland and Friesland to come out in favor of promising a future stadtholdership for William. The other provinces did not recognize the Act of Exclusion, as we <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>and</b> even Holland started to have second thoughts. Leiden and Haarlem proposed that the Prince would be designated stadtholder in future, and De Witt deflected this with some difficulty, at the same time making financial concessions to William's mother, promising to pay for his education as [...] "Child of State". To further mollify her (in hopes of her influencing her brother in favor of the Dutch), the Act of Exclusion was formally revoked in September, 1660 (the Commonwealth having expired as a state, this could be excused as not being a breach of treaty).|$|E
