500|$|Oh said of Yang's {{expressions}} of emotions during season eight: [...] "You see her express her emotions {{with only two}} people: her best friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart {{and then you have}} to pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> soon." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked" [...] saw the {{departure}} of Stevens, following the breakdown of her marriage with Karev. Series' writer Joan Rater commented on this: [...] "Izzie getting the clean scan back gives Alex the freedom to leave. Because {{he never would have}} left her when she was sick, he's a good guy. And I'm not saying that Alex ever consciously thought, I can’t leave her while she's sick, but now that she's not, now that she seems like she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>better,</b> it just comes to him. He deserves more. He's a good guy and he deserves more. But loving Izzie showed him that he can be good, is good. So it was a little gift. And when he tells Izzie he's done, he's not bitter or angry, he's just done." [...] The writing of the two-part season six finale, caused struggle to Rhimes. She elaborated on this: ...|$|E

500|$|McKidd has {{referred}} to his character and the character of Cristina Yang as [...] "soulmates." [...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. [...] But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> soon." ...|$|E

Thomas Gaffey, D-Meriden, co-chairman of the legislature's education committee. [...] "We need to shift away from the model of remedy {{that the state has}} been pursuing for years.

The hand-drawn comic made something of a return in the storyline [...] "All Good Things"—the hand-drawn format is used to represent George's home dimension, though this time drawn by Liss, Dave's wife.

30|$|Many {{participants}} {{discussed how}} {{their participation in}} CrossFit prompted changes in how they regarded the relationship between food and fitness. Most frequently, participants remarked that their participation in CrossFit had underscored for them the notion that what they ate impacted their athletic performance. Accordingly, participants discussed the notion of “eating to perform,” which frequently entailed the need to increase their food consumption to “to fuel for a workout” (Rachel, 28  years): “[I’ve experienced a] shift from thinking about calories to thinking about…[food as]…fuel, if I don’t eat enough I’m just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> never <b>get</b> <b>better,</b> because my muscles are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be super tired all the time” (Emma, 26  years).|$|R

[...] In the studio with his backing musicians, Fullbright was almost immediately captivated by what he was hearing. Although he initially thought he would leave the studio with a demo record, he says: [...] "We got lost in it in those three hours we were recording.

Oh, Peter, hurry up and get well, for we are having such good times and we miss you so much.

I haven't the dixonary handy, and if I ask the others Felicity will laugh at me, though she cannot spell lots of words herself.) I am saving some of the Honourable Mr. Whalen's pears for you. I've got them hid where nobody can find them. There's only a dozen because Dan et all the rest, but I guess you will like them.

I haven't anything else valuable, since I gave Sara Ray my forget-me-not jug, but if you would like anything I've got let me know and I'll leave instructions for you to have it.

I can focus on what I'm much better at, which is making music. I'm just not cut out for that role. I kind of fell into it a few years ago - the live show had to happen, I had to be the frontman because I was doing the vocals on the songs. It went all right.

His signature feat was throwing by hand and individually breaking seven clay targets with a Winchester Model 12, 12 gauge pump action shotgun. Able to eject and shoot the hulls of a Model 61, [...]22 pump rifle, Herb was the behind-the-camera shot maker and technical adviser for James Stewart's 1950 movie Winchester '73. Parsons was mentioned by Dr. Mallard in the NCIS episode [...] "Ships in the Night", but Leroy Jethro Gibbs doesn't know who he is. Take the last (duck in a group) to begin with...By taking the last one, you keep the swing right on through.

5000|$|On August 27, 2013, Samadi {{appeared}} as a guest on {{a segment of the}} Fox & Friends morning television show to discuss whether women should pay more than men for health insurance. At the time of the interview, the gender rating for insurance premiums was common practice among health insurers, with estimates that women paid about $1 billion a year more than men on health insurance. However, under the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010 (″Obamacare″), the practice was banned effective January 1, 2014, and this is considered {{to be one of the}} most uncontroversial provisions in the law. Samadi argued that women pay more for health insurance, because they, for a number of reasons, tend to use the health care system more than men. He stated that women go through more preventive screening; they give birth; they have mammograms and PAP smears; men do not like to go to the doctor. [...] He said: [...] "I just think that the whole system is not working well. I mean this is one of the examples, where men and women are totally different, there is a sex difference when it comes to the health care use, but I really think that if you pay for it, you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> negotiate, finding out where is the best doctor, where you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a <b>better</b> deal on all these X-rays etc., that's how you're gonna save money." ...|$|R

The innovative decisions are implemented by the wide use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) : national e-Government portal, qualified electronic signature, interoperability and standardization. The national e-Government portal works successfully. Its free and unlimited access provides fast and reliable administrative service. It helps integrate the information systems which are used in all administrative levels. It is reached a satisfactory level of security by a qualified electronic signature. The electronic signature provides data protection and allows the wide use of e-Services. A form of interoperability is carried out by centralizedly stored registers which provide broad overall information for each management level. Unification of the public administration processes and typification of the different operations from public administration process are presented. They enhance the effectiveness of administrative services. These innovative decisions are implemented by the wide use of advanced ICT methods as information modeling and the forms of standardization - unification and typification.
