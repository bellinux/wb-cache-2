The C-SPAN School Bus, introduced in November 1993, traveled around the U.S. educating the public about government and politics using C-SPAN resources, {{and served as a}} mobile television studio. The bus also recorded video footage of the places that it visited. A second bus was introduced in 1996. The two original buses were retired in 2010, and the C-SPAN Digital Bus was inaugurated, introducing the public to C-SPAN's enhanced digital products. C-SPAN has also equipped six Local Content Vehicles (LCVs) to travel the country and record unique political and historical stories, with each vehicle containing production and web-based technologies to produce on-the-spot content.|$|E

Chitwood, the chairman of the House Education Committee, who became the first Texas Tech business manager, spoke at the event. Chitwood served in the position only fifteen months; he died in November 1926.

The school grew to around 100 pupils on the register in 1900. The church building, also used for Wesleyen Sunday school, was used as a school until 1929. For this period the Education Department rented it from the Church trustees. A new school was built, on donated land, opposite the church and next to the recreation ground. This state school was opened in a ceremony on 23 August 1929. The school remained open as late as the end of 1954.|$|E
5|$|Measure 32 was {{a medium}} pattern of {{obtrusive}} polygons in navy blue or black, against background polygons of lighter grays and greens. This measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack. Patterns were carried across the bow, and light gray was used aft to blend with the wake. This measure {{was based on}} the World War I dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific; and was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944 and 1945. Different patterns were devised <b>for</b> <b>classes</b> with large numbers of ships so the pattern would not identify the class of ship.|$|E

5|$|The West Florida Seminary, {{also known}} as the Florida State Seminary, opened <b>for</b> <b>classes</b> in Tallahassee in 1857, {{absorbing}} the Florida Institute, which had been established as an inducement for the state to place the seminary in the city. The former Florida Institute property, located where the historic Westcott Building now stands, is the oldest continuously used site of higher education in Florida. The area, slightly west of the state Capitol, was formerly and ominously known as Gallows Hill, a place for public executions in early Tallahassee. In 1858 the seminary absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy, established in 1843, and became coeducational.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved from}} Florence, South Carolina, to New York City {{at the age}} of 17. Working a variety of jobs, he saved enough money to pay <b>for</b> <b>classes</b> at the prestigious National Academy of Design. He took a preparatory class with Charles Louis Hinton, then studied with Charles Courtney Curran and George Willoughby Maynard, all of whom {{emphasized}} classical portraiture and figure drawing. Beginning in 1923, Johnson worked with the painter Charles Webster Hawthorne, who emphasized the importance of color in painting. John studied with Hawthorne at the Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown, Massachusetts during the summers, paying for his tuition, food and lodging by working as a general handyman at the school. Johnson received a number of awards at the National Academy of Design, and applied for a coveted Pulitzer Travel Scholarship in his final year. When another student was given the award, Hawthorne raised nearly $1000 to enable Johnson to go abroad to study.|$|E
5|$|Novelist {{and social}} {{commentator}} Walter Besant proposed a 'Palace of Delight' with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, an art school and various classes, social rooms and frequent fêtes and dances. This {{coincided with a}} project by the philanthropist businessman, Edmund Hay Currie {{to use the money}} from the winding up of the 'Beaumont Trust', together with subscriptions to build a 'People's Palace' in the East End. Five acres of land were secured on the Mile End Road, and the Queen's Hall was opened by Queen Victoria on 14 May 1887. The complex was completed with a library, swimming pool, gymnasium and winter garden, by 1892, providing an eclectic mix of populist entertainment and education. A peak of 8000 'tickets' were sold <b>for</b> <b>classes</b> in 1892, and by 1900, a Bachelor of Science degree awarded by the University of London was introduced. In 1931, the building was destroyed by fire, but the Draper's Company, major donors to the original scheme, invested more to rebuild the technical college and create Queen Mary's College in December 1934. A new 'People's Palace' was constructed, in 1937, by the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, in St Helen's Terrace. This finally closed in 1954.|$|E
40|$|Examination of induced sputum and {{measurement}} of exhaled NO have been advocated as noninvasive methods of assessing {{the degree of}} airway inflammation. In this study, we performed follow-up evaluation on 71 subjects with asthma caused by exposure to Western red cedar; 50 subjects had left exposure, whereas the rest continued {{to work in the}} same job. Spirometry, methacholine challenge tests, exhaled nitric oxide, and sputum induction were carried out. Of the 50 subjects who left exposure, 12 had no respiratory impairment according to the American Throacic Society guidelines for assessing respiratory impairment in patients with asthma, 17 belonged to Class 1, 12 to Class 2, five to Class 3, and four to Class 4. The percentage of eosinophils in induced sputum showed a significant inverse relationship with FEV 1 (r = − 0. 46, p < 0. 001), and a significant positive correlation with levels of exhaled NO (r = 0. 42, p < 0. 001) and with the class of respiratory impairment (r = 0. 52, p < 0. 001). Mean percent eosinophils were 1. 5 <b>for</b> impairment <b>Class</b> 0, 2. 2 <b>for</b> <b>Class</b> 1, 1. 7 <b>for</b> <b>Class</b> 2, 6. 8 <b>for</b> <b>Class</b> 3, and 16. 3 <b>for</b> <b>Class</b> 4.

5|$|Poe {{may have}} become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he {{registered}} at the one-year-old University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages. The university, in its infancy, was established on the ideals of its founder Thomas Jefferson. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students {{to choose their own}} studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate. During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. Poe claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register <b>for</b> <b>classes,</b> purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased. Poe gave up on the university after a year, but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer. At some point, he started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet.|$|E

Sledd managed the move of the school's assets from Lake City to Gainesville during the late summer of 1906, and participated in the official dedication of the campus on September 27, 1906. When registration <b>for</b> <b>classes</b> was held in Gainesville on September 24, 1906, there were 102 students and {{fewer than a dozen}} faculty members.
