40|$|This paper adds to {{the series}} of {{writings}} on Islamic home financing presented and published by the author since February 2010. It spells out certain norms Islamic banks must observe in home financing and demonstrates that the conventional model based on an Excel formula {{does not meet the}} stated norms. It may well be emphasized that in Islam the question of observing these norms arises before, and not after, the selection of the formula; additional juristic requirements may only follow subsequently. Is it not then strange many Islamic banks are using the formula to determine the periodic <b>instalment</b> <b>payments</b> in their home financing programs? The paper finds, for example, the popular Musharakah-Mutanaqisa Partnership (MMP) Islamic home financing model to be non-compliant with the stated norms. It presents a new model―the Zubair Diminishing Balance Method (ZDBM) ― and argues that the alternative is not only fully observant but is superior to the MMP model on some other counts as well. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{coverage}} of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) remains low despite existing distribution strategies, hence, {{it was important}} to assess consumers' preferences for distribution of ITNs, as well as their perceptions and expenditures for malaria prevention and to examine the implications for scaling-up ITNs in rural Nigeria. Methods Nine focus group discussions (FGDs) and questionnaires to 798 respondents from three malaria hyper-endemic villages from Enugu state, south-east Nigeria were the study tools. Results There was a broad spectrum of malaria preventive tools being used by people. The average monthly expenditure on malaria prevention per household was 55. 55 Naira ($ 0. 4). More than 80 % of the respondent had never purchased any form of untreated mosquito net. People mostly preferred centralized community-based sales of the ITNS, with <b>instalment</b> <b>payments.</b> Conclusion People were knowledgeable about malaria and the beneficial effects of using nets to protect themselves from the disease. The mostly preferred community-based distribution of ITNs implies that the strategy is a potential untapped additional channel for scaling-up ITNs in Nigeria and possibly other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. </p...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a sample}} of small Belgian firms that reorganized under the 1997 Law on Judicial Composition, I empirically review the law's {{effectiveness}} to rehabilitate distressed debtors. The econometric findings show that firms with less pre-bankruptcy operational losses and a better cash position {{are more likely to}} successfully execute their reorganization plan and that certain debt restructuring measures can contribute to firm rescue. Despite these positive findings, many firms still failed to reorganise under the 1997 -reorganization law, which resulted in constant criticism on its effectiveness leading up to its recent replacement in 2009. My data also shows that within the former reorganization procedure the Belgian debtor was faced with high debt <b>instalment</b> <b>payments</b> compared to international practice and that successful plan execution relied too much on the uncertain realization of the operational cash flow projections. In discussing the legal framework of the new Law on Corporate Continuity enacted in 2009 -replacing the 1997 -law-I argue that this new law is a more effective legislation to save distressed businesses...|$|R

After Smaug was destroyed, the dwarves reclaimed the treasure, and Thorin, very pleased with Bilbo, gave the Hobbit a chain-mail coat made of mithril as the first <b>instalment</b> of his <b>payment.</b> Faced with demands from Thranduil the Elvenking and Bard the Bowman for {{a fair share of}} the treasure to be distributed to the wood-elves and the men of Lake-town, Thorin let greed get the better of him and refused to acknowledge their right to any of the hoard. He fortified the Mountain against his new rivals, and sent to his cousin Dáin Ironfoot for reinforcements. Thorin was furious when Bilbo stole the Arkenstone to use as a bargaining counter, and drove him from the Mountain. The growing conflict was averted only by an invasion of goblins and wargs, whereupon the dwarves joined forces with the wood-elves, the men of Lake-town, and the great eagles in {{what became known as the}} Battle of Five Armies. During the battle, Thorin was mortally wounded, but he made his peace with Bilbo before he died.|$|R

Jan Magnussen was drafted into the McLaren team to replace Mika Häkkinen because of the Finn's operation for appendicitis. The third driver change was Ukyo Katayama's return to Tyrrell after missing the European Grand Prix due to a crash at the Portuguese Grand Prix. Gianni Morbidelli returned to the Footwork team replacing Max Papis, while at Pacific, Bertrand Gachot came back to replace Jean-Denis Délétraz, both men having driven for these teams {{at the start of the}} season. Délétraz was replaced as he had not made agreed <b>payment</b> <b>instalments</b> to the Pacific team for the privilege of the drive. Pacific had originally intended to run local driver Katsumi Yamamoto in place of Délétraz, but he was not granted an FIA Super Licence and so Gachot retook the seat. Similarly, the Forti team's plans to replace Roberto Moreno with Hideki Noda came to nought for the same reason, even though Noda had started three Grands Prix for the Larrousse team the previous year.|$|R
60|$|She {{had told}} him before they started {{that they should be}} early; she wished to see Miss Birdseye alone, before the arrival of any one else. This was just for the {{pleasure}} of seeing her--it was an opportunity; she was always so taken up with others. She received Miss Chancellor in the hall of the mansion, which had a salient front, an enormous and very high number--756--painted in gilt on the glass light above the door, a tin sign bearing the name of a doctress (Mary J. Prance) suspended from one of the windows of the basement, and a peculiar look of being both new and faded--a kind of modern fatigue--like certain articles of commerce which are sold at a reduction as shop-worn. The hall was very narrow; a considerable part of it was occupied by a large hat-tree, from which several coats and shawls already depended; the rest offered space for certain lateral demonstrations on Miss Birdseye's part. She sidled about her visitors, and at last went round to open for them a door of further admission, which happened to be locked inside. She was a little old lady, with an enormous head; that was the first thing Ransom noticed--the vast, fair, protuberant, candid, ungarnished brow, surmounting a pair of weak, kind, tired-looking eyes, and ineffectually balanced in the rear by a cap which had the air of falling backward, and which Miss Birdseye suddenly felt for while she talked, with unsuccessful irrelevant movements. She had a sad, soft, pale face, which (and it was the effect of her whole head) {{looked as if it had}} been soaked, blurred, and made vague by exposure to some slow dissolvent. The long practice of philanthropy had not given accent to her features; it had rubbed out their transitions, their meanings. The waves of sympathy, of enthusiasm, had wrought upon them in the same way in which the waves of time finally modify the surface of old marble busts, gradually washing away their sharpness, their details. In her large countenance her dim little smile scarcely showed. It was a mere sketch of a smile, a kind of <b>instalment,</b> or <b>payment</b> on account; it seemed to say that she would smile more if she had time, but that you could see, without this, that she was gentle and easy to beguile.|$|R
40|$|In {{the post-war}} period, {{there were several}} largely {{unsuccessful}} attempts in England to introduce workable methods to directly tax land value uplifts. Since the 1970 s a system of negotiated project-specific agreements between local planning authorities and developers/landowners has evolved into the sole mechanism by which part of land value uplift ‘released’ by the grant of planning permission is captured by government. In 2010, {{in an attempt to}} simplify and speed up the planning process – negotiated planning obligations were regarded as time-consuming and a brake on development – the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) was introduced. After a slow start, CIL has now been adopted by approximately one third of local authorities. Originally intended as a simple flat rate charge to replace planning obligations, CIL now sits alongside that mechanism so that developers pay CIL to help fund infrastructure provision in the locality, whilst planning obligations help mitigate the impact of their development (including the provision of affordable housing). Over the last five years, for political as well as administrative reasons, a series of amendments to CIL and s 106 planning obligations have led to what many regard as a complicated set of regulations. <b>Payment</b> <b>instalment</b> policies, exemptions for small developments and self-build schemes, reliefs for exceptional circumstances and social housing, restrictions on the pooling of planning obligations, the award of credit for re-using vacant buildings, and revenue allocations to neighbourhood groups have been introduced by central government. At the local government level, planning authorities have been adopting more and more nuanced CIL charging schedules with differential rates depending on land use and location to an extent where, in some cases, CIL is more analogous to a development value tax than an infrastructure levy. The experience of running a system of negotiated planning obligations alongside a non-negotiable infrastructure levy offers an opportunity to evaluate these policy shifts in order to assess their strengths and weaknesses and whether there are any wider lessons for international discussions of best practice in land value capture. Drawing on reviews of planning obligations and CIL the paper will consider: how much revenue has been raised and how is it being used; whether developer contributions vary depending on where and when development takes place; the types of development that generate developer contributions and how the amount of developer contributions is assessed...|$|R

V prvem delu so podane splošne lastnosti zaporedij, aritmetično in geometrijsko zaporedje. Nadalje so predstavljene lastnosti vrst. V drugem delu sledi opredelitev pojmov, povezanih z računanjem kreditov (obresti, obrestna mera, obrestni račun). Poudarek je na izdelavi amortizacijskih oziroma odplačilnih načrtov. Upoštevali smo obe možnosti odplačevanja kredita: anuitetni in obročni način. V zadnjem delu smo predstavili praktični primer računanja kreditov. Izdelali smo odplačilni načrt za najeti kredit: izbrali smo vrsto kredita in znesek kredita, določili mesečno anuiteto in izbrali ustrezno obrestno mero. Za posamezno kapitalizacijsko obdobje smo nato izračunali obresti, razdolžnine in ostanke dolgov. Izračune smo primerjali z informativnim izračunom odplačilnega načrta, ki smo ga naredili na spletnih staneh NKBM. Za konec smo na primeru dveh izbranih bank (NLB in NKBM) naredili primerjavo informativnih izračunov za stanovanjski kredit. Določili smo znesek kredita in odplačilno dobo. Zanimala nas je mesečna anuiteta, ki bi jo morali plačevati ob najemu izbranega kredita. The {{purpose of}} this diploma work was to {{research}} the calculation of credits and {{the applicability of the}} mathematical instruments at calculating credits. The diploma work consists of three parts. In the first part the general properties of progressions, arithmetic progression and geometric progression are presented. Furthermore we have presented the characteristics of the sequences. In the second part there are definitions of conceptions, connected with calculating credits (interests, rate of interest, interest account). We wanted to emphasise the composition of amortisation schedules. We have considered both possibilities of repayment of the credit: the annuity and the <b>instalment’s</b> way of <b>payment.</b> In the last part the practical example of calculating the credits is presented. We have made a payment plan for the engaged credit: we have chosen the type and the amount of the credit, defined the month annuity and chosen the rate of interest. Then we have calculated the interests, redemption of debts and the rest of debts for every capitalization period. Our calculations were compared with the informative plan, which we have made on the NKBM 2 ̆ 7 s internet web page. At the end we have chosen two banks (NLB and NKBM) and made informative calculations for a residential credit. Then we have presented a few practical examples of credits calculations. We have defined the amount of the credit and the period of paying by installments. We were interested in the month annuity, which we should pay at the credit loan...|$|R
