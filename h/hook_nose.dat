500|$|The film {{employs a}} number of {{negative}} stereotypes of Jews as being materialistic, immoral, cunning, untrustworthy and physically unattractive. At one extreme, Jews are portrayed as cut-throat capitalists; at the other, they are depicted as poor, filthy immigrants. Mike Davis writes that, [...] "A thousand years of European anti-semitism were condensed into the cowering rapist, SÃ¼ss, with his dirty beard, <b>hook</b> <b>nose</b> and whining voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|At age 49, {{the years}} of {{reckless}} living and the {{thousands of miles of}} travel had taken their toll. Casanova's smallpox scars, sunken cheeks, and <b>hook</b> <b>nose</b> became all the more noticeable. His easygoing manner was now more guarded. Prince Charles de Ligne, a friend (and uncle of his future employer), described him around 1784: ...|$|E

60|$|Seated on {{what may}} be called his counter, smoking a nargileh, in a mulberry-coloured robe bordered with fur, and a dark turban, was a middle-aged man of {{sinister}} countenance and air, a long <b>hook</b> <b>nose</b> and a light blue eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{he was a}} very ill-favored fellow, sir," [...] replied Robin, [...] "with {{two great}} bumps on his forehead, a <b>hook</b> <b>nose,</b> fiery eyes; and, what struck me as the strangest, his face was of two {{different}} colors. Do you happen to know such a man, sir?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Queen, nonsense! {{you mean}} the Princess of Wales--pretty woman, petit nez retrousse, grew monstrous stout!" [...] {{suggested}} Mr. Brummell, whose reading was evidently not extensive. [...] "Sir Sidney Smith was a fine fellow, great talker, <b>hook</b> <b>nose,</b> so has Lord Cochrane, so has Lord Wellington. She was very sweet on Sir Sidney." ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{prosecution}} of his deep-laid plans, Stumps {{attracted the attention of}} a gentleman with exceedingly black eyes and hair, a <b>hook</b> <b>nose,</b> and rather seedy garments. This gentleman followed Stumps with great care for a considerable time, watched him attentively, seemed to make up his mind about him, and finally ran violently against him.|$|E
6000|$|... ''Tis {{their great}} leader,' said Saturn, {{as he pointed}} out the Titan to Proserpine, 'the giant Enceladus. He got us into all our scrapes, but I must do him the justice to add, {{that he is the}} only one who can ever get us out of them. They say he has no heart; but I think his <b>hook</b> <b>nose</b> is rather fine.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{leader was}} a tall, thin {{man with a}} leathern face, <b>hooked</b> <b>nose</b> and {{piercing}} gray eyes. His breast glittered with orders. It was von Kargenbrut, the military governor.|$|R
60|$|He {{was tall}} and gaunt, with <b>hooked</b> <b>nose</b> and deep-sunk eyes; he had {{cultivated}} a long, grey beard, and could call forth the powers of Mirrab the Witch with a remarkably solemn and guttural voice.|$|R
50|$|Shylock is a money-lender and {{was often}} portrayed with a <b>hooked</b> <b>nose</b> and bright red wigs. Shylock's {{character}} {{has been criticized}} for its anti-Semitic nature, although some interpretations of the play consider him a sympathetic figure.|$|R
60|$|With his rapid native action, {{his hands}} made {{the outline of}} a high <b>hook</b> <b>nose,</b> pushed his eyes near together, dishevelled his hair, puffed out his upper lip to {{represent}} a thick moustache, and threw the heavy end of an ideal cloak over his shoulder. While doing this, with a swiftness incredible to one who has not watched an Italian peasant, he indicated a very remarkable and sinister smile.|$|E
6000|$|The varlet {{was not an}} ill-favoured knave;[hq][555] [...] A {{good deal}} like a vulture in the face, [...] With a <b>hook</b> <b>nose</b> and a hawk's eye, which gave [...] A smart and sharper-looking sort of grace [...] To his whole aspect, which, though rather grave, [...] Was by no means so ugly as his case; [...] But that, indeed, was hopeless as can be, [...] Quite a poetic felony [...] "de se." ...|$|E
60|$|Look at {{that little}} boy {{sleeping}} there under the railway arch in the East End of London--not the boy with the black hair and the <b>hook</b> <b>nose</b> and the square under-jaw, but {{the one with the}} curly head, the extremely dirty face, and the dimpled chin, on the tip of whose snub nose the rising sun shines with a power that causes it to resemble a glowing carbuncle on a visage still lying in shadow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, what {{on earth}} do you mean?" [...] asked Miles, {{with a look of}} such genuine {{surprise}} that Redhair was puzzled, and the man with the <b>hooked</b> <b>nose,</b> who had been listening attentively, looked slightly confused.|$|R
60|$|Sir Ethelred {{opened a}} wide mouth, like a cavern, {{into which the}} <b>hooked</b> <b>nose</b> seemed anxious to peer; there came from it a subdued rolling sound, as from a distant organ with the scornful indignation stop.|$|R

60|$|The man {{was dressed}} like a traveller, in a {{foraging}} cap with fur about it, and a heap of cloak. He looked like a foreigner. He had a quantity of hair and moustache--jet black, except at the shaggy ends, where it had a tinge of red--and a high <b>hook</b> <b>nose.</b> He laughed at Mistress Affery's start and cry; and as he laughed, his moustache went up under his nose, and his nose came down over his moustache.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Prince {{was sitting}} at 'er front door nursing 'er three cats when 'e got there. She was an ugly, little old woman with {{piercing}} black eyes and a <b>hook</b> <b>nose,</b> and she 'ad a quiet, artful sort of a way with 'er that made 'er very much disliked. One thing was she was always making fun of people, and for another {{she seemed to be}} able to tell their thoughts, and that don't get anybody liked much, especially when they don't keep it to theirselves. She'd been a lady's maid all 'er young days, and it was very 'ard to be taken for a witch just because she was old.|$|E
6000|$|While {{they were}} thus employed, a tallish gentleman with a <b>hook</b> <b>nose</b> and black hair, {{dressed in a}} {{military}} surtout very short and tight in the sleeves, and which had once been frogged and braided all over, but was now sadly shorn of its garniture and quite threadbare--dressed too in ancient grey pantaloons fitting tight to the leg, {{and a pair of}} pumps in the winter of their existence--looked in at the door and smiled affably. Mrs Jarley's back being then towards him, the military gentleman shook his forefinger as a sign that her myrmidons were not to apprise her of his presence, and stealing up close behind her, tapped her on the neck, and cried playfully 'Boh!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is a middle-aged, spare man, {{about forty}} years old, of a brown complexion, and dark-brown colored hair, but wears a wig; a <b>hooked</b> <b>nose,</b> a sharp chin, gray eyes, {{and a large}} mole near his mouth." ...|$|R
60|$|The new-comer approached. He {{was a very}} tall, thin man, {{in white}} ducks, with a fine head of curly white hair. His face was thin too, long, with a large, <b>hooked</b> <b>nose</b> and a beautiful, {{expressive}} mouth.|$|R
60|$|Fawsitt seated {{himself on}} the other side of the table. He had a long, thin face, dark, narrow eyes, unwholesome complexion, a {{slightly}} <b>hooked</b> <b>nose,</b> and teeth discoloured through constant smoking. His fingers, too, bore the tell-tale yellow stains.|$|R
6000|$|Undoubtedly Paul Burns {{would have}} scorned to draw back, {{for he was}} a [...] "hero of romance;" [...] an enthusiast of the deepest dye, with an inquiring mind, a {{sanguine}} disposition, and a fervent belief in all things great and good and grand. He was also a six-footer in his socks, a horse in constitution, a Hercules in frame, with a <b>hook</b> <b>nose</b> and a hawk eye and a strong jaw--and {{all the rest of}} it. Paul had a good brain, too, and was well educated--as education went in those days. Yes, {{there can be little doubt}} that even though Paul Burns had been able to see into the future, he would have deliberately chosen to go on that voyage.|$|E
60|$|She {{went up to}} the house, keeping {{within the}} shrubbery, and went round it, peeping between the leaves at the lower windows. Most of them were open, as they usually were in such warm weather, but there were no lights yet, and all was silent. She tried the garden with no better effect. She thought of the wood, and stole towards it, heedless of long grass and briers: of worms, snails, and slugs, and all the {{creeping}} things that be. With her dark eyes and her <b>hook</b> <b>nose</b> warily in advance of her, Mrs. Sparsit softly crushed her way through the thick undergrowth, so intent upon her object that she probably would have done no less, if the wood had been a wood of adders.|$|E

"I {{would not}} miss seeing you for worlds," [...] wrote Sir Lionel; [...] "and {{although}} I {{have been ordered}} to Constantinople with all the immediate haste which your civil-service grandees always use in addressing us military slaves, it shall go hard with me but I will steal a fortnight from {{them in order to}} pass it with you at Jerusalem. I suppose I shall scarce know you, or you me; but when you see an old gentleman in a military frock, with a bald head, a <b>hook</b> <b>nose,</b> and a rather short allowance of teeth, you may then be sure that you look upon your father. However, I will be at Z----'s Hotel--I believe they honour the caravansary with that name--as soon as possible after the 14th." ...|$|E
60|$|Diogenes {{heard the}} drawing {{of more than one}} heavy bolt, then the {{grinding}} of a key in the lock; after which the door was partially opened, and a thin face with <b>hooked</b> <b>nose</b> and sunken cheeks appeared in the aperture.|$|R
50|$|Brighella wore a servant's suit {{of rough}} off-white fabric, trimmed with {{green on the}} sides of his pants and down the front of his long shirt. His mask had a <b>hooked</b> <b>nose,</b> beard, and mustache. His dagger was worn at his belt.|$|R
60|$|Even now he {{was looking}} on at the dancing with a heavy scowl upon his face. The girl near him--she with the dark, Oriental eyes and the thin, <b>hooked</b> <b>nose,</b> Klara Goldstein the Jewess--gave him a nudge with her brown, pointed elbow.|$|R
