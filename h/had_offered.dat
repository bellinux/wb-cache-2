5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign. In 1156–1157 {{the question was}} raised whether Christ <b>had</b> <b>offered</b> himself as a sacrifice {{for the sins of}} the world to the Father and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to the Logos (i.e., to himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E
5|$|According to the city's {{metropolitan}} bishop, Symeon (in office 1416/17–1429), {{both he and}} the Despot Andronikos sent repeated {{pleas for}} aid to Constantinople, but the imperial government was short of resources and preoccupied with its own problems. At long last, a single unnamed commander {{was sent to the}} city, but he brought neither men nor money with him. The commander proposed setting up a common fund of the citizens to support the defence, but this proposal met with vehement opposition, particularly from the wealthy aristocrats, who would naturally have born the brunt of the cost. The common people however also proved unwilling to contribute, and rioted in favour of an accommodation with the Ottomans, when the news spread that they <b>had</b> <b>offered</b> a peaceful settlement, provided that the Despot Andronikos left the city.|$|E
5|$|Actor Rishi Kapoor was {{subsequently}} cast as Rauf Lala, an underworld Don. Kapoor, {{who had never}} played a completely negative character in his entire career, was initially hesitant to sign the film. In an interview with Daily News and Analysis he stated that when Malhotra <b>had</b> <b>offered</b> him the role, he considered {{it to be a}} joke and thought that he would be the reason for the film's failure. Kapoor subsequently insisted on a test look before principal photography could begin, so that he could comfortably fit into the Muslim character of Lala, who wears kohl in his eyes, a karakul cap and is dressed in traditional kurta-pajamas. While shooting for the action sequences, Kapoor suffered several bad falls and bruises, but continued shooting and was thereby praised by co-star Hrithik Roshan for his professionalism.|$|E
