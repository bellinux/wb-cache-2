The health and wellbeing of these individuals, groups and communities is compromised through the deprivation of meaningful and purposeful activities.|$|R
40|$|Comparable {{worth is}} {{designed}} to raise the earnings of women assumed to be penalized for working in female-dominated occupations. Comparable worth advocates assume that the relation between earnings and percentage female in an occupation is due to crowding {{or other forms of}} discrimination. An alternative explanation is that the relation stems from women <b>freely</b> <b>choosing</b> different <b>occupations.</b> In other words, preferences are an omitted variable. In our study, we first replicate previous research that has used cross-sectional data to find a negative relation between earnings and percentage female (in an occupation) for both men and women. However, using longitudinal data to control for time-invariant omitted variables, we find that while men 2 ̆ 7 s estimated penalty is not reduced, the percentage female penalty falls substantially for women and is not statistically significant. These results imply that estimates of the percentage female effect based on cross-sectional data may be inflated for women. An exception to this general finding is that women with intermittent labor force participation do experience a sizeable penalty for working in female-dominated occupations. Hence, this pattern of results suggests that a comparable worth policy would most likely benefit women with discontinuous employment [...] perhaps an unintended outcome...|$|R
40|$|Cyclists seek to {{maximize}} performance duringcompetition, and gross efficiency {{is an important}} factor affectingperformance. Gross efficiency is itself affected by pedal rate. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} factors that affect <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> pedal rate. Crank inertial load varies greatly during road cycling based on the selected gear ratio. Nevertheless, the possible influence of crank inertial load on <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> pedal rate and gross efficiency has never been investigated. This study tested the hypotheses that during cycling with sub-maximal work rates, a considerable increase in crank inertial load would cause (1) <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> pedal rate to increase, and as a consequence, (2) gross efficiency to decrease. Furthermore, that it would cause (3) peak crank torque to increase if a constant pedal rate was maintained. Subjects cycled on a treadmill at 150 and 250 W, with low and high crank inertial load, and with preset and <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> pedal rate. <b>Freely</b> <b>chosen</b> pedal rate was higher at high compared with low crank inertial load. Notably, the change in crank inertial load affected the <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> pedal rate as much as did the 100 W increase in work rate. Alongwith <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> pedal rate being higher, gross efficiency at 250 W was lower during cycling with high compared with low crank inertial load. Peak crank torque was higher during cycling at 90 rpm with high compared with low crank inertial load. Possibly, the subjects increased the pedal rate to compensate for the higher peak crank torque accompanying cycling with high compared with low crank inertia...|$|R

40|$|Self-perception theory {{posits that}} people {{sometimes}} infer their own attributes by observing their <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> actions. We hypothesized that in addition, people sometimes infer their own attributes by observing the <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> actions of others {{with whom they}} {{feel a sense of}} merged identity—almost as if they had observed themselves performing the acts. Before observing an actor’s behavior, participants were led to feel a sense of merged identity with the actor through perspective-taking instructions (Study 1) or through feedback indicating that their brainwave patterns overlapped substantially with those of the actor (Studies 2 - 4). As predicted, observers incorporated attributes relevant to an actor’s behavior into their own self-concepts, but only when they were led to feel a sense of merged identity with the actor and only when the actor’s behavior seemed <b>freely</b> <b>chosen.</b> These changes in relevant self-perceptions led observers to change their own behaviors accordingly. Implications of these vicarious self-perception processes for conformity, perspective-taking, and the long-term development of the self-concept are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} effects of low cadence training at moderate intensity on aerobic capacity, cycling performance, gross efficiency, <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> cadence and leg strength in veteran cyclists. Method: Twenty-two well trained veteran cyclists (age: 47 ± 6 years, maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) : 57. 9 ± 3. 7 ml. kg- 1. min- 1) were randomized into two groups, a low cadence training group and a <b>freely</b> <b>chose</b> cadence training group. Respiratory variables, power output, cadence and leg strength were tested before and after a 12 weeks training intervention period. The low cadence training group performed 12 weeks of moderate (73 - 82 % of maximal heart rate (HRmax)) interval training (5 x 6 min) with a cadence of 40 revolutions per minute (rpm) two times a week, in addition to their usual training. The <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> cadence group added 90 minutes of training at <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> cadence at moderate intensity. Results: No significant effects of the low cadence training on aerobic capacity, cycling performance, power output, cadence, gross efficiency or leg strength was found. The <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> cadence group significantly improved both VO 2 max (58. 9 ± 2. 4 vs. 62. 2 ± 3. 2 ml. kg- 1. min- 1), VO 2 consumption at lactate threshold (49. 4 ± 3. 8 vs. 51. 8 ± 3. 5 ml. kg- 1. min- 1) and during the 30 min performance test (52. 8 ± 3. 0 vs. 54. 7 ± 3. 5 ml. kg- 1. min- 1), and power output at lactate threshold (284 ± 47 vs. 294 ± 48 W) and during the 30 min performance test (284 ± 42 vs. 297 ± 50 W). Conclusion: Twelve weeks of low cadence (40 rpm) interval training at moderate intensity (73 - 82 % of HRmax) twice a week does not improve aerobic capacity, cycling performance or leg strength in highly trained veteran cyclists. However, adding training at same intensity (% of HRmax) and duration (90 minutes weekly) at <b>freely</b> <b>chosen</b> cadence seems beneficial for performance and physiological adaptations. <br/...|$|R
