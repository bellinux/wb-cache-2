25|$|Governments issue {{government}} bonds {{in their own}} currency and sovereign bonds in foreign currencies. State and local governments issue municipal bonds to finance projects or other major spending initiatives. Debt issued by government-backed agencies is called an agency bond. Companies can issue a corporate bond or obtain money from a bank through a corporate loan. Preferred stocks {{share some of the}} characteristics of <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> bonds.

25|$|In both {{classical}} and Keynesian economics, the money market is analyzed as a supply-and-demand system with interest rates being the price. The money supply {{may be a}} vertical supply curve, if the central bank of a country chooses to use monetary policy to fix its value regardless of the interest rate; {{in this case the}} money supply is totally inelastic. On the other hand, the money supply curve is a horizontal line if the central bank is targeting a <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> rate and ignoring the value of the money supply; in this case the money supply curve is perfectly elastic. The demand for money intersects with the money supply to determine the interest rate.|$|E

25|$|The {{securities}} can {{be issued}} {{with either a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> rate or a floating rate under currency pegging system. Fixed rate ABS set the “coupon” (rate) {{at the time of}} issuance, in a fashion similar to corporate bonds and T-Bills. Floating rate securities may be backed by both amortizing and non-amortizing assets in the floating market. In contrast to fixed rate securities, the rates on “floaters” will periodically adjust up or down according to a designated index such as a U.S. Treasury rate, or, more typically, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The floating rate usually reflects the movement in the index plus an additional fixed margin to cover the added risk.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 and 2009, 14 {{lawsuits}} {{were filed}} against JPMorgan Chase in various district courts {{on behalf of}} Chase credit card holders claiming the bank violated the Truth in Lending Act, breached its contract with the consumers and committed a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The consumers contended that Chase, {{with little or no}} notice, increased minimum monthly payments from 2% to 5% on loan balances that were transferred to consumers' credit cards based on the promise of a <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> rate. In May 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California certified the class action lawsuit. On July 23, 2012, Chase agreed to pay $100 million to settle the claim.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} common indices are the rates on 1-year constant-maturity Treasury (CMT) securities, the cost of funds index (COFI), and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). A few lenders use their own cost of funds as an index, rather than using other indices. This is done to ensure a steady margin for the lender, whose own cost of funding will usually {{be related to the}} index. Consequently, {{payments}} made by the borrower may change over time with the changing interest rate (alternatively, the term of the loan may change). This is distinct from the graduated payment mortgage, which offers changing payment amounts but a <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> rate. Other forms of mortgage loan include the interest-only mortgage, the fixed-rate mortgage, the negative amortization mortgage, and the balloon payment mortgage.|$|E

25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E
500|$|On 20 October 2011, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research {{published}} an article that suggests transforming the EFSF into a European Monetary Fund (EMF), which could provide governments with <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> rate Eurobonds at a rate slightly below medium-term economic growth (in nominal terms). These bonds would not be tradable but could be held by investors with the EMF and liquidated at any time. Given the backing of all eurozone countries and the ECB, [...] "the EMU would achieve a similarly strong position vis-à-vis financial investors as the US where the Fed backs government bonds to an unlimited extent". To ensure fiscal discipline despite lack of market pressure, the EMF would operate according to strict rules, providing funds only to countries that meet fiscal and macroeconomic criteria.|$|E
500|$|During the 1640s, England {{endured a}} civil war that pitted King Charles I and the Royalists against the Parliamentarians. In 1647, {{different}} factions of the victorious parliamentary army {{held a series of}} discussions, the Putney Debates, on reforming the structure of English government. The most radical elements proposed universal manhood suffrage and the reorganisation of parliamentary constituencies. Their leader Thomas Rainsborough declared, [...] "I think it's clear, that every man that is to live under a government ought first by his own consent to put himself under that government." [...] More conservative members disagreed, arguing instead that only individuals who owned land in the country should be allowed to vote. For example, Henry Ireton stated, [...] "no man hath a right to an interest or share in the disposing of the affairs of the kingdom ... that hath not a permanent <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> in this kingdom." [...] The views of the conservative [...] "Grandees" [...] eventually won out. Oliver Cromwell, who became the leader of England after the abolition of the monarchy in 1649, refused to adopt universal suffrage; individuals were required to own property (real or personal) worth at least £200 in order to vote. He did nonetheless agree to some electoral reform; he disfranchised several small boroughs, granted representation to large towns such as Manchester and Leeds, and increased the number of members elected by populous counties. [...] These reforms were all reversed, however, after Cromwell's death and the last parliament to be elected in the Commonwealth period in 1659 reverted to the electoral system as it had existed under Charles I.|$|E

40|$|It is now {{increasingly}} {{established that}} Central Banks exercise control over nominal and real magnitudes, in regimes where banks desire to hold zero reserves, not by altering {{the stock of}} reserves nor by <b>fixing</b> <b>interest</b> rates but rather by operating upon the spreads or the relative price of banking services. Central Banks always affect the price of banking services which are essentially the supply of liquid, and accessible-at-least-cost, intertemporal transactions services. Central Banks are always operating upon this real relative price so that the set of all relative prices cannot be ascertained independently of {{the activity of the}} monetary authorities.

We show that an equilibrium exists under general conditions even if bidders expect true demand to exceed supply on average. The outcome is typically inefficient. It is argued that the {{fixed rate tender}}, in comparison to other tender formats, may be an appropriate instrument for central bank liquidity management when market conditions are sufficiently calm.

2500|$|The {{volatility}} of bonds (especially short and medium dated bonds) {{is lower than}} that of equities (stocks). Thus, bonds are generally viewed as safer investments than stocks, but this perception is only partially correct. Bonds do suffer from less day-to-day volatility than stocks, and bonds' interest payments are sometimes higher than the general level of dividend payments. Bonds are often liquid – it is often fairly easy for an institution to sell a large quantity of bonds without affecting the price much, which may be more difficult for equities – and the comparative certainty of a <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> payment twice a year and a fixed lump sum at maturity is attractive. [...] Bondholders also enjoy a measure of legal protection: under the law of most countries, if a company goes bankrupt, its bondholders will often receive some money back (the recovery amount), whereas the company's equity stock often ends up valueless. However, bonds can also be risky but less risky than stocks: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, the Federal Reserve System of the United States {{raised the}} {{discount}} rate that it charged its member banks from 9.5% to 12% {{in an effort to}} reduce inflation. The building or savings and loans associations (S) had issued long-term loans at <b>fixed</b> <b>interest</b> rates that were lower than the interest rate at which they could borrow. In addition, the S had the liability of the deposits which paid higher interest rates than the rate at which they could borrow. When interest rates at which they could borrow increased, the S could not attract adequate capital, from deposits to savings accounts of members for instance, they became insolvent. Rather than admit to insolvency, lax regulatory oversight allowed some S to invest in highly speculative investment strategies. This had the effect of extending the period where S were likely technically insolvent. These adverse actions also substantially increased the economic losses for the S than would otherwise have been realized had their insolvency been discovered earlier. One extreme example was that of financier Charles Keating, who paid $51 million financed through Michael Milken's [...] "junk bond" [...] operation, for his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association which at the time had a negative net worth exceeding $100 million.|$|E
