This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract A group of nine states <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern United States, hereafter {{referred to as}} <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> states, has experienced particularly high HIV diagnosis and case fatality rates. To provide additional information about <b>the</b> HIV burden <b>in</b> this region, we used CDC HIV surveillance data to examine characteristics of individuals diagnosed with HIV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> states (2011), 5 -year HIV and AIDS survival, and deaths among persons living with HIV (2010). We used multivariable analyses to {{explore the influence of}} residing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> states at diagnosis on deaths among persons living with HIV after adjustment for demographics and transmission risk. <b>In</b> 2011, <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> states had a higher HIV diagnosis rate (24. 5 / 100, 000 population) than the US overall (18. 0 / 100, 000) and higher proportions than other regions of individuals diagnosed with HIV who were black, female, younger, and living in suburban and rural areas. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> states had lower HIV and AIDS survival proportions (0. 85, 0. 73, respectively) than the US overall (0. 86, 0. 77, respectively) and the highest death rate among persons living with HIV of any US region.

Larger batches were produced later starting from several kilograms of plutonium with the einsteinium yields (mostly 253Es) of 0.48 milligrams in 1967–1970, 3.2 milligrams in 1971–1973, followed by steady production of about 3 milligrams per year between 1974 and 1978.

The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} disposal method, transmutation, {{has been}} demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. In this process, the technetium (technetium-99 as a metal target) is bombarded with neutrons to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16seconds) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium-100. If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal, an extremely pure technetium target is needed; if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium are present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> {{they are likely to}} undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target. The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.|$|E

5|$|Crystal Tools is {{a unified}} game engine by Japanese {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix that combines standard libraries for graphics rendering, physics processing, motion control, cinematics, visual effects, sound, artificial intelligence and networking. Its target systems are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. On the development side, the engine {{takes the form}} of various authoring tools focused on large-scale game projects. It encompasses a character viewer for 3D models, an effects and a cutscene editor, a previsualization tool, and a sound maker. Usage of the third-party programs Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softimage and Adobe Photoshop is supported via plug-ins. The individual authoring tools are connected over a communications server called GRAPE2 which reads all the different data formats, processes them and gives an instant preview of the final game. The engine is highly customizable and can be expanded with new functions and tools should the need for them arise. Although Crystal Tools allows for easier cross-platform development, the differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> systems' video memory and microarchitecture still necessitate fine-tuning adjustments in the games, for example concerning texture sizes.|$|E
5|$|Many ligand {{transport}} proteins bind particular small biomolecules {{and transport}} {{them to other}} locations {{in the body of}} a multicellular organism. These proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations, but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> tissues. The canonical example of a ligand-binding protein is haemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties. Lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. Receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins.|$|E

40|$|Older {{adults have}} been shown to exhibit a {{reduction}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lateralization of neural activity. Although neuroplasticity induced by noninvasive brain stimulation has been reported to be attenuated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> motor cortex of older adults, it remains possible that the plasticity effects may instead manifest in a more distributed (bilateral) network. Furthermore, attention, which modulates neuroplasticity in young adults, may influence these effects. To address these questions, plasticity was induced in young (19 - 32 years) and older (65 - 78 years) adults using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paired with peripheral nerve stimulation. The plasticity effects induced by this paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> and nontargeted hemispheres were probed using TMS-induced motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle of each hand. PAS-induced effects were highly variable across individuals, with only half of <b>the</b> participants <b>in</b> each group demonstrating <b>the</b> expected increase <b>in</b> MEP amplitude. Contrary to predictions, however, PAS-induced corticospinal plasticity manifests predominately <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> hemisphere for both young and older adults. Attention to <b>the</b> <b>target</b> hand did not enhance corticospinal plasticity. The results suggest that plasticity does not manifest differently across bilateral corticospinal pathways between young and older adults...|$|R
