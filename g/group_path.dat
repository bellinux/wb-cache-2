Virtualized resources (= storage volumes presented to hosts) are distributed across I/O groups to improve performance.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>group</b> <b>path</b> planning while maintaining group coherence and persistence. Group coherence ensures that a group minimizes both longitu-dinal and lateral dispersion, and is achieved with the introduc-tion of a deformation penalty to the cost formulation. When the deformation penalty is significantly high, a group may split and later merge. Group persistence is modeled by introducing split and merge actions in the action space, and adding a split penalty to the cost measure. We formulate the problem domain (state, action space, and cost formulation), present our path planning approach for coherent and persistent groups, and provide empirical results demonstrating the capabilities of our method {{on a variety of}} challenging scenarios.

40|$|Ground-based {{coherent}} backscatter {{radar systems}} are extensively used to investigate small-scale dynamics in the earth's ionosphere and related geophysical process(es) in the magnetosphere. At high-latitudes, HF radars are used {{due to the}} requisite orthogonal condition with the earth's magnetic field lines. Because {{of the effect of}} ionospheric refraction on the ray paths, the exact path of the radar signal through the ionosphere is then unknown. In practice, it is important to locate the radar echo sources given the echo parameters, such as <b>group</b> <b>path,</b> elevation angle, and azimuth angle. Furthermore, radar observations consist of direct backscatter from the ground. An uncertainty arises due to the difficulty in separating true ground backscatter from ionospheric scatter which fulfils the radar criteria based on the measured Doppler velocity and spectral width.;These problems are investigated in this research using a three-dimensional ray tracing computer programme, Jones 3 D (Jones and Stephenson, 1975). Some problems in the Jones 3 D code have been identified and corrected whilst modifications to the code have been made to suit the purpose of this research work. All modelling work presented in this thesis is based on two HF radars, the Halley HF radar in Antarctica and the CUTLASS HF radar in Finland. For the best comparison with radar observations, realistic ionospheric conditions are used. In the case study for the Halley HF radar in Antarctica, it is found that the radar's main propagation mode is one-hop propagation, and that the radar scatter is mostly organised in ranges in the order of E- region scatter, F- region scatter, and ground scatter. The range-bin statistical analysis suggests that the radar criteria based on the measured Doppler velocity and special width are not sufficient, and that the measured range (<b>group</b> <b>path)</b> parameter is important and should be used in separating radar ionospheric echoes from ground backscatter...|$|E

In this situation, people may detour from straight paths connecting destinations to take advantage of frequently visited, hence inexpensive, paths.

40|$|A {{variety of}} ground based radio {{techniques}} have provided new {{information relating to}} the nature of mid-latitude F-region irregularities responsible for frequency spreading on ionograms. Firstly, an analysis of ionograms covering a restricted frequency band indicates that frequency spreading is primarily caused by duplicate traces which are often unresolved in <b>group</b> <b>path</b> on standard ionograms. Furthermore, where angle of arrival information is available, the duplicate traces are shown to represent reflections from markedly different directions and the spread in critical frequencies is therefore indicative of a horizontal gradient in the peak electron density over a scale size of the order of many tens of kilometres. Secondly, the individual duplicate traces themselves are shown to comprise quasi-horizontal trace (QHT) segments which are unresolved on conventional ionograms and contribute to the diffuse appearance of spread-F traces on those ionograms. Difficulties in attributing these observations to the widely held view that scattering from small scale structures is the causative mechanism are discussed...|$|E
