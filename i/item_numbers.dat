5|$|Dev Gill was {{selected}} to portray the film's antagonist. Rajamouli was criticised for selecting him considering Gill's previous film, Krishnarjuna (2008), but remained adamant about casting him. He {{said that he had}} to cast a good looking man as the film's villain because the heroine needed to find him trustworthy. For this film, Gill had to practice horse riding in Ramoji Film City; Ram Charan was already an experienced equestrian. Srihari was cast in his role in the film in early April 2008. Kim Sharma {{was selected}} to perform one of the two <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> in the film in early June 2008. Saloni Aswani made a cameo appearance in the film and shot for three days.

Besides this, she performed another item number in James (2005) on director-producer Ram Gopal Varma's behest, who {{has a history of}} casting aspirant actress-models like Sameera Reddy, Isha Koppikar and Koena Mitra in similar roles.

Her performance earned her a South Scope Style Award for Best Tamil Actress, her first award win, and a nomination at the Vijay Awards. The role made her {{a star in the}} south Indian film industry.

5000|$|The film {{features}} an <b>item</b> <b>number</b> by Shahrukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan, Rakesh's son. While Hrithik will introduce the protagonists via a promotional video, Shahrukh {{will be shown}} performing at a function, {{as a part of}} an important sequence in the film. About Shahrukh's gesture by performing the <b>item</b> <b>number,</b> Hrithik said [...] "it's the first time something like this has been done, it highlights the solidarity of the industry. Shah Rukh has shown a lot of grace and respect for my father and we're touched as a family." [...] While this marks the second <b>item</b> <b>number</b> for Hrithik after Dhoom 2 (2006), it will be Shahrukh's third after Kaal (2005) and Om Shanti Om (2007).

500|$|In April 2009, Sonakshi Sinha {{signed for}} her debut role. Salman {{had seen her}} at a {{function}} engaging in dancing and offered her the role.

She added that she had been [...] "observing people and trying to pick up nuances" [...] as a step of further preparation.

500|$|Jacqueline Fernandez was {{approached}} {{to perform an}} item number in the film, but the producers failed {{to make a deal}} and instead signed Sophie Choudry after seeing her performance in [...] "Aala Re Aala" [...] from Shootout at Wadala (2013). For her first Telugu song, Choudry joined the film's set in September 2013. Sukumar said about the item number, [...] "It's a superstarâ€™s film and it should reach all. <b>Item</b> <b>numbers</b> are common these days and people expect to see them. The situation was that Mahesh had to go to a pub to get information about the person he was looking for. So there was occasion to put in an item number".|$|E
500|$|Khan collaborated for {{the third}} time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic drama Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) {{opposite}} Anushka Sharma, at that time a newcomer. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times believed the dual role to have been [...] "tailor-made" [...] for Khan, giving him the opportunity to display his talents, although Deep Contractor from Epilogue thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj. In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in Mudassar Aziz's Dulha Mil Gaya. He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009. He performed an extended, special appearance in the 2009 film Billu, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khana fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical <b>item</b> <b>numbers</b> with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone. As head of the film's production company, Red Chillies, Khan made the call to change the title of the film from Billu Barber to Billu after hairdressers across the country complained that the word [...] "barber" [...] was derogatory.

5000|$|<b>Item</b> <b>numbers</b> {{have been}} criticized for their {{gratuitous}} objectification of women. <b>Item</b> <b>numbers</b> have also been imitated in Mumbai's bar dancers.
