5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of <b>his</b> <b>victims,</b> and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment {{for a period of time}} as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> as they slept.|$|E

5|$|At {{his death}} he had {{achieved}} 57 aerial victories, placing him seventh {{on the list}} of the war's most successful aces. Just under two-thirds of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> can be identified by name. This is possible since, unlike other Allied aces, a substantial proportion of McCudden's claims were made over Allied-held territory. The majority of his successes were achieved with 56 Squadron RFC and all but five fell while flying the S.E.5a.|$|E

5|$|Edmund Emil Kemper III (born December 18, 1948) is an American {{serial killer}} who {{abducted}} and murdered several {{women in the}} early 1970s and murdered his paternal grandparents and his mother. He regularly engaged in necrophilia and claimed to have consumed the flesh {{of at least one}} of <b>his</b> <b>victims,</b> but later retracted this confession.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are {{assigned}} to the case. Discussing the photograph, Mulder tells Scully about Ted Serios, who was famous for making photos which showed what was in his mind. He takes pictures of his gloved hand using a camera found in Lefante's apartment, and they all appear {{the same as the}} one from the pharmacy. Mulder deduces that the kidnapper has been stalking <b>his</b> <b>victims.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of appeals, defense {{attorneys}} presented mitigating evidence of the troubled upbringing of Gardner, who had spent nearly his entire adult life in incarceration. His request for commutation of his death sentence was denied in 2010 after the families of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> testified against him. Gardner's legal team took the case {{all the way to}} the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to intervene.|$|E

25|$|Once he {{had tied}} up <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> on the bed, Ireland again demanded <b>his</b> <b>victim's</b> bank details. This time <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> refused to comply. After killing Collier's cat, Ireland strangled Collier with a noose. He put a condom on Collier's penis {{and placed the}} dead cat's mouth over it, and placed the cat's tail into Collier's mouth. Ireland was angered at {{discovering}} Collier was HIV positive while rummaging through his personal effects looking for bank details. He then phoned the police, asking why they had not linked the four murders. He left the next morning with £70.|$|R
5000|$|His most {{important}} ability {{is the ability}} to take over a host body, adding <b>his</b> <b>victim's</b> life span to his own.

This ability has several limitations though: ...|$|R
5|$|In a {{study of}} 19th-century warfare, {{historian}} James Reid posits that Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, the ability to inflict fear and suffering in <b>his</b> <b>victims,</b> and suggests he suffered from the most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks and Anderson's group, arguing that they behaved similarly.|$|E
5|$|Low captained {{a number}} of ships, usually {{maintaining}} a small fleet of three or four. Low and his pirate crews captured {{at least a hundred}} ships during his short career, burning most of them. Although he was active for only three years, Low remains notorious {{as one of the most}} vicious pirates of the age, with a reputation for violently torturing <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> before murdering them.|$|E
5|$|Low, {{like other}} pirates of the time, tried to intimidate <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> into {{surrendering}} {{by threatening to}} kill or torture them. The crew of the targeted ship would hinder the officers from defending the ship, so afraid were they of reprisals. One failed torture session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred.|$|E

5|$|Martin {{killed at}} least three people in Singapore and Thailand, and may have killed others in Belize, Mexico, and the United States. His modus operandi was to pose as a tourist and {{converse}} with another randomly chosen caucasian, either aboard their flights or while waiting at airports. He stayed in the same hotels as <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> in a room near theirs. Once he had an excuse {{to be in their}} rooms, he used an electroshock weapon to immobilise them before killing them by striking their heads with a hammer and cutting them up in their bathrooms. He chose caucasians as <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> because they were vacationing far away from their home countries, which made him less likely to be discovered. His motive apparently included money, as large amounts were withdrawn using the credit cards of Gerard Lowe and Timothy MacDowall.|$|E
5|$|Medical experiments, {{many of them}} pseudoscientific, were {{performed}} on concentration camp inmates beginning in 1941. The most notorious doctor to perform medical experiments was SS-Hauptsturmführer Dr. Josef Mengele, camp doctor at Auschwitz. Many of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> died or were intentionally killed. Concentration camp inmates were made available for purchase by pharmaceutical companies for drug testing and other experiments.|$|E
5|$|Numbers 1–3 {{had become}} a Job Centre by the 1980s, specialising in {{vacancies}} for the catering industry.

5|$|The {{challenge}} was to make £1million in a single year. Realising that they would essentially be making their own prize money, most contestants quit the show within two days. One group stayed together for slightly longer: sleeping {{on the floor of}} their cameraman's flat, they attempted to create their own TV show about themselves. Having also given up his flat and job, Russian was also homeless, and was forced to stay with the contestants he had manipulated. After the programme failed, Russian went into hiding, and was unable to be contacted. He was eventually tracked down by one of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> to an address in Richmond upon Thames, where he was forced to apologise on camera. As he had not taken any money from <b>his</b> <b>victims,</b> a criminal case against Russian was not pursued—a civil case was also not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Reyes and her fellow agents investigate a serial killer who uses numerology to choose <b>his</b> <b>victims.</b> Soon, Reyes and Scully meet an unusual man who may prove more of a hindrance than a help.|$|E
5|$|A week later, Marsh's {{action was}} again under {{scrutiny}} {{when he played}} his second shield match against Victoria in Melbourne. While Richard Callaway—the New South Wales umpire officiating the match—was satisfied with Marsh's bowling action, his Victorian counterpart Bob Crockett was concerned with the twisting of the bowler's wrist. Crockett no-balled Marsh {{three times in the}} match, but was reluctant to elucidate on the reasons for his call. Marsh took 3/39 and 3/51 respectively, dismissing Test batsmen Peter McAlister, Warwick Armstrong, Jack Worrall and Frank Laver. Marsh bowled three of <b>his</b> <b>victims.</b>|$|E
