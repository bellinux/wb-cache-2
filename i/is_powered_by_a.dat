A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that {{it could also be}} used to record iPad games with the right setup.|$|E
5|$|The AV-8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack {{aircraft}} {{of metal}} and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral (downward slope). The aircraft <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, cold end of the engine and two are near the rear, hot end of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller valve-controlled nozzles in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.|$|E

5|$|The Nexus7 <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 4,325mAh {{lithium-ion}} polymer battery {{that typically}} lasts 9.5hours and can be charged via micro-USB. In order to maximize the device's battery life, Asus engineers spent one month attempting to reduce electrical leakage by measuring heat and voltage at every point on the printed circuit board (PCB). The tablet includes a highly efficient power management integrated circuit designed by Maxim Integrated Products. Google claims the Nexus7's battery life allows 9hours of HD video playback, 10hours of web browsing or e-reading, and 300hours on standby.|$|E
5|$|The current {{paper mill}} building, whose water wheel <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> small canal from the river, dates from around 1860 {{and is a}} Grade II listed building. The {{commercial}} production of handmade paper ceased in February 2008 after owner Gerry Cottle concluded {{there was no longer}} a market for the product, and therefore sold most of the historic machinery. Visitors to the site are still able to watch a short video of the paper being made from cotton. Other attractions include the dinosaur yard, a small museum about the cave and cave diving, a theatre with circus shows, a house of mirrors and penny arcades.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} blocks of JF-17 <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single Russian RD-93 {{turbofan}} engine, {{which is a}} variant of the RD-33 engine used on the MiG-29 fighter. The engine gives more thrust and significantly lower specific fuel consumption than turbojet engines fitted to older combat aircraft being replaced by the JF-17. The advantages of using a single engine are a reduction in maintenance time and cost when compared to twin-engined fighters. A thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.99 can be achieved with full internal fuel tanks and no external payload. The engine's air supply is provided by two bifurcated air inlets (see airframe section).|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> General Instrument CF-599.|$|R
5|$|The Harrier was {{typically}} {{used as a}} ground attack aircraft, though its manoeuvrability also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges. The Harrier <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single Pegasus turbofan engine mounted in the fuselage. The engine is fitted with two air intakes and four vectoring nozzles for directing the thrust generated: two for the bypass flow and two for the jet exhaust. Several small reaction nozzles are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, {{for the purpose of}} balancing during vertical flight. It has two landing gear units on the fuselage and two outrigger landing gear units, one near each wing tip. The Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying a variety of weapons and external fuel tanks.|$|E
5|$|The C5 <b>is</b> <b>powered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 12-volt {{lead-acid}} {{electric battery}} driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts {{and a maximum}} speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque {{by a factor of}} 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E
