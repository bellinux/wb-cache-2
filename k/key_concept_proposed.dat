40|$|Galvanic {{isolated}} {{gate drivers}} require a control signal {{as well as}} energy transmission from the control side (lowside) to the driver side (high-side). An additional backward signal transmission is preferred for error signals, status information, etc. This is often realized by means of several transformers or opto-couplers. Decreasing the number of isolation elements results in lower cost and {{a higher degree of}} miniaturization. This work presents a gate driver with bidirectional signal transmission and energy transfer via one single transformer. The <b>key</b> <b>concept</b> <b>proposed</b> in this paper is to combine bootstrapping to deliver the main gate charge for the driven power switch with additional energy transfer via the signal transformer. This paper also presents a very efficient combination of energy transfer to two high-side supply rails with back channel amplitude modulation. This way an isolated gate driver can be implemented that allows 100 % pulse-width modulation (PWM) duty cycle at low complexity and system cost. The proposed high-side driver IC with integrated power supply, modulation and demodulation circuits was manufactured in a 180 nm high-voltage BiCMOS technology. Measurements confirm the concept of bidirectional signal transmission with a 1 MBit/s amplitude modulation, 10 / 20 MHz frequency modulation and a maximum power transmission of 14 mW via the transformer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{approach}} to the computation of an approximate estimate of spatial object pose from camera images is proposed. The method {{is based on a}} neural network that generates pose hypotheses in real time, which can be refined by registration or tracking systems. A modification of Kohonen’s self-organizing feature map is systematically trained with computer generated object views such that it responds to a preprocessed image with one or more sets of object orientation parameters. The <b>key</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>proposed</b> are representations of spatial orientation that result in continuous distance measures, and the choice of a fixed network topology that is best suited to the representation of 3 -D orientation. Experimental results from both simulated and real images demonstrate that a pose estimate within the accuracy requirements can be found in more than 90 % of all cases.

40|$|Recent {{convergence}} {{results with}} pseudospectral methods are exploited {{to design a}} robust, multigrid, spectral algorithm for computing optimal controls. The design of the algorithm is based on using the pseudospectral differentiation matrix to locate switches, kinks, corners, and other discontinuities that are typical when solving practical optimal control problems. The concept of pseudospectral knots and Gaussian quadrature rules are used to generate a natural spectral mesh that is dense near the points of interest. Several stopping criteria are developed based on new error-estimation formulas and Jackson’s theorem. The sequence is terminated {{when all of the}} convergence criteria are satisfied. Numerical examples demonstrate the <b>key</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>proposed</b> {{in the design of the}} spectral algorithm. Although a vast number of theoretical and algorithmic issues still remain open, this paper advances pseudospectral methods along several new directions and outlines the current theoretical pitfalls in computation and control.

We have proposed a solution approach, called Transparent Schema Evolution (TSE), that successfully addresses this problem by integrating schema evolution capabilities with object-oriented view facilities. In TSE, users interface with the OODB exclusively through their customized database view. In this paper, we identify key features required from OODB systems in order to provide such transparent schema change support, including multiple classification, dynamic reclassification, and flexible restructuring. Such features are currently not supported by commercial OODB systems. We thus propose a novel object-oriented modeling paradigm that overcomes these limitations. <b>Key</b> <b>concepts</b> of the <b>proposed</b> solution include object-slicing techniques and object-oriented views.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This Degree {{work is a}} reflectión {{about the}} main {{elements}} proposed by Robert Simons (2000) about the management control and its practical application in the health sector, more specifically we will contextualize those elements to the companies of the described sector. At a crisis such as we are experiencing nowadays, in which resources and funds are scarce {{is very important for}} enterprises that managers have the necessary tools {{in order to ensure that}} resources and funds are used efficiently. If we focus on the health sector financed with public funds this is more important because the interests of the whole society are involved in a dual approach, firstly we are the customers of the outputs and everyone wants to be well taken care when a hospital is visited, lastly the hospitals financed by public funds are paid by everyone with taxes and social security contributions and the society wants that its funds are well used. This requires that enterprises have an adequate structure in accordance with the objectives and managers have constant flows of key information about the organization and the achieving of the objectives. In the first place we will introduce some of the <b>key</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>proposed</b> by Simons, such as, design of work units, span of control, span of accountability and others in relation to the organizational system and the business structure. Afterwards, we will continue describing how important is the use of information about the production process in order to be more efficient and the ítems in which attention must be fixed in every particular case. Secondly we will apply the foregoing concepts to the kind of enterprise contextualized in this study in order to assess the implications of the approach proposed by Simons in these enterprises. We will illustrate this with the application of the author´s approach to a real case. And thirdly we will focus in one ítem, and we will analyse how the model explained in this study contribute to be more efficient. We will finish with some brief reflections about the implications of the practical application of the model proposed by Robert Simons in the analysed sector in this study and some future development proposals.

40|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is presenting a flexible solution to the box-constrained least squares problems. This solution is applicable to many existing problems, such as nonnegative matrix factorization, support vector machine, signal deconvolution, and computed tomography reconstruction. The <b>key</b> <b>concept</b> of the <b>proposed</b> algorithm is to replace the minimization of the cost function at each iteration by the minimization of a surrogate, leading to a guaranteed decrease in the cost function. In addition to the monotonicity, the proposed algorithm also owns a few good features including the self-constraint in the feasible region and the absence of a predetermined step size. This paper theoretically proves the global convergence for a special case of below-bounded constraints. Using the proposed mechanism, some valuable algorithms can be derived. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides performance that is comparable to that of other commonly used methods in numerical experiment and computed tomography reconstruction...|$|R

Lefebvre’s ideal of the “right to the city” is now more widely accepted given today’s current cultural and social situation. Most current research on Henri Lefebvre refers solely to his ideas and their theoretical discussion, without focusing on the empirical transcription of the philosopher.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a practical solution}} to the problem of limited bandwidth in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) - secured communication through using rapidly rekeyed Internet Protocol security (IPsec) links. QKD is a cutting-edge security technology that provides mathematically proven security by using quantum physical effects and information theoretical axioms to generate a guaranteed non-disclosed stream of encryption keys. Although it has been a field of theoretical research for some time, it has only been producing market-ready solutions for a short period of time. The downside of this technology is that its key generation rate is only around 52, 000 key bits per second over a distance of 50 km. As this rate limits the data throughput to the same rate, it is substandard for normal modern communications, especially for securely interconnecting networks. IPsec, on the other hand, is a well-known security protocol that uses classical encryption and is capable of exactly creating site-to-site virtual private networks. This paper {{presents a}} solution that combines the performance advantages of IPsec with QKD. The combination sacrifices only a small portion of QKD security by using the generated keys a limited number of times instead of just once. As a part of this, the solution answers the question of how many data bits per key bit make sensible upper and lower boundaries to yield high performance while maintaining high security. While previous approaches complement the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE), this approach simplifies the implementation with a new <b>key</b> synchronization <b>concept,</b> <b>proposing</b> a lightweight protocol that uses relatively few, slim control messages and sparse acknowledgement.

40|$|Abstract Background While the {{evidence}} suggests that the way physicians provide information to patients is crucial in helping patients decide upon a course of action, the field of knowledge translation and exchange (KTE) is silent about how the physician and the patient influence each other during clinical interactions and decision-making. Consequently, based on a novel relationship-centered model, EXACKTE 2 (EXploiting the clinicAl Consultation as a Knowledge Transfer and Exchange Environment), this study proposes to assess how patients and physicians influence each other in consultations. Methods We will employ a cross-sectional study design involving 300 pairs of patients and family physicians from two primary care practice-based research networks. The consultation between patient and physician will be audio-taped and transcribed. Following the consultation, patients and physicians will complete a set of questionnaires based on the EXACKTE 2 model. All questionnaires will be similar for patients and physicians. These questionnaires will assess the <b>key</b> <b>concepts</b> of our <b>proposed</b> model based on the essential elements of shared decision-making (SDM) : definition and explanation of problem; presentation of options; discussion of pros and cons; clarification of patient values and preferences; discussion of patient ability and self-efficacy; presentation of doctor knowledge and recommendation; and checking and clarifying understanding. Patients will be contacted by phone two weeks later and asked to complete questionnaires on decisional regret and quality of life. The analysis will be conducted to compare the <b>key</b> <b>concepts</b> in the EXACKTE 2 model between patients and physicians. It will also allow the assessment of how patients and physicians influence each other in consultations. Discussion Our proposed model, EXACKTE 2, is aimed at advancing the science of KTE based on a relationship process when decision-making has to take place. It fosters a new KTE paradigm by putting forward a relationship-centered perspective and has the potential to reveal unknown mechanisms that underline effective KTE in clinical contexts. This will result in better understanding of the mechanisms that may promote a new generation of knowledge transfer strategies. </p...|$|R
