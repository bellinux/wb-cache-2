40|$|<b>Fine</b> <b>milling</b> in {{combination}} with thinbed mash filters has been introduced into the brewing industry more than 20 years ago. Although clearest worts can be obtained at highest gravity, {{in combination}} with high extract yield and improved starch conversion, a majority of brewers still use the conventional coarse milling {{in combination with}} lautertuns. Brewers seem still afraid having a negative impact of <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> on wort and beer quality {{especially with regard to}} over extraction of polyphenols, proteins and oxidative enzymes. A lack of detailed data comparing both wort production methods could be a reason. In this study, the faster wort filtration as well as higher extract yield has been confirmed when using <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> and a thin bed filter. A higher concentration of fermentable sugar led to this increased yield and not an increased level of proteins and polyphenols. On the contrary, <b>fine</b> <b>milling</b> in combination with thicker mash and thin bed filtration results in a lower level of haze sensitive protein in the pitching wort in comparison to coarse grist and the use of a lautertun. No striking differences have been found comparing analyses of fresh beer. Also during forced ageing of the beers at 30 [*]°C, no difference in the formation of flavour negative compounds or degradation of bitterness has been noticed. Both wort production methods result in highly comparable beers with equal flavour stability. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The Agrio-Guadiamar River reach {{affected}} by the Aznalcóllar mine tailings spill {{can be divided into}} three main sectors taking account of geomorphic characteristics and human-induced changes. Along the first 15 km, the valley presents the characteristics of a middle fluvial reach of moderate sinuosity and gradient; the floodplain declines gently towards the main channel and is built up mainly by lateral accretion deposits, which are mined by open pits. The second sector is located between 15 and 30 km downstream of the mine, and is characterised by higher channel sinuosity and a lower gradient; the floodplain is built on overbank deposits, separated from the main channel by natural levees, showing some low sinuosity flood channels. Finally, the lowest reach, with a similar low gradient, can be described as the proximal area of the Doñana marshlands, whose geomorphology has been modified by agricultural practices for the last 40 years. The spread of mining tailings deposited a mat of pyrite mud (<b>fine</b> <b>milled</b> heavy metal-rich ore) over the main channel and floodplain with a thickness of up to 50 cm in the first sector and then, progressively decreasing downstream. The pyrite mud was deposited over the natural sediments without significant mobilisation of the latter and without relevant geomorphic changes. The subsequent cleaning up of the pyrite mud with the help of heavy machinery resulted in the removal of most of the bushy and herbaceous vegetation as well as the reworking of bed sediments and the destruction of their natural armouring. Relatively small amounts of submerged pyrite mud that could not be removed from the main channel and that mixed with the shallow natural sediments during the cleaning works provides a long-term pollution element in the system. Pyrite mud remnants on floodplains are not being directly removed by fluvial activity in the mid-term because these sedimentation areas are susceptible to erosion only by the wandering of the main channel. However, these materials can be easily oxidised, therefore, plant uptake and underground water pollution should be monitored. On the other hand, the channel bed and banks are source areas of sediments and pyrite materials that can be easily eroded due to the destruction of the natural protection features (vegetation and armouring). Once eroded, the pyrite particles will be transported over longer distances than the coarser host natural alluvium, and deposited on floodplains or areas with low flow velocity.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that shear force during mashing, transferring and lautering should be avoided, {{especially in the}} case of thin bed filtration, using a <b>fine</b> <b>milled</b> grist. Therefore pump rotation speed is limited up to 1000 rpm during thin bed filter operations. However, in order to achieve the targets of flow, filtration pressure and low rotation speed, the transfer pump is mostly too large and operates far from the ideal performance potential. Transferring tomatoes and milk products, where shear force directly leads to damage of the product, learned that the efficiency is much more important instead of the rotation speed. This phenomenon is tested for mash transfer during thin bed filtration on pilot and industrial scale. Mashes of 3. 5 hl were transferred with an oversized channel impellor pump (MWP 2 / 40 - 160 / 116 (3 K- 160) and maximum rotation speed of 1200 rpm. A smaller open impeller pump (FP/ 63 - 25 / 114 (O- 132) D 09 S 18 KEB Y 55 S 5019 [...] M 2) is used to test the hypothesis of higher rotation speed (1500 rpm). Industrial mashes (120 hl) were filtered using 4 pump types: P 1 = MCP 2 / 65 - 250 / 1104 (O- 260) ("open / semi-open impeller"-reference), P 2 = ICP 3 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (C- 220) ("closed impeller"), P 3 = IFF 2 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (VO- 220) ("vortex impeller"), P 4 = ICP 3 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (4 K- 200) ("channel impeller"). Following parameters were measured during lautering: flow, pressure, rotation speed, filtered volume, extract, β-glucan, and arabinoxylan content of first wort. At pilot scale, an increased rotation speed of 1500 rpm with the smaller new pump resulted in a somewhat improved lauter performance compared to the reference pump with a max rotation speed of 1200 rpm. However, the efficiency of this new pump is 17, 6 % vs 4 % with the reference pump. At industrial scale, no important differences in lauter performance were noticed with varying rotation speed. However higher pump efficiency resulted in a somewhat decreased extraction of β-glucans and pentosans meaning that pump efficiency is indeed more important compared to rotation speed. Higher pump efficiencies resulted in an improved lauter performance, even when rotation speed of the pump is higher. The β-glucan level in the first wort decreases with increased pump efficiency. It was generally accepted that rotation speed of transfer pumps for lautering should be below 1000 rpm to avoid shear forces. The determined factor was only the speed of rotation of the pump, efficiency was never a ‘key’ selection criterium. With these experiments, firstly proven by transferring tomatoes and milk products, pump efficiency is much more important compared to rotation speed. Decreased electricity consumption and lower investment cost is a direct result of these new findings. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two mains parts: an introduction giving a literature review of key topics relevant for design and interpretation of the experiments carried out in this thesis, and an experimental part. Recent reports from FAO have highlighted the need for increased utilization of more low cost material in food production industries. Aquaculture industry may play an increasingly important role in providing high quality food, and {{approximately half of the}} production costs are related to feed. It is, thus, becoming increasingly important to utilize non-food and low cost ingredients in fish feed. Nile tilapia is a major farmed fish species. Moreover, it has high capacity to tolerate a wide range of environmental stresses and the presence of antinutrients compounds in diet, making it an ideal target species for upgrading low-quality ingredients to high quality food. Secondary products from rapeseed oil processing are highly abundant and represent an inexpensive source of protein. The major challenge for increased use is the presence of certain glucosinolate derivatives such as isothiocyanate and progoitrin, which previously have been reported to cause metabolic problems or reduce feed acceptability for fish. Secondary products of rapeseed also contain other antinutritional factors such as phytic acid and tannins that may represent metabolic challenges. Several of these factors can be reduced by relatively intense moist heating. The overall aim of the research in this research was to find out if simple processing such as fine milling or moist heating influenced the nutritional value of rapeseed cake (RSC), a secondary product from rapeseed oil processing. Two experiments were carried out. The first experiment aimed at defining a dietary inclusion level to which Nile tilapias were sensitive to changes in nutritional quality of RSC. The second experiment was carried out to assess the effects of fine milling or the combination of fine milling and autoclaving of RSC. The first experiment was designed on the base of a regression analysis to define the dose response of tilapia to inclusion of rapeseed cake (RSC) in diet. Five different isoenergetic and isonitrogenous, plant ingredient-based diets were produced with different level of inclusion of RSC. Crude protein from soybean meal (SBM) was gradually replaced by crude protein from RSC at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of replacement. The feeding trial was performed in two replicate tanks of Nile tilapia for each experimental diet. Each tank contained 20 tilapias with average weight of 19. 9 g. Feeding was in excess, 3 times (40 min) per day. Feed was quantified on a daily basis for the first 3 weeks, and as a pooled value over the whole 6 week feeding period. The findings from Exp. 1 demonstrated a decline in feed intake and growth along with increasing the level of RSC in diet. A threshold effect was observed in the regression curve near of 50 % replacement. A possible explanation for these results may be the presence of bitter component in RSC which caused poor palatability of RSC containing diet and reduces feed intake. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) (g DM intake (g gain) - 1) was almost close to 1 g g- 1 for all levels, except for the groups feed 100 % replacement of CP from RSC, where it was slightly elevated. No diet-related trends were observed apparent digestibility or retention of crude protein, mineral (Ca, P, Mg, Mn, Zn) absorption or concentration in blood plasma, energy content of whole body and energy and protein retention along with different inclusion of RSC in diet, indicating that protein from RSC and SBM had comparable availability, and that the effects of phytic acid from the two protein sources had comparable effects. Moreover, thyroid hormone (T 4) in blood plasma was not markedly different for different treatments, indicating that glucosinolate derivatives may not have been a main factor in explaining the reductions in feed intake and growth. The lipid content of whole body composition decreased in treatments fed diet from 0 % until 50 % replacement and then increases up to 100 % replacement of CP from RSC with CP from SBM. The same pattern was seen in content of DM which can be the result of lipid content of body. It is assumed that presence of higher content of tannin in RSC on the base of feed intake pattern causes higher visceral fat deposition in fish after 50 % replacement. The ration of liver weigh to body weight was increased from 0 % until 50 % replacement level and after that tended to reduce up to 100 % replacement of CP from RSC with CP from SBM. Since the deposition of lipid in liver decreases by increasing content of tannin in diet, the pattern given from ratio of liver weight to body weight may be caused by this fact. The aim of second experiment (Exp. 2) was to assess whether fine milling and/or combination of fine milling and autoclaving the RSC applied in diet may affect the nutritional quality of feed for tilapia. Exp. 2 was performed according to the results from Exp. 1, on the 50 % level of replacement of CP from SBM with CP from RSC in diet which causes more sensitivity in fish to nutritional quality of diet. This experiment was designed on the base of ANOVA analysis. A 3 weeks trail feeding tilapia was conducted with 3 different experimental diets. The RSC used in different experimental diets were 1 mm ground (the same as Exp. 1), milled to 0. 5 mm of particle size, or milled to 0. 5 mm and autoclaved for 10 min in 120 oC. Each diet fed to tilapia in 3 replicate tanks. Each tank contained 20 fish with the average weight of 37. 3 gr. Feeding and monitoring of daily feed intake was the same as Exp. 1. Feed intake and gain were significantly (P 0. 05). This may be due to autoclaving having a negative effect on the palatability of RSC due to production of glucosinolates breakdown products. A linear relationship was seen between feed intake and gain which may demonstrate that the main reason of growth depression is related to decrease of FI. The finding of increased glucose concentration in the diet with autoclaved RSC, probably originating from hydrolysis of glucosinolates, supports this hypothesis. A significant decrease (P 0. 05) among different treatments. Also the content of minerals (except zinc) in blood plasma among different treatments fed different experimental diets was the same (P> 0. 05). However, the content of zinc in blood plasma of tilapia fed with diet containing <b>fine</b> <b>milled</b> and <b>fine</b> <b>milled</b> and autoclaved RSC tended (0. 050. 05). It may prove that the certain level of inclusion of secondary compounds of RSC used in these diets may not have any goitrogenic effect on tilapias thyroid. To conclude, this research show that presence of RSC in tilapia diet may reduce feed acceptability. However, it did not show different effects on metabolic function of fish than those caused by SBM. Fine milling did not affect the nutritional value of RSC, while autoclaving of RSC has negative effect on feed intake, energy utilization, and consequently on growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of microbial protein in the rumen {{has a major}} impact on protein- and amino acid supply in ruminants. The amount and amino acid composition of the protein that enters the small intestine primarily depends on diet formulation. In the present studies the effects of maize silage (MS) and grass silage (GS) on ruminal fermentation and microbial protein synthesis were investigated, considering methodical aspects of in vitro studies, particularly grinding of feed samples. In the first experimental series five mixed diets with different proportions of MS and GS (100 : 0, 79 : 21, 52 : 48, 24 : 76 and 0 : 100) and a constant proportion of soybean meal (11 %) were used. The content of crude protein (CP) and fibre fractions increased, whereas the content of organic matter (OM) and starch decreased with increasing proportion of GS in the diet. It was hypothesised that a combination of MS and GS can benefit microbial growth and thus fermentation of nutrient fractions to a higher extent than using only one forage source separately. It was also to be investigated how changes in diet composition affect the amino acid profile of microbial protein. A well standardised semi-continuous rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC) was used, which is a commonly accepted experimental model in investigations on ruminal fermentation. Changes in fermentation characteristics, as a result of changing the MS-to-GS ratio, were tested for linear and quadratic effects in order to identify possible associative effects. Prior to the in vitro incubation, feedstuffs were dried and ground. It was aimed to investigate in which way fermentation in the RUSITEC system is influenced by mean feed particle size. Therefore two milling screen sizes (MSS; 1 vs. 4 mm) were used in all diets and results on fermentation characteristic were tested for possible interactions of forage source and MSS. One incubation period lasted for 13 days (6 days adaption period, 7 days sampling period), and each treatment was tested in at least three replicates. Ruminal digesta, obtained from rumen-fistulated wether sheep, was used as the inoculum for starting the incubation. Diets were fed once daily to the RUSITEC system, and nylon feed bags remained for 48 h inside the fermentation vessel. A buffer solution, containing 15 NH 4 Cl, was infused continuously into the vessel and the respective effluent was analysed for short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and NH 3 -N. Solid- and liquid- associated microbial fractions were isolated from the feed residues, the liquid inside the vessel and the effluent by differential centrifugation. The flow of microbial CP was quantified on the basis of N and 15 N balances. The feed residues were analysed for crude nutrients and detergent fibre fractions and the respective degradation rates were calculated. OS and CP in the feed residues were corrected for the contribution of solid-associated microbes. The degradation of OM and fibre fractions, as well as amounts of NH 3 -N increased linearly with stepwise replacement of MS by GS. Degradation of CP was unaffected by diet composition, as well as total SCFA production. The degradation of OM and CP was higher in coarse milled (4 mm-MSS) than in <b>fine</b> <b>milled</b> (1 mm-MSS) treatments, accompanied by higher amounts of NH 3 -N and total SCFA. An improvement of growth conditions for some microbial groups, e. g. anaerobe fungi, was discussed. The amount of microbial CP increased linearly by the stepwise replacement of MS by GS, and was higher at 4 mm-MSS than at 1 mm-MSS. The amount of available N was assumed to advance microbial growth in the RUSITEC system. Efficiency of microbial CP synthesis was improved from 29 to 43 mg microbial N per g degraded OM by increasing the proportion of GS in the diet, but was unaffected by MSS. The N content and the profiles of amino acids of the three microbial fractions, as well as the ratio of solid- to liquid-associated microbes were affected by diet composition and MSS. Interactions of forage source and MSS were rare. However, the results indicated interactions between dietary factors and origin of microbial isolate on characteristics of microbial protein synthesis. In order to provide additional information on the nutritional value, the mixed diets were evaluated by two further methods. The total tract digestibility of crude nutrients was determined in wether sheep. The content of metabolisable energy was similar between diets and averaged 11. 5 MJ per kg dry matter. The in vitro gas production was measured within 93 h by using a modified Hohenheim gas production test, providing information on kinetics and extent of ruminal fermentation. Cumulative gas production decreased with increasing proportion of GS in the diet. A negative effect of coarse milling on fermentation in the Hohenheim gas production test was confirmed. Across all diets gas production was delayed at 4 mm-MSS compared to 1 mm-MSS. The results from both approaches supported the findings of the RUSITEC study that a stepwise replacement of MS by GS led to a linear response in degradation of nutrients. As indicated by the gas production data, positive associative effects might only occur in the first hours after starting an incubation. When mixed diets are used effects cannot be clearly related to individual diet ingredients. Moreover, in the mixed diets interactions between soybean meal inclusion and forage source or feed particle size cannot be excluded. Therefore pure silages were incubated separately in the RUSITEC system in the second experimental series and three milling screens of different size were used (1, 4 and 9 mm). In accordance with the first experimental series, degradation of OM, fibre fractions and non-structural carbohydrates, production of NH 3 -N, as well as microbial CP flow and efficiency of microbial CP synthesis were higher in GS than in MS. A higher degradation of CP was found for MS than for GS, indicating interactions between forage source and soybean meal inclusion. An increase in MSS from 1 mm to 9 mm led to an improvement in the degradation of OM, CP and non-structural carbohydrates, particularly of starch in MS, {{as well as in the}} microbial CP flow for both silages. But the efficiency of microbial CP synthesis and microbial amino acid profile were less affected by MSS. In the second experimental series additionally the effect of available N on fermentation of MS was investigated. The supplementation of urea-N improved the degradation of non-structural carbohydrates, especially starch, but not that of fibre fractions in MS. The efficiency of microbial CP synthesis was increased from 26 to 35 mg microbial N per g degraded OM by urea-N supplementation to MS. The way of urea administration, either supplied together with the feed once daily or infused continuously by buffer solution, had only marginal effects on fermentation characteristics. It was concluded that microbial growth is improved by degradation of OM from GS compared to MS and by an increasing availability of N in the RUSITEC system. Meaningful associative effects of mixtures of MS and GS on ruminal fermentation characteristics are not likely to occur. However, transferability of results to other batches of MS and GS is limited, as high variations in chemical composition are known for both types of silage. Fermentation of MS- and GS-based diets in the RUSITEC system benefits more by coarse milling at MSS up to 9 mm than by fine milling at 1 mm-MSS. Consequently, variations in MSS and feed particle size distribution have to be taken into account when evaluating feeds by rumen simulation systems. The changes in composition and contribution of microbial fractions give indications to a shift in the microbial community as a result of variation of silage type and feed particle size, but further research on this aspect is needed. Moreover, the present results stated that the origin of the microbial samples is very important for measurements on microbial protein synthesis. Die Synthese mikrobiellen Proteins im Pansen hat einen entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Protein- und Aminosäurenversorgung der Wiederkäuer. Die Menge und die Aminosäuren-zusammensetzung des am Dünndarm anflutenden Proteins sind vor allem von der Rations-gestaltung abhängig. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde der Einfluss von Maissilage (MS) und Grassilage (GS) auf die ruminale Fermentation und die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese untersucht. Die Betrachtung methodischer Aspekte, insbesondere der Vermahlungsgrad des Futters, wurde in den vorliegenden in vitro Untersuchungen einbezogen. In der ersten Versuchsreihe (Paper I + II) wurden fünf Mischrationen mit unterschiedlichen Anteilen an MS und GS (100 : 0, 79 : 21, 52 : 48, 24 : 76 und 0 : 100) und einem konstanten Anteil an Sojaextraktionsschrot (11 %) verwendet. Mit steigendem Anteil an GS in der Ration stieg der Gehalt an Rohprotein (XP) und Faserfraktionen an, wohingegen der Gehalt an organischer Substanz (OS) und Stärke abnahm. Es wurde die Hypothese aufgestellt, dass eine Kombination von MS und GS das mikrobielle Wachstum und somit den Nährstoffabbau in einem höheren Maße begünstigt als die Verwendung einer einzigen Grundfutterquelle. Zudem sollte geprüft werden, wie sich die Rationsänderung auf das Aminosäurenmuster des mikrobiellen Proteins auswirkt. Es wurde eine gut standardisierte semi-kontinuierliche Pansensimulationstechnik (RUSITEC) genutzt, welche als Modell für Untersuchungen zur Pansenfermentation weitestgehend akzeptiert ist. Die Veränderung der erfassten Fermentationsparameter, als Folge der Änderung des MS:GS-Verhältnisses in der Ration, wurde auf lineare und quadratische Effekte untersucht, um mögliche assoziative Effekte zu identifizieren. Vor der in vitro Inkubation der Futtermittel wurden diese getrocknet und vermahlen. Inwieweit die mittlere Futterpartikelgröße die Ergebnisse im RUSITEC-System beeinflusst, sollte durch eine Variation der Siebweite (SW; 1 vs. 4 mm) bei der Vermahlung geklärt werden. Mögliche Wechselwirkungen von Grundfutterquelle und SW auf die Kenngrößen der ruminalen Fermentation wurden geprüft. Eine Inkubationsperiode dauerte 13 Tage (6 Tage Adaptationsphase, 7 Tage Sammelphase) und jede Behandlung wurde mit mindestens 3 Wiederholungen getestet. Als Startmedium für die Inkubation diente feste und flüssige Phase der ruminalen Digesta von pansen-fistulierten Hammeln. Das Futter wurde dem RUSITEC-System einmal täglich zugeführt und die Nylonfutterbeutel verblieben 48 h im Fermentationsgefäß. Eine mit 15 NH 4 Cl versetzte Pufferlösung wurde kontinuierlich in das System infundiert. In der jeweiligen Überlaufflüssigkeit wurde der Gehalt an kurzkettigen Fettsäuren (SCFA) und NH 3 -N bestimmt. Drei Mikrobenfraktionen wurden aus der festen und flüssigen Phase des Systems mittels Differentialzentrifugation isoliert; und zwar aus den Futterresten, aus der Flüssigkeit im Inneren des Fermentationsgefäßes und aus der Überlaufflüssigkeit. Die Menge an mikrobiellem XP, welches das System täglich verließ wurde mittels N- und 15 N-Bilanzen bestimmt. Die Futterreste wurden auf ihren Gehalt an Rohnährstoffen und Detergenzien-Faser-Fraktionen analysiert. Der Gehalt an OS und XP in den Futterresten wurde um den jeweiligen Anteil der Partikel-assoziierten Mikroben korrigiert. Der stufenweise Austausch von MS durch GS bewirkte einen linearen Anstieg im Abbau der OS und der Faserfraktionen, sowie in der Menge an NH 3 -N. Der XP-Abbau und die Gesamt-menge an gebildeten SCFA waren durch die Ration nicht beeinflusst. Eine grobe Vermahlung (4 mm SW) führte im Vergleich zu einer feinen Vermahlung (1 mm SW) zu einer Erhöhung im OS- und XP-Abbau, sowie zu einer erhöhten SCFA-Produktion. Eine Verbesserung der Wachstumsbedingungen für bestimmte Mikrobengruppen, z. B. anaerobe Pilze, wurde diskutiert. Die Menge an mikrobiellem XP stieg linear mit dem Austausch von MS durch GS an und war bei 4 mm-SW höher als bei 1 mm-SW. Es wurde vermutet, dass die Menge an verfügbarem N im RUSITEC-System das mikrobielle Wachstum fördert. Die Effizienz der mikrobiellen XP-Synthese (mg mikrobieller N/g abgebaute OS) stieg mit zunehmendem Anteil an GS in der Ration von 29 auf 43 an, war aber nicht durch die SW beeinflusst. Der N-Gehalt und das Aminosäurenprofil der drei Mikrobenfraktionen, ebenso wie das quantitative Verhältnis von Mikroben der festen und flüssigen Phase zueinander, waren durch die Rationsgestaltung und die SW beeinflusst. Wechselwirkungen von Grund-futterquelle und SW auf die untersuchten Merkmale waren kaum zu beobachten. Allerdings deuteten sich Wechselwirkungen zwischen den beiden Faktoren und der Herkunft der Mikrobenfraktion auf die Parameter der mikrobiellen Proteinsynthese an. Um zusätzliche Informationen zum Futterwert zu erhalten, wurden zwei weitere Methoden zur Evaluierung der Mischrationen herangezogen. Eine Bestimmung der Rohnährstoff-verdaulichkeit bei Hammeln ergab, dass der Gehalt an umsetzbarer Energie zwischen den Rationen ähnlich war und im Mittel 11. 5 MJ je kg Trockensubstanz betrug. Zudem wurde in vitro die Gasbildung über 93 h mittels eines modifizierten Hohenheimer Futterwert-Testes gemessen, um Aussagen zur Kinetik und zum Umfang der ruminalen Fermentation zu erhalten. Die kumulative Gasbildung nahm mit steigendem Anteil an GS in der Ration ab. Der negative Einfluss einer gröberen Vermahlung im Hohenheimer Futterwert-Test konnte bestätigt werden. In allen Rationen war die Gasbildung durch eine Erhöhung der SW von 1 mm auf 4 mm vermindert. Die Ergebnisse aus diesen beiden Untersuchungsansätzen untermauerten die Aussage der RUSITEC-Studie, dass ein stufenweiser Austausch von MS durch GS in der Ration zu einer linearen Änderung im Nährstoffabbau führt. Die Ergebnisse zur Gasbildung deuteten darauf hin, dass positive assoziative Effekte nur in den ersten Stunden nach Beginn der Inkubation auftreten. Bei der Verwendung von Mischrationen können Effekte nicht eindeutig einzelnen Futter-komponenten zugeordnet werden. Zudem kann bei den Mischrationen nicht ausgeschlossen werden, dass Wechselwirkungen zwischen dem zugesetzten Sojaextraktionsschrot und der Grundfutterquelle oder der Futterpartikelgröße auftreten. Deshalb wurden in der zweiten Versuchsreihe ausschließlich die beiden Silagen getrennt inkubiert und drei verschiedene SW während der Vermahlung genutzt (1, 4, 9 mm). In Übereinstimmung mit den Ergebnissen der ersten Versuchsreihe war der Abbau der OS, der Faserfraktionen und der Nichtstruktur-Kohlenhydrate, die Menge an NH 3 -N sowie der mikrobielle XP-Fluss und die Effizienz der mikrobiellen XP-Synthese bei GS höher als bei MS. Ein höherer XP-Abbau konnte bei MS im Vergleich zu GS festgestellt werden, was Hinweis auf eine Wechsel-wirkung zwischen Grundfutterquelle und der Zulage von Sojaextraktionsschrot gibt. Ein Anstieg in der Siebweite von 1 auf 9 mm führte in beiden Silagen zu einer Verbesserung im Abbau der OS, des XP und der Nichtstruktur-Kohlenhydrate, inbesondere von Stärke in MS, sowie zu einem erhöhten mikrobiellen XP-Fluss. Die Effizienz der mikrobiellen XP-Synthese, sowie das Aminosäurenmuster waren kaum von der SW beeinflusst. In der zweiten Versuchsreihe wurde zusätzlich der Effekt der N-Verfügbarkeit auf die Fermentation von MS untersucht. Die Zugabe von Harnstoff-N führte zu einer Verbesserung im Abbau der Nichtstruktur-Kohlenhydrate, insbesondere der Stärke. Der Abbau der Faser-fraktionen blieb hingegen unbeeinflusst. Die Effizienz der mikrobiellen XP-Synthese erhöhte sich von 26 auf 35 mg mikrobieller N/g abgebaute OS infolge der Harnstoffzugabe. Die Art und Weise der Harnstoffsupplementierung, entweder einmal täglich zusammen mit dem Futter oder als kontinuierliche Infusion über die Pufferlösung, hatte nur marginale Auswirkungen auf die untersuchten Fermentationsparameter. Es wurde geschlussfolgert, dass das mikrobielle Wachstum im RUSITEC-System durch den Abbau der OS aus GS im Vergleich zu MS, sowie durch eine Erhöhung der verfügbaren N-Menge begünstigt wird. Nennenswerte assoziative Effekte auf das Fermentationsgeschehen durch die Kombination von MS und GS in Mischrationen sind nicht zu erwarten. Allerdings ist die Übertragbarkeit dieser Ergebnisse auf andere Silage-Chargen begrenzt, da große Unterschiede in der chemischen Zusammensetzung bestehen können, sowohl bei MS als auch bei GS. Die Fermentation von MS und GS wird durch eine gröbere Vermahlung mit Erhöhung der SW von 1 mm bis auf 9 mm positiv beeinflusst. Infolgedessen sollten Unterschiede in der SW und der Futterpartikelgrößenverteilung bei der Bewertung von Silagen im RUSITEC-System berücksichtigt werden. Die Veränderungen in der Zusammen-setzung und der Mengenanteile der einzelnen Mikrobenfraktionen, als Folge der Variation der Grundfutterquelle und der Futterpartikelgröße, weisen auf eine Verschiebung in der Zusammensetzung der mikrobiellen Gemeinschaft hin. Zudem bestätigen die vorliegenden Ergebnisse, dass die Herkunft der Mikrobenmasse einen großen Einfluss auf die Bewertung der mikrobiellen Proteinsynthese hat...|$|E

Other lower cost mills dotted the American South, staffed by a labor force willing to accept lesser wages in the wake of a collapsed post-war economy. These mills specialized in low cost, easily produced cotton goods of middling quality, leaving an opening in the marketplace for finely produced cotton textiles.
