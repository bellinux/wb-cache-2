500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} pilot were generally positive. Eric Goldman of IGN rated the pilot {{eight out of}} ten. Goldman admitted that while he [...] "never had any interest in the many stories of forensics investigators and the various bodily fluids they can use to solve crimes," [...] he found [...] "new series engaging and fun." [...] Goldman particularly praised Caan's performance in the episode, stating he [...] "is very good, bringing a lot of humor to the part and finding an easy chemistry with O'Loughlin. Per usual {{for this type of}} story, McGarrett and Danny don't get along initially and Caan is able to add a lot of charm to small moments like Danny saying to himself, 'I hate him. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him</b> so much.'" [...] However, the reviewer also enjoyed the main cast in general, stating they were a [...] "very well cast and likable bunch and make this an easily accessible series. They're a group you want to spend more time with." [...] Adam Sweeting of The Arts Desk stated [...] "The refreshing thing about Five-0 (revisited) is that while it has been given a brisk 21st-century spring clean, with international terrorism, people-smuggling and a blast of ultra-modern spook technology, its uncomplicated heart still belongs to the 1970s." [...] Sweeting added that [...] "the good guys (and girl) are clearly identified," [...] and [...] "the baddies are unambiguously despicable." ...|$|E
2500|$|The writers also {{referred}} to Kennedy as [...] "the little buggle-eyed bastard",. However, they admired his talent. Jim Pike said, [...] ".. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him,</b> {{but he is the}} best there is".|$|E
2500|$|Anselm's {{vision was}} of a {{universal}} Church with its own internal authority, which clashed with WilliamII's desire for royal control over both church and state. One of Anselm's first conflicts with William came in the month he was consecrated. WilliamII was preparing to wrest Normandy from his elder brother, RobertII, and needed funds. Anselm was among those expected to pay him. He offered Â£500 but William refused, encouraged by his courtiers to insist on 1000 {{as a kind of}} annates for Anselm's elevation to archbishop. Anselm not only refused, he further pressed the king to fill England's other vacant positions, permit bishops to meet freely in councils, and to allow Anselm to resume enforcement of canon law, particularly against incestuous marriages, until he was ordered to silence. When a group of bishops subsequently suggested that William might now settle for the original sum, Anselm replied that he had already given the money to the poor and [...] "that he disdained to purchase his master's favour as he would a horse or ass". The king being told this, he replied Anselm's blessing for his invasion would not be needed as [...] "I hated him before, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him</b> now, and shall hate him still more hereafter". Withdrawing to Canterbury, Anselm began work on the Cur Deus Homo.|$|E

[...] "He came to St. Argueil {{about a year}} ago. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> then. <b>I</b> have <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> ever since. <b>I</b> {{think that}} if all men were like that I would be content {{to stay in the}} convent all my life." ...|$|R

"I {{hate him}} for his mother's sake. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him</b> for his own sake. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him</b> for going to London behind my back, and making {{inquiries}} about me. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him</b> for forcing {{me out of my}} situation before I wanted to go. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him</b> for destroying all my hopes of marrying him, and throwing me back helpless on my own miserable life. But, oh, after what I have done already in the past time, how can I? how can I? ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the friend}} that I had loved came towards me, {{and we walked}} {{together}} with our hands clasped. But <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Ray {{turned to}} me. There was {{a look in}} his eyes which I readily understood. At that moment I think that <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'One only, but {{he talks}} {{of his wife}} in a revolting way. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> for it. He thought he was being epigrammatic and brilliant.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not care}} if they were. The girls can have him and welcome. I don't want him. I never did. I am tired of hearing {{everyone}} eulogize him. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him.</b> Do you hear? <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him!</b> And I wish you would go away and leave me alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is ordinarily VERY handsome," [...] said he, {{with such}} a leer {{at a couple of}} passers-by, that one of them cried, [...] "Oh, crikey, here's a {{precious}} guy!" [...] and a child, in its nurse's arms, screamed itself into convulsions. [...] "Oh, oui, che suis tres-choli garcon, bien peau, cerdainement," [...] continued Mr. Pinto; [...] "but you were right. That--that person was not very well pleased when he saw me. There was no love lost between us, as you say; and the world never knew a more worthless miscreant. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him,</b> voyez-vous? I hated him alife; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him</b> dead. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him</b> man; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>him</b> ghost: and he know it, and tremble before me.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>him.</b> He {{was short}} and stout and florid, with an impertinent-looking moustache, and hair that was very smooth and oily save for two tight curls, which looked like the horns of a young goat, {{on each side of}} the centre parting. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> cordially, and had to control my {{feelings}} not to show him the contempt which I felt for his fatuousness and his air of self-complacency. Fortunately the beautiful being was the first to address me, and thus I was able to ignore the very presence of the detestable man.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} to ask me where is the {{necessity}} of my hate for such as Haldin, I would answer you--there is nothing sentimental in it. <b>I</b> did not <b>hate</b> <b>him</b> because he had committed the crime of murder.

60|$|On {{the very}} next day but one I was sitting behind my glass partition, as before, when he came into the outer office, as before. The moment I saw him again without hearing <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> worse than ever.|$|R
60|$|Thinking of her fair, sweet face, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> for his mocking laugh. But {{the next}} moment, looking into his deep eyes, seeing {{the pain that}} dwelt there, my pity was for him. A smile came to his ugly mouth.|$|R

60|$|Isabella, judging Phillippa by herself, gave {{a little}} moan of despair, and Owen, blinded by love and hope, thought his cause was won. But I knew my dearie too well to be glad, and Mark Foster did, too, and <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> for it.|$|R
6000|$|I kiss'd {{his eyelids}} into rest: [...] His ruddy cheek upon my breast. [...] The wind is raging in turret and tree. [...] <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>him</b> with the <b>hate</b> of hell, [...] But I loved his beauty passing well. [...] O the Earl was fair to see! ...|$|R

60|$|Bitter indeed {{was it that}} I {{dared not}} give him the lie. But what could I do? The {{character}} Wright gave me was scarcely worse than what I had chosen to represent. I had to acknowledge the justice of his claim, but nevertheless <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|...

6000|$|... "Yes, at last," [...] said Mab, sharply. [...] "But {{he might}} have said {{something}} encouraging sooner.
