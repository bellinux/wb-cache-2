5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a mang, or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the kuan yi, a simple <b>gown</b> <b>with</b> patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic <b>gown</b> <b>with</b> varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in {{with the rest of the}} costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a <b>gown</b> <b>with</b> a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. The lower half of the body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E

5000|$|Through the mid-1930s, {{the natural}} {{waistline}} was {{often accompanied by}} emphasis on an empire line. Short bolero jackets, capelets, and dresses cut with fitted midriffs or seams below the bust increased the focus on breadth at the shoulder. By the late 1930s, emphasis was moving to the back, with halter necklines and high-necked but backless evening <b>gowns</b> <b>with</b> sleeves. [...] Evening <b>gowns</b> <b>with</b> matching jackets were worn to the theatre, nightclubs, and elegant restaurants.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} traditions at St Andrews is the wearing of academic dress, particularly the distinctive red undergraduate gown of the United College. Undergraduates in Arts and Science subjects can be seen wearing these garments at the installation of a Rector or Chancellor, at chapel services, on 'Pier Walks', at formal hall dinners, at meetings of the Union Debating Society, giving tours to prospective students and visitors {{as well as on}} St Andrews day and to sit examinations. Divinity students wear a black undergraduate <b>gown</b> <b>with</b> a purple saltire cross on the left facing. Postgraduates wear the graduate gown or, as members of St Leonard College, may wear a black gown trimmed with burgundy, introduced for graduate students whose original university is without academic dress. (See Academic dress of the University of St Andrews.) St Mary's College Post Graduates, however, wear their graduate <b>gown</b> <b>with</b> a purple saltire cross on the left facing.|$|E
25|$|Many {{institutions}} whose dress includes gowns {{of varying}} lengths prescribe the appropriate length of each <b>gown</b> <b>with</b> reference {{to parts of}} the wearer's body (undergraduate gowns at Cambridge, for example, must not reach the knees, whereas BA gowns should reach just beyond them, according to the University's statutes). As such, suppliers of academic dress produce gowns in many different sizes to fit persons of different heights.|$|E

25|$|The undress gown {{or black}} gown {{is similar to}} the MA gown (for PhD, LittD, ScD and in {{practice}} DD) or is a 'lay-type' gown similar to that worn by Queen's Counsel (LLD, MD, MusD). Different doctorates are distinguished from each other and from the plain MA gown by different arrangements of lace on the sleeves, facings or flap collar. The DD traditionally had a <b>gown</b> <b>with</b> sleeves like that on American gowns being gathered at the wrists which are called 'bishop's sleeves' or 'pudding sleeves'.|$|E
