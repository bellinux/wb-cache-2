40|$|ProblemMany {{countries}} have weak disease surveillance and immunization systems. The elimination of polio creates {{an opportunity to}} use staff and assets from the polio <b>eradication</b> <b>programme</b> to control other vaccine-preventable diseases and improve disease surveillance and immunization systems. ApproachIn 2003, the active surveillance system of Nepal 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s polio <b>eradication</b> <b>programme</b> began to report on measles and neonatal tetanus cases. Japanese encephalitis and rubella cases {{were added to the}} surveillance system in 2004. Staff from the programme aided {{the development and implementation of}} government immunization policies, helped launch vaccination campaigns, and trained government staff in reporting practices and vaccine management. Local settingNepal eliminated indigenous polio in 2000, and controlled outbreaks caused by polio importations between 2005 and 2010. Relevant changesIn 2014, the surveillance activities had expanded to 299 sites, with active surveillance for measles, rubella and neonatal tetanus, including weekly visits from 15 surveillance medical officers. Sentinel surveillance for Japanese encephalitis consisted of 132 sites. Since 2002, staff from the <b>eradication</b> <b>programme</b> have helped to introduce six new vaccines and helped to secure funding from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Staff have also assisted in responding to other health events in the country. Lesson learntBy expanding the activities of its polio <b>eradication</b> <b>programme,</b> Nepal has improved its surveillance and immunization systems and increased vaccination coverage of other vaccine-preventable diseases. Continued donor support, a close collaboration with the Expanded Programme on Immunization, and the retention of the polio <b>eradication</b> <b>programme</b> 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s skilled workforce were important for this expansion. 28250536 PMC 532810...|$|R

Prevalence rate, New case detection rate, Percentage of cases released from treatment, Proportion of multibacillary (MB) cases among new cases, Proportion of grade II disability among new cases and Proportion of child cases among new cases were evaluated. Results: Analysis of records of ten years indicated a decrease in prevalence rate of leprosy. Over the years a declining trend in grade II disability among new cases was noted. There was an increase in percentage of patients being released from treatment. Case detection rate was increasing steadily from year 1992 to 1998. Analysis of data relating to proportion of cases among children did not show a consistency in trend.
