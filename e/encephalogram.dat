We distinguish it clinically, electrophysiologically, and genetically from previously described Mendelian epilepsies. the family described is a large Brazilian kindred of Portuguese extraction in which affected family members manifest a variety of seizure types, including hemiclonic, hemitonic, generalized tonic-clonic, simple partial (stereotyped episodes of epigastric pain), and complex partial seizures consistent with temporal lobe epilepsy. the syndrome is benign, either requiring no treatment or responding to a single antiepileptic medication. Seizure onset is in {{the first or second}} decades of life, with seizures in individuals up to the age of 71 years and documented <b>encephalogram</b> changes up to the age of 30 years. A key feature of partial epilepsy with pericentral spikes is a characteristic <b>encephalogram</b> abnormality of spikes or sharp waves in the pericentral region (centroparietal, centrofrontal, or centrotemporal). This distinctive <b>encephalogram</b> abnormality of pericentral spikes unites these several seizure types into a discrete family epilepsy syndrome.

40|$|Turbulence {{is present}} {{everywhere}} in our environment yet its complexities remain {{one of the}} great challenges in scientific and engineering research. This work began out of personal interest. As such, it involved all aspects of my background, not just my engineering training. It is disconcerting to some westerners to think of scientists as philosophers. In the traditional Vietnamese culture, {{it is not possible to}} think of scientists as not being philosophers. In the old days we taught philosophy before we gave more practical training because all that we do IS influenced by our beliefs. I was educated in French schools and New Zealand universities while being raised in a strongly nationalistic culture. This bicultural upbringing led at some stages of my youth to a painful crisis of identity but it greatly enriched my life and coloured my approach to science. The reader will find the influences of this background in my ideas about turbulence. At one time, the West used to think of Asian beliefs as vague. I was first taught by an extraordinary Vietnamese electrical engineer that our description of the universe was in fact a binary progression. This is found in the Kinh Dich (in Chinese Yi-King, the Book of Change). This concept is not specific to the Vietnamese or Chinese cultures. It can be found in Indian thought, in Islamic Kybalion (their secret book), in Egyptian and South American cultures. Since that day, I have learned much more about traditional Vietnamese culture which is unconsciously reflected in some of the ideas I have developed in this research. We believe that all phenomena are periodic. The manifestations that look continuous may in fact be thought of as an endless repetition of events that regenerate constantly. They are not static. I was not unduly surprised to learn of Fourier analysis which decomposes a continuous function into a series of periodic elements. I was thus receptive to the idea that one can define a timescale even for laminar flow, when I found it. It became eventually a transformation between the penetration and boundary layer theories of heat and mass transfer (Appendix A 4). We also believe, for example, that all things in Creation are governed by the same fundamental laws. In oriental medicine, it allowed us to understand and cure the human body by observing the laws that govern the larger universe. In essence, the organisation of the solar system is paralleled by that of the human body: there is a correspondence between the macrocosm and the microcosm. The reader will find a reflection of that thought in Chapter 9 where I endeavour to compare the information contained in time-averaged measurements to the those obtained from transient contributions. We believe that, like us, the Earth breathes. In the teaching of Khi Cong (the equivalent of Yoga) which I studied briefly, it is important to take note of and keep in harmony with this natural cycle since we derive so many of our resources from the Earth where we live. I have often wondered whether our environmental engineering would not have benefited if those ideas had permeated into Western science. To me, thoughts are not abstractions. They are concrete entities. We can now detect them through <b>encephalograms.</b> Thus thoughts that are conceived by a person are broad casted into the environment. If one is receptive, one can gather the wisdom of others around us. This is why Asian philosophy puts such an emphasis on emptying ourself of our own stray thoughts. This ultimate state of dispossession, mental as well as emotional and physical, is not easy to achieve because we tend to cling so hard to our own pre-conceived ideas. Vietnam can truly boast of having the most isolated scientific community in the world. The isolation imposed on the Vietnamese people by the Communists has forced many of us to face ourselves. In some cases it has been useful because this intellectual silence has made us much more receptive to the thoughts around us. In that sense, I have always felt that my work is simply the natural outcome of ideas evolved by my elders and colleagues in this field. In Phong Thuy (in Chinese Feng Shui, the art of shaping landscaping) the position where one buries one's ancestors is important because the configuration of the land filters the waves that are picked up by the remains of the deceased and transmitted to their descendants who are on the same wavelength. This is how innate talents are formed. As a people, the Vietnamese have had a wonderful ability to assimilate and adapt the culture of the peoples we meet, even those who tried to conquer us. The tragic history of our country during the last hundred years has unfortunately eroded the confidence of many among us. The unfortunate policies of the Communist government during the last seventeen years have hit particularly hard and we risk losing much of our fine heritage. It is particularly painful for me to see how many of my friends, some certainly brighter than I am, have given up on research because the facilities, if they exist at all, are so much poorer than anywhere else. In the later years, the driving force behind the present work was no longer pure interest but the need to show that, whatever the circumstances, our achievements are only restricted by our perseverance with the task at hand. The work became a statement of philosophy as much as one of engineering research. My hope is that my work will make a contribution to the field, that it will be recognised as such and in a small way help the Vietnamese nation find itself again.

40|$|International audiencePropofol is a {{chemical}} agent commonly {{used as an}} intravenous general anesthetic. At the cellular level, this short-acting ananesthetic positively modulates GABAergic inhibitory activity by targeting GABA-A receptors [1]. This type of receptors are widespread {{in the brain and}} can be present both within synaptic clefts, as well as on extrasynaptic locations along the dendrites and neuron membrane where they are responsible for tonic inhibition. At the macroscopic level of SEEG (deep Stereographic-Electro <b>Encephalogram)</b> or EEG (Electro <b>Encephalogram)</b> recordings, one observes, with certain doses of propofol, a paradoxical excitation phenomenon [2] the generation mechanisms of which are not clearly understood. In this study, we suggest a potential mechanism for the appearance of paradoxical excitation occurring under propofol-induced general anaesthesia. We show, with a model network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, that tonic inhibition – induced by the binding of propofol to extra-synaptic receptors – together with an increase of the synaptic time constant within an certain range [3] can account for the phenomenon of paradoxical excitation. However, changes in the gain (or conductance) of the synaptic inhibition do not correspond to a sudden increase in neuronal population firing rate nor synchrony as described in the experiments [3]. The action of propofol on extrasynaptic GABAergic receptors was modelled by varying the conductance g ton of a tonic current in the form $I ton = g ton (V − E ton) $ as described in [4]. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the neuronal population firing rate and the coherence (or synchrony) of the network activity as the tonic inhibition and the synaptic conductance vary. The plots are given for different values of the synaptic time constants. The increase of these three variables, synaptic time constant and conductance, and tonic conductance reflect an increase in propofol doses...|$|E
