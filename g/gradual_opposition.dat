40|$|The logical {{end of one}} act or fact is only one, but {{in human}} {{language}} {{it is not the}} same. So, in the Latin system of adverbs there are four words: denique, postremo, tandem and demum that mean the termination of one thing in a different way. Among all of these words and with respect to the end there is a privative opposition: denique, postremo and tandem vs. demum; the last word is the unmarked term Furthermore, we can find a <b>gradual</b> <b>opposition</b> in the other three adverbs, whose term less marked is denique, and the most one is demum, the only word of the four which always means the real end...|$|E
40|$|This article {{highlights}} {{the specificity of}} the prosodic subsystems integration within the conflict interactions of English business discourse. Conflict interactions are analyzed with the distinction of three stages: background, escalation and closure. The research defines {{the correlation between the}} speaker’s intention and prosodic actualization of logical argumentative interactions based on the communicative basis. The characteristics of prosody as a means of integration with-in conflict interactions have been experimentally determined, namely variations of falling tones on the nucleus, descending dynamics of energy maximums, accelerated and temperate tempo, short pauses. The tone frequency and intensity dynamics on the conflict interactions reveal high degree of their evaluative component. It has been proven that the prosodic characteristics integration reflects the communicative and pragmatic load of English business discourse interactions and conveys the specificity of this discourse pragmatic potential actualization. The results of the experimental phonetic study point out the integral nature of the prosodic marking of the pragmatic potential of each constituent of the <b>gradual</b> <b>opposition...</b>|$|E
40|$|The role of terms-indirect {{nominations}} in the thesaurus {{of information}} retrieval {{system of the}} Slavic linguistics The article examines {{some of the problems}} of modern information retrieval systems in the Slavic studies, in particular, one of the most representative – Bibliographic Database World Slavonic Linguistics, created in the Institute of Slavic Studies of PAS under the leadership of Dr. Z. E. Rudnik-Karwatova. The author focuses on the ways to improve the linguistic support of such systems and increase the efficiency of image for information searching. They are connected with the study of the keywords in the annotations of scientific publications within database, {{as well as in the}} whole of modern Slavic linguistic terminology. This study enables us not only to select a comprehensive number of terms for each linguistic discipline, school, or problem, but also to determine their variability as well as their relationship with other terms of modern-­day Slavic linguistics. The result of such study should be information retrieval thesaurus of modern Slavic linguistic terminology. Special attention in the article is paid to the role of indirect nomination in modern Slavic linguistic terminology, system-organizing function of the terms with indirect semantics, resources and modes of their creating in different Slavonic languages, the correlation between indirect nomination and figurative one as well as the terms which indicate the place of object in some classifications (see Ukrainian середній рід) or <b>gradual</b> <b>opposition</b> (see Polish semileksem) ...|$|E

After four more wins, Spinks finished '77 with the first fight that began a <b>gradual</b> ascent in <b>opposition</b> quality: an eight-round decision over Gary Summerhays, a popular young boxer of the time.|$|R
40|$|The {{square of}} {{opposition}} {{is as old}} as logic. There has been a recent renewal of interest on this topic, due to the emergence of new structures (hexagonal and cubic) extending the square. They apply to a large variety of representation frameworks, all based on the notions of sets and relations. After a reminder about the structures of opposition, and an introduction to their gradual extensions (exempli_ed on fuzzy sets), the paper more particularly studies fuzzy rough sets and rough fuzzy sets in the setting of <b>gradual</b> structures of <b>opposition...</b>|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{theoretical}} literature on price setting behavior, we model three distinct forms of nonlinearity that can describe the reduced-form Phillips curve: reaction asymmetry, state dependence and {{a mix of}} both. Employing these models to the G 5 for the 1985 - 2011 period, we find that: (i) the Phillips curve is unstable and nonlinear and (ii) there exist threshold levels of inflation and capacity utilization that erode price rigidity. Our results reinforce the existence of downward price rigidity in Japan, helping to explain the puzzle of <b>gradual</b> deflation. In <b>opposition,</b> downward price flexibility is verified for U. S. ...|$|R
500|$|The {{debate over}} the status of slavery in the territories {{exacerbated}} sectional tensions between the slave-holding South and the North, and the Compromise of 1850 failed to defuse the issue. In the early 1850s, Lincoln supported efforts for sectional mediation, and his 1852 eulogy for Henry Clay focused on the latter's support for <b>gradual</b> emancipation and <b>opposition</b> to [...] "both extremes" [...] on the slavery issue. As the 1850s progressed, the debate over slavery in the Nebraska Territory and Kansas Territory became particularly acrimonious, and Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise measure; the proposal would take the issue of slavery {{out of the hands}} of Congress by allowing the people of each territory to decide the status of slavery themselves. The proposal alarmed many Northerners, who hoped to stop the spread of slavery into the territories. Despite this Northern opposition, Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.|$|R

After a strong campaign for the 8 September elections in Moscow and many regions the opposition had won remarkable successes. So Navalny reached in Moscow a second place with surprising 27% behind Kremlin-backed Sergei Sobyanin with 51%. In other regions oppositions candidates received remarkable successes. So in the big industrial town Yekaterinburg In 2013 opposition candidate Yevgeny Roizman received the majority of votes and became the mayor of that town. The slow but <b>gradual</b> sequence of <b>opposition</b> successes reached by mass protests, election campaigns and other peaceful strategies has been recently called by observers and analysts as of Radio Free Europe [...] "Tortoise Revolution" [...] {{in contrast to the}} radical [...] "rose" [...] or [...] "orange" [...] ones the Kremlin tried to prevent.|$|R
6000|$|Early in the night,--before twelve o'clock,--the House divided, {{and even}} {{at the moment of}} the {{division}} no one quite knew how it would go. There would be many who would of course vote against the amendment as being simply desirous of recording their opinion in favour of the Bill generally. And there were some who thought that Sir Orlando and his followers had been too forward, and too confident of their own standing in the House, in trying so violent a mode of opposition. It would have been better, these men thought, to have insured success by a <b>gradual</b> and persistent <b>opposition</b> to the Bill itself. But they hardly knew how thoroughly men may be alienated by silence and a cold demeanour. Sir Orlando on the division was beaten, but was beaten only by nine. [...] "He can't go on with his Bill," [...] said Rattler in one of the lobbies of the House. [...] "I defy him. The House wouldn't stand it, you know." [...] "No minister," [...] said Roby, [...] "could carry a measure like that with a majority of nine on a vote of confidence!" [...] The House was of course adjourned, and Mr. Monk went at once to Carlton Terrace.|$|R
40|$|Ankara : The Department of History, Bilkent University, 2002. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2002. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 57 - 59. The {{ideas to}} introduce an Islamic Modernization {{in the political}} and social realms of the Ottoman Empire started as a reaction to the westernization attempts of the Tanzimat bureaucrats. It was not a quick response to the 1839 reforms, but a <b>gradual</b> development of <b>opposition</b> that started as of the 1856 decree, then reached its peak after the promulgation of the first constitution. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to find out the seeds of the attempts to give the Tazminat reforms and Islamic character in Ahmet Cevdet Paşa's thoughts, who was one of the leading Islamic scholars, as well as the statesmen, of the time. Since his life and his works have the most useful clues, which give us the best information about his struggles, I tended to organize my discussions around his ideas on various issues of the time. In the first part of my work, I will provide the biography of Cevdet Paşa in order to enable the reader to understand the following discusssions. In the second part, Cevdet's understanding of Islam and 'Islamıc Modernısm' will be discussed. In this part, I will make comparisons between his ideas and the contemporary Islamic thinkers' works in order to determine his standing among the Islamic intellectuals. The topic of the next section will be "how he opposed the 1856 decree and to the 1876 constitution despite the fact that he had been a fervent advocate of the 1839 Tanzimat Reforms?" In this section, I will also focus on his pro-Shari'a perspective, and discuss how he tolerated the establishment of the courts other than the Shari'a courts and the enforcement of the French codes in these courts. In this way I hope to show all the ambiguities inherent in the moderate Islamic position in a reforming Ottoman Empire. Yavuz, M SaitM. S...|$|R
