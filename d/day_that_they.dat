5|$|On June 25, 2015, Hardaway {{was traded}} to the Atlanta Hawks in {{exchange}} for the draft rights to Jerian Grant. Despite averaging 24 points in the Hawks' final two preseason contests, Hardaway was listed as inactive for the season opener. However, on the same <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> announced he would be inactive for the opener, the Hawks announced that they picked up the team option for the 201617 season. He was expected to battle Kyle Korver, Kent Bazemore, and Thabo Sefolosha for playing time as the season progressed. Hardaway also found himself competing with Lamar Patterson and Justin Holiday for time as he adjusted to his new team and their new gameplan. As a result, Hardaway did not debut with the Hawks until November 24 against the Boston Celtics in the team's 16th game.|$|E

25|$|In August 2008, {{several of}} the {{municipalities}} announced they were considering taking legal action against Citigroup, in either the United Kingdom or the United States, to hold Citigroup responsible for the losses. On 8 September, the eight municipal councils involved unanimously voted to hold DnB NOR and Depfa Bank liable for their losses, by issuing loans that were illegal according to the Municipality Act. The municipalities will no longer honour the loan commitments, and stop payments. Kjell-Idar Juvik claimed he hoped the banks {{would be willing to}} negotiate the matter, and hoped to avoid legal proceedings, but said that municipalities would not hesitate to bring the matter to court. DnB Nor announced that following <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are considering taking legal action against the municipalities to force them to continue payments.|$|E

Two days later, after the Test match had been completed, three more arrests were made (two unidentified men and an unidentified woman) on suspicion of money laundering in connection with the allegations. Police also seized the cell phones of Asif, Amir, and Salman Butt as part of their investigations. Scotland Yard announced on 17 September, 2010 that the initial file of the investigation had been passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service for them to decide whether to charge the players or not. On 5 November, 2010 Scotland Yard announced that they had passed on the second file of fixing evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. This moved the case one step closer to the courts.|$|E
25|$|Cactus Jack {{wrestled}} Big Van Vader on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, {{but being}} severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot {{to sell a}} storyline injury. Vader removed the protective mats at ringside and powerbombed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot. While Foley was away, WCW ran an angle where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a farcical comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia. Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy vignettes that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in Have a Nice <b>Day</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were the brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem {{that needed to be}} solved.|$|E
25|$|Task Review: Renaissance decided upon an Italian theme, but {{spent too}} long with their brand and pricing for the themed <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not buy from the wholesalers, thus forced {{to buy from}} {{elsewhere}} and resulting in increased food costs. Although their income was high and their services smoothed out after a shaky start, the team suffered {{from a lack of}} supplies that resorted to them cutting prices in half on their pizzas, with their expenditure being much higher due to their high cost overruns. Meanwhile, Alpha chose a Bollywood theme, yet while they managed to arrange all their printing for free, they were forced to cancel their lunch service due to the food not being prepared properly. They soon turned things around by focusing on a sales strategy of selling admission tickets for £5 that were redeemable against dinner, which proved to be a decisive idea as they secured a healthy profit, even before they had served a meal.|$|E

25|$|Initially all {{meetings}} between the Norwegian and Soviet commissioners and their staff {{was held at}} the Storskog–Boris Gleb crossing. The Soviets quickly bought a small cabin to host meetings. If the meeting was initiated by the Soviets, it was held in the premises, while it was held outdoors if initiated by the Norwegians, unless circumstances dictated {{that it had to be}} held indoors. This caused the Norwegian authorities to build a conference room on their side of the border, which opened in 1956. Initially {{meetings between}} the two commissioners would be called by hoisting a flag or red lamp at the border, and the other country's soldiers would alert the commissioner, who would meet within two hours. Later a telephone connection was installed and the parties agreed on two hours each week <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were to be available along with an interpreter. Initially the Soviet commissioner was based in Salmijärvi, but later moved to Nikel.|$|E

This can all happen within a 36-day period. This is done as a survival strategy to produce large numbers of offspring {{in a short period of}} time. This places tremendous demands on the mother. Research suggests biparental care in Campbell's hamsters (P. campbelli) but not in Djungarian hamsters (P. sungorus). [...] Frequent fighting can occur between the pups and as soon as they are weaned from their mother, they are separated from her. [...] Most Djungarian hamster dwarf hamsters grow to 3 to 4" [...] long. Djungarian hamsters breed all year round as no specific breeding season exists.|$|E
