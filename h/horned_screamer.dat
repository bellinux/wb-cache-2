5000|$|Screamers (Anhimidae) {{have two}} large spikes on the carpometacarpus. The larger one {{emerges from the}} {{extensor}} process, and a more distally located spur grows from {{near the end of}} the major metacarpal. In the black-necked screamer (Chauna chavaria) the spikes are oval in cross-section, but in the southern screamer (Chauna torquata) there is a sharp-edged keel along the spike’s proximal edge, and in the <b>horned</b> <b>screamer</b> (Anhima cornuta) the spikes are triangular in cross-section with three sharp keels. [...] In the black-necked screamer, the proximal spike can be 4.5-4.7 cm long, but in the male <b>horned</b> <b>screamer</b> it can reach 6.1 cm in length.|$|E
50|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>screamer</b> is the {{official}} bird of the Department of Arauca and the Municipality of Arauca in Colombia {{and it is also}} a symbol in the National Reserve of Churute in Ecuador. The department and its capital are named after the bird, which is called Arauco in Spanish.|$|E
50|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>screamer</b> {{is found}} in {{lowlands}} from Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Suriname, French Guiana, and Guyana. It is now extinct in Trinidad and Tobago. Despite having declined locally, it remains widespread and is fairly common overall. Its range in Brazil appears to have expanded in recent years.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{recorded}} {{from the}} reserve include the fulvous whistling duck, blue-winged teal, osprey, wattled jacana, black-necked stilt, cocoi heron, striated heron, anhinga and neotropic cormorant. Of special interest are the grayish piculet, apical flycatcher, bar-crested antshrike and the scrub tanager. The reserve also supports {{the only remaining}} population of the <b>horned</b> <b>screamer</b> in the region.|$|E
50|$|There 13 mammal and reptile species, {{including}} the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) at its southern limit.There {{are more than}} 40 species of birds {{including the}} Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus), white-necked heron (Ardea pacifica), great egret (Ardea alba), American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), white-winged guan (Penelope albipennis) and <b>horned</b> <b>screamer</b> (Anhima cornuta).|$|E
50|$|Both the {{southern}} and the <b>horned</b> <b>screamer</b> remain widespread and are overall fairly common. In contrast, the northern screamer is relatively rare and consequently considered near threatened. They are seldom hunted, {{in spite of}} their conspicuous nature, because their flesh has a spongy texture and is riddled with air-sacs, making it highly unpalatable. The main threats are habitat destruction and increased intensification of agriculture.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} covered by {{secondary}} growth of seasonal semi-deciduous forest, arboreal/shrub/herbaceous formations in the várzea areas, and areas of riparian palms.Vegetation includes the vulnerable Euterpe edulis (Jussara palmito).Vulnerable, threatened or endangered fauna include <b>horned</b> <b>screamer</b> (Anhima cornuta), wood stork (Mycteria americana), black-collared hawk (Busarellus nigricollis), jabiru (Jabiru mycteria), American pygmy kingfisher (Chloroceryle aenea), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) and South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>screamer</b> [...] (Anhima cornuta) is {{a member}} of a small family of birds, the Anhimidae, which occurs in {{wetlands}} of tropical South America. There are three screamer species, the other two being the southern screamer and the northern screamer in the genus Chauna. They are related to the ducks, geese and swans, which are in the family Anatidae, but have bills looking more like those of game birds.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>screamer</b> is {{a massive}} 84 - 95 cm long, 3.5 kg bird, with a small chicken-like bill. The upperparts, head, and breast are black, with white {{speckles}} on the crown, throat and wing coverts. There is a long spiny structure projecting forward from the crown. This structure is unique among birds and is not derived from a feather but is a cornified structure that is loosely attached to the skull and grows continuously while often breaking at its tip. [...] This gives this species its name. It has very long and lanky legs and three large toes in each. The belly and under wing coverts are white. It has two sharp spurs on its wings and feet which are only partially webbed.|$|E
50|$|The screamers {{are a small}} family, Anhimidae, of South American birds. For a long time, {{they were}} thought to be most closely related to the Galliformes because of similar bills, but they are instead more closely related to ducks (family Anatidae), most closely to the magpie goose (which some DNA {{evidence}} suggests are closer to screamers than to ducks). The clade is exceptional within the living birds in lacking uncinate processes of ribs. The screamers are represented by three species, the <b>horned</b> <b>screamer</b> (Anhima cornuta), the southern screamer or crested screamer (Chauna torquata) and the northern screamer or black-necked screamer (Chauna chavaria). A penis is absent in the males, and the birds' skin has a layer about a quarter of an inch thick that is filled with small bubbles of air, which produce a crackling sound when pressed.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} bristle-like appendages on {{the tail}} of the Early Cretaceous basal ceratopsian dinosaur Psittacosaurus with laser-stimulated fluorescence imaging. Our study reveals previously unknown details of these structures and confirms their identification as integumentary appendages. For the first time, we show that most bristles appear to be arranged in bundles and that they exhibit a pulp that widens towards the bristle base. We consider it likely that the psittacosaur bristles are structurally and developmentally homologous to similar filamentous appendages of other dinosaurs, namely the basal heterodontosaurid Tianyulong and the basal therizinosauroid theropod Beipiaosaurus, and attribute the greater robustness of the bristles of Psittacosaurus to a higher degree of cornification and calcification of its integument (both skin and bristles). Although the psittacosaur bristles are probably homologous with avian feathers in their origin from discrete cell populations, it is uncertain whether they developed from a follicle, one of the developmental hallmarks of true feathers. In particular, we note a striking resemblance between the psittacosaur bristles and the cornified spine on the head of the <b>horned</b> <b>screamer,</b> Anhima cornuta, an extant anseriform bird. Similar, albeit thinner keratinous filaments of extant birds are the ‘beard’ of the turkey, Meleagris gallopavo, and the crown of the Congo peafowl, Afropavo congensis. All of these structures of extant birds are distinct from true feathers, and because at least the turkey beard does not develop from follicles, detailed future studies of their development would be invaluable towards deepening our understanding of dinosaur filamentous integumentary structures...|$|E
