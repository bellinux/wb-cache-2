5|$|CryptoWall 3.0 used a payload {{written in}} JavaScript {{as part of}} an email attachment, which {{downloads}} executables disguised as JPG images. To further evade detection, the malware creates new instances of explorer.exe and svchost.exe to communicate with its servers. When <b>encrypting</b> files, the malware also deletes volume shadow copies, and installs spyware that steals passwords and Bitcoin wallets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Encrypting</b> File System (EFS) {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with BitLocker to provide protection once the operating system is running. Protection of the files from processes and users within the operating system can only be performed using encryption software that operates within Windows, such as EFS. BitLocker and EFS, therefore, offer protection against different classes of attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} file <b>encrypting</b> {{ransomware}} was invented and implemented by Young and Yung at Columbia University and {{was presented at}} the 1996 IEEE Security & Privacy conference. It is called cryptoviral extortion and it was inspired by the fictional facehugger in the movie Alien. Cryptoviral extortion is the following three-round protocol carried out between the attacker and the victim.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, RSA {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} <b>encrypt</b> the secret message and advanced LSB technique is used to hide the <b>encrypted</b> message. Firstly, the message is <b>encrypted</b> and then <b>encrypted</b> message is being divided in two parts.

After that the xored <b>encrypted</b> message is being hidden on LSB position...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  2, a user U <b>encrypts</b> {{a set of}} data D = { D_ 1, D_ 2,..., D_n} and creates an <b>encrypted</b> index file I which {{contains}} a set of m <b>encrypted</b> keywords extracted from the data set D. In order to conduct a search over the <b>encrypted</b> data, user U outsources the index I and the <b>encrypted</b> data set D to the cloud server. During a search, U creates an <b>encrypted</b> query and sends it to the server. Cloud server takes this <b>encrypted</b> query as input and then uses the <b>encrypted</b> index located at the server to retrieve pointers to the document(s) containing the searched keyword. Once the search result is obtained, the <b>encrypted</b> document(s) containing the searched keyword is returned to the client.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of <b>encrypting</b> payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E
5|$|<b>Encrypting</b> {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|Petya {{was first}} {{discovered}} in March 2016; unlike {{other forms of}} <b>encrypting</b> ransomware, the malware aimed to infect the master boot record, installing a payload which encrypts the file tables of the NTFS file system the next time that the infected system boots, blocking the system from booting into Windows at all until the ransom is paid. Check Point reported that despite what it believed to be an innovative evolution in ransomware design, it had resulted in relatively-fewer infections than other ransomware active {{around the same time}} frame.|$|E
3000|$|... <b>encrypt</b> (...) : This {{function}} {{takes as}} input all the files from user given path and <b>encrypt</b> all the files and also creates an <b>encrypted</b> index. For each input file the function retrieves the keywords first {{and for each}} keyword it computes the 128 -bit AES encryption of the keyword and document ID. Then, it creates an index entry in the <b>encrypted</b> index table to list out the <b>encrypted</b> keyword and the corresponding document ID. It uses put ([...] key, value) specified in Java TreeMap interface to associate the specified value (document ID) with the specified key (<b>encrypted</b> keyword). Finally, it saves the <b>encrypted</b> index in the database. The input documents are ready for encryption once the indexing is finished. For the encryption of a document, this method first creates a new document in the database and writes the <b>encrypted</b> stream in this. For each <b>encrypted</b> document, the corresponding document ID is used as the new filename of the <b>encrypted</b> document.|$|R

30|$|Consider a privacy-preserving image {{retrieval}} scheme {{which involves}} three parties: content owner, authorized user, and server. The content owner <b>encrypts</b> {{images in the}} JPEG format and then stores them into cloud servers. The authorized user, may be a content owner, has desire to retrieval images similar to the <b>encrypted</b> query image from <b>encrypted</b> database images. When receiving the <b>encrypted</b> query image, the server can calculate the distances between the <b>encrypted</b> query image and database images and then returns <b>encrypted</b> images similar to the query image in plaintext content, without knowing anything about the plaintext contents of the involved <b>encrypted</b> images. In the following, we will present the mechanisms of image encryption and retrieval in detail.|$|R
5|$|<b>Encrypting</b> {{ransomware}} {{returned to}} prominence in late 2013 with {{the propagation of}} CryptoLocker—using the Bitcoin digital currency platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on Bitcoin transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, the operators of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied in the months following, including CryptoLocker 2.0 (though not {{to be related to}} CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major design flaw that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location, due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting network-attached storage devices produced by Synology. In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled attacks have occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through ransomware designed to target Linux-based web servers.|$|E
