A few months later, the other members signed deeds of release, granting the property solely to Thomas Bryan. Bryan acted as either a <b>feoffee</b> or an owner representing the governing body of the Inn (there are some records suggesting he may have been a Bencher at this point) but in 1493 he transferred the ownership by charter to a group including Sir Robert Brudenell and Thomas Wodeward, reverting the ownership of the Inn partially back to the Gray family.|$|E
5|$|In 1469 John Spencer's uncle – {{also named}} John Spencer – had become <b>feoffee</b> (feudal lord) of Wormleighton in Warwickshire and a tenant at Althorp in Northamptonshire in 1486. The family's {{administration}} of their Northamptonshire and Warwickshire estates gained them admiration and a following throughout England, and their sheep-rearing business earned large profits. After beginning construction of Wormleighton Manor {{the previous year}} with some 60 relatives, John Spencer bought Althorp in 1508 for £800 from the Catesby family. At the time Spencer was also lord of the manors of Fenny Compton, Stoneton, Nobottle, Great Brington, Little Brington, Harlestone, Glassthorpe, Flore, Wicken, Wyke Hamon, Upper Boddington, Lower Boddington and Hinton, and owned numerous other properties. The park took some four years to establish, with 300 acres of grassland, 100 acres of woodland and 40 acres of water.|$|E
25|$|Alongside {{his work}} for Ludlow, Burley {{extended}} his reach as a <b>feoffee</b> and lawyer upwards into the local nobility.

50|$|Beginning in 1625, a {{group of}} Puritan lawyers, merchants, and clergymen (including Richard Sibbes and John Davenport) {{organized}} an organization known as the <b>Feoffees</b> for the Purchase of Impropriations. The <b>feoffees</b> would raise funds to purchase lay impropriations and advowsons, which {{would mean that the}} <b>feoffees</b> would then have the legal right to appoint their chosen candidates to benefices and lectureships. Thus, this provided a mechanism both for increasing the number of preaching ministers in the country, and a way to ensure that Puritans could receive ecclesiastical appointments.|$|R

25|$|Edmund de Ludlow {{was also}} a <b>feoffee</b> of Sir Richard and presumably a close relative. John Burley also acted with him for more humble clients. For example, as feoffees they {{assisted}} Philip Herthale with the inheritance of a mere garden in Ashford Carbonell. However, things clearly did not go smoothly with Edmund and on 30 July 1390 Sir Richard replaced him with a chaplain, John de Stretton. Edmund was aggrieved and took his case to the Arches Court, which found in his favour. Subsequently, he alleged that Burley and Sir Richard's retinue had nevertheless physically expelled him from his benefice. Sir Richard died before the suit came to court: Edmund possibly prevailed, as someone of his name was also incumbent at Wistanstow later in the decade.|$|E
25|$|The Burley and Burnell estates in South Shropshire {{were closely}} entwined {{with those of}} Sir Richard Ludlow, a much more {{powerful}} landowner who had inherited eleven manors in Shropshire. For about a decade, until Ludlow's death late in 1390, Burley worked closely with {{him as one of}} his feoffees. For example, Burley was {{one of a group of}} feoffees whom Ludlow was licensed to appoint on 20 January 1383 in relation to lands at Hodnet and elsewhere, the aim being to ensure they passed to John Ludlow, Richard's brother, should he die sine prole, as he actually did. As a <b>feoffee</b> Burley exercised many of Ludlow's responsibilities and powers on his behalf. The register of Joh Gilbert, the Bishop of Hereford, shows that Burley jointly exercised the advowson of the church at Wistanstow, presenting Edmund de Ludlowe as rector on 6 August 1385.|$|E
50|$|In 1466 Shabbington {{was settled}} on Sir William Lovel, 7th Baron Morley, who in 1474 {{released}} the manor to <b>feoffees</b> including Richard Piggott, {{who in turn}} transferred it to other <b>feoffees,</b> of whom the principal was Richard Fowler. Fowler died in 1477; also Richard, was knighted in 1501 and sold Shabbington in 1515-18.|$|R
50|$|In 1629, Peter Heylin, a Magdalen don, preached {{a sermon}} in St Mary's denouncing the <b>Feoffees</b> for Impropriations for sowing tares among the wheat. As {{a result of}} the publicity, William Noy began to prosecute <b>feoffees</b> in the Exchequer court. The feoffees' defense was that all of the men they had had {{appointed}} to office conformed to the Church of England. Nevertheless, in 1632, the <b>Feoffees</b> for Impropriations were dissolved and the group's assets forfeited to the crown: Charles ordered that the money should be used to augment the salary of incumbents and used for other pious uses not controlled by the Puritans.|$|R
50|$|An {{organization}} of Puritans {{known as the}} <b>Feoffees</b> for Impropriations responded by raising funds. It was formally in existence from 1625 to 1633. Money was applied to buy impropriations and advowsons, thus allowing Puritan nominees to take over ministerial and lecturing positions. The suppression of the <b>Feoffees,</b> by legal action, was an early move of Laudianism.|$|R
25|$|Burley {{continued}} to work for Arundel on issues concerning his estates. When, on 25 January 1407, the earl granted a new charter to Oswestry, enhancing its liberties and giving it a commercial monopoly over a considerable area, the steward Burley's name headed the list of witnesses. These included Holbache and Richard Lacon, a hero of the fight against Glyndŵr and another ally of Arundel who had married profitably into the Corbet family. In the summer of that year Burley again acted as <b>feoffee</b> for an important collection of Arundel's estates, including Shrawardine and other estates in Shropshire and Wiltshire, in a transaction that gave a lifetime interest to the earl's wife, Beatrice, Countess of Arundel. On 3 September 1411 Burley was made Arundel's attorney, along with Richard Wakehurst, a Sussex man who handled similar business for the earl in the South of England. They were needed because Arundel was sent abroad to negotiate for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and a daughter of John the Fearless, the Duke of Burgundy: a mission that proved abortive. Burley's relationship with the earl was reinforcesr by the accession of two of his sons, William and John, to the Arundel affinity.|$|E
25|$|While Cokayne and {{the other}} knights {{were still in the}} Tower of London, the king {{initiated}} a quiet coup to remove his opponents from power. On 11 November he made Thomas of Lancaster head of his council in place of the Prince of Wales and, with the acquiescence of the Michaelmas parliament, went on to remove Thomas Beaufort as chancellor, replacing him with Arundel, his predecessor. This led to a reversal of foreign policy and in 1412 Cokayne went to France with a force led by Thomas of Lancaster, now Duke of Clarence, in pursuance of an accord made at Bourges with the Armagnac faction: an expedition that paid the knights 2 shillings per day. Before departure he made a will at Pooley, placing the manor of Middleton-by-Wirksworth in the hands of feoffees for the use of his daughter, Alice. He also appointed Sir John Dabrichecourt a <b>feoffee</b> for his interest in the manor of Baddesley Ensor, with the aim of raising a sum towards the marriage of his younger daughter Elyn. Any residue he hoped would be devoted to chantries for his family at Polesworth and Ashbourne. He probably served in central France and Aquitaine until the death of Henry IV, when Clarence returned to England, after the French factions made temporary peace among themselves and bought off the English.|$|E
25|$|One of the Talbot estates {{was held}} of the marcher lord Hugh Burnell, 2nd Lord Burnell, {{who had also}} granted land at Abbeton to Burley. Burnell was a marcher lord based in central Shropshire, where his family were the eponyms of Acton Burnell, with its {{fortified}} house, and where he was governor of Bridgnorth. Burnell's second wife, Joyce Botetourt, brought him considerable wealth, as she was the cousin (once removed) and heiress of Hugh la Zouche, a wealthy Leicestershire landowner who died in July 1399. Burley acted as a <b>feoffee</b> to speed {{the transfer of the}} manor of Mannersfee in Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, which was held of the Bishop of Ely. The escheator was mandated to take the fealty of Burley and the other feoffees by the new régime of Henry IV on 21 May 1400. However, there were considerable legal difficulties with some parts of the manor and the matter seems not to have been fully resolved until June 1403. Presumably John Burley's services were much valued, as his son, Edmund, was presented to a portion of Holdgate parish by Hugh Burnell in 1411. The three clerics of the church were described as canons, {{as if it were a}} collegiate church attached to Holdgate Castle. Edmund Burley must have been appointed to the deaconry, as its advowson was held by the Burnells. The favour shown by Burnell to the Burleys suggests that they may have been relatives.|$|E

[...] The <b>Feoffees</b> were also directed to elect one of their number annually as chief Lord of the Manor, in whose name the courts should be called and the business of the town transacted. The election is still continued {{on the second day of}} February, and a manor court is held in the Town Hall in February and November.|$|R
25|$|Burley {{was also}} ordered to {{investigate}} complex and important matters {{of property and}} inheritance, and these too could have a bearing on the king's interests or public order. On 18 November 1400 he was sent with Lee, Holbache and Sir John Wiltshire, {{a close friend of}} Arundel, to investigate a case where it was suspected a dead man's property was being concealed from the king, a form of tax evasion. The following month Burley and Darras were among those sent in pursuit of Sir Thomas and Richard Harcourt. On the death of Sir William Shareshull, a furious dispute had broken out over his estates in Shropshire and Straffordshire, which he had inherited from his wealthy grandfather, the eminent lawyer Justice William de Shareshull. To keep their grip on the estates, the Harcourts had forcibly prevented the escheator taking possession of them. In March 1404 Burley and John Kinghtley, another JP, were ordered to discover the whereabouts of Fulk, the son and heir of John Mawddwy and Elizabeth Corbet. The case was one in into which Burley must have had considerable insight, bordering on a conflict of interests. In 1390 nine Shropshire and Herefordshire landowners had been summoned to interview by the king and his council under pain of 200 marks each because of their violence in pursuit of a Corbet family property dispute. They included John Darras, Sir Sir Roger Corbet, the father of Burley's ward, Sir Richard Ludlow, Burleigh's former client, Sir Hugh Cheyne and Thomas Young, both MPs with him for Shropshire and the latter a close associate in Arundel's service. Whatever the outcome of this particular phase in the dispute, the Mawddwy estates ultimately passed to Hugh Burgh, Burley's associate as a <b>feoffee</b> for the Talbots, who married the missing heir's sister.|$|E
25|$|The FitzAlan earls of Arundel {{were the}} richest and most {{important}} landowners in Shropshire, and {{for more than a}} century they had also been great landowners in the South of England, where their power was concentrated in Sussex. Their profits were invested in further expansion. Although this was only to a lesser extent in Shropshire, they were the dominant force in the county's politics and parliamentary representation: between 1386 and 1397 eleven of the twenty MPs were clients or allies of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel. Arundel formalised his relationship with many of his followers with small grants of land, rather than the annuities characteristic of bastard feudalism. His inquisition post mortem showed that Burley received from him a moiety of Brotton, worth 30s. annually: this seems to be additional land at Brockton, where Burley was lord of the manor. One of Earl Richard's concerns in Shropshire was with the civic and commercial development of Oswestry, the original power base of his dynasty. He made John Burley his steward of the town by 1393. This is made clear in a record of Arundel's court at Oswestry, dated 7 May 1393 and sealed by Burley, in which Thomas Salter and his wife Matilda are granted succession to Thomas's ancestral estates for the rather large feudal relief of £10, already paid in three instalments. In 1395 Burley became a <b>feoffee</b> for the important Arundel marcher lordships of Chirk and Chirkland. The other feoffees included Thomas Arundel, the Archbishop of York and the earl's brother, as well as other Arundel lawyers like Thomas Young and David Holbache. As a servant of Arundel, Burley was now regularly appointed a justice of the peace: for example a commission of 18 June 1394 was followed by another on 1 May 1396.|$|E
500|$|Little Thetford School is a Church of England primary school. In 1870, {{there was}} a school in the village using {{run-down}} premises lent by Townsend's <b>Feoffee,</b> now the John Townsend charity.

50|$|Around {{the time}} of the Norman Conquest of England a group called the Bloxham <b>Feoffees</b> formed. The name, of Anglo-Norman origin, denotes someone {{invested}} with a fief, which was often heritable land or property but could be rights or revenue. Comprising between 8 and 16 local yeomen, the <b>Feoffees</b> were responsible for the well-being of the village community. In return for helping the poor and services such as repairing the bridges, they were bequeathed money and land by the Crown. Until the 20th century they continued their village maintenance despite being replaced by a parish council after the Local Government Act 1894. Today they give financial help to Bloxham residents. The <b>Feoffees</b> own land in Grove Road (which is now rented to the Warriner School), the former allotment field in South Newington Road and the Old Court House.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1626, {{the support}} {{group known as}} the <b>Feoffees</b> for Impropriations was set up, and Sibbes was a {{founding}} member. (It built on an informal grouping dating back to 1613).

500|$|Damages {{is money}} claimed in {{compensation}} for some failure {{by the other}} party to a case. It is commonly believed that the Court of Chancery could not grant damages until the Chancery Amendment Act 1858, which gave it that right, but in some special cases it {{had been able to}} provide damages for over 600years. The idea of damages was first conceived in English law during the 13th century, when the Statutes of Merton and Gloucester provided for damages in certain circumstances. Despite what is normally assumed by academics, it was not just the common law courts that could grant damages under these statutes; the Exchequer of Pleas and Court of Chancery both had the right to do so. In Cardinal Beaufort's case in 1453, for example, it is stated that [...] "I shall have a subpoena against my <b>feoffee</b> and recover damages for the value of the land". A statute passed during the reign of Richard II specifically gave the Chancery the right to award damages, stating: ...|$|E
500|$|The English aristocratic Spencer {{family has}} resided at their ancestral home at Althorp, Northamptonshire, {{since the early}} 16th century. The Estate now covers [...] in Northamptonshire, Warwickshire and Norfolk. From pre-Tudor times the Spencers had been farmers, coming to {{prominence}} in Warwickshire in the 15th century when John Spencer became <b>feoffee</b> of Wormleighton in 1469, and a tenant at Althorp in 1486. His nephew, another John, used the gains from trade in livestock and commodities to buy both properties. He was knighted in 1504 and died in 1522. John's descendants expanded the family holdings through business dealings and marriage into the peerage. The family is related through marriage to the Churchills of Blenheim Palace, a line that included the Dukes of Marlborough and Winston Churchill. From the Althorp line came the Earls of Sunderland, the later Dukes of Marlborough, and the Earls Spencer. The family captured international attention when Lady Diana Frances Spencer married Prince Charles on 29 July 1981, and her death {{in a car crash}} in Paris on 31 August 1997.|$|E
500|$|One of de la Pole's first {{commissions}} {{under the}} new regime was to accompany Edward [...] on his campaign against the Scots in winter 1462, although he had returned to Norwich by early the next year. Suffolk also attended the reinterment of the king's uncle and cousins, Richard, Earl of Salisbury and his son Thomas at Bisham Priory in 1463. Soon after, Suffolk's dukedom was confirmed to him by Edward IV in letters patent dated 23 March (possibly, it has been suggested, on account of contemporary uncertainty {{as to whether he}} ever had been downgraded in 1460). He actually took seisin of his estates six months before coming of age, and was absolved from having to prove his age as was the legal custom. He was a trier of petitions at the parliament later that year. In 1465, the king granted Suffolk an annuity of 100 marks (nearly £67) a year, although this was only during the life of his wife, the king's sister. It may only have been compensation for lands lost by Edward's need to endow his queen with a landed estate. Two years later, in a clear mark of royal favour, his eldest son John was created Earl of Lincoln. Suffolk himself regained his father's Wallingford and Chiltern Hundreds offices, with a £40 per annum salary for it. In 1467, he acted as <b>feoffee</b> for his sister-in-law (the King's sister), Anne, Duchess of Exeter.|$|E

Clearly this is a large transaction, coming just 2 or 3 months before Gray's further sale of Gray's Inn or Portpool Manor, Holborn, to Denys as well. It may, therefore, be a likely candidate as a capitalisation of royal [...] "slush-fund" [...] monies. It is useful to list the parties:Querents: Sir Giles Daubeney (Chamberlain of the Lord King), Hugh Denys,esquire, Edmund Dudley,esquire, Thomas Wolverston, Thomas Pygot & Geogffrey ToppysDeforciants: Edmund Lord Grey of Wilton and Florence his wife.

500|$|Bonville had, then, by April 1455, {{received}} much royal favour, {{including all the}} offices the earl had lost, {{as well as the}} constableship of Exeter Castle. He was – [...] as one historian has called him – [...] "the King's lieutenant in the west." [...] The Earl of Devon had already reacted against this hegemony during the Duke of York's first protectorate (1454–5) and joined the royal council. However, it appears that even the council itself did not trust him to keep the King's peace, as they placed him under a bond of £1,000 to do so. This he had disregarded, and commenced another campaign against Bonville. This time, the Earl of Devon was accompanied by his sons, and, bringing a force of men into Exeter in April 1455, he attempted to ambush Bonville. This resulted in further government-imposed undertakings of good behaviour between the two parties. As the government was now headed by Courtenay's old ally, the Duke of York, it is likely that it was now that the earl decided to reject his alliance with York and give his support to the crown. He fought (and was wounded) at St Albans on 22 May that year, {{on the side of the}} king. Bonville, meanwhile, through his wife, was related to the Harrington family of Hornby, Lancashire, who had close links to the Nevilles – [...] his father-in-law was Thomas Harrington, a <b>feoffee</b> and retainer to the Earl of Salisbury. Bonville's new-found Yorkist sympathies seem to have driven the Earl of Devon to even greater violence in the county.|$|E
500|$|The Lord Chancellor had, {{since the}} 15th century, been tasked with {{administering}} estates where the estate {{was to be}} used for charitable purposes. In Bailiff of Burford v Lenthall, Lord Hardwicke suggested that the jurisdiction of the Court over charity matters came from its jurisdiction over trusts, {{as well as from the}} Charitable Uses Act 1601. Carne suggests that, as the Court had long been able to deal with such situations, the 1601 act was actually just the declaration of pre-existing custom. This is illustrated by the Chancellor's original jurisdiction over feoffments to uses, which came from his original status as a clergyman, as charity had been originally enforced by the Church and the ecclesiastical courts. Essentially, an owner of land could dispose of it by granting the right to use it and collect fees to another, not just by selling it. This was not valid at the common law courts but was in the Court of Chancery; the Lord Chancellor is reported as having said, in 1492, [...] "where there is no remedy at common law there may be good remedy in conscience, as, for example, by a feoffment upon confidence, the feoffor has no remedy by common law, and yet by conscience he has; and so, if the <b>feoffee</b> transfers to another who knows of this confidence, the feoffor, by means of a subpoena, will have his rights in this Court". After the reign of Edward IV, if the charitable land were to be sold (or land were to be sold to create the charity) the Court of Chancery was the only place this could be done, as ecclesiastical and probate courts did not have a valid jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|Roman law had a {{well-developed}} {{concept of}} the trust (fideicommissum) in terms of [...] "testamentary trusts" [...] created by wills but never developed the {{concept of the}} inter vivos (living) trusts which apply while the creator lives.

5000|$|The {{necessary}} royal licence {{to alienate}} (i.e. convey ownership in) the manors, listed in Denys's will for the bequest to Sheen, was not obtained by Denys's <b>feoffees</b> until 1516, {{five years after}} his death, after much legal wrangling between the Court and <b>feoffees.</b> It seems {{that one of the}} manors was found, seemingly Gray's Inn, during the legal process to grant a licence for alienation, technically to have escheated to the Crown previous apparently to Deny's ownership, by reason of [...] "the death of Robert de Chiggewell without an heir". This effectively meant that Denys had never himself held good title, and his representatives were therefore legally incapable of dealing in the property concerned. The matter required regularisation, which was achieved. Denys had foreseen the delay experienced by his <b>feoffees</b> in receiving a licence to alienate, and had made in his will specific provisions for the disposition of the income generated pending the transfer to Sheen.|$|R
