5|$|Diagnosis of bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} in newborn infants with breathing difficulties is {{difficult in the}} <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> However, if the infant's breathing does not improve during this time, blood tests and x-rays {{may be used to}} confirm {{bronchopulmonary dysplasia}}. In addition, an echocardiogram can help to eliminate other possible causes such as congenital heart defects or pulmonary arterial hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Miz {{was drafted}} from SmackDown! to ECW on June 17, 2007, {{as part of}} the 2007 {{supplemental}} draft. He was absent from the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of ECW, though he was the subject of backstage mentions between matches and had several short Miz TV Crashes ECW video segments. He made his debut on the July 10 episode of ECW in a match against Nunzio, which he won.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} resolve {{with time and}} conservative methods of treatment. Usually for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> people are advised to rest, change their activities, take pain medications, and stretch. If this is not sufficient physiotherapy, orthotics, splinting, or steroid injections may be options. If other measures do not work extracorporeal shockwave therapy or surgery may be tried.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of this meeting, the room {{unanimously}} voted to continue meeting together over subsequent weeks and this led to the establishment of Rangers <b>First</b> a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> later. The name Rangers First was suggested at the second open meeting held at the Louden.|$|R
5000|$|So many {{deaths were}} {{reported}} that the municipal authorities discontinued the tolling of the bells. Undertakers were fearful of touching the ravaged bodies[...] [...] [...] At least 500 persons were stricken during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>week,</b> and deaths in the pueblo for a time ran as high as 15 and 20 a day[...] [...] [...] At the Bella Union Hotel, always {{the hub of the}} town's activity, a funereal gloom was everywhere, and innkeeper Doctor Winston, now overworked in his capacity as town physician, kept the hotel running. His only thought was to save the living and to rid the town of the dead as quickly as possible.|$|R
5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce spent the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> {{of his term}} sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, {{forced out of the}} group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E

50|$|It wasn’t {{until one}} of the band’s <b>first</b> {{performances}} a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> later that keyboardist Ben Hite joined the band rounding out the official lineup. Ben was already a well known musician and was actively being pursued by several other bands in the valley.|$|R
50|$|The first European {{to study}} the species was the English {{explorer}} and naturalist John Whitehead in 1896, who observed the bird and whose servant, Juan, collected the <b>first</b> specimen a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> later. The skin of the bird was sent to William Robert Ogilvie-Grant in London in 1896, who initially showed it off in a local restaurant and described the species a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> later.|$|R
5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of 2010, {{there was}} renewed anxiety about {{excessive}} national debt, with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and current account deficits. This in turn {{made it difficult}} for four out of eighteen Eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt, particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, {{as in the case of}} Greece and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the tour, {{as he struggled to}} adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed {{because it is}} symptom-free or {{exhibits}} only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|E
40|$|This {{approach}} yields {{an estimate}} of two days for the lifespan of productively infected cells during primary infection, a value {{that is consistent with}} results obtained by drug perturbation experiments. We find that all patient data sets considered are consistent with a target-cell limited model from the time of initial infection until shortly after the peak in viremia, but some data sets are not consistent after the peak value with the assumptions of such a model. We illustrate that two possible immune response mechanisms, cytotoxic T lymphocyte destruction of infected target cells and cytokine suppression of viral replication, could account for declines in viral load data not predicted by the original target-cell limited model. We conclude that some additional process, perhaps mediated by CD 8 + T cells, is important in at least some patients. 2 1.

50|$|The {{uprising}} started October 10. Though efforts nearly failed {{within the}} <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days, within <b>weeks</b> {{the numbers of}} volunteers reached 12,000.

50|$|Benyon {{signed for}} Aberdeen in 1932 from Doncaster and {{established}} himself as a winger in the <b>first</b> team. A <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> after playing in the 1937 Scottish Cup final, he was struck down with appendicitis while on a tour of South Africa with Aberdeen and died of peritonitis. He was buried in South Africa.|$|R
5|$|The {{black vulture}} also {{occasionally}} feeds on livestock or deer. It {{is the only}} species of New World vulture which preys on cattle. It occasionally harasses cows which are giving birth, but primarily preys on newborn calves. In its <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> a calf will allow vultures to approach it. The vultures swarm the calf in a group, then peck at the calf's eyes, or at the nose or the tongue. The calf then goes into shock and is killed by the vultures. Black vultures have sometimes been seen to pick ticks off resting capybaras.|$|E
5|$|With Al-Nasr, Owumi {{would travel}} to games on private jets, {{not have to}} pay for food, and have his own driver. Although he only saw Gaddafi at one game, he met Gaddafi's sons Al-Saadi and Mutassim and {{considered}} following their footsteps into the oil business. In his <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> in Benghazi, he witnessed several protests against Gaddafi but relatively little violence. In addition, he saw people, including his teammates, gathering ammunition and weapons to prepare for the revolution.|$|E
5|$|In October 1944, the Banat and Bačka were {{captured}} by Soviet troops. Subotica was captured on the 12 October. After a few weeks, they withdrew and ceded {{full control of}} the region to the Partisans, who established a military administration in the Banat, Bačka and Baranja on 17 October 1944. In the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> after Bačka returned to Yugoslav control, about 16,800 Hungarians were killed by Serbs in revenge for killings during the Hungarian occupation. In November 1944, Tito declared that the Volksdeutsche of Yugoslavia were hostile to the nation, and ordered the internment of those living in areas under Partisan control. About 60,000–70,000 Volksdeutsche had been evacuated from Bačka; while an additional 30,000–60,000 from Bačka were serving in the Wehrmacht at the time.|$|E
50|$|A {{judicial}} inquiry is made {{into the matter}} about the warden's corrupt behavior and Leone serves only the jail time required {{of him in the}} <b>first</b> place.

He wishes Captain Meissner farewell, exits Gateway and embraces the waiting Melissa.|$|R
50|$|On 17 September 1978, aged 18, Torres {{made his}} league debut for Twente, {{in a home}} game against Sparta Rotterdam, scoring his <b>first</b> goal a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> later at HFC Haarlem and ending his first season with three goals in 23 matches as the Enschede side {{finished}} in 11th position and reached {{the final of the}} Dutch Cup, lost to league champions AFC Ajax.|$|R
50|$|Residents of South Euclid {{eventually}} wanted autonomy {{from the}} larger Euclid Township, and voted on October 13, 1917, to be incorporated as a village, with Edward C.

At the same time, with {{the decline of the}} Bluestone industry brought on by improvements to poured concrete, Bluestone village was absorbed into South Euclid.|$|R
5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was more}} often {{substitute}} than starter in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of 2012–13 under new manager Robert Maaskant, but {{went on to}} re-establish himself in the side. A minor knee injury sustained during the mid-season training camp meant he missed a couple of matches, and thereafter his appearances in the starting eleven were intermittent, whether through suspension or just not being selected. Groningen finished in seventh place, albeit 19 points behind Twente whom they faced in the play-offs. Kieftenbeld put in a strong performance in the first leg in a 1–0 defeat at home, but a 3–2 loss in the second leg confirmed that Groningen would not qualify for the Europa League.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{marked his}} {{first-class}} debut on English soil with a fluent 138 against Worcestershire, which was scored in only {{four hours and}} made him the first Australian centurion on tour. Morris found batting difficult for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> as he adapted to the alien batting conditions, reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings {{with a total of}} 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease. He rectified this, and success followed with 184 against Sussex in the final match before the First Test. Five more centuries {{before the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Polyakov {{underwent}} medical assessments before, during, {{and after}} the flight. He also underwent two follow-up examinations six months after returning to Earth. When researchers compared {{the results of these}} medical exams, it was revealed that although there were no impairments of cognitive functions, Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of increased workload during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of spaceflight and return to Earth. However, Polyakov's mood stabilized to pre-flight levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission. It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning to Earth. In light of these findings, researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights, such as manned missions to Mars.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{headquarters}} was in Ed O'Brien's {{barber shop}} on Florida Grove Road and the equipment was one dozen buckets.

5|$|The America's Response Monument, a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue {{commemorating the}} actions of U.S. Special Operations Forces in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of the War in Afghanistan, was {{unveiled}} to the public during the Veteran's Day Parade in New York City on November 11, 2011. The statue was displayed on a float, which traveled along Fifth Avenue north from 23rd Street to 56th Street. It was dedicated that same day, in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lieutenant-General John Mulholland, commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command and formerly commander of Task Force Dagger during the initial days of the War in Afghanistan. It was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day). Though solitary by nature, {{four-horned antelope}}s may form loose {{groups of three}} to five –with one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of their birth. The young remain with the mother for about a year.|$|E
5|$|With {{this dispute}} settled {{collaboration}} could once again take place. Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists {{as possible so}} long as Groves accepted them. Chadwick's first choice, Joseph Rotblat {{refused to give up}} his Polish citizenship. Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch, who to Chadwick's surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the screening process so that he could travel to America. Chadwick spent the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of November 1943 acquiring a clear picture of the extensive Manhattan Project. He realised the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was the new headquarters of the project, and could safely conclude that without similar industrial site being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low.|$|E
