5|$|Morgan began serious {{training}} in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team {{as well as}} the 400-metre freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of false starts. During the final, she lifted <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of the water and saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia {{went on to win the}} relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was then}} {{overhauled}} and passed by Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of the water, {{and seeing the}} American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics {{was the only time}} that Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E

Before Cassandra leaves town, she tells Donna that Matt is not her biological father. Donna creates an online vlog {{in a bid to}} find her father and James Linden (Tim Ross) turns up claiming to be Donna's half brother.

60|$|The {{door was}} {{fastened}} {{when we got}} to it, but Dicky Weed banged away at it as 'ard as he could bang, and at last the bedroom winder went up and Mrs. Pretty stuck <b>her</b> <b>'ead</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{smiled and}} shook <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{stretching}} <b>out</b> <b>her</b> hand {{to recover the}} Gnostic charm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, then," [...] said she, {{bending to}} invite the fall, {{and when it was}} playfully {{advanced}} above <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> bounding <b>out</b> of reach like some little chamois.|$|R
5|$|The Australian {{team made}} a poor {{start in the}} final after Fraser almost stopped during the first leg, believing that a false start had {{occurred}} after mistakenly hearing a second gunshot. She finished her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, almost two seconds slower than her personal best, but enough for a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska. Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained {{the lead in the}} first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds; the Australian lead was thus cut to 0.9 s. Morgan dived in for the third leg and was then overhauled and passed by American Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of the water—a fundamental error—and seeing the American a body length in front, responded with a surge to regain a 0.7-second lead heading into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the margin to 2.2 seconds to secure an Australian victory in a world-record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The victory {{was the first time that}} Australia had swept the 100-metre freestyle relay and individual events for both men and women. The only other time that this has been achieved was by the Americans in 1920 in Antwerp. The win would be Australia's only triumph in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Games in Athens. The victory made Morgan Australia's youngest-ever gold medallist; this record still stands.|$|E
500|$|Zoe is {{a former}} student at Hollyoaks Community College, where she studied Film Studies. Channel 4 {{publicity}} describe Zoe as [...] "the bubbly student" [...] and make note of her many bad choices in life and failed relationships. Discussing these failed relationships, Lister commented during an interview in June 2009 that she believed her character was having a break from men in order to sort out her problems: [...] "I think she's {{been in and out}} of so many relationships and her life is at a bit of a juncture; she probably needs to sort <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>out,</b> sort her career, knuckle down really and not get bogged down into a relationship because everything takes a backseat when you're in one." ...|$|E
500|$|McCay {{originally}} used {{a version}} of the film as part of his vaudeville act. [...] The first performance was on February8, 1914, in Chicago at the Palace Theater. [...] McCay began the show making his customary live sketches, which he followed with How a Mosquito Operates. [...] He then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured the audience on the making of animation. [...] Standing {{to the right of the}} film screen, he introduced [...] "the only dinosaur in captivity". [...] As the film started Gertie poked <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of a cave, and McCay encouraged her to come forward. [...] He reinforced the illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at the screen, at which point he turned his back to the audience and pocketed the apple as it appeared in the film for Gertie to eat. [...] For the finale, McCay walked offstage from where he [...] "reappeared" [...] in the film; Gertie lifted up the animated McCay, placed him on her back, and walked away as McCay bowed to the audience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop a moment, Mr. Bolton," [...] said Miss Kilburn; {{and she put}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> quite <b>out</b> of the carriage, {{and stared}} at the figure on the monument.|$|R

60|$|She braved it for {{a moment}} or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness, and murmured a phrase or two vaguely of Gen. Pinkney; but at length down went <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and <b>out</b> came the truth and tears.|$|R
2500|$|When {{released}} into the net pen, Springer immediately began feeding on the salmon, spyhopped (raising <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of the water), pushed at the net, and called loudly to her relative orcas swimming nearby. [...] "She was vigorous and vocalizing and obviously interacting with the other whales. We were listening practically with our mouths hanging open (Saturday) night," [...] said Dr. Spong. Dr. Lance Barrett-Lennard, Senior Marine Mammal Scientist with the Vancouver Aquarium, {{said that it was}} clear Springer knew she was home, and that [...] "her calls were so loud they practically blew our earphones off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Seward's son, Frederick, {{appeared}} {{at the top of}} the steps in his nightclothes. As Powell reached the second floor, Frederick ordered Powell to stop. Seward's daughter, Fanny, stuck <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of her father's bedroom door and warned the men that Seward was sleeping. She then returned to the bedroom. Powell said he was delivering medicine, and Frederick asked for the bottle. Powell gave it to him, then pulled out his revolver and pulled the trigger with the barrel of the gun against Frederick's chest. The revolver misfired, and Powell pistol-whipped Frederick over and over. Bell fled the house screaming [...] "Murder! Murder!" [...] and raced to the office of General Christopher C. Augur next door for help. Terrified, Herold tied Powell's horse to a tree and fled on his own steed.|$|E
2500|$|Though Nell Gwyn {{was often}} caricatured as an empty-headed woman, John Dryden {{said that her}} {{greatest}} attribute was her native wit, and she certainly became a hostess {{who was able to}} keep the friendship of Dryden, the playwright Aphra Behn, William Ley, 4th Earl of Marlborough (another lover), John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, and the king's other mistresses. She is especially remembered for one particularly apt witticism, which was recounted in the memoirs of the Comte de Gramont, remembering the events of 1681:Nell Gwynn was one day passing through the streets of Oxford, in her coach, when the mob mistaking her for her rival, the Duchess of Portsmouth, commenced hooting and loading her with every opprobrious epithet. Putting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of the coach window, [...] "Good people", she said, smiling, [...] "you are mistaken; I am the Protestant whore." [...] The Catholic whore was still the Frenchwoman Louise de Kérouaille, who had been created Duchess of Portsmouth in 1673.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Morris washed {{everything}} washable in the house, and did up Fay's frocks so daintily {{that she}} looked more like an elf than ever when <b>her</b> <b>head</b> shone <b>out</b> from the fluted frills, like the yellow middle of a daisy with its white petals all spread.|$|R

6000|$|Cynthia put <b>her</b> <b>head</b> far <b>out</b> of {{the window}} and looked along the steep roof before them. [...] "There is a blind off one {{of the window}}s.

60|$|Apparently this consolatory {{perspective}} of a mother's prospects failed in producing its due effect. The patient shook <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and stretched <b>out</b> <b>her</b> hand towards the child.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Stobell, {{about to}} reply, caught the staring {{eye of the}} photograph, and, shaking <b>her</b> <b>head</b> sorrowfully, took <b>out</b> <b>her</b> {{handkerchief}} and wiped her eyes. Mrs. Chalk softened.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why don't that extravagant fellow {{get you a}} servant?" [...] {{he asked}} impatiently one mild afternoon. She had thrown {{something}} over <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to run <b>out</b> for a while.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{glass of}} cold water is what you want." [...] Sophia Antonovna glanced up the grounds at the house and shook <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> then <b>out</b> of the gate at the brimful placidity of the lake.
