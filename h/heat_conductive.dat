40|$|A two-fluid {{model of}} the solar wind was {{introduced}} by Sturrock and Hartle (1966) and Hartle and Sturrock (1968). In these studies the proton energy equation was integrated neglecting the <b>heat</b> <b>conductive</b> term. Later several authors solved the equations for the two-fluid solar wind model keeping the proton <b>heat</b> <b>conductive</b> term. Methods where the equations are integrated simultaneously outward and inward from the critical point were used. The equations were also integrated inward from a large heliocentric distance. These methods have been applied to cases with low coronal base electron densities and high base temperatures. In this paper we present a method of integrating the two-fluid solar wind equations using an iteration procedure where the equations are integrated separately and the proton flux is kept constant during the integrations. The technique is applicable {{for a wide range}} of coronal base densities and temperatures. The method is used to carry out a parameter study of the two-fluid solar wind...|$|E
