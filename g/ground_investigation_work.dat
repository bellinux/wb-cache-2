40|$|A {{study of}} the geology of nearshore area of the {{northwest}} Lantau Island {{has been carried out}} because of the marine <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>work</b> of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. The objective {{of the study was to}} recreate a solid geological section of the northwest nearshore area and to resolve some of the discrepancy in the rock name. Data has been obtained from marine ground investigation by method of rotary drilling of rock cores and sampling of soil. Some of the rock specimens have been selected for thin section analysis. The borehole data is presented in the form a data base with projection of GIS software. Petrographic study has been carried out in the selected samples. The data has been interpreted in relation to the onshore geology of the Lantau Island. Which have been detailed in maps and geological memoir published by Geotechnical Engineering Office. (GEO) It is concluded that the area mainly composed of altered granite unit of the Lantau Granite and Chek Lap Kok Granite with minor mafic dyke intrusions. The area is structurally controlled by fault that can be traced onshore. published_or_final_versionApplied GeosciencesMasterMaster of Scienc...|$|E
30|$|In {{the past}} decade, China has faced {{a number of}} {{extraordinarily}} serious natural hazard-induced disasters, including the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, the 2010 Yushu Earthquake, the 2010 Zhouqu Debris Flow, the 2013 Lushan Earthquake, and the 2014 Ludian Earthquake. The National Commission for Disaster Reduction and the Ministry of Civil Affairs have thus set up a systematic program of comprehensive damage assessment for major natural hazard-induced disasters and have gradually developed and optimized a comprehensive approach to damage assessment that involves disaster extent assessment, quantitative assessment of physical damage, direct economic loss assessment, {{the construction of an}} index system, and the application of modeling algorithms. Disaster extent assessment refers to the delineation of the extent of a major natural hazard-induced disaster and the determination of the damage state. Quantitative assessment of physical damage refers to the determination of the physical damage to the exposed elements within the disaster extent, together with an assessment of the damage state, to obtain quantitative damage assessment results that reflect the aggregate quantities of damages for an exposure unit. Direct economic loss assessment refers {{to the use of the}} quantitative assessment results of physical damage as the basis for calculating the value of economic losses, that is the replacement cost. Among these aspects, the quantitative assessment of physical damage plays a linking role. It directly determines the precision of the overall damage assessment and the quantifiable levels, making it both a focus and a possible hurdle to be overcome in the comprehensive assessment of a disaster. Disaster damage assessment includes exposed urban and rural buildings; infrastructure; the agricultural, industrial, and public service sectors; natural resources; household property; and other assets. The measurement generally can be the number of units, length, area, and damage state, depending on the type of exposed elements and administrative units. In recent practical applications of disaster loss assessment, the Ministry of Civil Affairs of China has attempted to quantify disaster damage using remote sensing data (Experts Group for Earthquake Disaster Relief, National Disaster Reduction Committee and Ministry of Science and Technology 2008; Fan 2014), which has dramatically reduced the dependence on <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>work</b> and has allowed a more objective and comprehensive quantitative assessment of losses.|$|E

It then upgrades the drilling works to become an in-situ <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> technique of choice. Since formation of a drill hole is a necessary task in ground anchoring or soil nailing, the automatic monitoring of the drilling process with DPM can result {{a clearer understanding of}} the ground strength conditions and can optimize the design and construction of ground anchors and soil nails.

40|$|Implementation of mega {{geotechnical}} engineering projects {{requires a}} systematic approach and detailed planning. A mega land reclamation and ground improvement project {{which consists of}} various components of geotechnical engineering applications was planned and implemented in the Republic of Singapore from 1990 till 2005, a total period of {{one and a half}} decades. Due to the extensive ground improvement required to treat the underlying highly compressible soil, with the presence of highly variable ground profile and ground conditions due to the natural geological process, a detailed <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> was necessary. This was furthermore necessary due to the importance of various critical infrastructure planned for future usage in the land reclamation site. Extensive <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> was planned based on input from desk study and reconnaissance survey carried out using geophysical method under foreshore conditions. Progressive <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> included <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> carried out in foreshore area prior to land reclamation, on land prior to ground improvement, during and after ground improvement to assess the degree of improvement. The <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> involved large numbers of in-situ tests using numerous methods and collections and testing of undisturbed soil sample for further laboratory testing to drive necessary geotechnical parameters for design purpose or decision making for acceptance of ground improvement works. Due to the nature and speed of the project on-site geotechnical and geotextile laboratories were set up for characterization and quality control. In addition to the improvement of underlying soils, hydraulically filled granular soils were required to be densified by application of deep compaction methods to minimize future immediate settlement and to increase resistance to liquefaction. A large quantity of geotechnical instrumentation were installed and monitored for construction control as well as performance monitoring of ground improvement works.

40|$|A site {{investigation}} covers three stages, a preliminary {{appreciation of the}} site, a <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> i which borings and laboratory testing are undertaken, and a final stage in which the conclusions ofthe <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> are checked against the actual ground conditions as revealed by the constructional excavations. This paper considers the planning and implementation f the <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> under conditions normally prevailing in the British Isles. Various procedures are described for boring in soils and rocks, for trial excavations, for probing, and for geophysical surveying. Sampling procedures are considered {{on the basis of}} the quality of the sample thus obtained. Sample quality ranges between almost fully-undisturbed soil samples as taken by a thin-wall piston sampler, and fully disturbed samples taken from the driU tools. The choice of procedure for boring and sampling isdetermined by the technical require-ments of the investigation, by the practical problems arising from site conditions and by economy. It is considered that investigations should start using standard equipment and that the moIe sophisticated and expensive procedures should be employed only when the nature of the geotechnical problem has been determined.

40|$|Past {{applications}} of electrical resistivity surveying have particularly focused on areas of subsurface <b>ground</b> <b>investigations</b> to locate boulder, bedrock, water table, etc. Traditionally, electrical resistivity surveys were directed by an expert geophysicist for data acquisition, processing and interpretation. The final outcome from the electrical resistivity technique was an anomaly image that helped describe and demarcate zones of challenging ground conditions. The anomalies highlighted uncertain geotechnical conditions that were often irregular and dependent on individual site condition, yielding a site-dependent electrical resistivity value (ERV) for the ground. This study therefore identifies co-relationships between ERV and some basic geotechnical properties (BGP) such as soil moisture content, grain size of geomaterial, density, porosity, void ratio, and Atterberg limit. Different soil {{samples were collected}} and tested under both field and laboratory conditions. Basic geotechnical properties of the samples were obtained immediately after the electrical resistivity measurements were made. It was shown that the electrical resistivity value was greatly influenced by the geotechnical properties, and thus the resistivity surveying technique is applicable to support and enhance the conventional stand-alone anomaly outcome that is traditionally used in <b>ground</b> <b>investigation</b> interpretation...|$|R
