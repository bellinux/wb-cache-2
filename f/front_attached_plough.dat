2500|$|The FARC–EP is {{organized}} into seven main operational regions and the [...] "block" [...] {{is the name}} given to each FARC military command {{inside one of the}} main operational regions.

In addition to that, there are around 5 specially trained independent or elite <b>fronts</b> <b>attached</b> to some blocks, according to operational requirements.|$|R
30|$|In this question, {{we tried}} to study the process of rural user innovation. We find that the users {{were well aware of}} their local need and the {{constraints}} of their environment. This drives them to develop an idea of a product. For example, Patel got an idea to build a machine for stripping cotton, Prajapati got an idea to build a clay-based refrigerator, Jagni got an idea to <b>attach</b> <b>ploughing</b> implements to a motorcycle, Dahiya thought of using the gas produced in his kiln, and Kamboj got an idea to build a machine on the lines of a food processor. The next step in the innovation process was to seek financial help to build the product, as all of them were poor. They primarily relied on informal means of obtaining finance either from family members or friends. All of them had little or no educational backgrounds and were not conversant with the process of obtaining financial support from financial institutions. Additionally, they had no collateral to submit to banks. After acquiring financial support from informal sources, they built an initial working prototype.|$|R

50|$|Taser International {{announced}} in 2007 a new 12 gauge eXtended Range Electronic Projectile or XREP, which contains a small electroshock weapon unit in a carrier {{that can be}} fired from a standard 12 gauge shotgun.

Barbs on the <b>front</b> <b>attach</b> the electroshock unit to the target, with a tassel deploying from the rear to widen the circuit. A twenty-second burst of electrical energy is delivered to the target. This product {{is expected to be}} released to market in 2008. They were used—despite still being subject to testing, in breach of the supplier's license—by Northumbria police in their standoff with Raoul Moat in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|The railway {{mounting}} {{was of the}} [...] "cradle {{and rolling}} recoil" [...] type : the gun was mounted high up in a standard cradle with hydropneumatic buffers which allowed the gun to recoil 34 inches on firing at maximum elevation without striking the ground, and the remaining recoil force was expended by allowing the entire railway car to roll backwards 20-30 feet until stopped by its brakes. The gun car had a winch at the <b>front</b> <b>attached</b> by cable to a strongpoint further ahead, and the winch dragged the gun car back to its firing position. The advantage of this system was that no special track preparation was required and the gun could fire from any position along its curved section of track.|$|R

25|$|On 1 September 1944, Manteuffel was {{promoted}} to General of Panzer Troops and given command of the 5th Panzer Army on the Western Front, which {{took part in the}} Ardennes Offensive. Manteuffel’s 5th Panzer Army achieved one of the deepest penetrations of Allied lines during the offensive, almost reaching the Meuse River, and engaging the U.S. forces at the Battle of Bastogne.

5|$|At the time, {{the system}} was not {{believed}} to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that {{the system was}} indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold <b>fronts</b> <b>attached</b> to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.|$|R
50|$|On February 15 the 250th Infantry Division {{reported}} {{casualties of}} 3,645 {{killed or wounded}} and 300 missing or taken prisoner, which amounted to a 70-75% casualty rate of the troops engaged in the battle. It claimed 11,000 Soviet troops of the 55th Army {{had been killed in}} the five days beginning February 9. Because of these heavy losses and Allied pressure on the Spanish government, the Blue Division was withdrawn to Germany and later disbanded. A new volunteer formation called the Blue Legion (Legión Azul) remained in combat on the Eastern <b>Front,</b> <b>attached</b> to the 121st Infantry Division until March 1944. It was then also disbanded and the majority of the volunteers sent back to Spain. The 55th Army eventually took part in breaking the siege of Leningrad, securing the Leningrad-Moscow line in 1944. It subsequently advanced into Estonia and fought against the Courland pocket until 1945.|$|R

50|$|The {{outbreak}} began fairly {{early in}} the morning, with an initial round of storms and tornadoes associated with the incoming warm <b>front</b> <b>attached</b> to a rapidly deepening low pressure area over the central Great Lakes. One of these early day storms produced a damaging EF3 tornado that impacted Harvest, Alabama. The initial round of storms allowed for a strong warm air mass to enter the region, with temperatures rising to near-record levels for early March and instability combining with extreme wind shear, resulting in a highly volatile air mass. As a result, a second, much larger broken line of discrete supercells developed and followed the Ohio River, with additional storms developing farther south. During the afternoon, those cells tracked eastward across the Ohio Valley, passing north of Louisville, Kentucky and south of Cincinnati, Ohio with devastating results. One long-track EF4 tornado ripped through the Indiana towns of New Pekin, Henryville, Marysville, and Chelsea, killing 11 people.|$|R
