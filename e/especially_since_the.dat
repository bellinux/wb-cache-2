5|$|<b>Especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, {{religions}} {{from the}} former British colonies have grown in numbers, due to immigration. Islam {{is the most common}} of these, now accounting for around 5% of the population in England. Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism are next in number, adding up to 2.8% combined, introduced from India and South East Asia.|$|E
5|$|Illegal logging of {{precious}} hardwoods, such as rosewood and ebony, {{has become one}} of the greatest threats to the silky sifaka's habitat, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 2009 Malagasy political crisis. Its two largest protected areas, Masoala National Park and Marojejy National Park, have been the hardest hit. The disturbance caused by selective logging increases the likelihood of forest fires, helps invasive species take root, impairs habitat, and causes the loss of genetic diversity.|$|E

5|$|Some modern {{scholars}} have accepted these numbers, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point. Other authors reject this number, with 1,207 {{being seen as}} more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|The first Armenian {{arrived in}} California in 1874 {{and settled in}} Fresno. Fresno and the Central Valley in general were the center of California Armenian community, but in the later decades, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, when {{significant}} number of Middle Eastern Armenians arrived in the US, Southern California attracted more and more Armenians.|$|E
5|$|Fears of an Ottoman attack {{rose again}} {{after the fall of}} Candia in 1669, and the {{following}} year Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner invited the military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga to improve the fortifications. At the time the Floriana Lines were still under construction, and a number of weak points had been identified in their original design, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> demi-bastions forming the two extremities of the land front were too acute and could not be well defended. Valperga attempted to correct these flaws by making a number of alterations to San Salvatore Bastion on the western end of the lines, and constructing a faussebraye around the entire land front and a crowned hornwork near the eastern end. In the 1680s some minor modifications were made by the Flemish engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh.|$|E

5|$|The toothcomb in lemurs {{normally}} {{consists of}} six teeth (four incisors and two canines), although indriids, monkey lemurs, and some sloth lemurs {{only have a}} four-tooth toothcomb due {{to the loss of}} either a canine or an incisor. Because the lower canine is either included in the toothcomb or lost, the lower dentition can be difficult to read, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> first premolar (P2) is often shaped like a canine (caniniform) to fill the canine's role. In folivorous (leaf-eating) lemurs, except for indriids, the upper incisors are greatly reduced or absent. Used together with the toothcomb on the mandible (lower jaw), this complex is reminiscent of an ungulate browsing pad.|$|E
5|$|Athens had {{recently}} become a democracy, overthrowing its own tyrant Hippias. In their fight {{to establish the}} democracy, the Athenians had asked the Persians for aid (which {{was not in the}} end needed), in return for submitting to Persian overlordship. Some years later, Hippias had attempted to regain power in Athens, assisted by the Spartans. This attempt failed and Hippias fled to Artaphernes, and tried to persuade him to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians had baulked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Since they were already an enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities in their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of the Athenian democracy no doubt helped persuade the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{literature}} is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which {{are rooted in}} the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. There are four major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature; nature, frontier life, Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality. By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best. Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity are reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent modern writers focusing on ethnic life. Arguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (<b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> deaths of Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic. Numerous other Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards; including Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English; and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who is perhaps best known for the novel The English Patient, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E

50|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, more hobbyists {{have focused}} on using kiln-fused glass to make beads and {{components}} for jewellery. This has become <b>especially</b> popular <b>since</b> <b>the</b> introduction of glass manufactured for the specific purpose of fusing in a kiln.|$|R
50|$|The British Indian Ocean Territory, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Chagos Archipelago has had many threats of occupation by various groups, <b>especially</b> <b>the</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Depopulation of Chagossians from the Chagos Archipelago, {{as well as being}} a a joint UK-US facility that is used in countering terrorism. The UK maintains there is a low risk of terroism in this territory.|$|R
5|$|Cleomenes was {{not pleased}} with events, and marched on Athens with the Spartan army. Cleomenes's {{attempts}} to restore Isagoras to Athens ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian empire. Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him an 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, to which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced. They were, however, severely censured for this {{when they returned to}} Athens. At some later point Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias to the rule of Athens. This failed and Hippias again fled to Sardis and tried to persuade the Persians to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. The Athenians indignantly declined, and instead resolved to open war with Persia. Having thus become the enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities when they began their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example the Athenians had set no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> cities of Ionia were originally Athenian colonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} heritage of Slavonia represents {{a blend of}} social influences through its history, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> end of the 17th century, and the traditional culture. A particular impact was made by Baroque art and architecture of the 18th century, when the cities of Slavonia started developing after the Ottoman wars ended and stability was restored to the area. The period saw great prominence of the nobility, who were awarded estates in Slavonia by the imperial court {{in return for their}} service during the wars. They included Prince Eugene of Savoy, the House of Esterházy, the House of Odescalchi, Philipp Karl von Eltz-Kempenich, the House of Prandau-Normann, the House of Pejačević and the House of Janković. That in turn encouraged an influx of contemporary European culture to the region. Subsequent development of the cities and society saw the influence of Neoclassicism, Historicism and especially of Art Nouveau.|$|E

With its close proximity to downtown Phoenix, the housing market in South Phoenix continues to thrive.|$|R
50|$|The {{disappearance}} did {{not create}} much excitement at <b>the</b> time, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> country was infested with bandits, stragglers from the French army, and German revolutionaries. Additionally, murders and robberies were so common {{that the loss of}} one commercial traveller (which Bathurst was travelling as) was barely noticed, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> at <b>the</b> time there were hardly any legal authorities in Prussia.|$|R

50|$|The CPI has {{powerful}} political ramifications, and administrations {{of both parties}} have been tempted to change the basis for its calculation. <b>Especially</b> <b>since</b> 1980, <b>the</b> definition of CPI has been altered repeatedly, though economists disagree whether the index underestimates or overestimates the true rate of decline in purchasing power.|$|R
30|$|Preserving MCDC {{coverage}} on a transformed program is <b>especially</b> challenging, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> code transformation may produce arbitrary groupings of conditions into decisions.

25|$|NASA further {{leveraged}} {{their position}} {{by threatening to}} publicly reveal the heavy involvement of Mr. Kubrick's younger brother, Raul, with the American Communist Party.

25|$|The Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) {{nominated}} co-leader Selahattin Demirtaş {{as their}} presidential candidate on 30 June 2014.

25|$|Missionaries {{have been}} active among Akha, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> mid-20th century.

2500|$|One of {{the primary}} {{missions}} of the New Jersey Transit Police Department is the prevention of terrorism on all of New Jersey Transit's [...] trains and buses. This is <b>especially</b> relevant <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 2004 terrorist attacks of the transit system in Madrid, Spain.|$|R
50|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of the internet in the mid-90s, Internet activism has also become an invaluable component of presidential campaigns, <b>especially</b> <b>since</b> 2000. <b>The</b> internet was first used in the 1996 presidential elections, but primarily as a brochure for the candidate online.
