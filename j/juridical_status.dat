40|$|This volume, {{which appears}} in the series “Le Zebre” on the tenth anniversary of the {{foundation}} of the Center for Studies on the Languages of Identities at the University of Bergamo (October 1998), collects essays that were first presented at the XIX Biennial International Conference of the Italian Association of North-American Studies (AISNA), held in Macerata on October 4 - 6, 2007. The conference was entitled USA: Identities, Cultures, and Politics in National, Transnational, and Global Perspectives, and most of the contributions come from the workshop organized by Vincenzo Bavaro and Raffaella Malandrino on Queer Migrations: Identities across the Borders - all in the plural, of course, and in the planetary perspectives that are today’s mark. The hermeneutical category of “queer” is adopted by all contributors as the one that best enables us to discern the intricate weaving of sexual and national identities in the most disparate literary and cultural products linking the United States, Europe, and Asia. From their specific focuses and in their convergent approach, these essays prove how queer definitely cuts across the borders of its original gay and lesbian territory, and how vastly and subtly it can travel in time and space, in conspicuous ways as well as under the skin of cultural bodies. One could indeed argue that, while in most nations across the planet the material, political, and <b>juridical</b> <b>statuses</b> of queer people are still badly impaired, in most of this same planet queer seems to have infiltrated and destabilized significant mainstream and transnational domains...|$|R

The {{politics}} of Francisco de Toledo, viceroy of Peru (1571 - 1628) This article analyses the different operations mounted by the Crown 's administrators to disponess the Incas of their lordship and shows {{how it was}} the method used for registering the population and not a political struggle to retain the mayorazgo that triggered litigation between the Incas and the Crown. By retracing the successive steps {{that led to a}} new way of registering its Indian subjects, the author shows, in a tripartite approach, how the change in <b>juridical</b> and fiscal <b>status</b> that resulted from this method of registration enabled the transfer of a part of these subjects to the Crown: 1. the production of the Parecer de Yucay that characterized the Incas as tyrants in order to disqualify their descendant; 2. the naturalization of the Indians as a necessary step for changing their status and annulling their ethnic affiliation; 3. the objective of this move was to grant them new statutes that would negate any possible subjection to the Incas, and in response the Incas mounted a legal case against the Crown; they finally relinquished their ancient rights of lordship and became members of the Spanish nobility instead.

40|$|Juridical acts {{certainly}} {{play a very}} fundamental role in {{the organizational}} and functional aspects of the Church. They affect the <b>juridical</b> condition and <b>status</b> of persons, whether physical or juridical. Aware of their importance, the Church has attempted to provide some guidelines or general principles concerning them. The focus of this dissertation is a comprehensive and systematic analysis {{of the nature and}} application of juridical acts according to canon 124 of the Code of Canon Law. This canon has determined that for a juridical act to be valid, it must be placed by a person who is capable, and also it must contain those elements which essentially constitute the act itself, as well as the formalities and requisites imposed by the law for the validity of the act. It has further established that a juridical act properly placed, as far as its external elements are concerned, is presumed to be valid. In chapter one, an analysis of the concepts and principles on juridical acts as provided by the 1917 Code is presented. This analysis concentrates on four areas: (1) the notion of a juridical act, (2) its essential elements, (3) impediments to, and (4) efficacy of juridical acts. The Second Vatican Council and the revision of the Code of Canon Law introduced certain theologico-juridical principles which were to have significant impact on the entire juridical system of the Church, including the very notion and applicability of juridical acts. This is the focus of chapter two. As a consequence of their importance in the Church's life, the principles and norms governing juridical acts enjoy special consideration in the 1983 Code. They are presented in a systematic manner in the context of General Norms which have universal application. A comprehensive analysis of the elements mentioned in canon 124 is contained in chapter three. This analysis of the canon identifies some important conclusions on the nature of a juridical act and its applicability. There are certain factors which may impede a person from validly placing a juridical act. The Code has identified these in canons 125 [...] 126. They are: force, fear, deceit, error, and ignorance. In chapter four, these factors are subjected to a brief examination in order to demonstrate how they may affect juridical acts. The method employed in this study is historical and analytical. The historical perspective traces the origin and development of canon 124, while the analytical method is directed more toward a systematic analysis of canon 124 {{within the context of the}} general norms and its applicability to all canons of the 1983 Code of Canon Law...|$|R
