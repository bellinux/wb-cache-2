6000|$|... "Not a bit. But, on {{the other}} hand, they don't back up what <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> must be done. I've written to the Times, you know, {{explaining}} the whole thing--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary, <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that you}} will be compromising if you try to keep both your {{conscience}} and your love. You will be seeking to have, it both ways." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{that the}} {{railroad}} lawyer {{was a man}} of twice my age, experience, and reputation.|$|R
6000|$|SIR,--It {{is often}} said that one example is worth many sermons. Shall I be judged presumptuous if <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> one, which seems to me so {{striking}} just now, that, however painful, I cannot help dwelling upon it? ...|$|E
6000|$|In my reply, <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that, on the 10th of January, Mr. Stead {{addressed}} to me a letter, which commences thus: [...] "I {{see in the}} 'Times' of this morning that {{you are about to}} republish your letters on Booth's book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind. We shall {{give you}} two others {{in the place of}} them. But you must put {{yourself}} under my orders. You are welcome to all the official credit, but you must act on the line that <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out.</b> Is that agreed?" ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{talks about}} a problem what is an element {{promoting}} development of an industrial cluster. Firstly, this paper explained difference of traditional industrial accumulation theory and an industrial cluster theory. And, as the element which was necessary for development of clusters, <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> existence of coordinators and importance of new emerging firms. As the organization which took those roles, <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> importance of an incubator last...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. [Amused.] He came {{to make me}} {{an offer}} of marriage. <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to him that I was married already.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better luck than {{standing}} still, anyhow," [...] <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> resignedly, {{and left}} him to whatever thoughts or fancies haunted his awful immobility.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{assumptions}} are deliciously sweeping, but may <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that a decent and--the dear old Abbot of Wilton {{would have put}} it in his resonant monkish Latin much better than I can--a scholarly reserve, does not necessarily connote blank vacuity of mind on all subjects." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, exactly--of {{course you}} don't. But <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that fact {{to show the}} value. You would be making a present of that sum of money {{to people who do}} not want it--who have no claim upon you. I really don't see how they could take it." ...|$|E
60|$|Travellers who may {{not have}} been {{accustomed}} to pay attention to things so inobtrusive, will excuse me if <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the proportion between the span and elevation of the arch, the lightness of the parapet, and the graceful manner in which its curve follows faithfully that of the arch.|$|E
50|$|I was {{not aware}} of that arrangement. President Marcos never {{informed}} me. So, after twelve months of my term as Senate President, Puyat insisted that he take over. Naturally, <b>I</b> resisted and <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that my term had not yet expired. He kept citing an agreement, but <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> there was no such agreement.|$|R
60|$|The {{last part}} of my speech was lost upon Corporal Rufus Smith; for the instant that <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the gate he set off hopping down the road.|$|R
60|$|Now Jan {{went to the}} glade that <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to {{find the}} schimmel, while I led Ralph to Sihamba. She heard him coming and opened her eyes.|$|R
60|$|In {{the second}} chapter <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that this {{division}} in the conscience cannot be met by mere mental confusions, which would make any woman refusing any man a Eugenist. There will always be something in the world which tends to keep outrageous unions exceptional; that influence is not Eugenics, but laughter.|$|E

6000|$|... '"What {{are these}} points, my good friend?" [...] said I; and <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{to him the}} twenty-four heads of my sermon, asking him in which of these his doubts lay.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shoulder arms! Good, gentlemen, {{very good}} for a beginning. Yet still, if I may be critical, not perfect. There is more in this thing than you might imagine, gentlemen. May <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> to Private Henry Thompson that a musket carried across the {{shoulder}} at right angles is apt to inconvenience the gentleman behind. Even {{from the point of}} view of his own comfort, I feel sure that Private Thompson would do better to follow the usual custom in this matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] he said softly, [...] "forgive me if <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> to {{you that}} with your {{appearance}} and gifts a marriage with our excellent friend is surely not the summit of your ambitions! Here in Paris, I promise you, here--we can do much better than that for you. You have not, perhaps, a dot? Good! That is our affair. Give up our friend here, and we deposit in any bank you like to name the sum of {{two hundred and fifty}} thousand francs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my {{appearance}} once more before you, comrades, brothers, {{has no such}} petty object!" [...] he cried. [...] "I am here to demand my rights {{as a member of}} the Order of the White Hyacinth. I am here to remind you of our great principle--vengeance upon traitors! I am here to remind you of your unchanging oaths, and to claim your fulfillment of them, even as Francesco Dellia pleaded, and not in vain, before the council at Rome thirty years ago. We are a society of peace, save alone where traitors are concerned. <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> to you a traitor, and I cry--punishment!" ...|$|E
6000|$|A queer light {{crept into}} Wisbech's eyes. [...] "That {{is just the}} kind of thing one would expect Derrick Nasmyth to do. You see, as <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> he is my nephew." ...|$|R
60|$|Finally, after {{studying}} the map carefully in the moonlight which now flooded the room, <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> a waterway far {{to the north of}} us which also seemed to lead to Helium.|$|R

6000|$|... "Pebbles!" [...] he concluded, viciously {{dropping}} another bread pellet {{upon the}} heap. [...] "The roads of England are mended with pebbles! 'With the first heavy rainfall,' I've told 'em, 'your road {{will be a}} swamp.' Again and again my words have proved true. But d'you suppose they listen to me when I tell 'em so, when <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the consequences, the consequences to the public purse, when I recommend 'em to read Coryphaeus? No, Mrs. Ambrose, you will form no just opinion of the stupidity of mankind until you have sat upon a Borough Council!" [...] The little man fixed her with a glance of ferocious energy.|$|E
6000|$|He adds: 'I beg to {{call your}} Honours' {{attention}} to the wanton destruction of property by the Boer forces in Natal. They not only have helped themselves freely to the cattle and other property of farmers without payment, but they have utterly wrecked the contents of many farmhouses. As an instance I would specify Mr. Theodore Wood's farm [...] "Longwood" [...] near Springfield. <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> how very different is {{the conduct of the}} British troops. It is reported to me from Modder River that farms within the actual area of the British Camp have never even been entered, the occupants are unmolested, and their houses, gardens, and crops remain absolutely untouched.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not reproach me that <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> a safer mode of {{operation}} than your own. You would go to Gilbert and by a hot word, a rash act, put your life and my happiness into his hands, for though dueling is forbidden here, he would not hesitate to break all laws, human or divine, if by so doing he could separate us. What would you gain by it? If you kill him he is beyond our reach forever, and a crime remains to be atoned for. If he kill you your blood will be upon my head, and where should I find consolation {{for the loss of}} the one heart always true and tender?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing at all. <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{that the}} prince is {{interested}} in theatrical affairs, {{and that he is}} the chief member of the syndicate that runs the theaters. She seemed to understand." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{beginning}} of my conception of psychosynthesis was contained in my doctoral thesis on Psychoanalysis (1910), in which <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> what <b>I</b> considered to {{be some of the}} limitations of Freud's views.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear, dear Mortimer,' {{returned}} his friend, lazily lifting {{his head a}} little to look at him, 'how often have <b>I</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to you that its moral influence is the important thing?' ...|$|R
