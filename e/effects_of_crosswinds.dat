40|$|In {{order to}} develop {{recommendations}} for procedures for helicopter source noise characterization, the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>crosswinds</b> on main rotor harmonic noise radiation are assessed using {{a model of the}} Bell 430 helicopter. Crosswinds are found to {{have a significant effect on}} Blade-Vortex Interaction (BVI) noise radiation when the helicopter is trimmed with the fuselage oriented along the inertial flight path. However, the magnitude of BVI noise remains unchanged when the pilot orients the fuselage along the aerodynamic velocity vector, “crabbing ” for zero aerodynamic sideslip. The effects of wind gradients on BVI noise are also investigated and found to be smaller in the crosswind direction than in the headwind direction. The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>crosswinds</b> on lower harmonic noise sources at higher flight speeds are also assessed. In all cases, the directivity of radiated noise is somewhat changed by the crosswind. The model predictions agree well with flight test data for the Bell 430 helicopter captured under various wind conditions. The results of this investigation would suggest that flight paths for future acoustic flight testing are best aligned across the prevailing wind direction to minimize the effects of winds on noise measurements when wind cannot otherwise be avoided.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} extensive and unique full-scale measurements of the slipstreams of trains of various types that were carried out {{as part of the}} EU-sponsored AeroTRAIN project, together with the analysis of the experimental data. These experiments were carried out with the fundamental aim of seeking to reduce the complexity of the current technical specifications for interoperability (TSI) testing methodology. Experimental sites in Spain and Germany were used, for a range of different train types - high-speed single-unit trains, high-speed double-unit trains, conventional passenger units and locomotive/coach combinations. The data that was obtained was supplemented by other data from previous projects. The analysis primarily involved a study of the ensemble averages of the slipstream velocities, measured both at trackside and above platforms. The differences between the flows around different train types were elucidated, and the effect of platforms on slipstream behaviour described. A brief analysis of the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>crosswinds</b> on slipstream behaviour was also carried out. Through a detailed analysis of slipstream velocity components, the detailed nature of the flow around the nose and in the near wake of the train was investigated, again revealing differences in flow pattern between different trains. Significant similarity in the far wake flows was revealed. These fundamental results form the basis for the detailed discussion of the proposed TSI methodology that will be presented in Part 2 of this paper. Overall the results enable the nature of the flow field around trains to be understood in far greater detail than before, and also allow the developments of a revised TSI methodology which is more efficient than current practice. © IMechE 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub. co. uk/journalsPermissions. nav...|$|E

The experiments were carried out using a 1 / 25 th scale model of a four-coach train on a moving model rig (MMR). Flow velocities were measured using a rake of single hot films positioned close to the model side or roof.

A small number of particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) experiments were also carried out, and a wavelet analysis revealed details of the unsteady flow structure around the vehicle. It was shown that the flowfield around the vehicle could be divided into a number of different regions of distinct flow characteristics: an upstream region, a nose region, a boundary layer region, a near wake region and a far wake region. If the results were suitably normalized, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> model speed was small.

The intersection of asymptote method, along with scale analysis, is used to find a closed-form solution for the airflow rate at the tower exit for given crosswind speeds. The total heat rejected under a windy condition is then calculated based on the air mass flow rate at the tower exit. This theoretical model allows for parametric studies and can generate accurate data. Interestingly, the model results, expected to be accurate within an order of magnitude, are more accurate than anticipated when compared to available experimental and numerical data in the literature. In fact, the maximum relative error is observed to be 15 % when current theoretical predictions are compared to available experimental data.

Significant slipstream amplification is shown for both pressure and velocity transients on the leeward side of the train. The most significant slipstream amplification is observed at the 30 ° yaw angle case where high velocities remain almost constant at the furthest measurement position from train side. Instantaneous slipstream velocities on the leeward side of the train were inputted into a mathematical model which was used to predict the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> wind gusts on a representative sample of the population.

The overall {{aim of this}} research is to improve the understanding <b>of</b> the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> cycling position and crosswinds on the aerodynamics and performance of a cyclist. The first part of this thesis focuses on cycling position. To minimise air resistance, cyclists lower their torso to become more aerodynamic. Results show that lowering torso angle is associated with impairment of physiological functioning, which can be explained by a combination of mechanical and muscular factors. Consequently, there is a trade-off between aerodynamic gains and physiological impairment. Therefore a mathematical model has been developed predicting the optimal torso angle at different cycling speeds.

Results showed the Delayed DES (DDES) approach produced the highest correlation to experimental results. Ballast heights of 0 m, 0. 3 m and 0. 75 m were simulated and compared to existing experimental results. Comparisons between cases found that a vortex from the train’s underbody follows the ballast profile. Crosswind simulations were conducted at yaw angles of 0 o, 5 o, 10 o and 15 o. The results obtained showed {{the formation of a}} large vortex upon the leeward side at yaw angles of 10 o and above, this caused a region of low pressure which increased the overturning forces acting upon the train. Generally, crosswinds increased pressures upon the windward side of the train and decreased them upon the leeward side.

The commercial software Fluent 6. 3 was used to perform the calculations of flow and mixing fields as well as combustion. Standard k-ε and eddy dissipation models were selected as solvers for the representation of the turbulence and combustion, respectively. The results of all calculations are presented in the forms of contour profiles. During the investigation, the treatment was performed by setting a constant velocity of fuel at 20 m/s with varied cross-wind velocity and by keeping the cross-wind velocity constant at 1. 1 m/s with varied fuel velocity.

Amongst these, wind is the main meteorological agent influencing behaviour of birds in their migration journeys. Here we analyze the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> winds during migrations of adult individuals of two raptor species tracked with satellite telemetry, the Montagu’s harrier (Circus pygargus) and the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni). While harriers use mostly soaring flight, kestrels principally use flapping flight and thus, wind can differently affect these birds. We found that both forward and perpendicular winds significantly affected the movements of the Montagu’s harrier, which were drifted from their intended direction but also took advantage of tailwinds. On the contrary, lesser kestrels moved more regardless of forward winds, despite they were highly drifted by crosswinds. Our results also support that the drifting <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> winds {{at the onset of the}} spring migration may explain the loop migration observed for both species, with birds compensating later the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>crosswinds</b> to arrive to their breeding areas.

By reviewing literatures related to the design <b>of</b> NDDCT, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>crosswind</b> on the cooling performance of NDDCT is not considered in contemporary design theories for cooling tower system.

Birds must deal with the displacement caused by crosswinds and their behavior can vary according to different factors such as flight mode, migratory season, experience, and distance to goal areas. Here we analyze the relationship between wind and migratory movements of three raptor species which migrate by soaring-gliding flight: Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, booted eagle Aquila pennata, and short-toed snake eagle Circaetus gallicus. We analyzed daily migratory segments (i. e., the path joining consecutive roosting locations) using data recorded by GPS satellite telemetry. Daily movements of Egyptian vultures and booted eagles were significantly affected by tailwinds during both autumn and spring migrations. In contrast, daily movements of short-toed eagles were only significantly affected by tailwinds during autumn migration. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>crosswinds</b> was significant in all cases. Interestingly, Egyptian vultures and booted eagles showed latitudinal differences in their behavior: both species compensated more frequently at the onset of autumn migration and, {{at the end of the}} season when reaching their wintering areas, the proportion of drift segments was higher. In contrast, there was a higher drift at the onset of spring migration and a higher compensation at the end. Our results highlight the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> wind patterns on the migratory routes of soaring raptors, with different outcomes in relation to species, season, and latitude, ultimately shaping the loop migration patterns that current tracking techniques are showing to be widespread in many long distance migrants...|$|R

40|$|While {{crosswind}} has {{a negative}} influence on natural draft dry cooling towers (NDDCTs) of all sizes, the influence may be fatal for short towers (height < 30 m) proposed for geothermal or solar thermal power plants. In a previous paper, the authors demonstrated the potential for tri-blade-like windbreak walls not to only maintain but significantly improve the short tower cooling performance. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>crosswind</b> attack angle (windbreak walls orientation) was not examined in that paper. The present paper investigates that effect for a 15 m-high small-size NDDCT with horizontally-arranged heat exchangers. 3 D CFD models with different wind attack angles (0 °, 10 °, 20 °, 30 °, 40 °, 50 °, and 60 °) are set up and computed at different crosswind speeds. The {{results indicate that the}} way the cooling tower performance varies with the crosswind speed is highly sensitive to the wind attack angles. At attack angles of 0 ° and 60 ° the cooling performance is improved by windbreaks over the entire crosswind speed range investigated. Other attack angles lead to unfavourable effects at certain wind speeds. The differences are related to the turbulent airflow field in the tower bottom. The results suggest that the tri-blade-like windbreaks placements always with one symmetry axis alignment with the dominant crosswind direction. The findings could be used to determine the windbreak installation angles with respect to the most frequent direction(s) of the ambient wind in a given district...|$|R

In the analysis, all stability derivatives vary with time and hence are nonlinear functions of state variables. Since the Dutch roll motion is not damped despite the fact that a full-time yaw damper is engaged, it is concluded that the design data for the yaw damper is not sufficiently realistic and the contribution of time derivative of sideslip angle to damping should be considered. As a result of nonlinear flight simulation, the vertical wind acting on the aircraft is estimated to be mostly updraft which varies along the flight path before touchdown. Varying updraft appears to make the descent rate more difficult to control to result in a higher g-load at touchdown...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: While {{a number}} of past {{investigations}} have measured the aerodynamic forces on cricket balls, in general these forces have not been {{used to calculate the}} trajectories of balls between bowler and batsman. This article presents such a calculation. It begins with the full trajectory equations as developed for the study of debris flight in extreme windstorms, which are adapted for the cricket ball case. A collation of earlier experimental data is then presented for drag and side force coefficients on cricket balls. From these data, which show considerable scatter, a small number of generic force characteristics are derived for use in the trajectory equa-tions. These characteristics have constant force coefficients in the subcritical and supercritical Reynolds number regions, and a transitionbetween these two regionswith a variable gradient. An approximate analysis of the trajectory equations results in very simple forms for the trajectories in the sub- and supercritical Reynolds number regimes, which reveal the governing dimensionless parameters of the problem, and enable the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>crosswinds</b> to be quantified. The predicted parabolic profiles are in agreement with some very simple calculations carried out by earlier investigators, revealing the limited range of validity of such calculations, andwith the limited real bowling trajectories that have been observed. A full solution of the trajectory equations is then presented for the generic force coefficient characteristics, and a study of trajectories through the Reynolds number range is carried out. In the transition region between sub- and supercritical flows, complex ball trajectories are shown to be possible...|$|R
40|$|Video footage depicts United Airlines Flight 175 (UA 175) {{impacting}} World Trade Center tower 2 (WTC 2) on September 11, 2001 in New York City via {{a trajectory}} comprised of two separate banked turns. The second turn was apparently {{not required to}} generate impact. The first turn, which maintains a constant angle of bank (AoB), is evident at 1. 2 miles before impact. [1] Although human control of UA 175 ’s observed maneuvers cannot be ruled out, the precise coordination of variables such as the selections of a correct bank angle and turn start time for the first turn apparently pose challenges to the unaided human control hypothesis. The observed turn stability favors the use of autopilot operation, either functioning in a conventional course control mode or in Control Wheel Steering (CWS) mode. The probability that either of these two control systems were used is discussed. Flight deck images of United and American airlines 757 s and 767 s suggest that such CWS functions may have been disabled circa 2001. Constant radius turns utilizing plotted waypoints during commercial aviation operations are routinely supported by augmented GPS navigation service and related commercial Flight Management Systems (FMS) available circa 2001. [2] As will be demonstrated, the implementation of UA 175 ’s observed 1. 2 mile constant radius arc, seconds earlier or later than observed, would apparently result in UA 175 missing WTC 2. Estimates <b>of</b> the likely <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>crosswinds</b> on the approach to WTC 2 are also provided. It is noted that a projected impact via the first observed banked turn would have occurred under <b>crosswind</b> conditions capable <b>of</b> generating between 122 and 134 approximate total feet of lateral displacemen...|$|R
