The sample was carbon-coated to prevent charging, and then examined using a Zeiss EVO MA 15 {{scanning electron microscope}} with a LaB 6 source.|$|R
50|$|Characters had 12 {{different}} equipment <b>slots</b> (<b>head,</b> shoulders, {{left and}} right arms, gloves, chest, shirt, belt, pants, {{left and right}} thighs, and boots) in addition to two weapon slots, allowing for one ranged weapon, one or two melee weapons, or a shield. Armour was divided into 6 types: robe, cloth, leather, reinforced leather, chain mail, and plate.|$|R
5000|$|The first bolts had square heads, {{formed by}} forging. These are still found, {{although}} {{much more common}} today is the hexagonal head. These are held and turned by a spanner or wrench, {{of which there are}} many forms. Most are held from the side, some from in-line with the bolt. Other bolts have T-heads and <b>slotted</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics of a robot is the slots it has available for fitting modules. Each robot has a number of slots available, ranging from a handful to ten or more. Slots and modules come in three variants: head, legs, and chassis <b>slots,</b> with <b>head</b> modules fitting in a corresponding <b>head</b> <b>slot</b> and so on. Generally speaking, <b>head</b> <b>slots</b> can be considered electronics (such as scanners or sensor amplifiers), legs slots for engineering and chassis slots are for offensive and industrial modules.|$|R
50|$|Sonor drums {{have several}} design features, {{including}} undersized shells (a similar concept to a violin bridge - {{designed to enhance}} response), and tension rods that are round and feature a slot instead of the traditional square style (though recently Sonor made square <b>heads</b> standard, with <b>slotted</b> <b>heads</b> available as an option). Recently, Sonor re-introduced the designer X-Ray Acrylic drums, {{the first time in}} 20 years Sonor offered acrylic drums. These shells are made from seamless, extruded acrylic and feature acrylic hoops.|$|R
50|$|By design, Torx head screws resist cam-out {{better than}} Phillips <b>head</b> or <b>slot</b> <b>head</b> screws. Whereas Phillips heads were {{allegedly}} designed {{to cause the}} driver to cam out, to prevent overtightening, Torx heads were designed to prevent cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the screw head when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, screw head, and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Selmer-Maccaferri guitar" [...] {{is usually}} played {{by those who}} follow the style of Django Reinhardt. It is an unusual-looking instrument, {{distinguished}} by a fairly large body with squarish bouts, and either a [...] "D"-shaped or longitudinal oval soundhole. The strings are gathered at the tail like an archtop guitar, but the top is flatter. It also has a wide fingerboard and <b>slotted</b> <b>head</b> like a nylon-string guitar. The loud volume and penetrating tone make it suitable for single-note soloing, and it is frequently employed as a lead instrument in gypsy swing.|$|R
50|$|Screws {{were very}} hard to produce before the First Industrial Revolution, {{requiring}} manufacture of a conical helix. The brothers Job and William Wyatt {{found a way to}} produce a screw on a novel machine that first cut the <b>slotted</b> <b>head,</b> and then cut the helix. Though their business ultimately failed, their contribution to low-cost manufacturing of the screw ultimately led to a vast increase in the screw and the screwdriver's popularity. The increase in popularity gradually led to refinement and eventually diversification of the screwdriver. Refinement of the precision of screws also significantly contributed to the boom in production, mostly by increasing its efficiency and standardizing sizes, important precursors to industrial manufacture.|$|R

[...] This also ended Mark Sainsbury's association with the state owned channel.|$|R
50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square socket head screws that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for <b>slot</b> <b>head</b> screws and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. <b>Slotted</b> <b>head</b> screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{marked a}} {{departure}} from earlier Argus engines in that it had new construction techniques which gave the engine greater operating speeds and power. The engine featured smaller 105 mm x 115 mm cylinders with deep finned steel cooling <b>slots,</b> aluminum <b>heads,</b> geared supercharger,a steel alloy crankshaft and a magnesium alloy crankcase. The engine weighed approximately 315 kg and produced 465 PS (459 hp, 342 kW) at 3,100 rpm. Approximately 28,700 engines were produced.|$|R

50|$|Following Joel's eviction, the HouseGuests {{headed to}} the High Roller room for the Earn Your <b>Slot</b> <b>Head</b> of Household competition. A slot machine will show {{the faces of the}} HouseGuests who competed in a certain Power of Veto competition. HouseGuests had to buzz in and {{identify}} which Power of Veto competition those HouseGuests competed in. The HouseGuest with the most points will be the new Head of Household. Nick & Phil were the winners. On Day 71, Gary surprised the HouseGuests to dress them up for the Big Brother Canada Awards. The final four then got to see memorable moments from the season. On Day 71, Nick & Phil nominated Cassandra and Tim for eviction. On Day 71, the HouseGuests vied in the final Movin' Out Power of Veto competition. One at a time, the HouseGuests had to search a live-size jury house for 18 clues. They then had to take each of the clues and hang the clues on the realtor sign of the juror who applied to the clues. The HouseGuest who correctly places the clues on the realtor signs the fastest will win the final Power of Veto of the season. Nick & Phil won the Power of Veto. On Day 72, Nick & Phil decided not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 72, Kelsey cast the sole vote to evict Cassandra.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, On Edge {{played their}} two biggest shows to date. The first was on January 31, a Battle of the Bands at the Regent Theatre in Arlington, {{to a crowd}} of over 400 people.

5000|$|The tool used {{to drive}} a <b>slotted</b> screw <b>head</b> is called a standard, common blade, flat-blade, slot-head, straight, flat, flat-tip, or [...] "{{flat-head}}" [...] screwdriver. This last usage can be confusing, because the term flat-head also describes a screw with a flat top, designed to install in a countersunk hole. Furthermore, the term implies that a screwdriver has a [...] "head"; it does not. Such a flat-headed screw may have a slotted, cross, square recessed, or combination head. Prior {{to the development of}} the newer bit types the flat-blade was referred to as the [...] "Common-Blade". This was simply because it was the most common one.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Fudd {{prepares a}} steak with {{numerous}} hot spices {{and a cup}} of boiling hot coffee, but sets it on the table when he realizes he forgot the bread. The lion leaves the stuffed <b>head</b> <b>slot</b> to eat the steak (unaware it is coated with hot sauce), and when he tries to wash it down with the drink, he gets even hotter and blows fire, screaming. Going back to his hiding spot, Fudd wonders what happened to his steak, but is interrupted by a phone call saying that hunting season is cancelled and that he has to take the hunting signs down. Upon hearing this, the lion leaves his stuffed <b>head</b> <b>slot</b> and runs outside. Other animals, apparently not dead, leave their slots as well. Fudd explains to the audience that he set a new record this year for quickest time that the animals ran out on him, and does his trademark laugh as the short ends.|$|R

50|$|Basically a {{rotary switch}} {{construction}} set, the Geniac contained six perforated masonite disks, {{into the back}} of which brass jumpers could be inserted. The jumpers made electrical connections between <b>slotted</b> brass bolt <b>heads</b> sitting out from the similarly perforated masonite back panel. To the bolts were attached wires behind the panel. The circuit comprised a battery, such wires from it to, and between, switch positions, wires from the switches to indicator flashlight bulbs set along the panel's middle, and return wires to the battery to complete the circuit.|$|R
50|$|Johnny Carson {{retired after}} three {{decades in the}} long-time hosts' chair behind the {{familiar}} iconic late-night desk on May 22, 1992, {{and was replaced by}} Jay Leno amid national and media controversy. David Letterman not only wanted to move into that earlier time slot from his Late Night spot (which had been broadcast following Carson's program) after The Tonight Show, but was considered personally by Carson (Johnny's opinion not revealed until several years later) and others as the natural successor (despite Leno having been Carson's permanent guest host for several years). Letterman, having had his heart set on the earlier time slot, left NBC (on Carson's advice) and joined rival network CBS. Their new program and entry into the late-night television universe, the Late Show with David Letterman, airing in the same <b>slot,</b> competed <b>head</b> to head against The Tonight Show with now Leno in the host's chair and behind that iconic desk, {{for the better part of}} two decades.|$|R
5000|$|Playing both {{offense and}} defense in this era before free substitution, McColl began the 1950 season on defense as a {{defensive}} end, but {{was moved to the}} defensive tackle <b>slot</b> by <b>head</b> coach Marchie Schwartz in mid-October following the loss of two key players to knee injuries. The move proved successful and the 217-pounder was named as one of 11 members of the All-Pacific Coast football team by the International News Service, which reckoned him [...] "one of the brightest sophomore ends to come along in a good many years." [...] McColl's play was of such high caliber {{on both sides of the}} ball that more than once during the 1949 season he very nearly played complete 60-minute games, despite his newness to the varsity squad. Stanford would finish the season in third place in the Pacific Coast Conference with a 7-3-1 record, hitting #12 in the penultimate Associated Press Top 20 poll.|$|R

The importance of orthogonality of excitation forces distribution to the other eigenmodes of blades bundle is discovered at isolating selected resonance...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the company worked with Bruce Egnater of Egnater Amplification {{to create the}} MTS (Modular Tube System) series of guitar amplifiers. These involve a single amp head {{consisting}} of the power amp {{and part of a}} preamp, and <b>slots</b> in the <b>head</b> (one for the RM20 head and combo, two for the RM50 head and combo and RM22 head, and 3 for the RM100 head and RM100C combo, and 12 for the RM1250H) in which you can insert their various preamp modules. These modules are tube preamps in themselves that model various amps, from Vox and Fender style cleans, to Marshall crunch, to all out Mesa Boogie style distortion.|$|R

50|$|The Trofimoff valve {{comprises}} the valve spindle, the piston valve <b>heads</b> <b>slotted</b> onto {{them and the}} two supporting plates (Stützplatten). When the engine is running under load the valve heads are forced by steam pressure onto the support plates and work like standard pistons (Regelkolbenschieber). If steam admission ceases or, on a steam locomotive, the regulator is closed, the pressure drops, the valve heads remain in the inside dead centre position near {{the centre of the}} cylinder due to the tension of the piston rings. The valve spindle continues to move backwards and forwards with the support plates attached to it, without disturbing the valve heads. In this way, perfect pressure balance is achieved, thus ensuring excellent light-running conditions for the steam engine or locomotive.|$|R
