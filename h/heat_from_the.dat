5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} is passing a coolant (usually water) {{through a series of}} holes drilled through the mould plates and connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway. The coolant absorbs <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mould (which has absorbed <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hot plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{small power}} station {{comprising}} three Cummins B and C series diesel engines, offering an approx 150 kVa 3 phase supply {{to most of the}} island buildings.

5|$|A strong {{smell of}} burning {{was present in}} the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. As they approached Black Rod's box {{in the corner of}} the room, they felt <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left to go to the nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E
5|$|After the cyclone has passed, devastation often continues. Standing {{water can}} cause the spread of disease, and {{transportation}} or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed, hampering clean-up and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their devastating effects, tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tropics poleward.

5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|Clouds {{intercept}} both <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sun {{and heat}} radiated from the Earth. Their effects {{are complex and}} vary in time, location, and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss, this causes storms and subsequent flood rains and flooding.|$|E
5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E
40|$|A new {{experimental}} {{device was}} developed to observe and measure dynamical generations of supercritical CO 2 in a chamber. Temperature and pressure were measured locally by thin thermocouple and pressure transducer. The Rayleigh scattering in the chamber was visualized by a high-speed video camera. Heating of the liquid CO 2 was conducted by a ceramic heater <b>from</b> <b>the</b> upper or the lower side of the chamber. In <b>the</b> case of <b>heating</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> upper side, temperature profile was stable and generates scCO 2 slowly within a few seconds. On the other hand, in <b>the</b> case of <b>heating</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lower side, scCO 2 was created faster within a second but natural convection and turbulence were observed. Numerical simulations of the scCO 2 creation in a chamber were also performed using the COMSOL Multiphysics with a program package for themophysical properties of CO 2 called the PROPATH. It showed that scCO 2 creation in <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> upper side was stable due to the gas-like properties of the scCO 2 near the heater. In <b>the</b> case of <b>heating</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lower side, density distribution depended on temperature distribution firstly but after natural convection grows, flow in the chamber became disturbed and the density distribution depended not only on temperature distribution {{but also on the}} density fluctuation caused by the convection vortexes.

5|$|In 2013 {{an appeal}} to raise £3 million was {{launched}} to restore the pools. The fundraising has been supported by The Prince's Trust. The project aims not just to preserve the existing architecture, but also to reopen it as an outdoor lido. This is hampered by poor access to the site {{and the possibility of}} flooding. It is intended to make the work sustainable and environmentally friendly, with renewable sources of energy including water source heat pumps using latent <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> River Avon. A small landing stage is being proposed to enable access to the pools from river craft.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 2007, the {{technology}} was to be displayed at the Kinetica Museum, Spitalfields Market, London. A unit constructed of clear plastic was prepared so that the arrangement of magnets could be seen and {{to demonstrate that the}} device operated without external power sources.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{convective}} heat transfer in a {{cryogenic storage vessel}} is carried out numerically and experimentally. A scaled down model study is performed using water as the model fluid in a rectangular glass tank <b>heated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sides. The convective flow and the resulting thermal stratification phenomenon in the rectangular tank are studied through flow visualization, temperature measurement, and corresponding numerical simulations. It is found that a vortex-like flow near the top surface leads to a well-mixed region there, below which the fluid is thermally stratified. In addition, {{in an attempt to}} simulate the actual conditions, a numerical study is performed on a cylindrical cavity filled with liquid hydrogen $(LH_ 2) $ and <b>heated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sides.

5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} a collapse of a low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk.

5|$|The {{recovery}} from the fires began almost immediately, with plants such as fireweed appearing {{in a matter of}} days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fires. There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after the fires.|$|E

5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus {{the sun at}} 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} they even reached the fire.

This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the aid of elevators.|$|E
