5|$|<b>Guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> are susceptible.

5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. <b>Guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary.

They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 169 - 179) Microfiche. xviii, 179 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThis dissertation {{study was}} designed to elucidate the nucleotide sequence of the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> relaxin gene and hence to derive the amino acid sequence of <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> preprorelaxin, to show how many relaxin gene(s) are present in the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> genome, and to study the transcription of a relaxin gene in the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> endometrium during the reproductive cycle. A lactating <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> mammary gland cDNA library was screened with a radioactive full-length rat preprorelaxin cDNA probe. Seven positive clones were identified. The characterization of the inserts with the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) technique and Southern hybridization suggested that they are truncated molecules. In order to obtain general information of the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> relaxin gene, the clone containing the longest insert (approximately 600 bps) was submitted to sequence analysis. Computer-assisted sequencing data analysis show that this insert was similar to the mRNA sequence of the pig preprorelaxin. The conclusion from this study was that the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> relaxin gene sequence {{is similar to that of}} the pig relaxin gene. Based on the preliminary information from these studies, several sets of oligonucleotide primers were selected from different regions of the mRNA sequence of pig preprorelaxin. These synthetic primers were used to screen a cDNA "pool" prepared from the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> endometrium in late pregnancy by a PCR technique. One set of these PCR primers successfully amplified a relaxin related cDNA fragment (286 bps). Sequence analysis of this PCR product confirmed that it encodes an intact B chain of the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> preprorelaxin plus part of the signal peptide and C peptide of this molecule. The rest part of the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> endometrial relaxin gene was elucidated by a RACE-PCR and subcloning strategy. This is the first report of any part of the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> relaxin gene sequence. Availability of this sequence allowed a study of the physiology of <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> relaxin. The second question of this dissertation was studied by a Southern analysis of <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> genomic DNA digests with a <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> relaxin specific cDNA probe. It was shown that there are two different relaxin genes in the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> genome, a situation similar to the human genome, but different to the genomes of other mammals studied thus far. One relaxin gene has been shown to be expressed in the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> endometrium in this dissertation using PCR and direct sequencing. Whether,or where, the second relaxin gene is expressed needs further investigation. The availability of the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> relaxin gene sequence allowed a more convincing study of the expression of this gene in the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> endometrium. <b>Guinea</b> <b>pig</b> endometrial mRNAs from different stages of the reproductive cycle were hybridized with the radioactive <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> relaxin cDNA probe. Northern analyses obtained from this study showed that the transcription pattern of the relaxin gene in this organ is maximal in the late pregnancy, minimal during mid pregnancy, appears in the estrous cycle and disappears rapidly after parturition. This is the first study of the transcription of the relaxin gene in the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> endometrium during the reproductive cycle with a species-specific cDNA probe. It provides proof that relaxin is indeed synthesized in the <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> endometrium, not sequestered from other sources. The loss of transcription activity of the relaxin gene, in the endometrium, during lactation indicates that there are other sites of relaxin synthesis as sources of the plasma relaxin found in lactation...|$|R
