60|$|<b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> {{and thrust}} {{something}} into Jimmy's hand, something crisp and crackling. Then, his mission performed, fell back and stood waving a snowy handkerchief. The train {{plunged into the}} tunnel.|$|E
60|$|Gabe Werner {{was very}} much in earnest, and his face was red with anger and resentment. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> and caught hold of the lines which Gif held in his hands.|$|E
60|$|Weakly <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> and put {{his hands}} on her shoulders. He whispered in her ear. The tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the button at his throat.|$|E
50|$|Koenig drags {{himself to}} the {{communications}} desk; with great effort, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>up</b> and opens a channel to Carter. The astronaut reports Eagle One {{was caught in the}} Moon's gravitational field and has been carried along with it. He will make it back to base. As the waste pile stops fissioning, acceleration drops and the overpowering g-forces abate. Adjustments made to the base's artificial-gravity field help compensate. Alpha has sustained damage, but is operational. As the senior executives try to figure their next move, a live visual from the Mars satellite documents the Moon's rapid plunge out of the solar system.|$|R
6000|$|... “Ah! if that {{weapon is}} loaded I’ll use a bullet as a can-opener,” <b>he</b> exclaimed, and <b>reaching</b> <b>up</b> <b>he</b> removed the {{revolver}} from its place.|$|R
60|$|He left her. The {{sound of}} her frightened snivel aged him. He tiptoed to the barn door, eying a light in the farm-house. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> far <b>up</b> to the latch of the broad door {{and pulled out the}} wooden pin. The latch slipped noisily from its staple. The door opened with a groaning creek and banged against the barn.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll risk that," [...] he answered. [...] "Just now we're {{lucky if}} we get a {{carriage}} at all." [...] <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> and prodded the jehu in the ribs with his cane. [...] "How much to the Hotel Vesuvius?" [...] he demanded, loudly.|$|E
6000|$|A {{sense of}} defeat--of being {{defrauded}} of his self-justification, and {{of something else}} beyond power of explanation to himself, beset Soames like the breath of a cold fog.

60|$|The Russian soldier {{made his}} way nervously up the ragged side of the hill, holding his gun ready. He glanced around him, licking his dry lips, his face set.

2500|$|... 1955 Member of {{the team}} to first climb Kangchenjunga (28,208ft), <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> and set <b>up</b> camp five (out of six) with Tom Mackinon. The entire group would have summited except for the {{encroaching}} monsoon which prevented this.|$|R
60|$|When <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> {{the road}} <b>up</b> {{which they had}} just come, the second track of wheels could be seen, and he half {{expected}} to hear the farmer's warning cry, forgetting for the time that any ordinary pair of lungs could hardly be heard a mile away.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an etching {{depicting}} a padre ringing a bell at Mission Santa Barbara, ca. 1880. The padre is at center and is clothed in the robes of a Franciscan monk. <b>He</b> is <b>reaching</b> <b>up</b> and ringing a small bell at right. The priest and the bell are under an overhang {{supported by a}} wooden beam and several adobe columns that are missing much of their white spackle. A courtyard is visible behind the padre, and {{it is full of}} bushes and other plants...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not the smallest. For all I care, you are Robert Burns, or Napoleon Buonaparte, or anything, {{from the}} Mother of the Gracchi to Balaam's Ass.

60|$|The monkey {{was growing}} {{more and more}} feeble, and when Toby had shown this act of affection <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> his tiny paws, grasped Toby's finger, half raised himself from the ground, {{and then with a}} convulsive {{struggle}} fell back dead, while the tiny fingers slowly relaxed their hold of the boy's hand.|$|E
60|$|It was in {{the winter}} when this happened, very near the {{shortest}} day, and a week of fog into the bargain, {{so the fact that}} it was still very dark when George woke in the morning was no guide to him as to the time. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up,</b> and hauled down his watch. It was a quarter-past eight.|$|E
50|$|Carl Froch was {{involved}} in Showtime's Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament. <b>He</b> ended <b>up</b> <b>reaching</b> the final, losing to Andre Ward. Then, IBF officially enforced Carl Froch as Lucian Bute's number one mandatory.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{group was}} formed in the mid-1940s and was called [...] "Los Panchitos." [...] The group {{was made up of}} three brothers: Arturo, Jorge, and Javier Castro. Their ages ranged between 10 and 6 years old. Arturo played the piano, Jorge was the drummer, and Javier played the stand-up bass. In an interview with Gualberto Castro, c. 1982, Gualberto said: [...] "Javier was just a baby when he sang and played in [...] "Los Panchitos." [...] My uncle stood him up on a chair so <b>he</b> could <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to play the stand-up bass." ...|$|R
50|$|His {{elder brother}} Pankaj Kalra, {{was already a}} Hindi voice dubbing artist at the time, before he {{introduced}} Pawan into the Voice-dubbing business. He first started performing Hindi dubbing roles with Discovery, Cartoon Network, Pogo, Nickelodeon and Disney Channel programs. Some of the programs that he dubbed in Hindi airs on Pogo. Seven years later afterwards, <b>He</b> has <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> {{to the point of}} stage where people all over India recognize him as a voice artist and he felt glad. He is mostly famous for being the Official Hindi dub-over voice artist for Austro-American actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his career.|$|R
6000|$|... "Leave {{orders to}} call me at the {{slightest}} change," [...] said the Captain. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to put the book away, and tucked his legs upon the couch.

60|$|A {{tongue of}} flame sprang up the mizzen, reached hungrily {{for the lowest}} tier of canvas, missed it, and vanished. From aloft a burning shred of rope stuff fell square {{on the back of}} Captain Davenport's neck. He acted with the {{celerity}} of one stung by a bee as <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> and brushed the offending fire from his skin.|$|E
6000|$|... "To hear is to obey," [...] {{said the}} Genie, and, as he spoke, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> {{into the air}} and picked out a purse from nothing at all. [...] "Here," [...] said he, [...] "is the purse of fortune; take from it all that thou needest and yet it will always be full. As long as thou hast it thou shalt never be lacking riches." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nearer and nearer {{came the}} lion. Another moment and <b>he</b> could <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> with one great paw and drag the ape-man {{downward}} to those awful jaws. A whirring noise {{above his head}} caused Tarzan to glance apprehensively upward. A great bird was circling close above him. He never had seen so large a bird in all his life, yet he recognized it immediately, for had he not seen it hundreds of times {{in one of the}} books in the little cabin by the land-locked bay--the moss-grown cabin that with its contents was the sole heritage left by his dead and unknown father to the young Lord Greystoke? ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the musical Gambler, a dancer steps across the stage through a tunnel of light {{projected}} by a laser and scanning mirrors. <b>He</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>up</b> into the projected light so that his fingers interrupt the beam to create stripes on the tunnel wall. The effects from the 5 W argon-ion laser throughout the show, which is running at the Musicalbühne Mönchengladbach in Germany, {{are the result of}} a co-operation between engineers from the Fraunhofer Institut für Lasertechnik in Aachen and the creative team at the theatre. Members of the audience sit beneath the beams, but the safety of the performers depends on synchronizing the limelight (stage lighting) and the laser beams with the music to an accuracy of less than 40 ms. Erie Woolfson, an ex-member of pop group Alan Parsons Project, composed the music, which is reproduced from digital tape recorders. A master tape recorder produces a time code and feeds it to the main lighting panel. The laser effects program and its graphics editor run under Windows and are controlled by a mouse. The main panel transmits start and stop signals to the laser system, which is integrated as a fixed installation and stored in the room underneath the stage until it is needed...|$|R
50|$|Bethesda is {{situated}} along a major thoroughfare that was originally {{the route of}} an ancient Native American trail. Henry Fleet, an English fur trader, was the first European {{to travel to the}} area, which <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> by sailing <b>up</b> the Potomac River. After staying for two years with the Piscataway tribe—either as a guest or prisoner—he returned to England, spoke of potential riches in fur and gold, and won funding for another North American expedition.|$|R
60|$|On {{the ball}} soared, {{and began to}} drop; on the fielder sped, and began to {{disappear}} over a little hill back of his position. Then <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> with a long arm and marvelously caught the ball in one hand. He went out of sight as I touched second base, and the heterogeneous crowd knew about a great play to make more noise than a herd of charging buffalo.|$|E
6000|$|The tent reeled {{under the}} blows of the wind, the canvas booming hollowly at every shock, while the sleet and rain rattled {{overhead}} like skirmish-fire {{grown into a}} battle. In the lulls {{they could hear the}} water streaming off at the side-walls with the noise of small cataracts. [...] <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> curiously and touched the wet roof. A burst of water followed instantly at the point of contact and coursed down upon the grub-box.|$|E
60|$|She {{watched him}} as he hung up his overcoat. He wore black clothes, as usual. As <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>up</b> to the pegs, {{she could see the}} muscles of his shoulders, and the form of his legs. Her reddish-brown eyes seemed to burn, and her nose, that had a subtle, {{beautiful}} Hebraic curve, seemed to arch itself. She made a little place for him by herself, as he returned. She carried her head thrown back, with dauntless self-sufficiency.|$|E
60|$|Once {{in a while}} Johnny Chuck {{stopped to}} brush his coat carefully, for he is very {{particular}} about his appearance, is Johnny Chuck. By and by {{he came to the}} old butternut tree down by the Smiling Pool. He could see it a long time before <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> it, and <b>up</b> in the top of it he could see Blacky the Crow flapping his wings and cawing {{at the top of his}} voice.|$|R
60|$|So {{the youth}} did it again, {{and when he}} went {{up on the hill}} next year to look after his colt and the mares, each of the mares had her foal again; but the dappled colt was so big that when the lad wanted to feel its neck to see how fat it was, <b>he</b> could not <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to it, it was so high? and it was so bright that the light glanced off its coat.|$|R
5000|$|Allen R. Meyers {{has written}} a paper that [...] "describes the {{development}} of a slave army, the 'Abid al Bukhari, which enabled one such sultan, Ismail ibn al-Sharif to establish a large and relatively durable Moroccan state" [...] (3). Meyers states that with the armies support Ismail was able to collect taxes, suppress rebellion, and maintain public order. Ismail first began his army by confiscating three thousand male slaves from the residents of Marrakech, and later <b>he</b> would <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to fourteen thousand slaves. Creating this self-sufficient army also could have its drawbacks with uprisings and rebellions, such as a poor relationship with Islamic scholars due to enslaving others Muslims, (El Hamel) an act that was considered to be blasphemous.|$|R
