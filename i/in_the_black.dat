5|$|NATO {{increased}} its naval presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea significantly following the Russian invasion, with ships docking in Georgian ports, {{and according to}} the US Navy, delivering humanitarian aid. NATO said that its presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea was not related to the Georgian crisis; its vessels were conducting typical visits and preplanned naval exercises with Romania and Bulgaria. Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn reminded NATO of the limit on the number of vessels allowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea under the 1936 Montreux convention. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were bringing only humanitarian assistance, alleging the delivery of military material. According to political analyst Vladimir Socor, the US maintained a continual presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea. The ships were rotated from time to time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea because of the constraints on ship's weight and length of visits set by the Montreux Convention.|$|E
5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that much <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and the first few months of 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E

5|$|After the 1848 {{finding of}} gold in the Sierra Nevada and {{dramatic}} gains in new wealth from it, other men {{became interested in the}} potential for gold mining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills. Custer's announcement of gold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Lakota and whites seeking to move into the Black Hills.|$|E

5|$|In early 1916, UB-7 and UB-8 {{were still}} {{cruising}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea out of Varna. The Germans {{did not have}} good luck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea, which was not a priority for them. The Bulgarians, who saw {{the value of the}} submarines in repelling Russian attacks, began negotiations to purchase UB-7 and UB-8. Bulgarian sailors practiced in the pair of boats and technicians were sent to Kiel for training at the German submarine school there. The transfer of UB-8 to the Bulgarian Navy took place on 25 May 1916, but for reasons unreported in sources, UB-7 remained under the German flag.|$|E

5|$|After Germany's {{conquest of}} Romania (see Romania during World War I), the German Imperial Navy had {{sufficient}} fuel oil for submarines located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea. UB-44 {{and three of}} her sister ships in the Pola Flotilla were ordered to Constantinople and, en route, had to navigate through the Dardanelles, which had been heavily mined by the Allies {{in the middle of}} 1916. UB-44 departed from Cattaro on 8 August for Hersingstand (located on the Gallipoli peninsula) to pick up a pilot for the trip through the Dardanelles, but never arrived.|$|E

UB-14 was at Sevastopol after the Germany signed the armistice treaty that ended all fighting on 11 November. UB-14 and the three other surviving Constantinople Flotilla boats were disarmed on 25 November. UB-14 was scuttled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea off Sevastopol {{in the early months}} of 1919.|$|E

She was also involved in the Greco-Turkish War. In 1930, the London Naval Treaty mandated that the four Iron Duke-class battleships be discarded; Marlborough was used for a variety of weapons tests in 1931–32, the results of which were incorporated into the reconstruction programme for the s.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{sector in}} South Dakota's economy is tourism. Many travel {{to view the}} attractions of the state, particularly those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hills region, such as historic Deadwood, Mount Rushmore, and the nearby state and national parks. One of the largest tourist events in the state is the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.
