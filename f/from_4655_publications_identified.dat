25|$|After {{the drop}} in {{enrollment}} and subsequent restructuring of academic programs in the 1970s, little capacity construction was undertaken {{over the next two}} decades, except as required by the developing research interests of CNAS. Boyce Hall, completed in 1974, was the only major addition in the period, although several greenhouses and agricultural support units continued to be built. However, in the mid-80s, enrollment started to grow significantly, by 76% over six years (<b>from</b> <b>4,655</b> students in 1983 to 8220 students in 1989). This growth justified considerable further campus expansion over the 1990s. Major additions built in the 90s include the Entomology Research Museum completed in 1993, Bourns Hall completed in 1995, the Humanities & Social Science building in 1996, the Science Library in 1998, Pentland and Stonehaven residence halls in 2000, and the Arts building in 2001.|$|R

40|$|People {{who suffer}} from bruxism (teeth-grinding) often ask their dentists whether their {{condition}} is hereditary. The {{purpose of this study}} is to enable dentists to provide an ‘evidence-based’ answer to this question.

The references cited by the <b>publications</b> <b>identified</b> yielded one further publication, bringing the total number of publications included in the analysis to 10. Four publications related to family studies, five related to twin studies and one related to a DNA analysis. With the exception of one of the twin studies, all the included studies concluded that bruxism appears to be (in part) genetically determined. Dentists whose patients ask them about bruxism can therefore tell them that teeth-grinding does indeed ‘run in families’...|$|R

30|$|In step 1, 530 <b>publications</b> were <b>identified.</b> While {{we did not}} {{examine the}} number of false positives {{produced}} by the search criteria for this step, such an examination was performed for the most-cited publications in step 2, and {{it is reasonable to}} assume that the false-positive rate of 16 % identified for highly cited publications is similar to the rate for the wider dataset. For the <b>publications</b> <b>identified</b> in step 1, both descriptive as well as aggregated analyses of co-occurrences of keywords and records were conducted to find relevant information about the dataset. For processing the data retrieved from Scopus, we used several tools, including Microsoft Excel for basic processing and sorting, and Elsevier’s Mendeley as a reference manager tool. Co-occurrence analyses were conducted using VOSviewer (van Eck & Waltman, 2010) and Yasu Imao’s CasualConc application (sites.google.com/site/casualconc/), and the results are presented in the step 1 subsection of the results section.|$|R
