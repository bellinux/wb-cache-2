40|$|Abstract – A {{variety of}} {{assessment}} tools {{have become more}} prevalent in introductory physics courses {{as a way to}} enhance and assess conceptual learning. At the interface of modern physics and quantum mechanics, these tools are not presently as widely used. The Modern Physics course at American University presents an ideal opportunity for conceptual assessment given its somewhat atypical student composition. In this study both qualitative and quantitative measures of student understanding of a key concept in modern physics, the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> are utilized. As a quantitative overall baseline for gain, the Quantum Physics Conceptual Survey (QPCS) was implemented [1]. A set of questions on the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> that required both a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> were then given on both the midterm and final exams. The results of the QPCS, and a subset of QPCS questions solely on the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect,</b> are statistically compared to the more focused approach for assessing the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> Additionally, correlations between subsets of the student population and their gains on the various assessments were investigated. The results from these assessment methods will be discussed in the larger context of how assessment measures can be maximized to enhance student understanding in a modern physics course. In particular this study shows how there may be a correlation between a student’s background preparation, and their gain on different types of assessments...|$|R

40|$|According to {{an entropy}} {{approach}} and by reviewing {{the similarity between}} laws characterizing the flow of heat and electric charges, electric charges were defined as electromagnetic waves that possess an electrical potential or simply as ionized photons. Accordingly, the flow of electrons {{was defined as a}} simultaneous flow of particulate energy and wave energy. Such definitions led to clear the confusions of duality properties of electrons and light waves, conflicts in the SI system of units and to explain the difference between the calculated drift speed of electrons and the speed of electricity or charges in conductors. However, Einstein considered the electron to be a negative charge of unknown nature during his analysis of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> Einstein presented his hypothesis that light may behave as a particle to find a plausible explanation of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> He found the measured cutoff frequency of light below which light might not eject electrons from metal-surfaces in photocells regardless of how much light is shone on the surface as a proof of truth of his hypothesis. Such frequency may be explained also, according to the previously introduced definitions, as the minimum energy quanta that may gain a quantized potential in photocells. This explanation may find plausible explanations of the found measurements of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> for different metal surfaces, stopping voltages into photocells and the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> of X-rays. Einstein’s hypothesis of the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> failed to find plausible explanations of such measurement results. According to the principles of conservation of momentum, there is a minimum quantity of photons that may lead to bouncing an atomic electron out of its orbit. So, considering Einstein’s theory as a perfect hypothesis that explains the <b>photoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> may be a misconception...|$|R
