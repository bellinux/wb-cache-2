5|$|Flanders felt that, {{to quell}} inflation, wage {{increases}} should {{be tied to}} productivity increases, rather {{than the cost of}} living. He recommended splitting gains in productivity three ways: to the worker <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> wages, to the company <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> profits and to the consumer for lower prices. He felt that with this approach everyone would benefit at the company level and in the national economy. Such an approach would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that (1) there are quantitative differences in the cellular responses in the corneal stroma after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for low myopia compared to high myopia and (2) there are both qualitative and quantitative differences in the cellular responses in the corneal stroma after PRK <b>for</b> <b>high</b> myopia and laser in situ ker-atomileusis (LASIK) <b>for</b> <b>high</b> myopia. Methods: PRK for low myopia (- 4. 5 diopters [D]), PRK <b>for</b> <b>high</b> myopia (- 9. 0 D), and LASIK <b>for</b> <b>high</b> myopia (- 9. 0 D) were performed in rabbit eyes, and corneas were obtained for examination at 4, 24, and 72 hours, 1 and 4 weeks, and 3 months after surgery. A total of 144 rabbits {{were included in the}} study. Stromal apoptosis, necrosis, mitosis, myofibro-blast generation, and inflammatory cell infiltration were evaluated by immunohistochemical methods and electron microscopy. Results: Keratocyte apoptosis/necrosis and the subsequent proliferation and density of myofibroblasts were qualitatively and quantitatively different in PRK <b>for</b> <b>high</b> myopia compared to either PRK for low myopia or LASIK <b>for</b> <b>high</b> myopia. Significant inflammatory cell infiltration was noted in both PRK and LASIK but appeared to be greater in PRK <b>for</b> <b>high</b> myopia. Conclusions: The qualitative and quantitative differences in the cellular wound healing response after PRK <b>for</b> <b>high</b> and low myopia and LASIK <b>for</b> <b>high</b> myopia are likely determinants of the clinical differences in refractive outcome and some of the complications, such as regression and haze, seen after these procedures.
