5000|$|The car has a four-cylinder [...] engine {{from the}} saloon, {{but with a}} raised {{compression}} ratio. However, since it was developed from the saloon platform, it suffered from rigidity compromises despite extra side members in the chassis. The <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> were changed, and from 1954 an overdrive unit became standard. The gearchange lever was column-mounted. A true open 2-seater there were no external door handles or wind-up windows.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the use of}} {{front-wheel drive}} layouts, the gearbox and final drive are {{combined}} into a single transaxle. There {{is no longer a}} drive shaft between them and so the notion of [...] "direct drive" [...] isn't applicable.

50|$|In 2006, Sherco {{modified}} the tuning of the 2.9, 272cc, model; making a more mellow throttle response for better grip in wet conditions. This {{was done by}} increasing {{the volume of the}} cylinder head combustion chamber (lowering the compression ratio) and reducing the cross section area of the transfer ports. Other changes including the new chassis (now painted black rather than chrome plated), new <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> and a new front fork manufacturer. All these changes made the 2006 Sherco more usable for more riders. 2006 also saw the introduction of a Cabestany replica 2.9 model with limited edition graphics.|$|E
40|$|Abstract：Based on a {{technique}} of mixed programming with MATLAB and C#, the transmission parameters optimization software {{was developed to}} improve the power performance of off-road vehicle.

50|$|One of {{the main}} needs for a {{transmission}} is to match {{the speed of the}} engine to the speed of the locomotive, so that the engine can work in its useful operating speed range. All locomotives need to deliver high torque from zero rail speed for startup. The overall range of gear ratios required from the transmission thus depends on the maximum speed of the train. The narrower the power band of the engine, the more precise control of <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> is required, either by using a continuously variable transmission or a discrete ratio transmission with more ratios.|$|R

50|$|The A35 is {{very similar}} in {{appearance}} to the A30, except for a larger rear window aperture and a painted front grille, with chrome horse-shoe surround, instead of the chrome grille on the A30. Both have 13 in wheels. The semaphore turn-signal indicators were replaced with modern front- and rear-mounted flashing lights. A slightly easier to operate remote-control gear-change was provided. Much of the improved performance {{is a result of}} different <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios.</b> The A30 has the first three ratios close together then a big gap to top (fourth gear). The A35's ratios are better spaced and give a higher speed in third gear.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced to {{the market}} in 2003, the Peugeot 206 GTi180 and 206 RC brought high {{performance}} to the product range. The range topping GTi180 {{was brought to the}} UK market, while the 206 RC was introduced to the rest of Europe. The new 'hot hatch' used the 2 litre EW10J4S engine, which produced [...] thanks to variable valve timing and modified inlet and exhaust manifolds. Other features on the 206 GTi180 and 206 RC include 17 inch alloy wheels, racing bucket front seats, a short shift gear linkage and altered <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> (1st & 2nd gears). The new car was capable of reaching 62 mi/h km/h in 7.4 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The 604 was {{launched}} in March 1975, at the Geneva Motor Show. It was originally available in a single specification, as the 604 SL. In 1977, the 604 {{was launched}} in the US in carbureted V6 SL trim, with twin rectangular headlights and larger bumpers. In September, the somewhat quicker 604 TI model with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and a five-speed manual transmission was added. In late 1978, for the 1979 model year, the 80 horsepower 604 D turbo turbodiesel model was introduced; it entered production in February 1979. The diesel could be ordered with either a four- or a five-speed manual transmission, {{as well as the}} GM-sourced three-speed automatic. The six-cylinder 604's received modified <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 the Fabia {{received}} a facelift, with changed {{front fog lights}} and grille, slightly different rear lights, new steering wheel and revised specification levels. The RS also had its final <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> changed. Most importantly, the Sport model was added, with the [...] 1.4 petrol being offered with a manual transmission. This engine was quickly dropped for the 1.2 HTP, which while not as powerful, was a much more free revving engine giving a more sporty feel and flexible drive. The Sport also had its specification changed to include red seat belts and sunset privacy glass from the B pillar to the rear.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of the drivetrain is to couple the engine that produces the power to the driving wheels that use this mechanical power to rotate the axle. This connection involves physically linking the two components, which may be {{at opposite ends of}} the vehicle and so requiring a long propeller shaft or drive shaft. The operating speed of the engine and wheels are also different and must be matched by the correct gear ratio. As the vehicle speed changes, the ideal engine speed must remain approximately constant for efficient operation and so this <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> must also be changed, either manually, automatically or by an automatic continuous variation.|$|R

5000|$|The vehicle had a {{front-wheel drive}} layout and was {{powered by a}} flat-4 {{air-cooled}} engine. A series of small engines were available, displacing 1015, 1129, 1222 and 1299 cc. Power ranged from [...] to [...] Mated to a four speed gearbox, these were able to pull this car up to steady 151 km/h at 6250 rpm (with 1222 cc engine), due to the very aerodynamic body shape. Citroën's 3-speed C-Matic semi-automatic transmission was available {{as an alternative to}} the manual gearbox. With the introduction of the GSA a 5-speed gearbox was offered, which made cruising at high speeds more comfortable and economical (the top speed was raised to 164 km/h for both long and short <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios).</b> The GS and GSA were always low powered and needed full use of the free-revving engines to maintain progress, except when cruising, in the tradition of the Citroën 2CV.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the early}} {{development}} {{of cars and}} the almost universal rear-wheel drive layout, the final drive (i.e. rear axle) ratio for fast cars was chosen to give the ratio for maximum speed. The gearbox was designed so that, for efficiency, the fastest ratio would be a [...] "direct-drive" [...] or [...] "straight-through" [...] 1:1 ratio, avoiding frictional losses in the gears. Achieving an overdriven ratio for cruising thus required a <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio</b> even higher than this, i.e. the gearbox output shaft rotating faster than the engine. The propeller shaft linking gearbox and rear axle is thus overdriven, and a transmission capable of doing this became termed an [...] "overdrive" [...] transmission.|$|R

The Optimal Maneuver Method, which essentially simulates an ideal driver and computes the minimum Lap Time for a given motorcycle and a given circuit, is applied. A 1000 cc SuperBike motorcycle and two very different racetracks, i. e. a fast one and a slow one, are considered. First the agreement between the Optimal Maneuver Method results and the logged telemetry data is proven, in order to fully justify its application. Next the relationship between <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratio,</b> lap performance and circuit characteristics is investigated and potential improvements are highlighted.

50|$|The 2nd main change came in late 1964 {{when the}} entire Cortina range had a {{facelift}} {{which included a}} full width front grille and aeroflow outlets in the rear quarters because the Cortina Lotus also gained Ford's new ventilation system which also included an update to the interior. The third and probably most important change came in mid-1965, when the Lotus rear suspension was changed for the leaf springs and radius arms of the Cortina GT. This replaced all the stiffening tubing as well. The last update also came in 1965 when the rear drums were swapped for self-adjusting items and also the famous 2000E <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> were used. These lowered 1st and reverse about halfway between the Cortina GT ratios and the ultra close-ratio box. All these changes made the cars less specialised but far more reliable and all the special parts were still available for competition {{as well as to}} members of the public.|$|E
5000|$|The 1750 GTV {{replaced}} the Giulia Sprint GT Veloce and introduced many updates and modifications. Most significantly, the engine capacity was increased to 1779 cc displacement (80 mm bore × 88.5 mm stroke, 6.61l oil capacity, 9.58l radiator capacity). Peak {{power from the}} engine was increased to [...] at 5500 rpm. The stroke was lengthened from 82 to 88.5 mm over the 1600 engine, and a reduced rev limit from 7000 rpm to 6000 rpm. Maximum torque was increased to 186 Nm at 3000 rpm. A higher ratio final drive was fitted (10/41 instead of 9/41) but the same <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> were retained. The result was that, on paper, the car had only slightly improved performance compared to the Giulia Sprint GT Veloce, but on the road {{it was much more}} flexible to drive and it was easier to maintain higher average speeds for fast touring. For the United States market, the 1779 cc engine was fitted with a fuel injection system made by Alfa Romeo subsidiary SPICA, to meet emission control laws that were coming into effect at the time. Fuel injection was also featured on Canadian market cars after 1971. Carburettors were retained for other markets.|$|E
5000|$|The Moskvitch 412 was a {{derivate}} of Moskvitch 408, differing in {{more powerful}} 1.5 engine. The earliest engines for the M-412 {{were built in}} 1964. The Moskvitch-412 had a slanted (to a tilt of 20 degrees) inline-four engine with a block, head, and inlet manifold cast in aluminium alloy {{in order not to}} increase the weight of the engine and a hemispherical combustion chamber. Steel cylinder liners were replaceable to enable easy repair of the engine instead of having to replace it entirely. Since it was of an OHC design, it was taller than the OHV MZMA-408 engine it replaced, which is why it was mounted at a slant. The UZAM-412 had a capacity of [...] c.c. and developed 75 horsepowers. Its more powerful version, the Moskvitch-412-2V, had 100 h.p. and was installed on sports cars. The [...] UZAM-412 engine, with a light alloy block, was designed by Igor I. Okunev. According to some observers, it bore some similarities to the contemporary BMW M 115 motor used in the BMW 1500 model, although in other ways they are different from each other. The similarity between the two engines is purely superficial and limited only to the tilt angle of the cylinder block and between the valves and the gear of the overhead camshaft. The gearbox inherited from the M-408 was improved, with the <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> being revised to make better use of the increased power output.|$|E

5000|$|Ford {{wanted to}} change a few things for the Mk2, the Mk1 had done all and more than they could expect in {{competition}}, but the public linked its competition wins with Lotus and its bad points with Ford. Ford still {{wanted to build a}} Mk2 Lotus and compete with it, but Lotus were moving from Cheshunt to Hethel so it was a bad time for them to build another model. Ford were also concerned with the unreliability of the Lotus built cars. So a decision was made at Ford that to continue with its competition drive and make the car more cost effective they would make the car at Dagenham themselves, alongside the other Cortinas. So the Mk2 had to be much easier to build than the Mk1 so that it could be made alongside Mk2 GT production, just with a different engine and suspension. The Mk2 took a while to appear, first appearing in 1967. The main difference was the choice of colours and the lack of a stripe, although most had them fitted at Ford dealers at extra cost. The only cosmetic changes made were a black front grille, 5.5J x 13 steel wheels and Lotus badges on rear wings and by the rear number plate. The badge on the front grille was an option at first. Unlike the Mk1, the Mk2 was also made in left hand drive from the start of production. The Mk2 Cortina Lotus also gained an improved and more powerful (...) engine, which was formerly supplied as the special equipment engine option on Lotus Elan and the Cortina Lotus Mk1. The <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> remained 2000E ones but the car now used the Mk2 GT remote-control gearchange. The car also had a different final drive of 3.77:1 rather than 3.9:1. The Mk2 was a wider car than the Mk1, so although they looked the same, the steel wheels had a different offset so as not to upset the tracking, and radial tyres were now standard. Another attraction was the larger fuel tank. The spare wheel could now be mounted in its wheel well, but the battery remained in the boot to aid weight distribution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Optimal {{control of}} a wheel loader {{operating}} in the short loading cycle is studied in order to investigate the potentials for fuel consumption reduction while maintaining acceptable production rates. The wheel loader is modeled as a system with five states and three control inputs including torque converter nonlinearities. The torque converter is modeled with no lockup enabling power transmission in both directions. The geometry of the wheel loader boom and the demanded force in the lift cylinders during lifting are used {{to ensure that the}} in-cylinder pressure remains below component’s limits. The lift-transport section of the short loading cycle is divided into four phases due to discontinuities in the <b>gearbox</b> <b>ratios</b> and fuel consumption is calculated in each phase. Time optimal and fuel optimal transients of the system and the power consumption in each and every component is presented showing the dominance of the torque converter losses compared to the other components especially in the time optimal solutions. It is shown that introducing path constraints on the maximum lifting speed of the bucket due to limitations in hydraulic pumping speed moves the diesel engine operation towards higher speeds {{in order to maintain the}} lifting speed. Trade-off between fuel optimal and time optimal transients is calculated which is found to be in agreement with the results of experimental studies...|$|E
