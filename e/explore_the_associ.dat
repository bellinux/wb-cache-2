Real-time RT PCR is a standard method for studying changes in gene expression. However, to obtain accurate and reliable results, validation of reference genes is obligatory.

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in China has been increasing significantly in the past 2 decades and is now reaching epidemic proportions. 6, 7 Because diabetes mellitus has been regarded as a potent risk factor for both stroke and kidney dysfunction, 8, 9 we hereby hypothesized that <b>the</b> <b>associ...</b>|$|R

In order to do so, several authors suggest to build an object-oriented framework [10, 14].

40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} the psychological distress of school teachers using a 6 -item instrument (the K 6) in Kagawa prefecture, Japan. Methods: A total of 670 school teachers (328 me n and 342 women) were analyzed in this cross- sectional investigation study. <b>The</b> <b>associ</b> ation between psychological distress and clinical factors was evaluated {{by using the}} K 6 instrument, with psychological distress defined as 13 or more points {{out of a total}} of 24 points. Results: A total of 55 teachers (8. 2 %) were classified as having psychological distress. No significant relationships between the K 6 score and sex, age, dura tion of experience as a teacher, school grade and title were noted. The K 6 score in teachers with consciousness of suicide among students was higher than that without, but not at a significant level. Conclusion: Some teachers were defined as having psychological distress in Kagawa prefecture, Japan. However, no relevant effects of basic characteristics such as age and sex on psychological distress were recognized. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the {{existence}} of suitable feedback laws which provide stability (in a technical sense to be specified) with respect to inputs and initial conditions of the state response of a nonlinear system. 1. Introduction Roughly speaking, a forced system is said to be externally stable if the future state evolution is bounded whenever the input is bounded. Moreover, the system is said to be externally stabilizable if the external stability property can be achieved by means of some state static feedback connection. As the classical theory of linear systems shows, external stability and stabilizability are related to the so-called internal stability properties, that is stability properties of the associated unforced system. In this work we consider nonlinear systems of the form (1) x = f(x; u) where x 2 R n, u 2 R m and f 2 C 1 (R n Θ R m; R n).

40|$|Aims We {{investigated}} {{the association of}} serum adiponectin concentrations with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) after careful adjustment for other established risk factors. In addition, we investi-gated the association between adiponectin levels and established sociodemographic and laboratory risk markers for CHD. Methods and results Three hundred and twelve patients aged 40 – 68 with angiographically confirmed stable CHD and 476 age- and gender-matched controls were included in this case–control study. Adipo-nectin serum concentrations (adiponectin, R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany), markers of inflam-mation and haemostasis, and an extensive lipid profile were determined. Adiponectin serum concentrations were lower in CHD patients when compared with age- and gender-matched controls, both in men (median 4. 95 vs. 5. 58 mmol/L, P 0. 004) and in women (median 9. 64 vs. 11. 60 mmol/L, P 0. 018). Adiponectin was strongly correlated with lipoproteins and apolipoproteins, in particular HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), {{and to a lesser}} degree with markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL- 6, or markers of coagulation or fibrinolysis. When compared with subjects with adiponectin serum concentrations in the lower quintile, the OR for CHD was 0. 52 (95 % CI 0. 28 – 0. 95) in the upper one after adjustment for covariates (P, 0. 007 for trend).

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} focused on the {{association}} between the lipid-lowering efficacy of statins and the SLCO 1 B 1 c. 521 T>C polymorphism; however, the results are conflicting. The effects of statins show significant variability between individuals. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of the SLCO 1 B 1 c. 521 T>C polymorphism on the lipid-lowering effects of statins. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and Web of Science to screen relevant studies. Meta-analysis was performed to identify the association between SLCO 1 B 1 c. 521 polymorphisms and the lipid-lowering effects of statinson the basis of the standard mean difference (SMD) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Additionally, we checked for hetero-geneity (I 2) among studies and evidence of publication bias. We obtained eight studies in-cluding 2, 012 wild genotype (T/T) and 526 variant genotype (T/C and C/C) cases. Results: No significant difference was observed in the lipid-lowering efficacy of statins be-tween the wildand variant genotypes of SLCO 1 B 1, with a pooled SMD of 0. 03 (95 % CI:- 0. 07 - 0. 13). Furthermore, there was no significant effect in the meta-analyses of the vari-ant heterozygote, homozygote, and Chinese populations.
