5000|$|Blondel's theorem, {{named after}} its discoverer, French {{electrical}} engineer André Blondel, {{is the result}} of his attempt to simplify both the measurement of electrical energy and the validation of such measurements. The result is a simple rule that specifies the minimum number of watt-hour meters required to measure the consumption of energy in any system of electrical conductors. The theorem states that the power provided to a system of N conductors is equal to the algebraic sum of the power measured by N watt-meters. The N watt-meters are separately connected such that each one measures the current level in one of the N conductors and the potential level between that conductor and a common point. In a further simplification, if that common point is located on one of the conductors, that conductor's meter can be removed and only N-1 meters are required. An <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>meter</b> is a watt-meter whose measurements are integrated over time, thus the theorem applies to watt-hour meters as well. [...] Blondel wrote a paper on his results that was delivered to the International Electric Congress held in Chicago in 1893. Although he was not present at the Congress, his paper is included in the published Proceedings.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of more effective decision rules for the conformance assessment of <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> in private households in Norway, and proposes how to use a specific risk analysis in order to set the time for the next meter test. The MID regulation today prescribes conformance assessment of <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> based on ISO standards for attribute sampling where decision rules are purely statistical decision rules and economic consequences are not explicitly taken into account. The risk analysis we introduce calculates the risks involved for erroneous decisions, either rejecting a conforming batch of meters (the producer risk) or accepting a non-conforming batch (the consumer risk). The consumer risk is sensitive to the period until the next test which becomes a quality characteristic of each batch. This time interval can be optimized by balancing the consumer risk against the producer risk. When the quality drops, the period until the next test will need to become shorter. But at a certain level of quality, the energy net supplier would rather replace the complete batch, than continue testing at such short intervals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{measurement}} of the electrical energy and its billing for tax purpose are of great relevance. In spite of its importance, in the past a scarce attention was given to issues as the calibration and the traceability of the electrical energy meters, so that, at least in Italy, more than 30 millions of energy meters operate and put a tariff without proper metrological characterization. This situation is caused by both the absence of specific laws and the high cost related to the traceability process. In this ambit, a new European Directive on measuring instruments (MID) was introduced in 2004 {{with the aim of}} providing a high level of metrological protection in order that any party affected can have confidence in the result of measurement. In Italy the MID was adopted by a legislative decree and imposed that: (i) each active <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>meter</b> put into service has to be kept in test for a period for verifying its operating; (ii) after the test period, with positive result, the meter has to be calibrated at least twice in the year. The paper proposes a discussion about the issues of active <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>meter</b> calibration and the analysis of requirements of the MID. Finally, the design of a device that may solve the problem of the traceability to national standards in easy and economic way is reported...|$|E

Without an effective management system, nothing will have direction and no milestone can be achieved. The most important management section of any organization is the management on ground level. If ground level management of an organization is defective, the organization will not function and will soon only serve as {{a reference to a}} valuable lesson. The sustainability of local government is determined by the same principle, with the success thereof ascribed to the management of infrastructure and processes within a municipality. One such functioning aspect of municipalities is the <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>metering</b> system. A wellmanaged and maintained <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> management system {{is one of the few}} capital resources of any municipality. The electrical supply system can however also be one of many constraints, impeding development if mismanaged. This research study shows the effects of management, or the lack thereof, on selected rural municipalities. Research was done to determine the current state of technology and the associated financial impact on these municipalities. Although it is not possible to generalize, it is evident from this research study that an underlying problem is the lack of proper ground level management. Design science research was used to add value in the form of a capability maturity model for rural municipalities. Such a model can be used to score a municipality in terms of its capability maturity at national level. When applied correctly, this model can be used as a management tool.

In March 2007, Havells acquired SLI Sylvania of Netherlands for $300 million, making it the fourth largest lighting business in the world, worth over a billion USD This was, at that time, the biggest overseas takeover by an Indian electrical equipment manufacturer. This takeover helped to give the Havells brand access to over 20,000 dealers across Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa. The combined Havells-Sylvania generated over a $1 billion in revenue with more than 60% coming from international sales. Due to past mergers Havells’ portfolio includes many well-known brands like the Crabtree, Sylvania, Concord, Luminance, Linolite & SLI Lighting. In 2008 it became one of the first Indian CFL manufacturers to have adopted RoHS, European norms on restriction of hazardous substances in CFLs.

Incorporating smart <b>energy</b> <b>meters</b> along with smart grid could {{come a long way in}} conserving electricity apart from removing manual <b>energy</b> <b>meter</b> reading from the scene. Smart meters supply the required data for the smart grid which helps the grid in providing an automated response. The paper elucidates how smart meters help in digitally tackling the issue of energy conservation in the consumer end and the utility end...|$|R
