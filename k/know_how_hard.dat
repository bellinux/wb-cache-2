500|$|In {{the early}} months of 1950 Chance of a Lifetime was {{released}} into British cinemas; it was a film in which Jacques [...] "really made her mark", according to her biographer, Andy Merriman. Chance of a Lifetime is a social and industrial relations drama based in a plough factory whose manager cedes control to the workforce. Jacques played Alice, a welder: when she was offered her fee for 17 days filming, she replied [...] "I've done this job welding Bailey and Pontoon Bridges and I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it is. That's not enough money!" [...] and the offer was raised accordingly. The film critic Geoff Mayer considered that Jacques had [...] "the best scene in the film with her mock seductive dance in front of an angry [...] MacGinnis".|$|E
500|$|On 18 May 1968, Lennon {{summoned the}} other Beatles {{to a meeting}} at Apple Corps to {{announce}} {{that he was the}} living reincarnation of Jesus: [...] "I have something very important to tell you all. I am Jesus Christ. I'm back again." [...] The meeting was adjourned for lunch and Lennon never mentioned the subject again. In May 1969, Lennon and McCartney recorded [...] "The Ballad of John and Yoko", with Lennon singing the lines, [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy, You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it can be, The way things are going, They're gonna crucify me." [...] In a BBC interview a few months later, Lennon called himself [...] "One of Christ's biggest fans", talked about the Church of England, his vision of heaven, and unhappiness over being unable to marry Yoko Ono in church.|$|E
500|$|Most {{commentators}} blamed Take-Two's corporate governance; {{one analyst}} {{stated that the}} company's troubles were more [...] "company-specific than market-driven", and another declared company CEO Paul Eibeler to be the [...] "worst CEO of 2005", pointing to [...] "setbacks on the rollouts of newer games" [...] as evidence of his failure. Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda, and Todd Howard, Executive Producer for the game, gave an update about the delay on the weekend of November 6, 2005. They planned to give updates every subsequent weekend until the game's release. A commentator from Joystiq complained of the vagueness of the updates: [...] "they don't get any more specific than to say, 'There is work that {{still needs to be}} done'. In fact, they say this three times just to make sure we <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> they are working....While it's nice to see the development team taking time out to update the fans, if the announcements continue to be as vague as this one, I'd rather just see them spend the extra time on the actual game." ...|$|E

500|$|NBC {{executives}} {{tried to}} solve the problem so that both Leno and O'Brien would keep their jobs. Jeff Gaspin, the chairman of NBC Universal Television, instructed both parties that he did not wish to make a difficult decision but that the most appropriate solution was to move Leno back to his previous timeslot and push O'Brien to 12:05. Carter details a heated exchange between NBC executive Jeff Zucker and O'Brien's agent Rick Rosen during which Zucker told O'Brien's representatives he could enforce O'Brien's contract and [...] "ice him for two years", after details of the conflict were leaked to the media. The author cites O'Brien's disappointment with the perceived unfairness of the situation, and quotes O'Brien's comments at a meeting with NBC Entertainment and Universal Media Studios chairman Marc Graboff and Jeff Gaspin, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> I worked for this. It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in." [...] Carter recounts how affiliates of NBC complained to the network about the poor ratings performance of Leno's program The Jay Leno Show. O'Brien asked the two NBC executives, [...] "What does Jay have on you? What does this guy have on you people? What the hell is it about Jay?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was jointly written, composed, and {{produced}} by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis. Dennis and Davis {{had been brought}} together by British artist manager Simon Fuller, who wanted the duo {{to come up with}} a song for British pop group S Club 7. The song was recorded using Cubase music software, which Davis ran on his Mac computer. Davis began playing an acoustic guitar and ran a 125 beats per minute drum loop, on which Dennis, herself a singer who had enjoyed chart success in the United States, began singing the line [...] "I just can't get you out of my head" [...] in the key of D minor. After three and a half hours, the demo was recorded and the vocals were laid afterwards. Dennis called their recording setup for the song [...] "the most primitive set-up you could imagine! Different producers work in different ways. But it's good to be reminded you don’t have to be reliant on equipment. A song is about melody and lyrics and being able to take something away in your memory that is going to haunt you." [...] She also regarded their production as a [...] "very natural and fluid process," [...] saying: [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> we work sometimes to write songs and then spend months picking them to pieces, but this was the easiest process, the chemicals were all happy and working together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since modular {{arithmetic}} {{has such}} {{a wide range of}} applications, it is important to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it is to solve a system of congruences. A linear system of congruences can be solved in polynomial time with a form of Gaussian elimination, for details see linear congruence theorem. [...] Algorithms, such as Montgomery reduction, also exist to allow simple arithmetic operations, such as multiplication and exponentiation modulonbsp&, to be performed efficiently on large numbers.|$|E

6000|$|... "Forgive me, Skinny," [...] he said, softly. [...] "It hasn't {{been quite}} twenty years, and God alone <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> I {{have tried to}} be 'human' for Jane's sake, and yours, too, since He took my other Jane away." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> {{everyone}} in that locker room worked to get themselves {{in position to}} win that game today and for it to end like that, and {{for me to be}} the cause is very tough to swallow right now", Romo said after the game. [...] "I take responsibility for messing up at the end there. That's my fault. I cost the Dallas Cowboys a playoff win, and it's going to sit with me a long time. I don't know if I have ever felt this low." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cartoonist}} visited John Lennon and Yoko Ono {{at their}} 1969 Bed-In for Peace in Montreal, and their testy exchange later {{appeared in the}} documentary film [...] (1988). Introducing himself with the words [...] "I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?," [...] Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their [...] nude album cover: [...] "I think that everybody owes {{it to the world}} to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that I applaud you for it." [...] Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono ("Good God, you've gotta live with that?"), and is asked to [...] "get out" [...] by Derek Taylor. Lennon allowed him to stay however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his Ballad of John and Yoko song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy / You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify Capp! [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|News {{regarding}} Leno leaked via {{an obscure}} website, FTV Live, {{by the following}} morning, which set the Internet abuzz with rumors regarding both Leno and O'Brien's fates. Gaspin scheduled an immediate meeting with Ross and O'Brien {{as soon as they}} arrived, and although O'Brien had a hint of what was to come, explained the proposed changes. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> I worked for this", responded O'Brien. [...] "It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in." [...] Following the tense 15-minute meeting, O'Brien and Ross returned to the Tonight studio. TMZ reported on the story, and, according to Bill Carter in The War for Late Night, essentially reversed the rumor with a headline reading, [...] "NBC Shakeup; Jay Leno Comes Out on Top." [...] O'Brien called an emergency staff meeting and assured all that they had not been canceled and all would be fine. The TMZ story deeply bothered O'Brien ("the timing of the leak to TMZ—coming so soon after a story that Jay had been canceled—screamed of an attempt at diversionary action", wrote Carter), and he and Ross reasoned that they indeed were the last to be told of the changes.|$|E
