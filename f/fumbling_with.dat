500|$|The game {{received}} moderate praise in some German gaming magazines {{after its}} European release. In Video Games magazine the reviewer praised {{the game as}} being a good action-adventure game in the same style of The Legend of Zelda; {{he notes that the}} need to find hidden items and areas and the top-down perspective closely resemble the Nintendo classic. He appreciated the variety and extras in the game, the various strategies needed to fight bosses, its difficulty, and the well-done graphics. The reviewers from Power Play compared The Guardian Legend to The Legend of Zelda and Life Force. They praised the diverse gameplay and weapons, difficulty, and the mixture of action-adventure and shoot 'em up elements. They criticized the game for lacking battery-backed RAM to save player progress—one of the reviewers said that [...] "the wretched <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> the password had long ended"—as well as its lack of challenging puzzles and a high difficulty level in some of the shoot 'em up sections.|$|E
2500|$|McGee was {{returning}} to his boarding house on Sparks Street {{in the early morning}} hours of 7 April 1868. Smoking a cigar and <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> his key in the lock, he was greeted as the owner Mary Ann Trotter opened the door for him. At that moment, a muzzle flash erupted, and as a [...]32 calibre bullet tore through McGee's neck and through his jaw, knocking his dentures out, the politician fell back into the street.|$|E

2500|$|As an administrator, in his {{capacity}} as the chairman of the protest committee of the Greater New York Bridge Association (GNYBA), Kaplan was able to steer between extreme views of the Proprieties. An older group of players tended to regard the Proprieties as pious nonsense, believing that it was unrealistic to demand that players bid and play in tempo: problems arise that require time to consider. A younger group demanded that violations of the proprieties be made part of a player’s record. (Such violations can include, for example, <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> a doubleton on defense: a singleton would be played promptly, with no trace of indecision.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The LP is delicate. Any {{accidental}} <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> the stylus or dropping of {{the record}} onto a sharp corner can scratch the record permanently, creating a series of [...] "ticks" [...] and [...] "pops" [...] heard at each subsequent playback. Heavier accidents can cause the stylus {{to break through the}} groove wall as it plays, creating a permanent skip that will cause the stylus to either skip ahead to the next groove or skip back to the previous groove. A skip going to the previous groove is called a broken record; the same section of 1.8 seconds of LP (1.3s of 45rpm) music will repeat over and over until the stylus is lifted off the record. It is also possible to put a slight pressure on the headshell causing the stylus to stay in the desired groove, without having a playback break. This requires some skill, but is of great use when, for instance, digitizing a recording, as no information is skipped.|$|E
2500|$|In the 72nd Brigade, helmets {{were carried}} in {{protective}} satchels {{but in the}} 76th Brigade, helmets were removed before the attack and worn on the head, as recently advised. A large number of gas casualties occurred despite warnings and having been alerted for the attack; some groups received late warnings or underestimated the danger and a small number were caught asleep. The speed and concentration of the cloud meant that hesitation or <b>fumbling</b> <b>with</b> the mask resulted in poisoning. Most casualties occurred in the front line in trenches close to the German lines. Gas may have been strong enough to penetrate helmets in trenches nearest to the gas discharge, yet the 10th RWF had only [...] casualties, five casualties among engineers and five among trench mortar crews, compared with [...] in the 1st North Staffs and [...] the 8th Queen's in the 72nd Brigade. The 10th RWF had followed advice to keep the helmet ready and the gas blew sideways, missing the area further back. Casualty returns from battalions, field ambulances and casualty clearing stations, gave total gas casualties as [...] casualties in infantry battalions on the flanks and in reserve and among divisional and corps troops. The five battalions in the line (excluding machine-gun, R.E., tunnelling companies and trench mortar crews) had [...] casualties, [...] the total.|$|E
