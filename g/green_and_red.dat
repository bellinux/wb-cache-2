5|$|NigeriaSat-2, Nigeria's second satellite, {{was built}} as a {{high-resolution}} earth satellite by Surrey Space Technology Limited, a United Kingdom-based satellite technology company. It has 2.5-metre resolution panchromatic (very high resolution), 5-metre multispectral (high resolution, NIR red, <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> bands), and 32-metre multispectral (medium resolution, NIR red, <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> bands) antennas, with a ground receiving station in Abuja. The NigeriaSat-2 spacecraft alone was built {{at a cost of}} over £35 million. This satellite was launched into orbit from a military base in China.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth of}} the yellow, <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> tricolor {{occurred}} during a drive by other European republics to change their flags. One example that gave life {{to the idea of}} the tricolor was the French blue, white and red flag adopted after the French Revolution. The only tricolor that existed for Lithuania before the yellow, <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> flag was a green, white and red flag used to represent Lithuania Minor.|$|E
5|$|According to {{quantum chromodynamics}} (QCD), quarks possess a {{property}} called color charge. There are {{three types of}} color charge, arbitrarily labeled blue, <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>red.</b> Each of them is complemented by an anticolor – antiblue, antigreen, and antired. Every quark carries a color, while every antiquark carries an anticolor.|$|E
50|$|For {{many years}} the fleet livery was {{turquoise}} <b>and</b> <b>red.</b> From 1994 it {{was changed to}} the current white, two <b>greens</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> scheme. The Relaxaway Tours coaches were painted in a yellow and white livery.|$|R

25|$|The film's {{director}} of photography, Juan Ruiz Anchía, relied on low lighting and shadows with a blues, <b>greens,</b> <b>and</b> <b>reds</b> color scheme {{for the first}} part of the film. For the second half, he adhered to a monochromatic blue-grey color scheme.|$|R
5|$|Dysprosium iodide and {{dysprosium}} bromide {{are used}} in high-intensity metal-halide lamps. These compounds dissociate near the hot center of the lamp, releasing isolated dysprosium atoms. The latter re-emit light in the <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> part of the spectrum, thereby effectively producing bright light.|$|E
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. <b>Green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E
5|$|Plain arms {{also often}} {{function}} as a disguise for major characters. In the Chrétien de Troyes' Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, Lancelot bears plain red arms as a disguise. The hero of Cligès competes in a jousting tournament with plain black, <b>green,</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> arms on three successive days (Brault, 30).|$|E

5|$|The flag of Lithuania {{consists}} of a horizontal tricolor of yellow, <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red.</b> It was re-adopted on March 20, 1989, almost {{a year before the}} re-establishment of Lithuania's independence and almost three years before the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Denver is also {{famous for}} its {{dedication}} to New Mexican cuisine and the chile. It's {{best known for its}} <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> chile sauce, Colorado burrito, Southwest (Denver) omelette, breakfast burrito, chiles rellenos, and tamales. Denver is also well known for other types of food such as Rocky Mountain oysters, rainbow trout, and the Denver sandwich.|$|E
5|$|The {{matching}} rules {{can be described}} in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red)</b> to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E

The firewall has several updated features in this version. A Block Traffic button {{present in the}} {{main interface}} blocks all incoming and outgoing Internet traffic. Another new feature, the Visual Tracker, graphically maps attacks back to their origin. The firewall blocked all port scans conducted by CNET, stealthing each port.|$|E
5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the <b>Green</b> <b>and</b> <b>Red</b> Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E
5|$|Debates {{about the}} {{national}} flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colors, <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red,</b> were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates {{did not like the}} design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On April 19, 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag {{was supposed to be a}} tri-color (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate color, since the combination of yellow, <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the inter-war period.|$|E
50|$|The {{sanctuary}} and baptistery {{windows are}} predominantly deep blues, <b>greens</b> <b>and</b> <b>reds,</b> while the large Tree of Life west window, by Rein Slagmolen, {{at the opposite}} end of the building, uses cool blues at the base rising to warm golds at the top of the window.|$|R

5|$|Given the {{superficial}} {{similarities between the}} two flags, the Italian flag and the Mexican flag have been compared over time. However, the Italian tricolour actually uses lighter shades of <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> and the two have different aspect ratios; the Italian flag's aspect ratio is 2:3, while the Mexican flag's aspect ratio of 4:7 results in a more elongated rectangular shape. When Italy became a republic in 1946, the Mexican naval ensign was a plain tricolour; for this reason, on demand of the international naval authorities, Italy could not adopt a sole national flag similar to France as it wished.|$|E
5|$|The {{explanation}} for the <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> colours {{that make up the}} background field arose during the Estado Novo period, the nationalist authoritarian regime that held power from 1933 to 1974. It claims that the green represented the hope of the Portuguese people, while the red represented the blood of those who died serving the nation. Sources believe these noble meanings are far from the truth and are nothing more than propaganda, to provide an honourable justification to their choice.|$|E
5|$|Chariot {{racing in}} the Byzantine Empire also {{included}} the Roman racing clubs, which {{continued to play}} {{a prominent role in}} these public exhibitions. By this time, the Blues (Vénetoi) and the Greens (Prásinoi) had come to overshadow the other two factions of the Whites (Leukoí) and Reds (Roúsioi), while still maintaining the paired alliances, although these were now fixed as Blue and White vs. <b>Green</b> <b>and</b> <b>Red.</b> These circus factions were no longer the private businesses they were during the Roman Empire. Instead, the races began to be given regular, public funding, putting them under imperial control. Running the chariot races at public expense was probably a cost-cutting and labor-reducing measure, making it easier to channel the proper funds into the racing organizations. The Emperor himself belonged to one of the four factions, and supported the interests of either the Blues or the Greens.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{originally}} suggested the yellow, <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>red,</b> but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three colors were frequently used in folk weavings and traditional dress. At the Great Seimas of Vilnius of 1905, this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as {{the flag of the}} Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by Jonas Basanavičius, was not chosen for three reasons: the first was that as part of the drive for national identity, the Seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as Belarus, and Ukraine. The second issue was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with Marxist or Communist causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn.|$|E
