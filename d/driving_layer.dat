40|$|We {{study the}} motion of {{magnetic}} skyrmions in a nanowire induced by a spin-wave current J flowing out of a <b>driving</b> <b>layer</b> {{close to the edge}} of the wire. By applying micromagnetic simulation and an analysis of the effective Thiele equation, we find that the skyrmion trajectory is governed by an interplay of both forces due to the magnon current and the wire boundary. The skyrmion is attracted to the <b>driving</b> <b>layer</b> and is accelerated by the repulsive force due to the wire boundary. We consider both cases of a driving longitudinal and transverse to the nanowire, but a steady-state motion of the skyrmion is only obtained for a transverse magnon current. For the latter case, we find in the limit of low current densities J the velocity-current relation v ∼ J/α where v is the skyrmion velocity and α is the Gilbert damping. For large J in case of strong driving, the skyrmion is pushed into the <b>driving</b> <b>layer</b> resulting in a drop of the skyrmion velocity and, eventually, the destruction of the skyrmion.

40|$|We have {{computed}} a new grid {{of evolutionary}} subdwarf B star (sdB) models {{from the start}} of central He burning, taking into account atomic diffusion due to radiative levitation, gravitational settling, concentration diffusion, and thermal diffusion. We have computed the non-adiabatic pulsation properties of the models and present the predicted p-mode and g-mode instability strips. In previous studies of the sdB instability strips, artificial abundance enhancements of Fe and Ni were introduced in the pulsation <b>driving</b> <b>layers.</b> In our models, the abundance enhancements of Fe and Ni occur naturally, eradicating the need to use artificial enhancements. We find that the abundance increases of Fe and Ni were previously underestimated and show that the instability strip predicted by our simulations solves the so-called blue edge problem of the subdwarf B star g-mode instability strip. The hottest known g-mode pulsator, KIC 10139564, now resides well within the instability strip {even when only modes with low spherical degrees (l<= 2) are considered. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figures.

40|$|Received; {{accepted}} Aims. We {{examine a}} recently–proposed evolutionary scenario that {{could explain the}} existence of the low–mass, helium– enriched PG 1159 stars. We focus in particular on the study of the pulsational stability properties of the evolutionary models predicted by such scenario. Methods. We assess the overstability of pulsation g−modes of stellar models as evolution proceeds along the PG 1159 domain. Stellar models are extracted from the full evolution of a 1 -M ⊙ model star that experiences its first thermal pulse as a late thermal pulse (LTP) after leaving the AGB. The evolutionary stages corresponding to the born–again episode and the subsequent helium sub-flashes are taken into account in detail. Results. Under reasonable mass–loss rate assumptions, the evolutionary scenario reproduces the high helium abundances observed in some PG 1159 stars. We find that, despite the high helium abundance in the <b>driving</b> <b>layers,</b> there exists a narrow region in the log Teff−log g diagram for which the helium–enriched PG 1159 sequence exhibits unstable pulsation modes with periods in the range 500 to 1600 s.

40|$|We propose an {{outburst}} {{mechanism for the}} most luminous stars in our and other galaxies. These million solar luminosity stars, with masses (after earlier mass loss) of between 20 and maybe 70 solar masses, are pulsationally unstable for both radial and low-degree nonradial modes. Some of these modes are ``strange,`` meaning mostly that the pulsations are concentrated near the stellar surface and have very rapid growth rates in linear theory. The pulsation driving is by both the high iron line opacity (near 150, 000 K) and the helium opacity (near 30, 000 K) kappa effects. Periods range from 5 to 40 days. Depending on the composition, pulsations periodically produce luminosities above the Eddington limit for deep layers. The radiative luminosity creates an outward push that readily eases the very low gamma envelope to very large outburst radii. A key point is that a super-Eddington luminosity cannot be {{taken up by the}} sluggish convection rapidly enough to prevent an outward acceleration of much of the envelope. As the helium abundance in the envelope stellar material increases by ordinary wind mass loss and the luminous blue variable outbursts, the opacity in the deep pulsation <b>driving</b> <b>layers</b> decreases. This makes the current Eddington luminosity even higher so that pulsations can then no longer give radiative luminosities exceeding the limit. For the lower mass and luminosity luminous blue variables there is considerably less iron line opacity driving, and pulsations are almost all caused by the helium ionization kappa effect...|$|R

The fire module is a surface firebehavior model that is two-way coupled with the atmospheric model. Near-surface winds from the atmospheric model are interpolated to a finer fire grid and are used, with fuel properties and local terrain gradients, to determine the fire’s spread rate and direction. Fuel consumption releases sensible and latent heat fluxes into the atmospheric model’s lowest <b>layers,</b> <b>driving</b> boundary <b>layer</b> circulations.

Through the use of theoretical environmental vertical profiles, a suite of experiments using conditions typical of the daytime convective boundary layer was conducted in which these external parameters were varied around a control experiment.

We find a drastic increase of the photocurrent upon entering the frequency regime where impact ionization is possible. At large values of the Mott gap, where impact ionization is energetically not allowed, we observe a suppression of the current and a piling up of charge in the high-energy part of the upper Hubbard band.

Three characteristic oxidising peaks are found during dissolution of the copper deposit. Their charge contributions depend markedly on both thickness and the redox state of the polymer layers. The combined electrochemical, SEM and XPS studies allow to assign the different dissolution peaks to three types of copper deposits. The most negative peak is ascribed to macrodefects-induced deposition on polymer-free sites on the electrode surface. The middle peak should be connected to copper deposited in/on partially oxidised locations of the PAN coating. The most positive dissolution peak corresponds to copper incorporated in the polymer layer, prone to be dissolved only after <b>driving</b> the polymer <b>layer</b> in its oxidised state.

We used lasso regression to identify the dominant soil moisture <b>layers</b> <b>driving</b> daily variation in tree and grass water-use metrics while controlling for weather variables. We found clear rooting depth differences between grasses (shallow) and trees (deep) from the isotopic data, and these patterns were strongly supported by the water-use data, which showed that grasses and trees predominantly responded to soil moisture availability at 5 and 40 cm depth, respectively. Our results provide a rare example of mechanistic support for the resource partitioning hypothesis in savannas, with important implications for our understanding of tree-grass dynamics under altered precipitation regimes...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a Bayesian inference scheme for quantifying the active physiology of neuronal ensembles using local field recordings of synaptic potentials. This entails the inversion of a generative neural mass model of steady-state spectral activity. The inversion uses Expectation Maximization (EM) to furnish the posterior probability of key synaptic parameter and the marginal likelihood {{of the model}} itself. The neural mass model embeds prior knowledge pertaining to both the anatomical [synaptic, circuitry and plausible trajectories of neuronal dynamics. This model comprises a population of excitatory pyramidal cells, under local interneuron inhibition and <b>driving</b> excitation from <b>layer</b> IV stellate cells. Under quasi-stationary assumptions, the model can predict the spectral profile of local field potentials (LFP). This means model parameters can be optimised given real electrophysiological observations. The validity of inferences about synaptic parameters is demonstrated using simulated data and experimental recordings from the medial prefrontal cortex of control and isolation-reared Wistar rats. Specifically, we examined the maximum a posteriori estimates of parameters describing synaptic function {{in the two groups}} and tested predictions derived from concomitant microdialysis measures. The modelling of the LFP recordings revealed (i) a sensitization of post-synaptic excitatory responses, particularly marked in pyramidal cells, in the medial prefrontal cortex of socially isolated rats and (ii) increased neuronal adaptation. These inferences were consistent with predictions derived from experimental microdialysis measures of extracellular glutamate levels. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|While much {{of modern}} {{developmental}} biology has focussed upon molecularly defined cell populations, relatively little is understood about how clonal groups within these broad cell populations organise complex tissues. In this thesis, I explore the clonal {{architecture of the}} jaws and teeth, and of the dermal bones of the calvaria, revealing cryptic modules as novel developmental features in both. I combine Confetti multicolour genetic lineage labelling with novel analytical techniques in order to map clonal populations in 3 D and provide quantitative parameters for clonal expansions. Tooth identity within the mandible {{is thought to be}} encoded by the an initial proximodistal position within the branchial arch, which implies that cells do not undergo migration. I observe distal Hand 2 -Cre labelled cells in the proximal territory, which necessitates migration. These distal cells give rise to the mandible, alveolar bone and a small proportion of odontoblasts, while unlabelled proximal cells were found in the distal territory of the incisors in different proportions. The clonal composition of teeth and jaw bones is dissected by novel analysis of mixed cell populations. I find odontogenic and alveolar bone populations to share a common lineage, comprising a cryptic developmental unit distinct from the mandible, a feature that I can also verify in another transgenic for the upper jaw. I also find that the initial tooth composition radically changes in ontogenetic time. Starting from similar compositions of distal and proximal cells I find that in incisors the distal population expands while the proximal wanes, while in molars the opposite occurs. This is the first evidence for a temporally changing cell population structure underlying the well defined heterodonty between incisors and molars and allows a reinterpretation of early tooth specification events. The dermal bones of the calvaria are thought to grow in thickness by static osteoblasts depositing matrix appositionally and growth is supposed to occur exclusively at sutures. Whole calvaria single-cell clonal lineage analysis of cranial neural crest cells with Wnt 1 -Cre and Confetti labelling reveals an extensively dynamic program of invasive growth distributed throughout all parts of the dermal bone. Cryptic clonal modules grow laterally, with invasion through and into the bone primarily organised around the centres of these `patches'. The process of bone maturation is revealed to consist of a series of invasions between the three layers of the bone, with the innermost compacta <b>layer</b> <b>driving</b> initial thickness growth by invasion into the middle spongy layer, and the outermost (dermis-adjacent) compacta <b>layer</b> <b>driving</b> later growth. Conversely {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that the sutures are principal generative regions, as they do not share a common clonal lineage with adjacent bone. I also investigate muscle attachment regions and find that the same clones traverse tissue boundaries from bone into muscle connective tissues, thus a clonal model predicated on joint 'attachment point precursor cells' can now explain patterns of skeletomuscular connectivity previously found at the population level by my supervisor. A novel generative model of bone growth from cryptic clonal patch modules is proposed, allowing us for the first time to understand thickness growth and the evolutionary transition from a micromeric to a macromeric dermal bone condition, events first visible in crown gnathostomes (placoderms) ...|$|R
