40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>Erythema</b> exsudativum <b>multiforme</b> majus (EEMM) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) are severe {{cutaneous}} reaction patterns {{caused by}} infections or drug hypersensitivity. The {{mechanism by which}} widespread keratinocyte death is mediated by the immune system in EEMM/SJS are still to be elucidated. Here, we characterized the blister cells isolated from a patient with EEMM/SJS overlap and investigated its cause. METHODS Clinical classification of the cutaneous eruption was done according to the consensus definition of severe blistering skin reactions and histological analysis. Common infectious causes of EEMM were investigated using standard clinical techniques. T cell reactivity for potentially causative drugs was assessed by lymphocyte transformation tests (LTT). Lymphocytes isolated from blister fluid were analyzed for their expression of activation markers and cytotoxic molecules using flow cytometry. RESULTS The healthy 58 year-old woman suffered from mild respiratory tract infection and therefore started treatment with the secretolytic drug Ambroxol. One week later, she presented with large palmar and plantar blisters, painful mucosal erosions, and flat atypical target lesions and maculae on the trunc, thus showing the clinical picture of an EEMM/SJS overlap (Fig. 1). This diagnosis was supported by histology, where also eosinophils were found to infiltrate the upper dermis, thus pointing towards a cutaneous adverse drug reaction (cADR). Analysis of blister cells showed that they mainly consisted of CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells and a smaller population of NK cells. Both the CD 8 + T cells and the NK cells were highly activated and expressed Fas ligand and the cytotoxic molecule granulysin (Fig. 2). In addition, in comparison to NK cells from PBMC, NK cells in blister fluids strongly upregulated {{the expression of the}} skin-homing chemokine receptor CCR 4 (Fig 4). Surprisingly, the LTT performed on PBMCs in the acute phase was positive for Ambroxol (SI= 2. 9) whereas a LTT from a healthy but exposed individual did not show unspecific proliferation. Laboratory tests for common infectious causes of EEMM were negative (HSV- 1 /- 2, M. pneumoniae, Parvovirus B 19). However, 6 weeks later, specific proliferation to Ambroxol could no longer be observed in the LTT (Fig 4.) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{identify}} {{clinical and}} serological differences {{of patients with}} reactive arthritis after infection with Lancefield group A β-haemolytic streptococci (GAS), compared with non-group A—that is, group C or G streptococci (NGAS:GCS/GGS), {{and a group of}} culture negative or unidentified streptococci (GUS).  METHODS—A prospective study of consecutive patients with reactive arthritis after serologically or culture confirmed infection with β-haemolytic streptococci, presenting to the outpatient department of rheumatology from January 1992  until January 1998.  Alternative causes for reactive arthritis were excluded. Main outcome measures were clinical and serological characteristics including antistreptolysine-O (ASO) and antideoxyribonuclease-B (antiDNase-B) antibody titres.  RESULTS— 41 patients (female/male ratio 22 / 19; mean (SD) age 38  (13) years) with reactive arthritis were included. Culture of throat swab was positive in 13  cases (32 %) : 6  (15 %) GAS, 7  NGAS (17 %), that is, 5  (12 %) GCS, 2  (5 %) GGS. In 28  cases throat culture remained negative resulting in a group of unidentified streptococci; antibiotic pre-treatment had been given by the general practitioner in 18  cases (64 %). Arthritis was non-migratory, the number of arthritic joints in GAS and NGAS was similar, whereas in NGAS patients fewer joints were involved than in GUS: mean (SEM) 36  swollen joint index: 3. 3  (1. 0) in NGAS v 5. 6  (1. 0) in GUS (p< 0. 005); 28  swollen joint index: 2. 9  (1. 0) in NGAS v 4. 3  (0. 8) in GUS (p< 0. 05). Extra-articular manifestations—that is, <b>erythema</b> nodosum/ <b>multiforme,</b> AV conduction block or hepatitis—were observed after GAS or GUS infection, but not after NGAS infection. ASO and/or antiDNase-B rose significantly in all patients. The maximal titres for ASO and antiDNase-B in 41  PSRA patients were: mean (SEM) 1242  (232) U/l and 890  (100) U/l respectively; the maximal ASO titres were similar in the three groups: mean (SEM) 1125  (185) in GAS, 625  (160) in NGAS (GAS v NGAS: p= 0. 17), and 1430  (320) U/l in GUS (NGAS v GUS: p= 0. 10). AntiDNase-B titres were: mean (SEM) 1075  (180) in GAS, 375  (105) in NGAS (GAS v NGAS: p< 0. 01), and 995  (125) U/l in GUS (NGAS v GUS: p< 0. 005). ASO: antiDNase-B ratios were: mean (SEM) 0. 89  (0. 21) in GAS, 2. 60  (0. 76) in NGAS (GAS v NGAS: p< 0. 05), and 1. 43  (0. 28) in GUS (NGAS v GUS: p= 0. 12).  CONCLUSION—Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis occurs not infrequently. Differentiation of PSRA based on the causative streptococcal strain is frequently thwarted by negative throat cultures. Sometimes extra-articular manifestations are present that exclude NGAS as the causative organism. Serologically, lower antiDNase-B titres may be indicative for primary NGAS infection; the ASO/antiDNase-B ratio may be of additive value for differentiation in cases of a negative throat culture: the higher ASO/antiDNase-B ratios suggesting primary NGAS infection. In reactive arthritis, serological monitoring consisting of a simultaneous titration of antiDNase-B and ASO, seems to be of clinical importance to trace GAS induced cases, especially when throat cultures remain negative. ...|$|R
