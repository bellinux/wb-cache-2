5|$|The {{second part}} begins on November 3, 1966 with Guevara {{arriving}} in Bolivia {{disguised as a}} middle-aged representative of the Organization of American States hailing from Uruguay, who subsequently drives into the mountains to meet his men. The film is organized {{by the number of}} days {{that he was in the}} country. On Day 26, there is solidarity among Guevara's men despite his status as a foreigner. By Day 67, Guevara, however, has been set up for betrayal. He tries to recruit some peasants only to be mistaken for a cocaine smuggler, and the Bolivian Communist Party, led by Mario Monje, refuse to support the armed struggle. On Day 100, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> of food and Guevara exercises discipline to resolve conflicts between his Cuban and Bolivian followers.|$|E

25|$|Sector Principles. These are: (i) {{the river}} basin is the {{territorial}} unit {{for the implementation}} of the National Water Resources Policy; (ii) management of water resources should allow for multiple uses of water; (iii) water is a limited resource with economic value; (iv) the management of water resources should be decentralized and should involve participation by the government, the users, and the community; and (v) when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> of water, priority is given to human consumption and watering of animals.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> of academically {{qualified}} {{instructors to}} teach at schools of nursing worldwide. The serious need for educational capacity is not being met, which is the underlying most important preparation resource for the nurses of tomorrow. The decrease in faculty everywhere is due to many factors including decrease in satisfaction with the workforce, poor salaries, and reduction in full-time equivalent. Throughout the span of 6 years the nursing faculty shortage {{has been written about}} an increasing amount. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus or an organized plan on how to fix the ongoing issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{county has}} a mixed economy. An {{important}} part of the economy is based on tourism: many visitors are attracted by the many beaches and the mountains. A significant part of the county lies within the Snowdonia National Park, which extends from the north coast down to the district of Merioneth in the south; it is much larger than Snowdonia proper. But tourism provides seasonal employment and thus there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> of jobs in the winter. Another problem with tourism is the demand that it creates for second homes. This pushes house prices out of reach of local people, {{to the detriment of the}} position of the Welsh language in rural areas.|$|E

25|$|Market {{equilibrium}} occurs where {{quantity supplied}} equals quantity demanded, {{the intersection of}} the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.|$|E
25|$|Textbooks on the Nanai language, fairy tales, {{and artistic}} {{literature}} {{are used in}} Nanai language teaching. Sometimes teachers took the initiative to use oral folklore as well. However, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> of teaching and auxiliary materials, as well as difficulty in motivating students. Nanai language textbooks follow the model of Russian language textbooks aimed at native speakers, rather than emphasising instruction in the language itself, and in the theoretical/practical grammar. This model is not adequate for the situation of heritage language preservation. Moreover, the existing language teaching materials are oriented predominantly (or only) towards the development of reading habits; however, the number of publications in the Nanaian language does not exceed one-two ten, mostly collections of folklore or artistic works of the historical-biographical genre, publishing in limited print runs. Instruction in spoken language is not conducted sufficiently and is not reinforced by teaching aids.|$|E
25|$|Most {{carnivorous}} plants live in habitats {{with high}} light, waterlogged soils, and extremely low soil nitrogen and phosphorus, producing the ecological impetus to derive nitrogen from an alternate source. High light environments {{allowed for the}} trade off between photosynthetic leaves and prey capturing traps that are photosynthetically inefficient. To compensate for photosynthetically inefficient material, the nutrients obtained through carnivory would need to increase photosynthesis by investing in more leaf mass, i.e. growing. This means when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> of nutrients and enough light and water, prey capture and digestion has {{the greatest impact on}} photosynthetic gains, favoring the evolution of plant adaptations which allowed for more effective and efficient carnivory. Due to the large amount of energy and resources allocated to carnivorous adaptations. i.e. the production of lures, digestive enzymes, modified leaf structures, and the decreased rate of photosynthesis over total leaf area, some authors argue that carnivory is an evolutionary last resort when nitrogen and phosphorus are limited in an ecosystem.|$|E

25|$|Global {{economic}} change. Global {{economic change}} is one cause for illegal immigration because information and transportation technologies now foster internationalized production, distribution and consumption, and labor. This has encouraged many countries {{to open their}} economies to outside investment, then {{increasing the number of}} low-skilled workers participating in global labor markets and making low-skilled labor markets all more competitive. This and the fact that developed countries have shifted from manufacturing to knowledge-based economies, have realigned economic activity around the world. Labor has become more international as individuals immigrate seeking work, despite governmental attempts to control this migration. Because the United States education system creates relatively few people who either lack a high school diploma or who hold PhDs, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> of workers needed to fulfill seasonal low-skilled jobs as well as certain high-skilled jobs. To fill these gaps, the United States immigration system attempts to compensate for these shortages by providing for temporary immigration by farm workers and seasonal low-skilled workers, and for permanent immigration by high-skilled workers.|$|E
25|$|Older offspring, {{which are}} around two years old, may also live in {{families}} and help their parents. In addition to helping build food caches and repairing the dam, two-year-olds {{will also help}} in feeding, grooming and guarding younger offspring. Beavers also practice alloparental care, in which an older sibling may take over the parenting duties if the original parents die or are otherwise separated from them. This behavior is common and is seen in many other animal species, such as the elephant and fathead minnow. While these helping two-year-olds help increase the chance of survival for younger offspring, they are not essential for the family, and two-year-olds only stay and help their families if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> of resources in times of food shortage, high population density, or drought. When beavers leave their natal territories, they usually do not settle far. Beavers can recognize their kin by detecting differences in anal gland secretion composition using their keen sense of smell. Related beavers share more features in their anal gland secretion profile than unrelated beavers. Being able to recognize kin is important for beaver social behavior, and it causes more tolerant behavior among neighboring beavers.|$|E
500|$|Wooden Leg is an {{important}} original source {{of information on the}} Cheyenne and Plains Indians in general and on the Battle of the Little Big Horn in particular. [...] Many hundreds of books have been written about the Great Sioux War, its battles, and its characters. [...] A large number of these books have looked to Marquis to provide source material. [...] This is especially true of the Custer fight, where there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> of eyewitness accounts from the United States side.

500|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} uses {{cooperative}} breeding {{as a form}} of family insurance. The female regularly transfers her offspring to other females' nests—and likewise grooms and cares for offspring other than her own. While this can have a high physiological cost on a lactating female that is already expending a lot of energy, it can be beneficial overall to insuring survival among closely related groups with high mortality risk. [...] A study that took place over three breeding seasons showed that closely related females form breeding groups mainly when there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shortage</b> of suitable roosts; [...] when there is an advantage of a communal nest for defense, or when there are thermoregulatory benefits. In the event of offspring adoption, when a parent dies and a closely related female takes over care, it is believed that this is beneficial to groups with high mortality risk.|$|E
