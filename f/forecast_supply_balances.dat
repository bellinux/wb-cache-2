40|$|In this paper, a {{cross-section}} infrastructural and regulatory {{analysis of the}} European LNG sector is presented. The LNG chain is maintained as being a good tool to enlarge the number of natural gas exporters to Europe, adding in this way to competition and to {{the achievement of the}} targets of the liberalisation process, which is a decrease in price for final customers and security of supply. The main reason for this is to be identified in the minor specificity of the regasification-plant-related investment compared with pipeline transportation. As a matter of fact, as the infrastructural analysis will show, the construction of new LNG receiving terminals is likely to bring about {{an increase in the number}} of importers fostering competition among them and shrinking their margins among the value chain. In this context, regulation is meant to play a key role in promoting investments without hindering competition. Nevertheless it is questionable whether LNG will be able to introduce competition beyond the European border (that is among producers) according to the <b>forecasted</b> <b>supply</b> and demand <b>balance</b> that is leading to a seller's market in the upstream sector. In this case, a huger part of the rent would go to the exporters leaving minor scope for competition down the European border. ...|$|R

Cooperation, non-cooperation and predation are the main strategies of the two dominant players, namely OCP (Morocco) and Phosrock (USA) during the period 1960 - 2000. These strategies are analyzed by 'prisoner dilemma' and 'limit pricing' models. We consider a two-steps game within a duopoly according to Kreps-Scheinkman framework with Cournot and Bertrand duopoly hypothesis. The empirical results reveal the influence of stockpiles fluctuations and phosphate fertilizer price on the world phosphate rock prices. intersectoral relations, multipliers, labour qualifications, export promotion...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of three alternative models in <b>forecasting</b> housing <b>supply</b> in the Irish Republic. The results highlight key behavioural issues in the dy-namics of housing supply that the OLS and VAR models fail to adequately capture due to the inclusion of fundamental variables in their specification. The behaviour of developers in de-laying projects means that housing supply can often respond slowly to demand shocks. For this reason the OLS and VAR models substantially over-estimate housing supply during the period 1998 – 2001. In comparison the simple ARIMA model provides generally accurate <b>forecasts</b> of <b>supply.</b> KEY WORDS: Housing <b>supply,</b> <b>forecasting</b> accuracy, Republic of Irelan...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} how the Slovenian accession to European Union (EU) influenced the conditions on vegetable market in Slovenia. Slovenia remains the net importer of fresh vegetables. Annually, it imports larger quantities of vegetables than there are produced by agricultural holdings. The <b>supply</b> <b>balance</b> sheet for vegetables {{is the basis of}} an analysis of vegetable consumption on the level of entire country and allows the comparison with other countries. Data have shown that the degree of self-sufficiency varies a lot between years due to weather conditions. Although the conditions for vegetable growing in Slovenia are favourable, domestic production is too low to meet the domestic consumption. Many investigations have also shown that Slovenian people consume too small amounts of vegetables. This statement is supported by the <b>supply</b> <b>balance</b> sheet for vegetables. The human consumption per capita in Slovenia is gradually increasing, but it is still low in comparison with the EU countries...|$|R

The results are satisfactory and coherent with standard time series analysis but with much richer information about the market dynamic...|$|R

About 67 % milk it achieved in Germany, France, United Kingdom, Poland, Italy and Netherlands, which are the EU largest milk producers. The EU- 27 trade balance is a positive one, exports exceeding imports by 10, 448 thou tons milk. The main EU milk exporters are France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Denmark and Poland.
