5|$|The Tagora Présidence was {{a concept}} car {{designed}} by stylist Sunny Atri at the Talbot design studio in Whitley, Coventry. The concept {{was created to}} generate interest in employing high-end Tagoras as chauffeur-driven limousines by users such as business executives and government officials. The donor model for the Présidence was the 2.6 SX, which had an interior appointed with Connolly Leather upholstery and brass highlights, plus a host of electronics including a telephone, <b>dictaphone,</b> text-message receiver, and television with VCR. Originally valued at £25,000, the Présidence now resides at a car museum in Poissy.|$|E

25|$|Although {{apparently}} not tipped off by Nosovitsky himself, Amsterdam police authorities {{were well aware}} of the Comintern's secret gathering in the city, and bugged the conference room with a <b>dictaphone</b> machine—a device discovered by delegate Michael Borodin {{on the second day of}} the proceedings. A raid by the authorities soon followed, during which many delegates were arrested before being ordered to leave the country or physically deported. Fraina and Nosovitsky were not detained, but rather made their way to the home of Dutch radical S. J. Rutgers in Amersfoort, where several other delegates had assembled. They remained there a week before returning home to America.|$|E
25|$|The American Graphophone Company {{was founded}} {{by a group of}} investors mainly from the Washington D.C. area, {{including}} Edward Easton, a lawyer and Supreme Court reporter, who later assumed the presidency of the Columbia Graphophone Company. The Howe Machine Factory (for sewing machines) in Bridgeport, Connecticut, became American Graphophone's first manufacturing plant. Tainter resided there for several months to supervise manufacturing before becoming seriously ill, but later went on to continue his inventive work for many years, as health permitted. The small Bridgeport plant which in its early times was able to produce three or four machines daily later became, as a successor firm, the <b>Dictaphone</b> Corporation.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Middleton {{made the}} {{decision}} to release recordings of the telephone conversations Johnson made throughout his presidency. Although Johnson had stipulated that the recordings be sealed until 50 years after his death (the year 2023), Middleton consulted with the President's widow, Lady Bird Johnson, about releasing them sooner, and she said the decision was his to make. The conversations, most of which were recorded on a <b>Dictaphone</b> machine, cover a variety of issues, including foreign policy, the Vietnam War and peace negotiations, legislation, civil rights, the economy, politics, labor issues, appointments, and press relations. Consequently, 642 hours of secretly taped telephone conversations have been made available to the public, providing insight into Johnson's legislative skills and substantially elevating his standing among past presidents.|$|E

25|$|As enemy aliens, Frisch and Peierls were {{initially}} {{excluded from the}} Maud Committee, but the absurdity of this was soon recognised, and they were made members of its Technical Subcommittee. This {{did not mean that}} they were cleared for radar work. When Oliphant made the services of his secretary available for typing up the Peierl's and Frisch's papers for the Maud Committee in September 1940, they were not allowed to enter the Nuffield Building where she worked, so Peierls submitted them for typing by <b>dictaphone</b> on wax cylinders. Frisch and Peierls thought at first that uranium enrichment was best achieved though thermal diffusion, but as the difficulties with this approach became more apparent they switched to gaseous diffusion, bringing in a fellow refugee from Germany, Franz Simon, as an expert on the subject. Peierls also recruited yet another refugee from Germany, Klaus Fuchs, as his assistant in May 1941.|$|E
25|$|The others leave but {{a moment}} later Poirot suffers a small {{collapse}} and has Margot fetch back Dr. Sheppard. Poirot recovers quickly and, asking the doctor his opinion of the night’s events, is accused of playing a comedy. Poirot disagrees and confirms that he knows who the murderer is and for them {{there can be no}} escape. He takes the doctor through his thinking: The mysterious telephone call can only be judged from its result, which is that Sir Roger’s death was discovered that night instead of the next day. That means that the murderer wanted to be on the spot when the discovery was made, perhaps to retrieve something. The second puzzling fact was the armchair pulled out from its normal place in the study and that can only have been to have hidden something from sight at the moment that the room was broken into. As the <b>Dictaphone</b> is missing, it can only be that item which was there and, by use of a time-lock, the voice heard behind the door was not that of the living Sir Roger but a previously-made recording – the man was already dead. The murderer can only be someone who had a receptacle to carry away the machine and who had the study to himself for a moment after the discovery of the body – in other word’s, Dr. Sheppard himself.|$|E
25|$|Inspector Davies and Poirot meet back at Fernley. The call to Dr. Sheppard {{has been}} traced. It {{was made from}} the local railway station, {{a few minutes before}} the late-night express train for Liverpool left. He has also found out that the woman in the lodge house saw Ralph Paton enter the grounds at 9.25pm. The {{fingerprints}} on the dagger are yet to be tested but Poirot has a theory that they will find only the dead man's prints on the handle. The missing letter from Mrs Ferrars is also a puzzle and Poirot summons Parker and asks him to state what is different about the study compared to when he helped break in the previous evening. Parker tells him of the differences – including the fact that the armchair was pulled out from its normal position and turned at a strange angle, something that catches Poirot's attention. Raymond is questioned about any strangers seen in the past week – the only one he can recall was a young representative from a firm of <b>Dictaphone</b> manufacturers called Curtis and Trout – Sir Roger was considering buying one of their machines. Poirot reveals that he found a scrap of starched material in the summerhouse and theorises that it came from the dress of Bourne who is {{the only person in the}} house who has no alibi. Mr Hammond, the family solicitor, arrives and reveals that the dead man's will leaves the majority of Sir Roger's estate to Ralph – another motive for the murder. It is also revealed that cash to the sum of one hundred pounds is missing from Sir Roger's room. Ralph though remains the principle suspect and Poirot tells the assembled group that he knows they are all individually hiding something from him and that he means to find the truth.|$|E

50|$|Wallace narrated {{his words}} onto wax {{cylinders}} (the <b>dictaphones</b> of the day) and his secretaries typed up the text. This {{may be why}} {{he was able to}} work at such high speed and why his stories have narrative drive. Many of Wallace's critically successful books were dictated like this over two or three days, locked away with cartons of cigarettes and endless pots of sweet tea, often working pretty much uninterrupted in 72 hours. Most of his novels were serialised in segments but written in this way. The serialised stories that were instead written piecemeal have a distinctly different narrative energy, not sweeping up the reader on the story wave.|$|R

25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot {{has asked the}} {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph had been arrested in Liverpool. This forces Bourne {{to admit that she}} and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks them to sit down as he addresses them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However the time when the two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard behind the closed study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the <b>Dictaphone.</b> This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for the time is now useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide someone in a nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – {{who is one of the}} people in the room – must confess. They have until midday tomorrow and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|E

Richard Pinnell interviewed the pairing for The Wire magazine and {{wrote in a}} separate review: [...] "While Wall’s anger {{can be heard in}} the music, Rodgers’ spoken word parts are equally acerbic. He sounds constantly on edge, his voice slurs in places, growls in others and has a gruff bite to it that is only amplified by the cheap <b>dictaphones</b> used to record many of his parts. His words move between a bitterly spat-out stream of angry obscenity-ridden disgust and a carefully worked out and scripted sense of surrealism all wrapped up in a Beckettian verbal sensibility." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Tefifon is a German-developed and {{manufactured}} audio playback format that utilizes cartridges loaded with an endlessly looped reel of plastic tape (much like the later 4-track and 8-track magnetic audio tape cartridges) with grooves embossed on it, {{similar to the}} ones on a phonograph record. The grooves were embossed in a helical fashion across the width of the tape, much similar to <b>Dictaphone's</b> Dictabelt format, and are read with a stylus and amplified pickup in the player's transport. A Tefifon cartridge can hold up to four hours of music; therefore, most releases for the format are usually compilations of popular hits or dance music, operas and operettas. Tefifon players were not sold by television and radio dealers in Germany, but rather sold directly by special sales outlets affiliated with Tefi (the manufacturer of the format).|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} {{back in the}} summer of 1991. Skipper Hartley moved from the Computer Science and {{mathematics}} program at Emory University to a short-term position in a research laboratory in Naples, Italy. In Atlanta, Hartley and fellow guitarist Richie Edelson had planted the seeds of the 'Nut in the moist confines of a rehearsal cubicle. By the following January, they were working Atlanta clubs with a slow-morphing line-up that included Katie Walters singing timidly offstage and the notorious Elephants Gerald tweaking a battery of tape recorders and <b>Dictaphones,</b> a bricolage of gear that hardly suggested the sampler stylings that would become the band's trademark. Hartley's old bandmate Chris Collins was shipped in from Columbia, South Carolina, to play bass, and several drummers came and went. Toenut broke onto the Atlanta music scene and college radio rotations, and established a reputation of interesting and innovative music-making. The Point, a small music venue in Little Five Points, became their main stamping ground.|$|R

Pomerantz |publisher=Crown Publishing Group (Random House)}} [...] (The web page's interactive audio broadcast of the game uses Adobe Flash Player.) A copy of the radio broadcast of the game was only uncovered in 1988. WCAU's original game tape had been recorded over by one of its engineers, a standard practice in those days. However, a Philadelphian had recorded with a <b>Dictaphone</b> part of Campbell's coverage in the fourth quarter, but only the Warriors possessions. Two years later, a reel-to-reel tape of Campbell's entire fourth quarter call surfaced; Jim Trelease, then a college student at the University of Massachusetts, had recorded a 3am re-broadcast of {{the fourth quarter of}} the game. The NBA merged the reel-to-reel with the <b>Dictaphone</b> tape, which also included a short postgame show. German sports journalist Gunter Bork specified that the interruption resulting from Chamberlain's 100th point lasted for nine minutes, after which play continued.|$|E

Victor starts to warm to Alfred towards the end of his visit, but Alfred leaves early the next day after finding an unpleasant message about him that Victor had accidentally recorded on a <b>dictaphone.</b> He is not seen again, but keeps in touch with the Meldrews, as Victor is seen looking at some photographs Alfred had sent over in [...] "The Trial".|$|E
40|$|A live art and {{performance}} project, initially developed and presented as {{the culmination of}} research residencies awarded and supported by Iberescena (Spain), Wales Arts International (Wales), Brown University (Providence, USA) and PACT Zollverein (Essen, Germany), 'What if everything we know is wrong?' proposes and explores direct acts of representation - overt representation, devoid of metaphor, and without formal or technical assumptions. From its inception, the projects' outcomes have been conceived to be as direct and self-contained as possible, the transience and immediacy of the work being key to its proposition, its public manifestations requiring no technical support or infrastructure to be installed at site, and attempting to leave as little lasting physical impact on the location as possible. The work requiring simply an audience and an otherwise empty public space. Realised amongst unseated spectators - with only thirty pocket <b>dictaphones</b> containing fragments of specifically captured sound, chalk drawing, and polaroid images for reference - the work is defined and structured by the artists' attempt to reconstruct one place, from its collected fragments and details, within another place, where it wouldn?t otherwise be present...|$|R
40|$|The Olympus Optical Company of Japan {{was formed}} in 1919, with the {{introduction}} of the first generation single lens reflects camera, and soon after with the first microscope. Since that time, the organisation has developed and is now split into three main divisions: manufacturing and supplying cameras, microscopes and endoscopes. Other smaller specialist divisions exist suppling such products as <b>dictaphones.</b> Perhaps, rather surprisingly, the endoscope division is the largest part of the organisation. Through a world-wide organisation of four main business centers, Olympus Industrial, the name given to the industrial endoscope division, provides service and support to its customers. Each of the main business centers operates through agents and distributors. There are many different industries which gain the benefits of saved time and money provided by using endoscopes. To meet the needs of so many varied industries, {{there is a need to}} have a wide range of equipment. This includes light sources, to provide illumination, rigid borescopes, flexible fiberscopes, if views around corners are needed, and the new technology videoscopes.

40|$|Popularity {{of speech}} {{communication}} is rapidly increasing in various contexts such as conferencing systems, mobile/fixed electronic devices and laptops thus {{leading to a}} heightened demand for new services and improved speech quality. <b>Dictaphones</b> used for dictations usually have one microphone. Single microphone does not give enough degree of freedom to allow estimation of location of the source. Microphone array makes use of multiple microphones for spatial filtering suppressing the background noise. This report aims for speech enhancement utilizing the benefits inherited with microphone arrays to find direction of desired speaker and focus the listening beam in that direction. A comparison is made between Generalized Cross Correlation (GCC) methods for locating the source in real office environment. Beamforming is implemented to make the microphone array listen in the desired direction thus reducing the interference from other sources. Minimum Variance Distortion-less Response (MVDR) approach is shown to give better results compared to more simplistic techniques. Perceptual based Eigen filter incorporating human hearing models in subspace incorporated in the suppressor eliminates the residual noise. Objective system performance is evaluated by estimating Signal-to-Noise-Ratio improvement (SNRI), segmental SNR, signal degradation and noise suppression. Perpetual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) gives Mean Opinion Score for subjective evaluation. asim_zolo@yahoo. com, akbarali 45 @gmail. co...|$|R
