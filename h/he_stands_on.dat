5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cú Chulainn had rescued Derbforgaill, a Scandinavian princess, from being sacrificed to the Fomorians. She {{falls in love}} with him, and she and her handmaid come to Ireland in search of him {{in the form of a}} pair of swans. Cú Chulainn, not {{realising}} who she is, shoots her down with his sling, and then saves her life by sucking the stone from her side. Having tasted her blood, he cannot marry her, and gives her to his foster-son Lugaid Riab nDerg. Lugaid goes on to become High King of Ireland, but the Lia Fáil (stone of destiny), fails to cry out when <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> it, so Cú Chulainn splits it in two with his sword. When Derbforgaill is mutilated by the women of Ulster out of jealousy for her sexual desirability and dies of her wounds, Lugaid dies of grief, and Cú Chulainn avenges them by demolishing the house the women are inside, killing 150 of them.|$|E

[...] ACT UP/DC asked Mason to resign his post if he failed to meet their demands to restore access to cannabis. Brownies were served at the protest in honor of Rathbun, who had been arrested the month before and was now facing felony possession charges for distributing cannabis brownies to AIDS patients.

500|$|There {{was a scene}} {{cut from}} [...] "33" [...] where we saw Laura being given her copy of the photo along with a card that said it was taken {{on the roof of}} the capitol {{building}} on Aerilon during the attack. The photo was inspired by the famous shot of the fire-fighters raising the flag at Ground Zero that became iconic. I thought the Colonies would have their own version of this -- a snapshot taken in the moment that becomes a symbol of the day they can never forget and of all they had lost. The photo itself is of a soldier falling to his knees (possibly shot or simply overcome by emotion) as <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> the rooftop over looking the devastation of his city, while the Colonial flag waves at the edge of frame. The inscription below the photo on Laura's plaque reads, [...] "Lest We Forget" [...] in itself a reference to the inscription on the watch presented to John Wayne's character in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.|$|E

2500|$|... "A strange artistic production, full of odd imagery.... From a basic {{column of}} colored marble, about whose base disport three bronze amorini, one with wings and drunk, and another {{uplifting}} a wreath, rises an emaciated and strongly modelled bronze figure of an aged man, crowned with a bird's nest at whose edge two doves bill and coo. <b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> a base, bearing a woman's head and {{hand and a}} colossal frog. He holds in one hand a rose {{and in the other}} nothing. About the round base circle 18 heads, including those of the Saviour and the Virgin, and others, crowned and uncrowned, but nearly all grotesquely ugly. Inspired by the early art of the Chinese the work is a bitter satire on life, sardonic and rather horrible, if somewhat fascinating." ...|$|E
2500|$|These voices {{can emerge}} as {{accommodating}} or opposing dispositions and roles. [...] For example, a therapist’s voice of being pro-life while {{working with a}} client contemplating abortion—-the role of a therapist is thought to always be understanding and supportive, but this role can become conflicted by a therapist’s disposition or set of dispositions. This precisely illustrates Dasein's polyphonic (simultaneously composed of multiple voices) nature. Dasein's voice is constantly engaged in conversations with the voices of others, and these conversations mesh and mash into each other within each individual. The therapist’s voice of being pro-life is actively colliding with the patient’s voice to abort a pregnancy. Additionally, hearing {{the voice of the}} client adds to the ongoing private conversation the therapist has with himself as he continually re-evaluates where <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> the issue.|$|E
2500|$|From the 12th {{century the}} Resurrection itself begins to appear {{regularly}} in the West, with Christ shown emerging from what is normally shown as a Roman-style sarcophagus placed on the ground. Sometimes his torso is shown above {{the top edge of}} the sarcophagus, but more often <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> top of it, or places one foot on the edge. The slab has always been removed (by an angel, though they are rarely shown), and may lie {{to one side of the}} scene at a diagonal angle. The iconography showing Christ stepping out of a sarcophagus, and placing his foot on one of the sleeping soldiers is first found in English alabaster reliefs. [...] Like many aspects of Resurrection imagery, it may have drawn on medieval drama, which evolved complex traditions for dramatizing the event, including laments by the women at the tomb, and sub-plots involving the soldiers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tympanum}} is [...] wide at the base. It {{is made up}} {{of thirteen}} individual sections. The bottom row {{is made up of}} three plates located about [...] above the lintel. It is [...] deep and about [...] high. On {{the left side of the}} tympanum, it contains two rows of figures and on the right, three. The lower figures are nearly fully three-dimensional, while the upper figures are mostly carved in relief, with only the head and shoulders projecting out of the stone. Above these three plates, the remaining ten plates are arraigned in three rows. The bottom row is made up of four plates which rest on a [...] high base. The plates are high relief carvings, each about [...] deep and an average of about [...] high. The figures were all carved with a rock pick. In the center of the tympanum is the Archangel Michael. <b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> his platform which is projected forward from the rest of the figures. The entire tympanum represents Heaven and Hell in the Last Judgment.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{documents}} {{that support the}} fact that in this critical situation, Maria Feodorovna was involved in a planned coup d'état to depose her son from the throne in order to save the monarchy. The plan was reportedly for Maria to make a final ultimatum to the Tsar to banish Rasputin unless he wished for her to leave the capital, which would be the signal to unleash the coup. [...] Exactly how she planned to replace her son is unconfirmed, but two versions are available: first, that Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia would take power in her name, and that she herself would thereafter become ruling empress; the other version further claims that Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia would replace the Tsar with his son, the heir to the throne, Maria's grandson Alexey, upon which Maria and Paul Alexandrovich would share power as regents during his minority. Maria was asked to make her appeal to the Tsar after Empress Alexandra had asked the Tsar to dismiss minister Polianov. Initially, she refused to make the appeal, and her sister-in-law Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna stated to the French Ambassador: “It’s not want of courage or inclination that keeps her back. It's better that she don’t. She’s too outspoken and imperious. The moment she starts to lecture her son, her feelings run away with her; she sometimes says the exact opposite of what she should; she annoys and humiliates him. Then <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> his dignity and reminds his mother he is the emperor. They leave each other in a rage.” [...] Eventually, she was however convinced to make the appeal. Reportedly, Empress Alexandra was informed about the planned coup, and when Maria Feodorovna made the ultimatum to the Tsar, the empress convinced him to order his mother to leave the capital.|$|E
2500|$|The first sound {{adaptation}} of the play was in 1929; Sam Taylor's The Taming of the Shrew, starring Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks (the first sound {{adaptation of}} any Shakespeare play). This version was simultaneously shot as a silent film, and, depending on whether a given theatre was equipped to screen sound films, was released both as a [...] "talkie" [...] and a silent. Using only 500 lines from the original play, and a few lines from David Garrick's 1754 adaptation of Shrew, Catharine and Petruchio, the film is primarily known for how Pickford delivers Katherina's last speech. As she moves though the litany of reasons why a woman should obey her husband, she winks toward Bianca (Dorothea Jordan), unseen by Petruchio. Bianca smiles in silent communication with Katherina, thus acknowledging that Katherina has not been tamed at all. The film opens with a Punch and Judy puppet show which several critics have argued performs a similar function to the Christopher Sly Induction in the original play, but also works to instill a sense of false anticipation in the audience; the puppet show ends with Judy sinking lovingly into Punch's arms after he beats her. In the film, Katherina never sinks into Petruchio's arms. Indeed, Pickford's Katherina is much more resistant than in many stage versions; there is an extended scene of her wrecking Baptista's home, she only agrees to marry Petruchio when <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>on</b> her foot and her scream is taken by the priest as consent, when she falls in the mud {{on the way to}} Petruchio's house, he offers to help but she refuses, she rejects meat at the dinner table rather than being tempted by it. Most significantly, when Petruchio outlines his plan to tame her [...] "with kindness" [...] (4.1.195), which is usually a soliloquy, Katherina hears him. She then proceeds to 'out-tame' him; when he messes up the bed clothes, she overturns the entire mattress, sparking a game of one-upmanship which ends when she flings a stool at him and knocks him out. The conversation about the sun and moon, so often seen as a pivotal turning point in the taming is then delivered with a befuddled Petruchio apparently genuinely unsure whether he is looking at the sun or the moon, and a worried Katherina trying to placate him. This is immediately followed by her 'submission' speech, and her wink. Elizabeth Schafer believes this is a Katherina that has not been tamed; [...] "unlike Shakespeare's Katherina, Pickford's Katherina knows what Petruchio is trying to do in taming her and she responds to this tactically and successfully. Her surpassing of Petruchio's outrageous behaviour leaves him nonplussed and concussed." [...] However, Pickford herself was unhappy with the film, and with how Taylor had directed her. In her autobiography, she wrote she wanted to play Katherina as a ferocious woman, but Taylor told her [...] "We don't want any of that heavy stage drama; we want the old Pickford tricks." [...] Pickford said of her performance, [...] "Instead of being a forceful tiger-cat, I was a spitting little kitten." ...|$|E
