25|$|The bipolar {{junction}} transistor, {{unlike other}} transistors, {{is usually not}} a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of α and β in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the α of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector. The emitter is <b>heavily</b> <b>doped,</b> while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector–base junction breaks down. The collector–base junction is reverse biased in normal operation. The reason the emitter is <b>heavily</b> <b>doped</b> {{is to increase the}} emitter injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the emitter to those injected by the base. For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the emitter–base junction must come from the emitter.|$|E
25|$|Charge flow in a BJT {{is due to}} {{diffusion}} of charge carriers across a junction between two regions of different charge concentrations. The regions of a BJT are called emitter, collector, and base. A discrete transistor has three leads for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is <b>heavily</b> <b>doped</b> {{compared to the other}} two layers, whereas the majority charge carrier concentrations in base and collector layers are about the same. By design, most of the BJT collector current is due to the flow of charges injected from a high-concentration emitter into the base where they are minority carriers that diffuse toward the collector, and so BJTs are classified as minority-carrier devices.|$|E

We also report a significant shift of T/sub CR/, a crossover temperature separating two pinning regimes, toward higher temperatures with heavy Pb doping of Bi 2212 single crystals. On the other hand T/sub CR/ did not shift with Fe doping of Bi 2212 single crystals. It is argued that the temperature dependence of H/sub dis/(T) and the shift of T/sub CR/ in <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> Bi 2212 crystals {{was related to the}} enhanced c-axis conductivity caused by the Pb situated between the CuO/sub 2 / layers and imposing a 3 D characteristic on the vortex lattice...|$|R

2500|$|At {{very large}} reverse bias, beyond the {{peak inverse voltage}} or PIV, a process called reverse {{breakdown}} occurs that causes a large increase in current (i.e., {{a large number of}} electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p–n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The avalanche diode is deliberately designed for use in that manner. In the Zener diode, the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener diode contains a <b>heavily</b> <b>doped</b> p–n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is [...] "clamped" [...] to a known value (called the Zener voltage), and avalanche does not occur.

40|$|Magnetic {{hysteresis}} {{and magnetic}} relaxation measurements {{have been performed}} to study vortex pinning behaviour for Bi 2. iSr 1. 9 Ca 1. 0 (Cu 1 -yFey) 2 O 8 + δ single crystals with Fe concentration y = 0, 0. 005, 0. 016 and 0. 022 and for Bi(2 -x) PbxSr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 + δ single crystals with Pb content x = 0. 34. Here y = 0 is pure Bi 2212 single crystal. The main objective of this thesis was to study mechanisms for the dramatically improved vortex pinning behaviour in Bi 2212 single crystals with heavy Pb doping. It is argued that the strong vortex pinning behaviour in the <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> Bi 2212 single crystal came from improved c-axis conductivity i. e. {{a reduction in the}} resistivity anisotropy parameter. In <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> Bi 2212 single crystals, Pb resides between CuO 2 planes and thus reduces the anisotropy parameter significantly. Two microstructures such as Pb rich and Pb poor lamellar plates are also observed in <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> Bi 2212 single crystals. The Pb content in our crystal was relatively low. Therefore, these lamellar plates are not likely to dominate the vortex dynamics in our <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> Bi 2212 single crystal. However, no significant improvement in the vortex pinning behaviour has been observed in the Bi 2212 single crystals with Fe doping. In iron doped Bi 2212 single crystals, Fe substitutes Cu in the CuO 2 planes and does not decrease the anisotropy parameter. A comparative study of the temperature dependence of the field Hpeak(T), at which the second magnetization peak occurs in |M(H) |, is made for pure, Fe <b>doped</b> and <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> Bi 2212 single crystals. The second magnetization peak, persisting close to the critical temperature Tc is observed for <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> Bi 2212 single crystals. The second peak is not enhanced in Bi 2212 single crystals after Fe doping. Pure and Fe doped Bi 2212 single crystals have second peaks between temperatures 20 and 40 K. The peak field Hpeak for all the crystals is observed to decrease with increasing temperatures, T. Comparative studies are also made on the temperature dependence of fields Hmin(T) and Hinfl(T) where M(H) has a minimum {{between the first and second}} peaks at Hmin(T), and it has an inflection point on the low-field-side of the second peak at Hinfl(T). In pure and Fe doped Bi 2212 single crystals, a pronounced peak in the derivative |dM/dH| is observed corresponding to Hinfl(T), andHinfl(T) is independent of temperature T. We relate this peak to the field Hdis(T), an order-disorder field that separates a weakly elastically disordered vortex lattice from a plastically disordered vortex solid. A minimum in the normalized relaxation rate S (H) is observed at Hinfl, indicating two different flux-creep mechanisms above and below that field, and two different solid vortex phases. In <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> single Bi 2212 crystals, Hinfl(T) was observed to decrease with increasing T. However, in pure and Fe doped Bi 2212 single crystals, Hinfl(T) was observed to be temperature independent. It is concluded that the negative slope of Hinfl(T) in <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> Bi 2212 crystals is related to the enhanced c-axis conductivity caused by the Pb sitting between the CuO 2 layers and causing 3 D vortex lines, while in Fe doped Bi 2212 crystals the defects sit on the CuO 2 planes and thus do not enhance the coupling between pancake vortices. The field Hmin is observed to increase with temperature for pure and Fe doped Bi 2212 single crystals. However, in <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> Bi 2212 single crystals, Hmin is observed to decrease with T. An increase in the crossover temperature TCR, a temperature separating two different pinning regimes, has been observed with heavy Pb doping in Bi 2212 single crystals. Discussion on these pinning regimes is presented in section 5. 3. The increase of TCR may be interpreted as due to improved interlayer Josephson coupling of 2 D vortices in Bi 2212 crystal after heavy Pb <b>doping.</b> <b>Heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> crystal has TCR = 35 K for the field that is within the second peak in its magnetic hysteresis loop. The TCR in Fe doped crystal, however, did not change with Fe doping. For pure Bi 2212 and Fe doped Bi 2212 crystals, TCR = 19 K. The observed different results above or below TCR in the current-voltage curve and in the effective activation energy have also suggested the different pinning regimes. Comparative studies of the field dependence of the normalized critical current density, Jc|Jc 0 have also been made for pure, Fe <b>doped</b> and <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> Bi 2212 single crystals. Below 20 K, pure and <b>heavily</b> Pb <b>doped</b> crystals showed a weak field dependence of Jc|Jc 0 indicating strong vortex pinning behaviour.
