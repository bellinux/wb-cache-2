(See: K Foundation Burn a Million Quid). In an interview with Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo, Gimpo admitted to harbouring guilt about the million pounds burning; that if he'd burnt Whiteread's £40,000 the million pounds burning would never have happened. [...] "I should have burnt it. I had petrol all over the £40,000... We were due to wait until eleven o'clock until she came out, but {{we were told to}} wait another two minutes...

Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Joseph [...] "Red Dog" [...] Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. Their addictions had begun to affect their performances and matters seemed to only be getting worse, according to many involved. The clinic was deemed a [...] "joke" [...] and a [...] "nuthouse" [...] by Payne and Red Dog, and was later described {{as more of a}} psychiatric ward, as true rehabilitation clinics were several years away. All involved (including Duane) struggled to keep off the substance in the ensuing days. Despite this, Duane fueled the band's passion to get better and end their addictions: [...] "Duane was so happy and full of positive energy. He was always like that unless he was <b>just</b> <b>totally</b> wasted. He was the leader, the great soul, and he kept saying, 'We are on a mission and it's time for this thing to happen,'" [...] said Linda Oakley.

It's not something that you hear and you're like, 'That's not her,' but you also go, 'Is that her? I like that. It's new,' and that's what I wanted. I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started.

[...] The filmmakers [...] "decided to shoot all the 50s stuff first, and make the town look real beautiful and wonderful.

500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Born Again tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like [...] "hired help" [...] by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. [...] "When Ian Gillan took over {{that was the end of}} it for me", Butler later said. [...] "I thought it was just a joke and I <b>just</b> <b>totally</b> left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it." ...|$|E

Traveling through Memphis with his family in 1939 on the way to see a preacher in Dallas, he slipped off to look at Beale Street, at the time the heart of the city's music scene.

I mean, we were playing the same songs that eventually became big hits, like 'The Sweater Song' and 'Say It Ain't So,' and we'd play 'em out in the L.A. clubs would just be like, 'Go away.

500|$|The Open Door took 18 {{months to}} write. The new songs {{were written by}} Lee and Balsamo, who share credits for nine songs. Lee was the sole writer of [...] "Like You", [...] "Lithium" [...] and [...] "Good Enough", and co-wrote [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] with guitarist John LeCompt. The singer confessed that after Moody's {{departure}} she had nobody to hold her back {{in the writing process}} and that Balsamo was lifting her up and pushing her to do something she would not have done with Moody. Regarding this, Lee said, [...] "He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having fun with it for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm <b>just</b> <b>totally</b> in love with." [...] The singer further told The Sun, [...] " [...] got this sort of spooky, surreal element to his guitar writing [...] It’s really cool because it just works perfectly with what we do. He was really trying to create something so we were both discovering this new sound together and branching out [...] Writing with Terry was a unique experience in my life because I’ve never been able to just sit and write music with somebody and not be afraid of what they would say." [...] Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was [...] "really intense" [...] and that she came out [...] "feeling purified" [...] while her writing partner, Balsamo, lifted her [...] "to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities".

500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album seem {{to be based on}} the {{pressures}} of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include [...] "Not for You", [...] "Pry, To", [...] "Corduroy", [...] "Bugs", [...] "Satan's Bed", and [...] "Immortality". Vedder said, [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>totally</b> vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Not for You" [...] express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and [...] "how youth is being sold and exploited," [...] while Vedder said [...] "Corduroy" [...] is about [...] "one person's relationship with a million people." [...] In [...] "Pry, To" [...] the phrase [...] "P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me" [...] is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of [...] "Immortality" [...] may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about [...] "the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train." [...] The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of [...] "Immortality" [...] were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said regarding [...] "Nothingman" [...] that [...] "if you love someone and they love you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing." [...] "Better Man" [...] is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote [...] "Better Man" [...] when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio. Considered a [...] "blatantly great pop song" [...] by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.|$|E

At his advice, Strub began learning to play bass guitar. Gary Chester took botany classes with Strub and was offered to join the duo. The band was named as such after Buron created a character named Ed Hall in a game of Exquisite Corpse. [...] "John thought Ed Hall was a great name because it was totally opposite of the Butthole Surfers, Scratch Acid, or the Dead Kennedys," [...] explains Chester.

In 1995 Justice Argyle reiterated allegations about Dennis in The Spectator magazine. As this was outside court privilege, Dennis was able to successfully sue the magazine, which agreed to pay £10,000 to charity. Dennis refrained from suing Argyle personally: [...] "Oh, I don't want {{to make him a}} martyr of the Right: there's no glory to be had in suing an 80-year-old man and taking his house away from him.

Over the last two games, Johnson closed out the series by averaging 33.5 points and a dozen assists as the Suns won both Game Four and Game Five, with K.J. vastly outplaying Magic Johnson {{in the fourth quarter}} of both contests.
