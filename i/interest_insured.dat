40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to compare the rules on causation and incidence of loss from a hull insurance perspective in the Nordic countries. As a consequence of there being underlying differences in how these questions are resolved, it therefore results in an interesting comparison. In addition, {{in light of the}} proposal of a common Marine Insurance Plan for the entire Nordic market a comparison is relevant for the same reasons. In the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan the scope of the insurers liability when covered and uncovered perils have contributed to a loss is based on an apportionment principle, cf. § NMIP 2 - 13. This solution is unique in relation to the corresponding rules in the Nordic Countries, which operate with the dominant cause principle. However, the NMIP was used as a prototype to the revision of the Finnish Marine Hull Conditions (FHC) in the year of 2001. As a result, today the FHC has a corresponding rule of apportionment. Nevertheless, an exception is made to the apportionment principle when the loss is attributed to a combination of marine and war perils. In this case the starting point is the dominant cause principle as well. Another question related to causation arises in cases where a loss is caused by a peril that {{can be traced back to}} a previous insurance period. According to the NMIP § 2 - 11 first subparagraph the liability of the insurer is triggered when the <b>interest</b> <b>insured</b> is struck by an insured peril during the insurance period. The starting point is thus a peril has struck principle which is a different point of departure to the damage principle which the remaining Nordic countries operate with. The approach to the question of causation and incidences of loss differ within the Nordic countries. These differences may provide implications both in changing between the insurance conditions and with an implementation of a common Nordic Marine Insurance Plan. The question to be answered is what the differences really are, their impact and which solution would be best suited for the whole common Nordic marine insurance market. Although an all comprehensive comparison between the Nordic rules of marine insurance would be both interesting and relevant at time, the aim of this work will be limited to compare and analyse the selected sections from a hull insurance perspective. Focus is foremost put on a comparison between the relevant Swedish and Norwegian rules...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the long run}} interaction among deposit insurance, bank deposit rates and capital adequacy requirements. Using analysis similar to the price discrimination model of Lott and Roberts (1991) we find that a competitive environment among banks would link the spread between insured and uninsured deposit rates {{to the size of}} the insurance premium. We also find that banks that choose to operate at the regulatory minimum capital level, would increase asset risk with increased capital requirements if (1) the implicit <b>interest</b> paid to <b>insured</b> and uninsured depositors is equally sensitive to changes in risk and capital adequacy and (2) the insurance premium is independent of the level of risk and capital adequacy. Under the present risk-based premium structure, asset risk has the potential to decline when the regulatory agency raises capital requirements. Finally, we examine the time series behavior of <b>insured</b> and uninsured <b>interest</b> rates to see if it is consistent with our theoretical model. We find that insured and uninsured rates, along with deposit insurance premiums, are cointegrated series as suggested by our model. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1997. ...|$|R

Newfoundland children's literature was defined as being those books written by Newfoundlanders, published in Newfoundland (excluding books whose rights were purchased from the international market), or containing a significant Newfoundland theme. Anthologies and books written solely for informational purposes have been excluded. Eighty titles were located through searches of the catalogues of the Curriculum Materials Centre in the Faculty of Education at Memorial University of Newfoundland, the Newfoundland Room of the Queen Elizabeth II Library at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the Newfoundland Public Libraries; and examination of available publishers' catalogues, a number of standard reference and bibliographic aids, and two published annotated bibliographies of Newfoundland materials.

State law mandates that a {{life insurance policy}} owner must have an insurable <b>interest</b> in the <b>insured</b> {{at the time of}} purchase.

The Institute Builder’s Risk Clauses (ILU clauses), the People’s Insurance Company of China Builder’s risk insurance clauses (PICC clauses) and the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan of 1996 (NMIP clauses) are the main regulations governing builder’s risk insurance in UK, China and Norway.

Development of marine insurance relating to the implementation of the transport or shipping is done through a sea full of marine hazards. In a sense, marine insurance is not just limited to the marine environment only, but will also include terrestrial environments and inland waters (rivers and lakes). The author uses the methods of normative research that focuses on secondary data or literature data as a primary source. From the results of research already done so authors can be concluded that the legal basis of insurance contained in the Book of Acts - Act trademark law (Commercial code), Act - Act 2 of 1992 concerning insurance undertakings.

In AB 04 there is an insurance requirement that stipulates that the contractor shall take all risks and liability insurance for the contract where the client must be co-insured. Construction law is almost exclusively regulated by the various standard contracts, one of those is AB 04. The Construction Contracts Committe is an organization that has published the standard contracts in this area of law and also the advice and instructions to help the parties to understand the agreements. The insurance requirement occurs in an area of law that is complex and the meaning of the concept is not entirely clear, nor which of the parties’ interests and responsibilities that are covered by the types of insurances that are provided by the insurance requirement. This can create problems for the contractor and his client because the possibility exists that neither party knows what protection, or the extent of that protection, that the insurance obligation provides for the contract. The essay investigates the meaning and consequence of the insurance obligation by discussing how the insurance obligation is portrayed by the literature that is published in this field of law.
