5|$|On the April 11, 2011 {{episode of}} Raw, Edge gave an {{emotional}} speech about {{his career and}} the realities of wrestling. He said he took further tests to his basic-strength tests, and an MRI result forced him to retire. Leading up to this announcement, he had reflected upon his previous neck injury and cervical vertebral fusion, and felt numbness in his arms. This was diagnosed as cervical spinal stenosis, and doctors would not clear him to compete, for risk of neck-down paralysis or even death should he take a hard enough fall. Later that same week on the April 15 episode of SmackDown, Edge officially relinquished the World Heavyweight Championship, retiring as the World Champion {{in the process of}} recapping his announcement and expressing gratitude over this <b>happening</b> <b>now</b> rather than it being too late.|$|E
5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's <b>happening</b> <b>now.</b> We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E

25|$|Craig {{examines}} arguments {{aimed at}} showing either that God is timeless or omnitemporal. He defends the coherence of a timeless and personal being, but {{says that the}} arguments for divine timelessness are unsound or inconclusive. By contrast, he gives two {{arguments in favor of}} divine temporality. First, he says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his real relations to that world, God cannot remain untouched by its temporality. Craig says that given God's changing relations with the world he must change at least extrinsically, which is sufficient for his existing temporally. Second, Craig says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his omniscience, God must know tensed facts about the world, such as what is <b>happening</b> <b>now,</b> which Craig argues is sufficient for his being temporally located. Craig argues that, since a temporal world does exist, it follows that God exists in time.|$|E

500|$|Cultura Profética {{originally}} {{began as}} a cover band, performing popular reggae songs in small bars and clubs before beginning to perform original music in Spanish. Shortly after transitioning to perform original music, the group adopted the name Cultura Profética, which {{was inspired by the}} view that [...] "music is a voice of culture and is prophetic because the reggae music that we love, and that influenced us, is from the '70s with themes of what's <b>happening</b> <b>now</b> that can affect our future", according to guitarist/bassist Omar Silva.|$|E
500|$|The {{most notable}} {{aspect of his}} songwriting {{involved}} {{the wide range of}} genres that he used, which included, among other styles, rockabilly, progressive rock, heavy metal, gospel and disco. As he explained in a 1986 interview, [...] "I hate doing the same thing again and again and again. I like to see what's <b>happening</b> <b>now</b> in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things." [...] Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] is acyclic in structure and comprises dozens of chords. He also wrote six songs from Queen II which deal with multiple key changes and complex material. [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Despite the fact that Mercury often wrote very intricate harmonies, he also claimed that he could barely read music. He wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of different key signatures.|$|E
500|$|On the season's {{potential}} for crossover {{with the rest}} of the MCU, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "I think [...] year worked really well—we got to be our own show and tell our own stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and do a nice hand off or a tie-in, but neither are incumbent upon the other to be a follow, and I think that's a great model for us. Ant-Man comes out this summer and will have come and gone before we air again in September, so whether there's anything vestigial from that or for [...] next season is to be determined. But we're in contact with the movie people and them with us, and any time we can put little easter eggs in, it's a lot of fun for die-hard fans." [...] Bell also stated that there was a possibility of Hayley Atwell once again reprising her role as Peggy Carter in the season for an Agent Carter crossover, and after the series acknowledged the character's death in Civil War, added, [...] "Any time we can make a connection to her, whether in a flashback or dealing with what’s <b>happening</b> <b>now,</b> it makes the universe smaller." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. and it sounds like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to when I was growing up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day. And the same thing is <b>happening</b> <b>now,</b> where there’s all this stuff that feels like the soundtrack to 'Friends' or 'The Wizards of Waverly Place.'” ...|$|E
500|$|According to Nancy Keefe Rhodes of Stone Canoe, a U.S. {{literary}} journal, the film's {{audiences are}} likely to have the preconception that human trafficking is not slavery in the same sense that the Atlantic slave trade was, and many people believe that slavery was abolished a long time ago with such instruments as the U.S. Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment. Rhodes writes that society now uses the word [...] "slavery" [...] in modern contexts only as a metaphor, so that references to actual contemporary slavery can be dismissed as hyperbole, and she describes the film's goal as to [...] "reclaim the original term [...] and convince us that what is <b>happening</b> <b>now</b> is what happened then: highly organized and pervasive, intentional, highly profitable and... fully as coercive and wantonly cruel." [...] Rhodes says that the word [...] "slavery" [...] has started to be used in its original sense again in recent years, but that audiences' views on contemporary slavery are nonetheless influenced by the slave-like imagery in such films as Hustle & Flow (2005) and Black Snake Moan (2007). The Academy Award-winning Hustle & Flow portrays a pimp as the hero, while Black Snake Moan features Christina Ricci as a young nymphomaniac; the marketing for Black Snake Moan centered on evocative, sexualized slave imagery, including a scantily-clad Ricci in chains. According to Rhodes, Bilheimer [...] "rescue modern slaves from representation as exotic creatures, to restore their humanity" [...] and allow audiences to relate to them. For this purpose, Bilheimer tells stories of individuals {{in the context of their}} communities and families. While Bilheimer had previously done extensive social justice work with religious organizations, he did not proselytize in the film, despite the many opportunities the film afforded him to do so.|$|E

2500|$|To {{honor the}} anniversary, several storylines were {{introduced}} that harkened back to historic periods in the series.

2500|$|According to Guyer, {{the first}} line says that once {{the speaker of the}} sonnets is dead there should be no {{mourning}}, but it is phrased {{in such a way that}} says the mourning is <b>happening</b> <b>now,</b> at a point in life and living. Guyer's interpretation focuses heavily on time and the importance of that time used for mourning. In the line there is a limit of time being set aside for mourning, only in life, but after life has ended the mourning must stop. The line ends in dead, finality, giving the false sense that the sentence is over and yet it continues through to the second line. The second line gives the brief time between life and the sound of the bell to mourn and it seems to contradict {{the first line}}. The sonnet seems to be firmly against mourning after death, but really it is for mourning the dead but only in a timely manner. [...] "The sonnet's first-person subject demands that mourning—even if it lasts only for one minute or one day—coincides with, rather than succeed, the death knell that will [...] "Give warning to the world that I am fled." ...|$|E
