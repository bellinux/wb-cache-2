5|$|In the Gibraltar Range National Park, it is a {{dominant}} shrub of open <b>heathland</b> and a non-dominant shrub of closed heath, mostly found in swampy heath associated with sedges. Plants here have {{some degree of}} self-compatibility. In the Sydney region, it grows in association with heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), old man banksia (B.serrata), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), lance-leaved geebung (Persoonia lanceolata) and dwarf apple (Angophora hispida) in <b>heathland,</b> and with silvertop ash (Eucalyptus sieberi), Blue Mountains ash (E.oreades), Sydney peppermint (E.piperita), scribbly gum (E.haemastoma), Blue Mountains mallee ash (E.stricta), brittle gum (E.mannifera), snow gum (E.pauciflora) and red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera) in forested areas.|$|E

5|$|The natural {{environment}} of Poole is characterised by lowland <b>heathland</b> {{to the north}} and wooded chines and coastline to the south. The <b>heathland</b> habitat supports the six native British reptile species and provides a home for a range of dragonflies and rare birds. Development has destroyed much of the heath but scattered fragments remain to the north of Poole and have been designated Special Protection Areas. The town lies on unresistant beds of Eocene clays (mainly London Clay and Gault Clay), sands and gravels. The River Frome runs through this weak rock, and its many tributaries have carved out a wide estuary. At the mouth of the estuary sand spits have been deposited, enclosing the estuary to create Poole Harbour.|$|E

5|$|Although Exmoor {{witnessed}} {{the construction of}} a large number of monuments during the Bronze Age, only two stone circles survive in this area, the other being Porlock Stone Circle. The Withypool ring is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of <b>heathland.</b> In diameter it measures 36.4 metres (119 feet, 6 inches) across. Around thirty small gritstones remain as part of the circle, which may originally have held around one hundred; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western ends of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and subsequently surveyed by the archaeologist Harold St George Gray in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Before it {{was founded}} in 1810 by Lewis Tregonwell, the area was a deserted <b>heathland</b> {{occasionally}} visited by fishermen and smugglers. Initially marketed as a health resort, the town received a boost when it appeared in Augustus Granville's 1841 book, The Spas of England. Bournemouth's growth truly accelerated {{with the arrival of the}} railway and it became a recognised town in 1870. Historically part of Hampshire, it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974. Since 1997, the town has been administered by a unitary authority, meaning it is independent of Dorset County Council, although it remains part of that ceremonial county. The local council is Bournemouth Borough Council.|$|E

5|$|In the past, Exmoors {{were used}} as pit ponies. Ponies not kept in semi-feral {{conditions}} are used {{for a variety of}} activities including showing, long-distance riding, driving, and agility. Exmoor ponies won both divisions at the International Horse Agility Championships in 2011, and took a third title at the 2012 Championships. The breed's hardiness makes it suitable for conservation grazing, and it contributes to the management of many <b>heathland,</b> chalk grassland and other natural pasture habitats, {{as well as to the}} conservation of Exmoor itself.|$|E
5|$|Isopogon anethifolius, {{commonly}} known as narrowleaf- or narrow-leafed drumsticks, is a shrub in the family Proteaceae. The species is found only in coastal areas near Sydney, Australia, and to the immediate west. It occurs naturally in woodland, open forest and <b>heathland</b> on sandstone soils. An upright shrub, it can reach to 3m (10ft) in height, with terete leaves that are divided and narrow. The yellow flowers appear from September to December and are prominently displayed. They are followed by round grey cones, which give the plant its common name of drumsticks. The small hairy seeds {{are found in the}} old flower parts.|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa, {{commonly}} known as mountain devil, is a shrub of the family Proteaceae, endemic to New South Wales, Australia. First described in 1798 by English botanist James Edward Smith, it is the type species of the small genus Lambertia. It is generally found in <b>heathland</b> or open forest, growing in sandstone-based soils. It grows as a multistemmed shrub to around 2m (7ft) with a woody base known as a lignotuber, from which it regrows after bushfire. It has stiff narrow leaves, and the pink to red flowerheads, made up of seven individual tubular flowers, generally appear in spring and summer. It gains its common name from the horned woody follicles, which were used to make small devil-figures.|$|E

40|$|Bumblebees are the {{predominant}} wild pollinators for many plant species in temperate regions. A bumblebee colony requires pollen and nectar throughout its lifetime, but degraded and fragmented habitats may have {{gaps in the}} temporal and spatial continuity of floral resources. <b>Heathlands</b> are open biotopes that provide favourable habitat for bumblebees like Bombus jonellus, a declining species in Belgium. In <b>heathlands,</b> ericaceous species are the main plants that provide pollen and nectar for bumblebees. Although the nectar composition of ericaceous species has been previously studied, data on pollen composition remain scarce. We examined bumblebee diets (composition of their pollen loads) in Belgian <b>heathlands</b> {{over the course of}} a colony lifetime to assess the fidelity of bumblebees for ericaceous species. We compared nutritional values by investigating the chemical composition (amino acids, polypeptides and sterols) of the pollen of the ericaceous and dominant non-ericaceous species present in pollen loads. No relationship was detected between the abundance of a particular plant species in bumblebee loads and its pollen composition. The successive flowering periods and the nutritional quality of pollen of ericaceous species offer valuable resources for bumblebees. Ericaceous species represent a large part of bumblebee diets in <b>heathlands,</b> especially in early spring and late summer when the diversity of other flowering species was low. Bumblebee pollen loads also contained non-ericaceous flowering species that grow outside <b>heathlands.</b> Thus, land planning must incorporate conservation strategies for the different elements of the landscape matrix, including <b>heathlands,</b> peatlands, meadows and margins. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society.

5|$|The flower {{spikes of}} B. paludosa {{are unable to}} self-pollinate and require pollinators to set seed. A 1988 isozyme study showed very high rates of outcrossing; pollen from one plant is well-mixed among other plants in the locale. Nonflying mammals are {{important}} pollinators in <b>heathland</b> habitat, with the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii) a frequent visitor to flower spikes. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) is another mammal pollinator. Bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-eared honeyeater (L. leucotis), crescent honeyeater (Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera), New Holland honeyeater (P.novaehollandiae), and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the European honey bee and ants.|$|E
5|$|The grasslands, <b>heathland,</b> {{meadows and}} mire support {{extensive}} populations of birds such as barn owls (Tyto alba) and nightjar, with butterflies including marbled white (Melanargia galathea), green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and the gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus). The flora includes the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), corky fruited water dropwort (pimpinelloides), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), heather (Calluna vulgaris), lousewort (Pedicularis) and birds foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The hedgerows and woodlands {{are made up}} of ash, hazel (Corylus), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) which support populations of dormouse (Gliridae), common lizards, siskin, stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and the purple hairstreak butterfly (Neozephyrus quercus). The rivers and streams are home to kingfisher, otter and the Daubenton's bat.|$|E
5|$|Associated {{species in}} the Sydney region include <b>heathland</b> species such as heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), coral heath (Epacris microphylla) and {{mountain}} devil (Lambertia formosa), and tick bush (Kunzea ambigua) and prickly-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca nodosa) in taller scrub, and under trees such as scribbly gum (Eucalyptus sclerophylla) and narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) in woodland. The Agnes Banks Woodland in western Sydney has been recognised by the New South Wales Government as an Endangered Ecological Community. Here B.oblongifolia is an understory plant in low open woodland, with scribbly gum, narrow-leaved apple and old man banksia (B.serrata) as canopy trees, and wallum banksia (B.aemula), variable smoke-bush (Conospermum taxifolium), wedding bush (Ricinocarpos pinifolius), showy parrot-pea (Dillwynia sericea) and nodding geebung (Persoonia nutans) as other understory species.|$|E
