2500|$|The {{well-known}} later playback singer, Lata Mangeshkar, {{started to}} sing when Begum {{was at the}} peak of her career, and Begum's break after her husband's death boosted Mangeshkar's career, helping her to be offered high-quality songs. In the early careers of Mangeshkar, as well as her younger sister, Asha Bhosle, between 1944 and 1956, they had often been asked by producers and music directors to imitate Begum's style of singing, because producers could not afford Begum's fees. In their first song together, Mangeshkar {{was a part of the}} chorus while Begum was the main singer. Many of the songs sung by Lata like Ayega Ayega have been sung in Shamshad Begum style. Even Asha Bhosle's songs like her first duet with Kishore â€“ Aati Hai Yaad Humko from 1948 film Muqaddar bear direct resemblance to Shamshad Begum style. From 1949 to 1960, beginning with the song [...] "Dar Na Mohabbat Karle" [...] from Andaz (1949), Mangeshkar and Begum have sung many duets together, with the most famous being [...] "Pyar Ke Jahan Ki" [...] from the 1949 film Patanga, [...] "Bachpan Ke Din" [...] from 1951's Deedar; their last song together was Mughal-e-Azams song [...] "Teri Mehfil Mein Qismat" [...] in 1960. Begum has sung songs together with Mangeshkar and Bhosle, including [...] "Mubarak Ho Woh Dil Jisko" [...] from Benazir 1964 [...] It was the period between 1958 and 1963, that career of Lata got major boost as music directors started gradually preferring <b>her</b> <b>soft</b> voice, until then Geeta Dutt and Begum were the most preferred singers but Shamshad Begum continued to be at the top from 1940 till 1963 non-stop.|$|E
