50|$|The disease {{development}} of <b>grape</b> <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> {{is known to}} be heavily reliant on the efficiency of the asexual propagation cycles. Kiefer et al. (2002) demonstrated that the early {{development of}} Plasmopara viticola is regulated specifically and coordinately by unknown factors originating from the host grapevine plant Vitis vinifera. The host factors influence the pathogen development in three ways: (i) accelerating the release of zoospores from mature sporangia, (ii) coordinating the morphogenesis of the germ tube through the reorientation of the polarity of the zoospores during the attachment to the host cell, and (iii) targeting the zoospores to the stomata by active chemotaxis from the open substomatal cavity. The expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes by the host plant V.vinifera during the infection of P.viticola has been investigated over the years. The expressions of PR-2, PR-3 and PR-4 genes are induced in the grapevine host during pathogen infection, which encode for cell wall-degrading enzymes B-1,3-glucanase (PR-2) and chitinases (PR-3 and PR-4). It was previously understood that oomycetes differ from true fungi by the presence of cellulose in the oomycetes’ cell walls as opposed to chitin in true fungi. However, it was found that chitin synthesis is regulated during in planta growth and asexual propagation of P.viticola and this is further demonstrated by the presence of chitin on the cell walls of the hyphae, sporangiophores and sporangia of the <b>grape</b> <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> pathogen. Hence, both the cell wall-degrading enzymes are synthesized by the host grapevine plant specifically to target and degrade the cell walls of the oomycete pathogen. In addition, the upregulation of the PR-9 gene that encodes for peroxidase, which is a reactive oxygen species is associated with the systemic acquired defense of the grapevine host. The roles of other constitutively expressed PR genes during P.viticola infection such as PR-5, PR-1 and PR-10 genes remain ambiguous. PR-5 is involved in the synthesis of thaumatin-like proteins and osmotins, which are believed to inhibit the spore germination and germ tube growth of Plasmopara viticola by creating transmembrane pores.|$|E
5000|$|Plasmopara viticola, {{also known}} as <b>grape</b> <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> is {{considered}} to be the most devastating disease of grapevines in climates with relatively warm and humid summers. It was first observed in 1834 by Schweinitz on Vitis aestivalis in the southeastern of the United States. Shortly after this first observation, the pathogen was introduced to European countries where it played a devastating role in the yield and production of their grapes, and consequently their wine. France was among the first of the European countries to gain experience in dealing with the pathogen. Within just a few years of the pathogen's introduction the French attempted to graft American root stock to their own vines in order to produce a more resistant strain of grape. Depending on the year, production of grapes in France has been estimated to have been reduced by as much as 50%. [...] Because of numbers and results like these, downy mildew has been considered the most devastating disease of a filamentous pathogen to affect European vineyards.|$|E

40|$|Generalist predatory mites {{belonging}} to the Phytoseiidae are important biocontrol agents in several perennial cropping systems. These predatory mites can persist for long periods on plants without prey, feeding on alternative foods included polle n and fungi. Predatory mite population are often limited by pesticide applications and these effects can be influenced by environmental {{factors such as the}} availability of alternative food sources. On grapevine, predatory mite abundance can be influenced by the spread of pathogens (e. g., <b>grape</b> <b>downy</b> <b>mildew).</b> Thus different <b>grape</b> <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> infection levels induced by different fungicide strategies can result in significant (indirect) effects on predatory mite populations. These effects can be stronger than those associated to the intrinsic toxicity of pesticides. On apple, the availability of alternative food sources (i. e., pollen) can mitigate the impact of insecticides on predatory mites. The provision of uncontaminated fresh pollen is likely to decrease pesticide exposure, and provides a highly nutritional food source that boosts mites’ fecundity, favoring the resilienc e of phytoseiid populations on treated plants...|$|E
40|$|A rapid LAMP (loop-mediated {{isothermal}} amplification) {{detection method}} was developed {{on the basis}} of the ITS sequence of P. viticola, the major causal agent of <b>grape</b> <b>downy</b> <b>mildew.</b> Among the 38 fungal and oomycete species tested, DNA isolated exclusively from P. viticola resulted in a specific product after LAMP amplification.

The infected leaves may produce sporangia that serve as a secondary inoculum. The developed LAMP assay is efficient for estimating the latent infection of grape leaves by P. viticola. When combined with the rapid and simple DNA extraction method, this assay’s total detection time is shortened to approximately one hour; therefore it is suitable for on-site detection of latent infection in the field. The sporangia levels in the air are strongly associated with disease severity.

In a 2013 survey of copper application in Germany we found, that while the amounts of copper used per hectare in conventional grape (0. 8 kg ha − 1), hop (1. 7 kg ha − 1) and potato-farming (0. 8 kg ha − 1) were well below those used in organic farming (2. 3, 2. 6 and 1. 4 kg ha − 1, respectively), they were nearly identical to those used in apple growing (1. 4 kg ha − 1). Due to the smaller farming area, only 24 % (26. 5 tonnes) of the total amount of copper was applied in organic farming compared to 76 % (84. 8 tonnes) in conventional farming. Since 2001, the Federal Agency for Agriculture and Food (BLE) promoted a copper research and minimization strategy which was funded with a total of C 10. 2 million. Our status quo analysis of research in this field shows that some progress is being made concerning alternative compounds, resistant varieties and decision support systems. However, it also shows that new approaches are not yet able to replace copper pesticides completely, especially in organic farming. In integrated pest management, copper preparations are important for the necessary active substance rotation and successful resistance management. The availability of such products is often essential for organic grapes, hops and fruit production and for extending the organic farming of these crops. We conclude that the complete elimination of copper pesticides is not yet practicable in organic farming as the production of several organic crops would become unprofitable and may lead to organic farmers reverting to conventional production. Several existing copper reduction strategies were, however, identified, and some, like modified forecast models adapted to organic farming, varieties more resistant to fungal diseases and new alternative products, already contribute to copper minimization in German agriculture. </div...|$|R

In addition, these compounds have various beneficial effects on human health, acting as anti-oxidants and also as potential chemopreventive agents.

At BBCH 53, successful infections were observed on all tested cultivars and functional stomata were present, while no infections were observed after this stage. At BBCH 69 and 75, cracks were observed around the stomata and guard cells were unstructured or completely collapsed, leading to closed-like stomata. At BBCH 53, significant stilbene accumulation was quantified in 2091 and Solaris; pterostilbene and Î¿-viniferin were produced in large amounts.

40|$|A {{plant disease}} {{model is a}} {{simplification}} of a real pathosystem (i. e., the relationships between a pathogen, a host plant, and the environment) that determine whether and how an epidemic develops over time and / or space. Different approaches {{have been used for}} the development of plant disease models, with relevant improvements in recent years. Empirical models have been elaborated using data collected under variable field conditions since {{the second half of the}} last century. The so called 3 10 rules for predicting first seasonal infection of <b>grape</b> <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> is a precursor of this empirical approach for understanding relationships between pathogens, plants and the environment. By using this approach, the model is developed by searching mathematical or statistical relationships between field collected data and these relationships do not necessarily have cause-effect meaning. Lack of knowledge, accuracy and, especially, robustness are the main weaknesses of these models, which impose accurate validation and, usually, proper calibration when these models are used in different environments or under changing climate. Recent methods of data analysis, like for instance neural networks, improve the capability of searching the mathematical structure of the model but they do not overcome the above mentioned weaknesses. Mechanistic models are a new class of models based on knowledge of biological and epidemiological behaviour of the system under study. These models (also referred to as explanatory, theoretical, or fundamental) explain the pathosystem on the basis of what is known about how the system works in relation to the influencing variables. Mechanistic models are dynamic, because they analyse the changes over time of the components of an epidemic due to the external, influencing variables. Dynamic modelling is based on the assumption that the state of the pathosystem in every moment can be quantitatively characterised and that changes in the system can be described by mathematical equations.

Results: Here a high-quality draft genome of Plasmopara halstedii is reported and analysed with respect to various aspects, including genome organisation, secondary metabolism, effector proteins and comparative genomics with other sequenced oomycetes. Interestingly, the present analyses revealed further variation of the RxLR motif, suggesting an important role of the conservation of the dEER-motif. Orthology analyses revealed the conservation of 28 RxLR-like core effectors among Phytophthora species.

40|$|<b>Downy</b> <b>mildews</b> {{and root}} and foliar rots caused by Phytophthora {{are among the}} most {{destructive}} plant pathogens and therefore have attracted considerable attention during the past two decades. Although it has been realized that a close phylogenetic relationship exists, so far sharp distinction has been made between the obligate biotrophic <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and the hemibiotrophic Phytophthora. In the study presented here, it is shown that a continuum of character states from hemibiotrophic Phytophthora species to obligate biotrophic <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> is present. Intermediate character states between <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and Phytophthora species exist in several rare parasites of grasses, which are not embedded within the major clades of the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> but are placed sister to these, with unresolved affinities to both these clades and to Phytophthora. They still have retained traits hitherto thought to be exclusive for Phytophthora. A careful review of previous research is presented and it is highlighted that uniquely for <b>downy</b> <b>mildews,</b> Poakatesthia may form an intracellular mycelium, growing through several host cells. In addition, scanning electron microscopy reveals that sporangiophore growth is not determinate in Viennotia and that outgrowth from sporangiophores is very similar to Phytophthora infestans. It is concluded that the sharp morphological distinction between <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> and Phytophthora species (that are often placed in separate families and even different orders), is rather artificial, since all features thought to be exclusive to Phytophthora or the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> are united in the rare grass-parasitizing down mildew genera Viennotia and Poakatesthia and the enigmatic genus Sclerophthora. Therefore, several paradigms regarding the distinction between Phytophthora and the <b>downy</b> <b>mildews</b> need to be reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|Field {{tests are}} used to {{evaluate}} the pesticides’ impact on predatory mites in realistic use situations. However, the distinction between the direct and indirect effects of a pesticide is not always possible in field tests. Generalist predatory mites belonging to the Phytoseiidae are considered as non-target organisms in pesticide side-effect evaluations. Plant pathogens of cultivated plants can be of importance as food resources for various phytoseiids. Pesticides with fungicidal activity may have a direct impact on phytoseiids, but they can also an indirect effect when reducing food availability for predatory mites. In field experiments on grapevine, we investigated whether the availability of the plant pathogen <b>grape</b> <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> has an effect on fungicides impact on the predatory mites Typhlodromus pyri and Amblyseius andersoni. We used fungicides having a differential selectivity towards predatory mites: copper compounds, folpet, and mancozeb. The abundance of predatory mites was associated with the plant pathogen foliar symptoms. The presence of predatory mites differed among treatments in response of the toxicological features of fungicides (direct effects), but also as consequences of plant pathogen availability induced by fungicide applications (indirect effects). Plant pathogen spread on untreated control determined contrasting results on pesticides effect. We segregated the direct effects from the indirect effects including a non-toxic reference in the experimental protocols...|$|E
40|$|Generalist predatory mites {{belonging}} to the Phytoseiidae {{play a major role}} in keeping phytophagous mites below economic threshold levels in European apple orchards and vineyards. The ability of generalist predatory mites to feed on alternative foods is of importance for their persistence in perennial crops. Pesticides can exert dramatic effects on mite communities, and these effects can be more severe on predators than on phytophagous mites, with practical consequences for pest management. Environmental conditions, in particular availability of alternative foods, could affect the resilience of predatory mite populations after pesticide applications. We evaluate the role of availability of alternative foods on the response of predatory mite populations to pesticide applications in two crop systems: apple and grape. In the former, increasing the abundance of pollen through appropriate grass management resulted in less pronounced negative effects of some insecticides on the predatory mite Kampimodromus aberrans (Oudemans). In a controlled laboratory experiment, we demonstrated that availability of fresh pollen reduced the effect of pesticides on the fecundity of that predator. In the grape system, we found a positive effect of the plant pathogen <b>grape</b> <b>downy</b> <b>mildew</b> (GDM) on Amblyseius andersoni (Chant) populations, while some pesticides had a negative impact. GDM availability on plants favored the colonization by beneficial mites of pesticide treated plants with positive implications for mite persistence in vineyards...|$|E
40|$|Epidemics {{caused by}} Plasmopara viticola on grapevines {{are caused by}} both primary and {{secondary}} infections that overlap for {{a part of the}} season. To date, this complexity has not been incorporated into models for <b>grape</b> <b>downy</b> <b>mildew.</b> A conceptual model was developed that links the quantitative aspects of both sexual and asexual stages of the P. viticola life cycle in a biologically coherent framework. Vanderplank’s logistic equation was integrated with a time step of 1 day; the resulting rates of disease increase were separately calculated for primary and secondary infections and linked together. Key model parameters included oospore density and development, infection efficiency for primary infections, ability of the lesions to reproduce asexually, infection efficiency for secondary infections, and carrying capacity of the host leaves. The model structural adequacy procedures (MSA) were used to estimate model parameters, and the model outputs were compared with real data not used in model development and parameterization. Real data were taken from published studies of 23 vineyards, where lesions had been previously genetically analyzed and distinguished as primary (caused by singleton genotypes) and secondary (caused by clonal genotypes). The 23 vineyards had experienced epidemics characterised by a low to high level of clonality. The estimated model parameters were biologically plausible and consistent with previous knowledge, and the model accurately mimicked the variability of the 23 real epidemics. The model represents a coherent mathematical structure for developing a simulator for downy mildew epidemics in the vineyard...|$|E
