To what extent students occupy jobs {{for which the}} low-educated umployed also qualify is subject of this study. By means of three separate empirical studies among: a) students in higher education, b) the low-educated unemployed and c) employers this question was evaluated. Occupation of jobs suitable for the low-educated unemployed by students is substantial and takes place especially in sectors such as: retail trade/shops, <b>hotel</b> <b>and</b> <b>catering</b> <b>and</b> <b>industry.</b> Motives of employers for recruting students in stead of low-educated persons refer in particular to their perceived communication skills, flexibility and their by comparison less need for settle in work time...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} union-bargained minimum wages on transitions {{into and out of}} employment in the <b>hotels</b> <b>and</b> <b>catering</b> <b>industry</b> over the period 1979 – 99. This industry is characterised by a high fraction of unskilled labour input, high worker turnover and binding minimum wages. The empirical approach identifies workers affected by real minimum wage increases and decreases, respectively. Job separations and accessions for the treatment groups are then contrasted to the outcomes for control groups, with wages marginally above those of the treatment groups. Unlike previous studies, this paper also considers same-period transitions for same-wage workers who are unaffected by minimum wage changes. This procedure should help to control for unobserved differences between high- and low-wage workers and is made possible by the diversified minimum wage structure of the industry. According to the results, increasing minimum wages tend to be associated with non-negligible employment effects (except for teenagers during 1993 – 98). The evidence regarding decreasing minimum wages is less conclusive. Minimum wages; employment...|$|R
50|$|A colossal rate of {{diversity}} in British self-employment and entrepreneurship in the British Chinese Community has been considerably high. East Asian British groups (Chinese, Japanese, South Korean) and British South Asian groups (Indian, Bangladeshi, and Pakistani) typically have higher rates of self-employment than Whites, while Black groups (Black African and Black Caribbean) have lower rates. Self-employment rates in the British Chinese community is generally {{higher than the national}} average. For instance, White British had self-employment rates of 17% in 2001, but the British Chinese self-employment rate was 28%, the higher than the British Indian rate of 21%, British Pakistanis of 27%, and the highest overall among Britain's main ethnic groups. However, overall aggregate self-employment fell between the decade of 1991 to 2001 as the proportion of British Chinese with higher qualifications grew from 27% to 43% between the years of 1991 to 2006. 75% of male British Chinese entrepreneurs worked in the distribution, <b>hotel,</b> <b>and</b> <b>catering</b> <b>industries.</b> In 1991, 34.1% of British Chinese men and 20.3% of British Chinese women were self-employed and the rate was the highest among all Britain's major ethnic groups during that year. In 2001, self-employment rates for British Chinese men dropped to 27.8% and 18.3% for British Chinese women, yet overall rates still remained the highest among all of Britain's major ethnic groups. The overall self-employment rate in 2001 was 23%. Common business industries for the British Chinese include restaurants, business services, medical and vet services, recreational and cultural services, wholesale distribution, <b>catering,</b> <b>hotel</b> management, retail <b>and</b> construction. By 2004, overall British Chinese self-employment was just under 16%, as one in five (21%) of British Pakistanis were self-employed and more British Chinese choose to acquire higher qualifications via education. By 2006, 29% of allChinese men were classed as self-employed compared to 17% of white British men and 18% of Chinese women compared to 7% of White British women.|$|R
40|$|The {{prohibition}} of smoking {{in public places}} that has been implemented in various European countries {{has led to a}} noticeable {{decrease in the number of}} hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction. This effect became manifest within one year after the adoption of the measure. A significant proportion of the benefit can probably be ascribed to the reduction of passive smoking. The recently published INTERHEART study is a case-control study involving approximately 12, 500 patients who had been admitted for an acute myocardial infarction and approximately 14, 500 apparently healthy controls. The study was carried out in 52 countries and reveals that an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction as the result of tobacco use can be seen in all investigated countries and races. Smoking as well as the chewing or sniffing of tobacco are associated with an increased risk; there is also a clear proportional relationship between the level of tobacco use and the degree of risk. Moreover, passive smoking was again shown to be an important and avoidable cause ofacute myocardial infarction. In the Netherlands, smoking in public buildings has been prohibited since 1990, with the exception of the <b>hotel,</b> restaurant <b>and</b> <b>catering</b> <b>industry.</b> It would be a good thing if this exception were eliminated in our country as wel...|$|R

40|$|There is {{generally}} a world wide view that internationally the <b>Hotel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Catering</b> <b>Industry</b> {{has a number}} of personnel related problems and poor employment practices and conditions. This view is supported by a study of the <b>Hotel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Catering</b> <b>Industry</b> by 5 which revealed that the industry was dogged with problems of low wages, long working hours and unstable shift hours, poor or non existent career structures, over reliance on informal recruitment methods, lack of evidence of good human resources practices and high labour turnover. Therefore this research sought to assess the level of significance given to the Human Resources function in order to find meaningful solutions to employment practices and personnel problems experienced in the Sector. The research focused on the 1 star to 5 star rated and registered hotels in Harare, Zimbabwe. The hotel ratings are according to the 15 ratings. This study was based on a descriptive survey research design. Both qualitative and quantitative data was collected. For this study a questionnaire was chosen as the data collection instrument.

40|$|Rates of pay in the <b>hotel</b> <b>and</b> <b>catering</b> <b>industry</b> are a {{contentious}} issue. The industry is traditionally labour intensive and labour costs form {{a significant proportion}} of the total running costs of an organisation. On the other hand, the industry has a reputation for low pay, and evidence suggests that pay in the industry consistently falls behind many other industries. Information about pay in the industry is however limited. Existing sources do not provide detailed data on the rates of pay for a range of employees in the <b>hotel</b> <b>and</b> <b>catering</b> <b>industry.</b> The aim of this research therefore, is to develop a comprehensive study of pay in the industry for particular grades of staff, and also to examine the factors that influence pay in the industry. A survey was conducted throughout Great Britain into rates of pay in the hotel sector, the restaurant sector, the industrial catering sector and the contract catering sector. Rates were found to be generally higher in the industrial catering sector, while the hotel and restaurant sectors tended to have very similar rates of pay. The traditionally female occupations in the industry, such as the room maid and the housekeeper are shown to have some of the lowest rates of pay, and some average rates of pay were below the legal minimum laid down by the Wages Council, The examination of determinants of pay in the industry demonstrates that pay for the unskilled grades of staff is influenced by factors such as the regional and locational situation of the hotel restaurant or unit. As there are variations of demand for labour and alternative job opportunities in different regions and locations around Great Britain, the average rate of pay for unskilled workers fluctuates. The pay of the skilled grades of staff was affected to a greater extent by factors such as the size or the price level of a unit. These factors are mainly indicative of the style of the operation and perhaps the level of skill demanded...|$|E
