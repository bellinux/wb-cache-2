40|$|The {{challenge}} of a full-duplex <b>single-channel</b> <b>system</b> is the method to transmit and receive signals simultaneously {{at the same}} time and on the same frequency. Consequently, a critical issue involved in such an operation is the resulting self-interference. Moreover, for MIMO <b>system,</b> the full-duplex <b>single-channel</b> <b>system</b> is subjected to the very strong self-interference signals due to multiple transmitting and receiving antennas. So far in the pieces of literature, there have not been any suitable techniques presented to reduce the self-interference for full-duplex <b>single-channel</b> MIMO <b>systems.</b> This paper initially proposes the method to cancel the self-interference by utilizing the mutual-coupling model for self-interference cancellation. The interference can be eliminated by using a preknown interference, that is, the mutual-coupling signals. The results indicate that the channel capacity performance of the proposed technique can significantly be improved due to the reduction of the self-interference power. The measurement results indicate that the proposed MIMO system can suppress the self-interference and mutual-interference signals with the reduction of 31 [*]dB received power...|$|R

On the other hand, the MWF provides an optimal solution for broadband noise reduction from a {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) perspective. Speech-distortion-weighted MWF (SDW-MWF) has been introduced to control speech distortion and noise reduction [8]. Algorithms such as SDW-MWF and MVDR preserve speech binaural cues, but distort noise binaural cues [10]. Therefore, extensions for preserving the binaural cues of directional sources using additional cost functions or linear constraints have been proposed [10, 11].
