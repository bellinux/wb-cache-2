5|$|Most main-sequence {{stars with}} a {{spectral}} class between O5 and F5 {{have been found}} to rotate rapidly. For stars in this range, the measured rotation velocity increases with mass. This increase in rotation peaks among young, massive B-class stars. As the <b>expected</b> <b>life</b> span of a star decreases with increasing mass, this can be explained as a decline in rotational velocity with age.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 No.6 Squadron's F-111Cs were {{replaced}} by F-111Gs which had been purchased from the USAF in 1992 {{to be used for}} training purposes. This purchase allowed Australia's F-111Cs to be used mainly for strike and reconnaissance purposes and extended the type's <b>expected</b> <b>life</b> in RAAF service. All the F-111Gs were assigned to No,6 Squadron, and the unit's F-111C and RF-111C aircraft were transferred to No.1 Squadron. The squadron typically had seven F-111Gs operational at any point in time.|$|E

25|$|DLR-Tubsat (a.k.a. TUBSAT) was a German {{remote sensing}} microsatellite, {{developed}} in {{joint venture between}} Technical University of Berlin (TUB) and German Aerospace Center (DLR).

25|$|The {{front of}} the iPod Shuffle had buttons for Play/Pause, Next Song/Fast Forward, Previous Song/Fast Reverse, {{and up and down}} volume adjustment.

25|$|Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was {{declared}} {{guilty of the}} three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against {{the internal and external}} security of the State, and high treason because of her intelligence activities {{in the interest of the}} enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death. At worst, she and her lawyers had <b>expected</b> <b>life</b> imprisonment. In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law, Madame Élisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children. The letter did not reach Élisabeth. Preparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards. She put on a plain white dress, white being the color worn by widowed queens of France. Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was put on a rope leash. Unlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (carrosse), she had to sit in an open cart (charrette) for the hour it took to convey her from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honoré thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in the Place de la Révolution, (the present-day Place de la Concorde). She maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd. A constitutional priest was assigned to her to hear her final confession. He sat by her in the cart, but she ignored him all the way to the scaffold.|$|E

500|$|When the aircraft's SDU {{responds}} to messages sent {{from the ground}} station, it uses the aircraft's navigation system to determine the aircraft's position, track, and ground speed and adjusts the transmit frequency {{to compensate for the}} Doppler shift on the uplink signal, based on the satellite being located in its nominal position in geostationary orbit (35786 km above the equator) at 64.5°E. The initial analysis was calculated with the satellite at its nominal location in geostationary orbit, [...] above the equator at 64.5°E longitude. However, the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite was launched in 1996 with an <b>expected</b> <b>life</b> span of 13 years and to extend its lifespan by conserving remaining fuel, it was allowed to drift from its nominal location into a slightly inclined orbit. A map of the sub-satellite points—the location on Earth's surface directly beneath the satellite—shows that the satellite moves counterclockwise in an oval shape between 1.6°S–1.6°N and 64.45–64.58°E. As a result, the adjustments made by the SDU only partially compensate for the Doppler shift on the uplink. This error is [...] "immaterial" [...] to the performance of the satellite network, but was crucial to eliminate the northern corridor during the initial analysis.|$|E
