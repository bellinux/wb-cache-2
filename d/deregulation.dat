5|$|In 2000, the Indonesian {{government}} announced the aviation <b>deregulation</b> policy, {{which makes it}} easier to acquire a permit to establish a new airline company. The policy was meant to stimulate air transportation investments and increase air-travel business in the country, as well as to serve and stimulate tourism industry in the region. As a result, many new airlines began to spring up in Indonesia, among them Lion Air (est. 1999), Sriwijaya Air (est. 2003), Adam Air (operating from 2002 to 2008), and Batavia Air (operating from 2002 to 2013). The <b>deregulation</b> also spurred the low-cost carrier service in Indonesia. Previously, air travel service was dominated by well-established airlines such as Garuda Indonesia and Merpati.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of the evolution in intrastate and interstate <b>deregulations</b> on the total factor productivity growth of U. S. commercial banking during 1971 – 95. We consider statewide <b>deregulations</b> in intrastate branching, intrastate multibank holding company (MBHC), interstate multibank holding company, and interstate MBHC de novo branching regulations. Results indicate that (1) long-standing banking restrictions negatively affected banks’ productivity growth, and (2) relaxing restrictions on intrastate branching expansion had a positive long-run influence upon banks’ productivity growth. The effect of interstate MBHC <b>deregulations</b> is largely short run, and it is negative in the long run for interstate MBHC de novo branching <b>deregulations.</b> Dogan Tirtiroglu, Kenneth N.

5|$|As Energy Minister, Baird was {{entrusted}} with implementing the government's plan {{to sell off}} part of Ontario's Hydro One. A few months later, he became unexpectedly involved in two major and interrelated policy reversals. The Energy ministry came under intense media scrutiny in late 2002 after hydro rates increased significantly {{in many parts of}} the province. Critics argued that the Progressive Conservative government's price <b>deregulation</b> policy (implemented before Baird became Energy Minister) was responsible. Baird suggested that the rate increases resulted from an unusually hot summer. Rates remained high through the autumn, and the Eves government was forced to re-regulate the market in November by introducing a price cap. The government continued to support <b>deregulation</b> in principle, but maintained the cap for the remainder of its term in office. The second and more fundamental reversal occurred in late January 2003, when Premier Eves announced that Hydro One would remain under public control.|$|E

In October Kirkie BUS was introduced onto Kirkintilloch-based vehicles and Cumbernauld's Buses onto vehicles stationed in that town.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have rapidly {{become the}} focus of many cancer {{research}} studies. These small non-coding RNAs have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. It has also been demonstrated that miRNA expression profiles differ significantly between normal and cancerous cells, which indicates the possibility of using miRNAs as markers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, not much is known about the regulation of miRNA expression. One of the issues worth investigating is whether <b>deregulations</b> of miRNA expression in cancer cells occur according to some pattern or in a random order. We therefore selected two approaches, previously used to derive graph models of oncogenesis using chromosomal imbalance data, and adapted them to miRNA expression data. Applying the adapted algorithms to a breast cancer data set, we obtained results indicating the temporal order of miRNA <b>deregulations</b> during tumor development. When analyzing the specific <b>deregulations</b> appearing at different time points in the derived model, we found that several of the <b>deregulations</b> identified as early events could be supported through literature studies. ...|$|R

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{class of}} small non-coding RNAs that control gene {{expression}} by targeting mRNAs and triggering either translation repression or RNA degradation. Several groups pointed out that miRNAs {{play a major role}} in several diseases, including cancer. This is assumed since the expression level of several miRNAs differs between normal and cancerous cells. Further, it has been shown that miRNAs are involved in cell proliferation and cell death. Because of this role it is suspected that miRNAs could serve as biomarkers to improve tumor classification, therapy selection, or prediction of survival. In this context, it is questioned, among other things, whether miRNA <b>deregulations</b> in cancer cells occur according to some pattern or in a rather random order. With this work we contribute to answering this question by adapting two approaches (Beerenwinkel et al. (J Comput Biol, 2005) and Höglund et al. (Gene Chromosome Canc, 2001)), developed to derive graph models of oncogenesis for chromosomal imbalances, to miRNA expression data and applying them to a breast cancer data set. Further, we evaluated the results by comparing them to results derived from randomly altered versions of the used data set. We could show that miRNA <b>deregulations</b> most likely follow a rough temporal order, i. e. some <b>deregulations</b> occur early and some occur late in cancer progression. Thus, it seems to be possible that the expression level of some miRNAs can be used as indicator for the stage of a tumor. Further, our results suggest that the over expression of mir- 21 as well as mir- 102 are initial events in breast cancer oncogenesis. Additionally, we identified a set of miRNAs showing a cluster-like behavior, i. e. their <b>deregulations</b> often occur together in a tumor, but other <b>deregulations</b> are less frequently present. These miRNAs are let- 7 d, mir- 10 b, mir- 125 a, mir- 125 b, mir- 145, mir- 206, and mir- 210. Further, we could confirm the strong relationship between the expression of mir- 125 a and mir- 125 b...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the banking regulatory frameworks that were enforced from the 1980 {{to date and}} see if there is a cyclical tendency in the patterns of regulations and <b>deregulations.</b> To analyse this, we look at 10 acts or key events from the US banking industry and compare them against variant macroeconomic indicators. The result shows that lawmakers imposed <b>deregulations</b> upon the banking industry in moments of economic growth and regulatory measures after a period of economic downturn. This has some serious implications for policy making. In the end, we attempt to conclude whether lawmakers should back off and have a hands off approach to banking industry or if they should permanently regulate...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of US branch banking <b>deregulations</b> on the entry size of new firms using {{micro-data}} from the US Census Bureau. We find that the average entry size for startups did not change following the <b>deregulations.</b> However, among firms that survived at least four years, a greater proportion of firms entered either at their maximum size or closer to the maximum size in the first year. The magnitude of these effects were small compared to the much larger changes in entry rates of small firms following the reforms. Our results highlight that this large-scale entry at the extensive margin can obscure the more subtle intensive margin effects of changes in financing constraints. ...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Oligonucleotide microarray platforms were used for gene expression and pathway analysis. Confirmation studies were performed using quantitative real time PCR. Results: Bortezomib treatment has shown upregulated DIABLO and NF-κBIB (a NF-κB inhibitor) and downregulated NF-κB 1, NF-κB 2, and BIRC 1 gene expressions. Combination treatment of the two compounds showed gene expression <b>deregulations</b> in concordance {{by the results of}} single bortezomib treatment.
