25|$|The first DQ {{restaurant}} {{was located in}} Joliet, Illinois. It was operated by Sherb Noble and opened for business on June 22, 1940. It served a variety of <b>frozen</b> <b>products,</b> such as soft serve ice cream.|$|E
25|$|The Senator <b>Frozen</b> <b>Products</b> {{company was}} profitable, {{but by the}} 1950s the large mass-producers of ice cream started a price war, leading to his {{decision}} to make a heavy kind of high-end ice cream. In 1959, he decided {{to form a new}} ice cream company with what he thought to be a Danish-sounding name, Häagen-Dazs, a move known in the marketing industry as foreign branding.|$|E
25|$|Häagen-Dazs's founder Reuben Mattus {{was born}} in Poland in 1912 to Jewish parents. His father died during the First World War, and his widowed mother emigrated to New York City with her two {{children}} in 1921. They joined an uncle {{who was in the}} Italian lemon-ice business in Brooklyn. By the late 1920s, the family began making ice pops, and by 1929, chocolate-covered ice cream bars and sandwiches under the name Senator <b>Frozen</b> <b>Products</b> on Southern Boulevard in the South Bronx, delivering them with a horse-drawn wagon to neighborhood stores in the Bronx.|$|E

25|$|With time, the {{shortage}} economy led to scarcity of meat, coffee, tea and other ingredients of daily use. Many products like chocolate, sugar and meat were rationed, {{with a specific}} limit depending on social class and health requirements. Physical workers and pregnant women were generally entitled to more food products. Imports were restricted, {{so much of the}} food supply was domestic. Cuisine became homogeneous, to be a chef was no longer a prestigious profession and for decades the country became basically disconnected from any foreign cuisine. Tropical fruits (citrus, banana, pineapple, etc.) were available during holidays and local fruits and vegetables were mostly seasonal but were available at private stands. For most of the year the Poles had to get by with only domestic winter fruit and vegetables: apples, plums, currants, onions, potatoes, cabbage, root vegetables and <b>frozen</b> <b>products.</b> Other food products (of foreign origins) were available at markets at high prices.|$|E

40|$|Freezing {{preservation}} of banana (Musa cavendishii, var. enana) was investigated. Microwave treatment of banana slices at 650 watts for 2 min or immersion of whole peeled fruits {{in boiling water}} for 11 min followed by freezing at - 24 °C inhibited color deterioration in the <b>frozen</b> <b>product.</b> Treatments showed different effectiveness depending on the enzymatic system studied [polyphenoloxidase (PPO) or peroxidase (POD) ] and banana maturity level at the processing date. Blanching in boiling water yielded a good <b>frozen</b> <b>product</b> in which no darkening was observed. The proper stage of ripeness for processing of this banana cultivar was characterized by a firmness of 1. 24 kg, a pulp/skin ratio of 1. 30 and a green (70 %) -yellow (30 %) peel color.

2500|$|In the 1870s, Julius Vogel was {{periodically}} both colonial treasurer and premier. He viewed New Zealand as a [...] "Britain of the South Seas" [...] {{and began}} the development of infrastructure in New Zealand investing in heavily in roads, railways, telegraphs and bridges funded by public borrowing. Progress slowed {{after the collapse of}} the City of Glasgow Bank in 1878 which led to a contraction in credit from London, the centre of the world’s financial system at the time. Economic activity was depressed for some years afterwards, until refrigeration was introduced in 1882. This enabled New Zealand to start exporting meat and other <b>frozen</b> <b>products</b> to the United Kingdom.
