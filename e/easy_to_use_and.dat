5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> <b>and</b> have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E
5|$|The EyeTV W was {{introduced}} in November 2013. It is a small 44 gram device that receives free digital over-the-air television broadcasts and makes it available to portable devices through a wireless hot spot. A review in Macworld said it was portable, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> had good battery life, but noted that users can't connect to other wi-fi networks and watch TV at the same time. It gave the product 4 out of 5 stars. An EyeTV Mobile device for iPads was announced at the 2011 International Franchise Conference as the first tuner for the new Freeview system in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Fish farm owners {{search for}} a cost-effective, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> <b>and</b> {{available}} food that is preferred by the fish. From cysts, brine shrimp nauplii can readily be used to feed fish and crustacean larvae just after one-day incubation. Instar I (the nauplii that just hatched and with large yolk reserves in their body) and instar II nauplii (the nauplii after first moult and with functional digestive tracts) are more widely used in aquaculture, because they are easy for operation, rich in nutrients, and small, which makes them suitable for feeding fish and crustacean larvae live or after drying.|$|E
25|$|The {{controllers}} were hard-wired to {{the console}} with no connectors for cost reasons. The game pad controllers were more-or-less copied {{directly from the}} Game & Watch machines, although the Famicom design team originally wanted to use arcade-style joysticks, even taking apart ones from American game consoles {{to see how they}} worked. There were concerns regarding the durability of the joystick design and that children might step on joysticks left on the floor. Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game & Watch D-pad to the Famicom prototype and found that it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> caused no discomfort. Ultimately though, they installed a 15-pin expansion port {{on the front of the}} console so that an optional arcade-style joystick could be used.|$|E

25|$|The Winchester Liberator is a 16-gauge, four-barrelled shotgun, {{similar to}} a scaled-up four-shot {{double-action}} derringer. It was an implementation of the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon design. Robert Hillberg, the designer, envisioned a weapon that was cheap to manufacture, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> <b>and</b> provided a significant chance of being effective {{in the hands of}} someone who had never handled a firearm before. Pistols and submachine guns were eliminated from consideration due to the training required to use them effectively. The shotgun was chosen because it provided a high hit probability. Both Winchester and Colt built prototypes, although the Colt eight-shot design came late in the war and was adapted for the civilian law enforcement market. No known samples were ever produced for military use.|$|E
25|$|Internet {{telephony}} {{is another}} common communications service {{made possible by}} the creation of the Internet. VoIP stands for Voice-over-Internet Protocol, referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with walkie-talkie-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as cable or ADSL. VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} PCMAG of the Wink Hub 2 {{said it was}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> {{compatible}} with many devices, but had no battery backup or USB ports. Under [...] "Bottom Line" [...] the review said, [...] "Works with virtually every wireless protocol out there and supports dual-band Wi-Fi. Installation and device pairing is quick and easy." [...] It gave the Hub 2 4.5 out of 5 stars and named it its new Editors' Choice for home automation hubs. In contrast, CNET gave the device three stars. The reviewer said the device is easy {{to set up and}} compatible with many devices, but gave the reviewer error messages. The reviewer was never able to successfully set it up the way she wanted. Tom's Guide gave the Wink Hub 2 7 out of 10. It also said the device was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> compatible with many devices, but missing some advanced features. Tom's Guide said it was good for [...] "basic" [...] smart homes.|$|E

500|$|A visual {{indicator}} was developed based on vibrating reeds, which provided a simple panel-mounted [...] "turn left-right" [...] indicator. It was reliable, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> more immune to erroneous signals than the competing audio based system. Pilots who had flown with both aural and visual systems strongly preferred the visual type, {{according to a}} published report. The reed-based solution was passed over by the U.S. government, however, and the audio signals became standard for decades to come.|$|E
500|$|PC Magazine {{gave the}} service a 4/5 rating. The reviewer, Jeffrey Wilson, found its app <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> noted its digital signing and cloud storage features. Wilson {{reported}} problems {{when trying to}} use the digital signing feature with the phone held vertically and experienced occasional crashes. TopTenReviews gave the service a 9.5 out of 10. TopTenReviews praised the product for unlimited downloads and accessibility from a desktop, laptop or other mobile device. In benchmark tests, the service took seven minutes to upload a 30 MB file, compared to an industry average of six minutes.|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} for C16 and Plus/4 {{received}} positive reviews. Commodore Horizons awarded 8 stars to gameplay, describing it is [...] "as good as anything" [...] within the C16's limitations. Commodore User noted the C16 version for fast, but involved action. Their review of Plus/4 described it similarly, {{and called it}} one of the best dedicated Plus/4 games, only giving sound a lower score. Computer Gamer gave both the C16 and Plus/4 version 5 out of 5 stars and described Ace as <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> understand.

500|$|Robert Brunner, Apple's head of {{industrial}} design at the time, led the design team that developed the laptop, including its trackball and granite color. Brunner said he designed the PowerBook [...] "so {{it would be}} as <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> carry as a regular book". The dark granite grey color set it apart from other notebook computers of the time and also from Apple's other products, which traditionally were beige or platinum grey. The trackball, another new design element, was placed {{in the middle of the}} computer, allowing the PowerBook to be easily operated by both left- and right-handed users. The designers were trying to create a fashion statement with the overall design of the laptop, which they felt made it a more personal accessory, like a wallet or briefcase. Brunner said: [...] "It says something about the identity of the person who is carrying it".|$|E

2500|$|Unlike other {{arbitration}} agreements, AT Mobility's {{arbitration agreement}} {{was designed to}} facilitate the pursuit of small claims in arbitration. [...] The arbitration agreement provided that AT Mobility would pay the entire cost of arbitration (unless the claim {{was determined to be}} frivolous). [...] The arbitration would take place in the county where the consumer was located, by telephone, or through document submission, and forms for the arbitration were made available on AT Mobility's website. [...] The arbitrator was not limited in the damages it could award to a consumer, and if the consumer received an award greater than AT Mobility's last written settlement offer, the award would be increased to $7,500, and the consumer would be entitled to double attorney's fees. [...] This led the United States District Court for the Southern District of California to state that arbitration under AT Mobility's agreement was [...] "quick, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> <b>and</b> prompts full or, as described by Plaintiffs, even excess payment to the customer without the need to arbitrate or litigate." ...|$|E
