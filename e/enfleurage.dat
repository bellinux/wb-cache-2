5000|$|<b>Enfleurage</b> is {{a process}} that uses odorless fats that are solid at room {{temperature}} to capture the [...] fragrant compounds exuded by plants. The process can be [...] "cold" [...] <b>enfleurage</b> or [...] "hot" [...] <b>enfleurage.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Enfleurage</b> is a {{two-step process}} {{during which the}} odour of {{aromatic}} materials is absorbed into wax or fat, then extracted with alcohol.

50|$|Fragrance {{extraction}} {{refers to}} the extraction of aromatic compounds from raw materials, using methods such as distillation, solvent extraction, expression, or <b>enfleurage.</b> The results of the extracts are either essential oils, absolutes, concretes, or butters, depending {{on the amount of}} waxes in the extracted product.|$|E
50|$|Used in {{perfumery}} and aromatherapy, absolutes {{are similar}} to essential oils. They are concentrated, highly aromatic, oily mixtures extracted from plants. Whereas essential oils can typically be produced through steam distillation, absolutes {{require the use of}} solvent extraction techniques or more traditionally, through <b>enfleurage.</b>|$|E

50|$|In hot <b>enfleurage,</b> solid fats are {{heated and}} botanical matter is stirred into the fat. Spent {{botanicals}} are repeatedly strained from {{the fat and}} replaced with fresh material until the fat is saturated with fragrance. This method is considered the oldest known procedure for preserving plant fragrance substances.|$|E

5000|$|In both instances, {{once the}} fat is {{saturated}} with fragrance, {{it is then}} called the [...] "enfleurage pomade". The <b>enfleurage</b> pomade was either sold as it was, {{or it could be}} further washed or soaked in ethyl alcohol to draw the fragrant molecules into the alcohol. The alcohol is then separated from the fat and allowed to evaporate, leaving behind the absolute of the botanical matter. The spent fat is usually used to make soaps since it is still relatively fragrant.|$|E
50|$|The <b>enfleurage</b> {{fragrance}} extraction {{method is}} by far one of the oldest. It is also highly inefficient and costly but was the sole method of extracting the fragrant compounds in delicate floral botanical such as jasmine and tuberose, which would be destroyed or denatured by the high temperatures required by methods of fragrance extraction such as steam distillation. The method is now superseded by more efficient techniques such as solvent extraction or supercritical fluid extraction using liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) or similar compressed gases.|$|E
50|$|In cold <b>enfleurage,</b> a large framed {{plate of}} glass, called a chassis, is smeared {{with a layer}} of animal fat, usually lard or tallow (from pork or beef, respectively), and allowed to set. Botanical matter, usually petals or whole flowers, is then placed on the fat and its scent is allowed to diffuse into the fat over the course of 1-3 days. The process is then {{repeated}} by replacing the spent botanicals with fresh ones until the fat has reached a desired degree of fragrance saturation. This procedure was developed in southern France in the 18th century for the production of high-grade concentrates.|$|E
50|$|Neroli oil is an {{essential}} oil produced from the blossom of the bitter orange tree (Citrus aurantium subsp. amara or Bigaradia). Its scent is sweet, honeyed and somewhat metallic with green and spicy facets. Orange blossom is also extracted from the same blossom and both extracts are extensively used in perfumery. Orange blossom {{can be described as}} smelling sweeter, warmer and more floral than neroli. The difference between how neroli and orange blossom smell and why they are referred to with different names, {{is a result of the}} process of extraction that is used to obtain the oil from the blooms. Neroli is extracted by steam distillation and orange blossom is extracted via a process of <b>enfleurage.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the Middle Ages, Grasse {{specialized}} in leather tanning. Once tanned, the hides were often exported to Genoa or Pisa, cities that shared a commercial alliance with Grasse. Several centuries of this intense activity witnessed many technological advances within tanning industries. The hides of Grasse acquired {{a reputation for}} high quality. But the leather smelled badly, something that did not please the glove wearing nobility. This is when Galimard, a tanner in Grasse {{came up with the}} idea of scented leather gloves. He offered a pair of scented gloves to Catherine de Medici who was seduced by the gift. Thereafter, the product spread through the Royal Court and high society, and this made a worldwide reputation for Grasse. The seventeenth century became the heyday of [...] "Glovers Perfumers'. However, high taxes on leather and competition from Nice brought a decline for the leather industry in Grasse, and production of leather fragrance ceased. The rare scents from the Grasse (lavender, myrtle, jasmine, rose, orange blossom and wild mimosa) did win the title for the Grasse as the perfume capital of the world. Harvesting jasmine was a labor-intensive business only a few decades ago. Flowers had to be hand picked at dawn, when their scent is the most developed and immediately to be treated by cold <b>enfleurage.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Kelly Heaton's {{most recent}} exhibition, [...] "Pollination," [...] (2015) invites the viewer into a fertile {{exchange}} involving not only bees and plants, but our very identity as human beings. [...] A {{tour de force}} of sculpture, electronics, perfume, and mixed media art, Heaton's recent work challenges {{us to see the}} connections between all things, and to take responsibility for our role in the ecosystem. Dominating the exhibition is [...] "The Beekeeper," [...] a floor to ceiling kinetic sculpture that Heaton refers to as “an energetic self-portrait.” At the heart of the sculpture, bees fly around an illuminated honeycomb rooted in a landscape of floral electronics, while a reflective mind and crystalline third eye spiral up to a radiant sun of hands. A self-taught perfumer, Heaton created fragrances to seduce her audience with scent, including [...] "Smells Like Weeds (The Queen of Hungry Spirits)," [...] a rare perfume made by Heaton using bee-friendly plants; and [...] "Smells Like Money (Hungry Spirits)," [...] a delicate perfume extracted from hundreds of dollar bills using the labor-intensive method of cold <b>enfleurage.</b> Heaton's [...] "Shamanic Bee" [...] is a large and haunting portrait that begs for human attention to the plight of insect pollinators. Other of Heaton's works that urge our respect for nature include [...] "Weeds," [...] a vitrine of exquisite silk flowers; [...] "Colony Collapse Disorder," [...] an engineer’s interpretation of the honeybee epidemic; [...] "Emergency Queen Cell," [...] a brass hive with an inverted Virgin Mary; [...] "The Monsanto Series," [...] agricultural landscapes invaded by manmade devices; and [...] "This is the Problem, Not the Solution," [...] a crossword puzzle of endangered pollinators and threats to their existence. Heaton's [...] "Diseases of the Hive" [...] series cautions against our own infestation by electronic devices. To complement the show, the artist has written [...] "Pollination," [...] a book documenting these works and the story of their creation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Enfleurage,</b> the {{extraction}} of elusive floral scents {{with the help of}} a lipophilic carrier (grease), is widely used in the perfume industry. Male neotropical orchid bees (Euglossini), which accumulate exogenous fragrances as pheromone analogues, use a similar technique. To collect fragrances, the bees apply large amounts of straight-chain lipids to odoriferous surfaces from their cephalic labial glands, which dissolve the volatiles, and the mixture is then transferred to voluminous hind-leg pockets. Here, we show that males do in fact operate a lipid conveyor belt to accumulate and concentrate their perfume. From the hind-leg pockets of caged male Euglossa viridissima, deuterated derivatives of carrier lipids were consecutively sequestered, shuttled back to the labial glands and reused on consecutive bouts of fragrance collection. Such lipid cycling is instrumental in creating complex perfume bouquets. Furthermore, we found that labial glands of male orchid bees are strikingly similar to those of scent-marking male bumblebees in terms of size, form and structure. This, and a prominent overlap in secretory products, led us to propose that perfume collection evolved from scent-marking in ancestral corbiculate bees...|$|E
