5|$|The video {{opens with}} Aguilera gearing up and riding a {{motorcycle}} into a nightclub. Wearing a bikini and buttocks-bearing chaps, she is lowered from a cage into a boxing ring and dances, accompanied by several back-up dancers. A masked woman is {{lowered into the}} ring, and the two engage in foxy boxing. The scene is intercut with sequences of Aguilera dancing in a crop top, which she later removes to reveal a bra, and a microskirt. Redman then proceeds <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway,</b> passing people such as mud wrestlers, a contortionist, and furries. The video proceeds to a scene of Aguilera and back-up dancers splashing and dancing while being sprayed with water in a room containing several urinals, as a possible reference to urolagnia. It features several sexual fetishes, from mud wrestling to muscle worshipping.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} was filmed {{for the song}} and {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas. There are {{two versions of the}} video— one intercut with clips from the ABC series Dirty Sexy Money and created to promote the show, and another which is the official video. The video is set in a mansion, and starts with Gaga making her way <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> with several people who are either walking behind her, holding an umbrella over her, dancing in front of her, or tossing dollar bills around her. Gaga and company are then featured in many repeatedly-changing shots at various locations in the mansion. She is seen lying seductively on a table covered with money, crawling along a black grand piano and striking the keys with her leg several times, dancing around and later making out with a statue, and dancing in an elevator solo. There are also several close-up shots of her burning money and later stuffing it into her mouth. Over the course of the video, she undergoes numerous costume changes. Singer-songwriter Space Cowboy is also shown, most notably in scenes where he climbs a wall.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Scully {{notices that}} Miles (now on life support) has two heartbeats. At the FBI, Kersh unsuccessfully tries to {{convince}} Doggett to stop investigating Mulder's apparent death. A short while later, as Skinner walks <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway,</b> rogue agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) activates nanobots {{that he had}} previously placed in Skinner's bloodstream as blackmail. Skinner stumbles in pain, and in an elevator, Krycek reveals himself to Skinner and explains {{that he has a}} vaccine which could save Mulder's life. However, he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose. Later, alone in his hospital bed, Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower. While doing so, his decaying flesh falls away, revealing a healthy body beneath. He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity. Scully, however, gets a lab report which reveals that Miles's DNA has substantially changed; he is now a new being. Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder's disease, but does not explain Krycek's demands.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} {{connecting the}} band and school shootings continued on October 10, 2007, when 14-year-old SuccessTech Academy student Asa Coon shot four people before committing suicide. After being punched in the face by another student while exiting a bathroom, he shot his attacker – Michael Peek – in the abdomen. Armed with two revolvers, he then proceeded <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway,</b> where he wounded another student and two teachers by firing into two occupied classrooms, before entering a nearby bathroom and committing suicide.

500|$|Gaga teased on Twitter {{that the}} video {{would be her}} longest and [...] "the {{beginning}} of the story I never told you." [...] On November 11, 2011, she posted a still from the video on Twitter that shows her as she is sent <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> on a stretcher by two nurses. The post was accompanied by the message [...] "It's not that I've been dishonest, it's just that I loathe reality." [...] James Montgomery of MTV News compared the scene—known as [...] "The Prelude Pathétique"—to the 1975 drama film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and the 1980 horror film The Shining. Gaga teased a two-minute opening sequence of the music video on November 17,2011, after her performance at Children In Need Rocks Manchester.|$|E
500|$|The {{distribution}} of The Incredible Melting Man was handled by American International Pictures, with {{the involvement of}} film producer and distributor Irwin Yablans, who specialized primarily in B movies and low-budget horror films. A trailer released for the film attempted to build tension by not revealing the monster right away. Instead, it showed portions of the scene immediately before the nurse is murdered, in which she runs <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> screaming and then crashes through a glass window trying to escape from West, who is only shown {{towards the end of}} the trailer. In some advertisements, the monster from the film was described as [...] "the first NEW horror creature". As a promotional gimmick, candles were made and sold to advertise the film.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Paul Boyd. It depicts Twain wearing a long dress and a bindi. She is walking <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway,</b> attempting to go through several doors; however, they are all locked. Finally she finds an unlocked door, proceeds through it and finds an orchestra being led by a conductor. She stands in front and finishes singing the song. The video uses The Right Mix of the song. This re-recorded solo version features slightly more contemporized instrumentation and removes White's vocals. The version shown on Twain's video compilations [...] "" [...] and [...] "The Platinum Collection" [...] adds a short outtake during filming, in which Twain accidentally broke off a doorknob, {{to the end of}} the video.|$|E
50|$|Corridor style housing {{includes}} single, double, {{and triple}} rooms lined <b>down</b> <b>a</b> unisex <b>hallway,</b> with approximately 36 residents {{and one to}} two bathrooms per hallway. Suite style housing includes suites of six same-gendered people in three double bedrooms with a shared common space and bathroom. Bedrooms in suite style housing are smaller than corridor style, which are 150 sq. ft and 180 sq. ft respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Staples Center {{has been}} the home arena of both teams since 1999. Their locker rooms are 70 ft <b>down</b> <b>a</b> concrete-floored <b>hallway</b> from one another, inspiring the series between the two to {{sometimes}} {{be referred to as}} the [...] "Hallway Series". The name is patterned after other notable crosstown rivalries such as baseball's Subway Series in New York and the Freeway Series in Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|Reached via Milton Proby Parkway, the {{terminal}} {{consists of two}} concourses. However, only one, the larger concourse housing gates 1-12, has ever been put to commercial use; the second concourse (called the Western Pacific Airlines concourse) contains gates 14-18 (there is no gate 13) and is now mainly used for meetings. Access between the concourses requires leaving the secure area, walking through the main terminal and <b>down</b> <b>a</b> long <b>hallway.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Good Hit" [...] begins with Lopez holding a pointer {{in her left}} hand, while asking for the {{attention}} of the students. Two chalk boards are shown behind her, saying the words [...] "Fierceology" [...] and [...] "Work It Out 101". Lopez is then seen dancing on chairs with several female students, each with a hair dryer in hand. These scenes are intercut with Lopez teaching the students how to whip their hair. They then strut up and <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway.</b> The music video was noted for its sex appeal, in which Lopez and the students are dressed in Dolce & Gabbana. An alternate version of the video was leaked online in December 2011. This version begins with Lopez posing in front of a mirror, draped in jewelry and sitting on a couch with a telephone. This footage is taken from a behind the scenes look at the photoshoot for Love?. These scenes are intercut with that from the original version.|$|E
500|$|The children's book The World's Angriest Boy in the World, {{which appears}} in Haller's {{memories}} of his childhood, was written by Hawley and published {{for use in the}} show. Stevens described it as [...] "the world's most twisted children's book", but useful for him to hold and read while acting. The physical manifestation of the book's title character was inspired by Edward Gorey drawings, with Wylie explaining that he [...] "loved the idea of him wearing a little velvet, Eddie Munster child’s funeral suit. That’s where that dude came from. He’s really scary." [...] Another manifestation of the Shadow King, the Devil with the Yellow Eyes, was inspired by the reality television series My 600-lb Life, with Wylie explaining, [...] "They do this amazing thing at the beginning of every episode of that show where they show the person struggling {{to get out of bed}} or walk <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> ... They light it badly just to make the person’s journey seem that much more difficult." [...] Boisclair was cast in the role due to his [...] height and slender frame, with prosthetics used to give him a [...] "gigantic body with no neck [...] really skinny arms and legs". Boisclair was called a [...] "rare and lucky find", akin to Bolaji Badejo, who portrayed the alien in the 1979 film Alien. Boisclair's prosthetics were designed by Sarah Pickersgill, under special effects makeup head Todd Masters, and took four-and-a-half hours to apply. Masters' team were also responsible for creating the body parts that are found sticking out of walls in the pilot, including Lenny's upper body and arm, produced from a silicone copy of Plaza; extensive bruising for Cary and Kerry Loudermilk after a major fight sequence, which was achieved with Pros-Aide transfers that were reduced each day to show the wounds healing; and the burn makeup for Linklater after he is injured in the pilot, which was designed to cover half his face and most of his chest and back, with just the face and neck requiring five separate prosthetics. Marcine Peter at Contour Contact Lens provided hand-painted contact lenses for the production, including for Boisclair to wear as the Devil with the Yellow Eyes.|$|E
2500|$|By 2005, {{security}} director Steve Wilkos became {{sort of a}} cult {{figure on}} his own, and would close each show walking <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> engaging in casual talk {{with one of the}} more colorful guests of the preceding episode. [...] He also would occasionally host the show. Episodes that he hosted were intended to be more serious in tone than the typical Springer show. Wilkos left Springer {{at the end of the}} 2006–2007 season to pursue his own talk show, The Steve Wilkos Show.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Phil Griffin and filmed in late 2002. The video opens with a scene of Minogue walking <b>down</b> <b>a</b> futuristic <b>hallway</b> covered in photographs used to promote Neon Nights. She is then shown sitting and dancing in a blue room with the song's title swirling around her in numerous languages. The video concludes with scenes of Minogue crouching in a ventilation shaft and cutting her hair.|$|R
5000|$|LOOKS by Rob Pruitt and Marc Jacob: the {{participant}} is instructed to walk <b>down</b> <b>a</b> long green <b>hallway.</b> <b>As</b> they do so, someone barks orders to [...] "walk like a supermodel", [...] "don't smile", [...] "give attitude", etc. Upon exiting the hallway, {{the participant}} {{is faced with}} large projections of themselves superimposed into the Marc Jacobs fashion show.|$|R
50|$|The brick core {{comprises}} {{two rooms}} up and two <b>down,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> {{along the southern}} end of the ground floor leading from what was originally the front door in the western wall to a small stair hall in the SE corner of the building. There is an original arch between the hallway and the stair hall, and an early back door in the eastern external wall below the staircase. The lack of <b>a</b> central <b>hallway</b> is unusual in a house of this period, suggesting the design was the work of a competent architect who maximised the size and functionality of the rooms by offsetting the hallway.|$|R
2500|$|As {{with some}} of his other movies, Kubrick ends The Shining with a {{powerful}} visual puzzle that forces the audience to leave the theater asking, [...] "What was that all about?" [...] The Shining ends with an extremely long camera shot moving <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> in the Overlook, reaching eventually the central photo among 21 photos on the wall. The caption reads: [...] "Overlook Hotel-July 4th Ball-1921." [...] The answer to this puzzle, is that most Americans overlook the fact that July Fourth was no ball, nor any kind of Independence day, for native Americans; that the weak American villain of the film is the re-embodiment of the American men who massacred the Indians in earlier years; that Kubrick is examining and reflecting on a problem that cuts through the decades and centuries.|$|E
2500|$|On March 21, 2005, Weise killed {{nine people}} before killing {{himself in a}} murder–suicide. With a [...]22 caliber pistol that he had {{acquired}} {{up to a year}} before the shooting, Weise first killed his grandfather, 58 year old Daryl Lussier Sr. while he was asleep in bed and his grandfather's girlfriend, 32 year old Michelle Sigana while she was coming back upstairs from the basement with laundry. [...] He then took his grandfather's police issued firearms and drove his grandfather's police cruiser to the school. At the school, Weise shot and killed unarmed security guard Derrick Brun, 28, before going inside the school. Once inside, Weise fired randomly <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> and in a classroom, killing teacher Neva Wynkoop-Rogers, 62, and students Dewayne Lewis, 15; Chase Lussier, 15; Chanelle Rosebear, 15; Thurlene Stillday, 15, and Alicia White, 14. After engaging in a brief shootout with police and being injured in the hip and leg, Weise then retreated to another classroom and committed suicide using a shotgun.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins in}} a futuristic {{cafeteria}} with kids, dubbed the [...] "Warriorettes", {{sitting down at}} tables wearing all white while the tables and walls are gray. Smith then enters the room in colorful attire, including a blue vest, orange pants and a belt with her name on it, while donning rhinestones on her lips and extravagant nail tips. With her braids shaped to form a heart, she carries a boombox filled with paint and plays it while undoing her braids and dipping them into paint inside the stereo, using her hair as a paintbrush and enlivening the atmosphere with colors. Smith then performs dance moves and gets the classroom involved, which is intercut with the singer now donning a colorful mohawk, performing choreography with dancers with blue shirts {{in front of a}} light blue backdrop. She alternates different hairstyles, and then walks <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway</b> with her backup dancers, donning a cotton candy-esque hairstyle. She further whips her hair to give color to the lockers and students' attire, before performing extensive choreography with the hallway students. Midway, Smith and her dancers perform a dance routine with music not in the original song. The last scenes involves Smith with puff braids and in a yellow jumpsuit with her backup dancers in a different classroom {{trying to get them to}} dance, which is intercut with previous paint-splashing scenes, as the students, including her brother Jaden, teachers, janitor, elderly lady, and toddler dance. A writer for Rap-Up said that Smith [...] "is in a class of her own in the breakout video for her empowering anthem", calling the video [...] "the birth of more B.S.".|$|E
2500|$|It was an {{incredible}} camera setup. We rehearsed two days. The camera followed Greenstreet and Bogart from one room into another, then <b>down</b> <b>a</b> long <b>hallway</b> and finally into a living room; there the camera moved {{up and down in}} what is referred to as a boom-up and boom-down shot, then panned from left to right and back to Bogart's drunken face; the next pan shot was to Greenstreet's massive stomach from Bogart's point of view. ...

2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hallway,</b> through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E
