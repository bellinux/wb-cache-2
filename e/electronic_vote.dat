40|$|This paper {{examines}} the various {{different types of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems, and distinguishes between <b>electronic</b> machine <b>voting</b> and <b>electronic</b> distance <b>voting.</b> The prospects of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems are unclear; this paper observes some of the risks and the costs {{that are associated with}} <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems. This paper discusses security requirements when using information communications technologies in an <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system. This paper uses computer security requirements to develop a voter trust model that helps to identify weaknesses in <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems. This paper observes the security threats that may affect an <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system and that can compromise such a system. Diebold’s <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems highlight security concerns of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting.</b> To develop <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system governments must make considerations regarding the system and its characteristics, as these will inevitably affect its future...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is {{research}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> topics applied to conditions of University of Economics, Prague and the Czech Republic. It therefore consists of not only theoretical research but also of applied work. First goal of this paper was to provide information base both about (especially <b>electronic)</b> <b>voting</b> and significant <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> projects realized throughout the world. Consequent second goal was analysis and design of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> solution for chosen elections type at the University of Economics, Prague and proposal of possible process changes in chosen type of elections in the Czech republic should <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> be implemented. In it's first part the paper gathers, summarizes and presents information about (especially <b>electronic)</b> <b>voting</b> and chosen <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> implementations. The second part then describes chosen types of elections at the University of Economics, Prague and in the Czech Republic and analyzes their processes. In former case the analysis is followed by proposition and evaluation of possible <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> implementation variants of chosen elections type and detailed elaboration of the most suitable one. In latter case the paper goes on to describe possible process changes that could arise should <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> be implemented for chosen elections type in the Czech Republic. Author's contribution lies in fulfilling the goals of this thesis and performing the necessary activities leading to them. Following the (<b>electronic)</b> <b>voting</b> research the author has provides the reader with information base needed to quickly orientate tehmselves in the field of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting.</b> The author then leverages this information to research and process-analyze chosen types of elections at the University of Economics, Prague and in the Czech Republic, propose changes in mapped processes needed for eventual <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> implementation, present alternatives of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> implementation of chosen elections type at the University of Economics, Prague and elaborate on the chosen most suitable one...|$|R

In addition to providing instant Internet access to campaign finance reports, Jones launched the nation's first Internet site that carried live election returns on Election Day. Following the 2000 presidential election, Jones developed a 10-point election reform plan to modernize voting systems used in California. The plan was soon adopted as a national model for other states to use.

40|$|Abstract:-In this {{technological}} and knowledge age, e-commerce related matters become popular. <b>Electronic</b> <b>voting</b> {{is one of}} these matters and it is able to provide convenient, less expensive, fast and secure facilities. Important basic properties of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> are fairness, privacy, eligibility, receiptfreeness, coercion-resistance and verifiability. Current <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems satisfy only some of these properties. So, the proposed system aims to design and implement an <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system which satisfies the required properties of <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> process. After implementing the system, it will be verified using mCRL 2 language in order to prove the satisfaction of the security properties. The performance of the proposed system will be compared with the other existing e-voting systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Many <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems, {{classified}} {{mainly as}} homomorphic cryptography based, mix-net based and blind signature based, appear after the eighties when zero knowledge proofs were introduced. The common ground {{for all these}} three systems {{is that none of}} them works without real time cryptologic calculations that should be held on a server. As far as known, the agent-based approach has not been used in a secure <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system. In this study, an agent-based <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> schema, which does not contain real time calculations on the server side, is proposed. Conventional cryptologic methods are used in the proposed schema and some of the requirements of an <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> system are constructed within the schema. The schema seems quite secure if the used cryptologic methods and agents are secure. In this paper, proposed schema will be explained and compared with already known <b>electronic</b> <b>voting</b> systems.
