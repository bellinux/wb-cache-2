5|$|Blackwood rapidly gained on {{the ship}} {{of the line and}} by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under the stern of Guillaume Tell and {{beginning}} a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in the stern of the ship. Decrés recognised that if <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> engage Penelope then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy ship of the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' stern repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the space}} of six days, Galland's friend, Steinhoff was badly burned in a crash on 18 April, and then, on 24 April, his friend Lützow was posted missing. On 21 April, Galland was {{credited}} with his 100th aerial victory. He was the 103rd and last Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark. On 26 April, Galland claimed his 103rd and 104th aerial victories against B-26s, escorted by the 27th Fighter Group and 50th Fighter Group. Galland again made a mistake; <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> make sure his second victory was going to crash and {{he was hit by}} a USAAF P-47 Thunderbolt piloted by James Finnegan. Galland nursed his crippled Me 262 to the airfield, only to find it was under attack by more P-47s. Galland landed under fire and abandoned his jet on the runway. The battle was his last operational mission. Soon afterward, he was sent to hospital for a knee wound sustained during his last mission. The Americans lost four B-26s and another six damaged. In return two Me 262s were shot down: the other pilot surviving.|$|E
5|$|The Abbot-Emeritus of the Abbey of New Clairvaux, Fr.Thomas X.Davis, OCSO, {{first saw}} the stones and pictured them {{reassembled}} as a monastery on September 15, 1955—his first day in California. He arrived that day in San Francisco {{to serve as a}} new monk in Vina, California, at the monastery of Our Lady of New Clairvaux. The monastery belonged to Trappists of the order known as Cistercians of the Strict Observance. The monks farmed and worshiped on land once used by Leland Stanford to grow wine grapes. Davis's superior met him at the airport and drove him through Golden Gate Park where <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> show Davis the stones sitting among the weeds. From time to time in subsequent years, Davis inspected the stones only to find them in increasingly poor condition.|$|E

5|$|Reflections on {{the race}} by the organisers and the media {{generally}} concluded that the Grand Prix had been a poor replacement for the Gordon Bennett races. In part, this had been because the race was too long, and the system of starting the race—with each car leaving at 90-second intervals—had meant {{that there had been}} very little interaction between the competitors, simply cars driving their own races to time. The ACF decided that too much pressure had been put on drivers and riding mechanics by forbidding others to work on the cars during the race. It was also felt that the outcome of the race had been too dependent on the use of Michelin's detachable rims. Clément had driven the only Clément-Bayard to not have the rims, and it was thought that this contributed to Nazzaro passing him on the second day as <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> change tyres. Despite this, the ACF decided to run the Grand Prix again the following year. The publicity generated by the race prompted the German governing body to organise a similar event that favoured their own industry. The forerunner to the German Grand Prix, the Kaiserpreis (Kaiser's Prize) was raced in 1907.|$|E

Phillimore responded by appointing the chaplain 'acting-bishop of St Michael's', and the consecration was duly carried out.|$|E

500|$|Moffat's plan [...] "from the outset", to tie {{the episode}} into the {{overarching}} story arc of the series, was that Rory not just die but be erased from history in {{the crack in the}} universe.

Moffat also thought it was appropriate as the trio had had fun, and now {{it was time for a}} casualty. Rory's death is also connected with Chibnall's theme of making mistakes; it was the Doctor's fault as <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>to</b> look at the crack. Gillan called the scene [...] "incredibly challenging" [...] for her to perform and tried to make it [...] "truthful and believable".|$|E
500|$|Several {{incidents}} hindered {{the production}} of the episode.
