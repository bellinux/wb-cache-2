40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{computer vision system}} for an autonomous road vehicle (ARV) {{that is capable of}} negotiating complex road networks including <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> in real time. The ultimate aim of the system is to enable the vehicle to drive automatically along a given complex road network whose geometric description is known. This computer vision system includes three main techniques which are necessary for an ARV: a) road following, b) <b>road</b> <b>junction</b> detection, c) manoeuvring at the <b>road</b> <b>junction.</b> The <b>road</b> following algorithm {{presents a}} method of executing a number of algorithms using different methods concurrently, fusing their outputs together into an accurate road model. A model-based object approach is used for detecting the <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> in images. In this approach two sequence processes are performed. They are to find a boundary between the candidate <b>road</b> <b>junction</b> surface and the current road surface, and to locate the <b>road</b> <b>junction</b> surface. A multi-camera vision-based re-orientation mode was used to guide the ARV during the manoeuvring process at the <b>road</b> <b>junction.</b> In the re-orientation mode, the position of the ARV with respect to the <b>road</b> <b>junction</b> is determined by the “bootstrap ” process. The results are presented for real road stretches and intersection images and performed on the experimental autonomous road vehicle in real time...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lead {{pollution}} and lead tolerance levels of microbes in soil at major <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> in Benin City were investigated. Results revealed that {{distance from the}} <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> affected the concentrations of lead in soil, {{as well as the}} microbial population density and types of microbes present in the soil. The highest concentrations of lead were recorded with soil samples obtained at 0 and 10 m distance closer to <b>road</b> <b>junctions,</b> while the lowest concentrations were recorded with soil samples obtained at 30 m distance away from <b>road</b> <b>junctions.</b> The highest concentrations recorded for lead, copper and iron were 32 x 101 mg kg- 1, 8 x 10 - 1 mg kg- 1 6. 3 x 10 - 1 respectively. All these levels decreased rapidly as the distance from the road increased. Bacterial counts increased as the distance from the <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> increased. While fungal counts decreased as distance from <b>road</b> <b>junctions</b> increased. Lead tolerance range of bacterial and fungal isolates was between 10 to 1000 mg 1 - 1. Non-significant, negative correlation was found between lead concentration and microbal counts. The bacteria and fungi most frequently isolated at 0 and 10 m distance were Pseudomonas sp., Micrococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Candida utilis, Penicillium sp and the yeast Saccharromyces cerevisiae...|$|R
