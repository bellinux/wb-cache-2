40|$|Established {{entrepreneurial}} intentions models {{argue that}} entrepreneurial intentions are largely a function <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>desirability</b> and perceptions <b>of</b> feasibility. Recent research however, {{has suggested that}} the relationship between perceptions <b>of</b> <b>desirability</b> and perceptions <b>of</b> feasibility may be more complex. In this paper we investigate how perceptions <b>of</b> <b>desirability</b> interact with perceptions of feasibility in the formation of entrepreneurial intentions. Using a relatively large multi-country sample we find that consistent with previous research, entrepreneurial intentions are positively related to both perceptions <b>of</b> <b>desirability</b> and perceptions <b>of</b> feasibility. In addition, we find evidence of a significant interaction effect between perceptions <b>of</b> <b>desirability</b> and perceptions <b>of</b> feasibility. While conventional wisdom might suggest a positive interaction, we find this interaction effect to be negative. Thus, the study not only supports the contention by McMullen & Shepherd (2006) that individuals who are not necessarily highly motivated might act entrepreneurially if they have high perceived self-efficacy, but also supports the converse argument that highly motivated individuals might act entrepreneurially even if they have low perceived self-efficacy. These findings have important implications for both theory and practice...|$|R

5|$|The Ikarus IK-2 was a 1930s high-wing, single-seat, {{monoplane}} fighter aircraft of Yugoslav design {{built for}} the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. The IK-2 was designed by French-trained engineers Kosta Sivčev and Ljubomir Ilić, who saw the <b>desirability</b> <b>of</b> a developing a home-grown aircraft industry. A gull-wing design, it was armed with a hub-firing autocannon and fuselage-mounted synchronised machine guns. Just 12 production models were built, as the aircraft was obsolescent {{at the time it}} was brought into service in 1935, and only eight were serviceable at the time of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After the defeat of Yugoslavia, the remaining four aircraft were taken onto the strength of the air force of the Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, but none survived the war.|$|E

Korais explained about the necessity of a periodical that would gather material from political and philological newspapers of the enlightened peoples of Europe and contain reports from Ottoman-ruled Greece. He also stressed that this should be edited by a man of learning, and proposed that his friend Anthimos Gazis, scholar and Orthodox priest in Vienna, would be the most suitable person.|$|E

5|$|The Joker is {{considered}} one of, if not, the most-recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture (Batman's arguable equal), {{one of the best}} comic villains, and one of the greatest villains of all-time. The character was well-liked following his debut, appearing in nine out of the first twelve Batman issues, and remained one of Batman's most popular foes throughout his publication. The character {{is considered}} one of the four top comic book characters, alongside Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man. Indeed, when DC Comics released the original series of Greatest Stories Ever Told (1987–1988) featuring collections of stories about heroes like Batman and Superman, the Joker was the only villain included alongside them. The character has been the focus of ethical discussion on the <b>desirability</b> <b>of</b> Batman (who adheres to an unbreakable code forbidding killing) saving lives by murdering the Joker (a relentless dealer of death). These debates weigh the positive (stopping the Joker permanently) against its effect on Batman's character and the possibility that he might begin killing all criminals.|$|E
5|$|The process {{required}} {{a range of}} equipment. Some of this was protective equipment to allow the workforce and horses to operate safely on ice, including cork shoes {{for the men and}} spiked horse shoes. Early in the 19th century only ad hoc, improvised tools such as pickaxes and chisels were used {{for the rest of the}} harvest, but in the 1840s Wyeth introduced various new designs to allow for a larger scale, more commercial harvesting process. These included a horse-drawn ice cutter, resembling a plough with two parallel cutters to help in marking out the ice quickly and uniformly, and later a horse-drawn plough with teeth to assist in the cutting process itself, replacing the hand saw. By the 1850s, specialist ice tool manufacturers were producing catalogues and selling products along the east coast. There were discussions over the <b>desirability</b> <b>of</b> a circular cutting saw for much of the 19th century, but it proved impractical to power them with horses and they were not introduced to ice harvesting until the start of the 20th century, when gasoline engines became available.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the <b>desirability</b> <b>of</b> their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are {{valuable}} on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the ascent}} of the Bourbon monarchy in Spain in 1700, {{each of the}} regions of Spain {{retained}} its own system of measurement. The new Bourbon monarchy tried to centralise control {{and with it the}} system of measurement. There were debates regarding the <b>desirability</b> <b>of</b> retaining the Castilian units of measure or, in the interests of harmonisation, adopting the French system. Although Spain assisted Méchain in his meridian survey, the Government feared the French revolutionary movement and reinforced the Castilian units of measure to counter such movements. By 1849 however, it proved difficult to maintain the old system and in that year the metric system became the legal system of measure in Spain.The Government was urged by the Spanish Royal Academy of Science to approve the creation of a large-scale map of Spain in 1852. The following year Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was appointed to undertake this task. All the scientific and technical material had to be created. Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero and Saavedra went to Paris to supervise the production by Brunner of a measuring instrument which they had devised and which they later compared with Borda's double-toise N°1 which was the main reference for measuring all geodetic bases in France and whose length was 3.8980732 metres.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of selling $n$ items to a single buyer with an {{additive}} valuation function. We consider the valuation of the items to be correlated, i. e., <b>desirabilities</b> <b>of</b> the buyer for the items are not drawn independently. Ideally, {{the goal is to}} design a mechanism to maximize the revenue. However, {{it has been shown that}} a revenue optimal mechanism might be very complicated and as a result inapplicable to real-world auctions. Therefore, our focus is on designing a simple mechanism that achieves a constant fraction of the optimal revenue. Babaioff et al. propose a simple mechanism that achieves a constant fraction of the optimal revenue for independent setting with a single additive buyer. However, they leave the following problem as an open question: "Is there a simple, approximately optimal mechanism for a single additive buyer whose value for $n$ items is sampled from a common base-value distribution?" Babaioff et al. show a constant approximation factor of the optimal revenue can be achieved by either selling the items separately or as a whole bundle in the independent setting. We show a similar result for the correlated setting when the <b>desirabilities</b> <b>of</b> the buyer are drawn from a common base-value distribution. It is worth mentioning that the core decomposition lemma which is mainly the heart of the proofs for efficiency of the mechanisms does not hold for correlated settings. Therefore we propose a modified version of this lemma which is applicable to the correlated settings as well. Although we apply this technique to show the proposed mechanism can guarantee a constant fraction of the optimal revenue in a very weak correlation, this method alone can not directly show the efficiency of the mechanism in stronger correlations...|$|R
