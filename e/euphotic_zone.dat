5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the <b>euphotic</b> <b>zone,</b> thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the <b>euphotic</b> <b>zone),</b> which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E

The lakes with D. commutata had significantly lower C:P ratio than those without these daphnids. On the other hand, those lakes where Daphnia is present have the lower predation risk than those were Daphnia is absent. In addition, we carried out growth experiments with neonates and natural seston of three lakes with different C:P ratio. The growth rates were inversely related with C:P of the food.

40|$|Application of resource-based {{competition}} {{theory to}} high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll {{regions of the}} ocean suggests that single-factor controls on vertical export rates of carbon from <b>euphotic</b> <b>zones</b> are unlikely. High specific rates of grazing or sinking losses interact with growth physiology to produce nutrient requirements in situ that are much higher than those required {{for the growth of}} populations held in bottle bioassays. The efficiency of vertical export of carbon by sinking partic-ulates can vary with species composition of the plankton, which in turn can be altered by nutrient manipulation. A simulation model explores possible changes to species composition and vertical carbon flux which might result from addition of Fe ito Southern Ocean plankton communities. Nutrient manipulation permits invasion of plankton communities by taxa not originally present and does not necessarily increase the biomass or metabolism of resident species. This makes a priori prediction of fluxes associated with an enriched and altered community fundamentally uncertain if predictions are based on stoichiometries and physiologies of the original resident taxa. Vertical carbon flux could either increase or decrease in response to single-element addition, depending on the attributes of the invading species...|$|R

The amount of ammonium in the ocean is about 3 orders of magnitude less than nitrate. Between ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, nitrite has the fastest turnover rate. It can be produced during nitrate assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification; however, it is immediately consumed again.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{differences}} in the species compositions and absolute abundances of planktonic microorganisms in fresh- and saltwater, there are broad similarities in microbial food webs across systems. Relative abundances of bacteria and nanoplanktonic protozoa (HNAN, primarily heterotrophic flagellates) are similar in marine and freshwater environments, which suggests analogous trophic relationships. Ranges of microbe abundances in marine and fresh waters overlap, and seasonal changes in abundances within an ecosystem are often as great as {{differences in}} abundances between freshwater and marine systems of similar productivities. Densities of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoplankton, therefore, are strongly related {{to the degree of}} eutrophication, and not salt per se. Data from the literature is compiled to demonstrate a remarkably consistent numerical relationship (ca 1000 bacteria: 1 HNAN) between bacterioplankton and HNAN from the <b>euphotic</b> <b>zones</b> of a variety of marine and freshwater systems. Based on the results of a simple food web model involving bacterial growth, bacterial removal by HNAN, predation on HNAN, and the observed relationships between bacterial and HNAN abundances in natural ecosystems, it is possible to demonstrate that bottom-up control (food supply) is more important in regulating bacterial abundances in oligotrophic environments while top-down control (predation) is more important in eutrophic environments...|$|R

However, the underlying mechanisms for the process remain unknown, although they {{have been linked to}} the semiconducting characteristics of hexagonal birnessite, the ubiquitous Mn(IV) oxide produced mainly by bacterial oxidation of soluble Mn(II). One of the universal properties of this biogenic mineral is the presence of Mn(IV) vacancies, long-identified as strong adsorption sites for metal cations. In this paper, the possible role of Mn vacancies in photoreductive dissolution is investigated theoretically using quantum mechanical calculations based on spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT). Our DFT study demonstrates unequivocally that Mn vacancies significantly reduce the band-gap energy for hexagonal birnessite relative to a hypothetical vacancy-free MnO{sub 2 } and thus would increase the concentration of photo-induced electrons available for Mn(IV) reduction upon illumination of the mineral by sunlight. Calculations of the charge distribution in the presence of vacancies, although not fully conclusive, show a clear separation of photo-induced electrons and holes, implying a slow recombination of these charge-carriers that facilitates the two-electron reduction of Mn(IV) to Mn(II) ...|$|R

The light fields within the crusts presented steep vertical gradients in magnitude and spectral composition. Near-surface light-trapping zones were formed due to the scattering nature of the sand particles, but strong light attenuation resulted in <b>euphotic</b> <b>zones</b> only ca. 1 mm deep, which were progressively enriched in longer wavelengths with depth. Rates of gross photosynthesis (3. 4 – 9. 4 mmol O 2 ·m− 2 ·h− 1) and dark respiration (0. 81 – 3. 1 mmol O− 2 ·m− 2 ·h− 1) occurring within 1 to several mm from the surface were high enough to drive the formation of marked oxygen microenvironments that ranged from oxygen supersaturation to anoxia. The photosynthetic activity also resulted in localized pH values in excess of 10, 2 – 3 units above the soil pH. Differences in metabolic parameters and community structure between two types of crusts were consistent with a successional pattern, which could be partially explained {{on the basis of}} the microenvironments.

2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{is an important}} process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N2 from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria. Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years. Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. [...] Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the <b>euphotic</b> <b>zone</b> by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the <b>euphotic</b> <b>zone.</b> Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the <b>euphotic</b> <b>zone.</b> Ammonification or Mineralization is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. Nitrification can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate.

40|$|Periphyton and {{phytoplankton}} {{contribute to}} the base of lake food webs, and both groups of microalgae are influenced by resources and physical forcing. Spatial variation in light availability interacts with the physical dynamics of the water column to create predictable depth gradients in resources and disturbance that may differentially affect periphyton vs phytoplankton. We characterized the depth distribution of chlorophyll and productivity of periphyton on sediments (epipelon) and phytoplankton in the <b>euphotic</b> <b>zones</b> of 13 oligomesotrophic lakes that span a large size gradient (0. 017 – 32, 600 km 2). Epipelic chlorophyll usually increased with depth in the epilimnion. Light was the primary driver of the consistent within-lake patterns in periphyton productivity across this lake-size gradient. In 5 lakes, epipelic periphyton exhibited a unimodal distribution of productivity with depth in the photic zone, but no evidence of photoinhibition was found for periphyton. Rather, patterns in sediment N and P and observed changes in biofilm structure were consistent with determination of epipelic biomass by disturbance at depths ≤ 1 m in the smaller lakes and by light limitation at depths > 1 m. Further quantification of the effects of disturbance on epipelon is needed. Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that the perceived high spatial variability in periphyton biomass and productivity is not an impediment to development of robust models of whole-lake primary production that include both phytoplankton and periphyton...|$|R

30|$|SCU {{patterns}} of chromatophore genome of P. chromatophora and S. elongatus may be {{closely associated with}} living habitats. The adapted habitat of P. chromatophora is a submerged vegetation in freshwater. Mud loving nature of this organism protects it from potential extrinsic mutagens like UV-B radiation and which in turn causes genome wide mutation as reported in Prochlorococcus (Partensky et al. 1999). Freshwater β – cyanobacterium S. elongatus PCC 6301 is less adaptive to varying environments as it resides strictly in <b>euphotic</b> <b>zones,</b> relatively with low nutrient contents at mesophilic temperature (Waterbury et al. 1986) unlike marine Synechococcus which is more adaptive to grow in varying nutrient conditions and temperatures (Moore et al. 1998). To make marine Synechococcus more adaptive to environment, translational selection shapes the codon usage patterns (Yu et al. 2012) but mutational pressure frames codon usage in less adaptive fresh water S. elongatus. Closely related species, living in distinct environments may exhibit considerable genomic diversity (Paul et al. 2010) that lead to differences in factors behind diversification of SCU patterns. Mutational pressure {{was found to be}} the major factor, influencing SCU pattern across PCG in strictly thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP- 1 (Prabha et al. 2012) which is less adaptive to other temperature ranges as growth of thermophiles is restricted to particular environment at specific temperature (Botzman and Margalit 2011). These reports support our finding that SCU pattern of P. chromatophora and S. elongatus is dictated by mutational pressure due to their less adaptation to varying environments.|$|R

One reason is that only continual input of new nitrogen can determine the total capacity of the ocean to produce a sustainable fish harvest. Harvesting fish from regenerated nitrogen areas will lead to a decrease in nitrogen and therefore a decrease in primary production. This will have a negative effect on the system. However, if fish are harvested from areas of new nitrogen the nitrogen will be replenished.|$|E
2500|$|One way to {{increase}} the carbon sequestration efficiency of the oceans is to add micrometre-sized iron particles {{in the form of}} either hematite (iron oxide) or melanterite (iron sulfate) to certain regions of the ocean. This has the effect of stimulating growth of plankton. [...] Iron is an important nutrient for phytoplankton, usually made available via upwelling along the continental shelves, inflows from rivers and streams, as well as deposition of dust suspended in the atmosphere. Natural sources of ocean iron have been declining in recent decades, contributing to an overall decline in ocean productivity (NASA, 2003). [...] Yet in the presence of iron nutrients plankton populations quickly grow, or 'bloom', expanding the base of biomass productivity throughout the region and removing significant quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere via photosynthesis. [...] A test in 2002 in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica suggests that between 10,000 and 100,000 carbon atoms are sunk for each iron atom added to the water. [...] More recent work in Germany (2005) suggests that any biomass carbon in the oceans, whether exported to depth or recycled in the <b>euphotic</b> <b>zone,</b> represents long-term storage of carbon. [...] This means that application of iron nutrients in select parts of the oceans, at appropriate scales, could have the combined effect of restoring ocean productivity {{while at the same time}} mitigating the effects of human caused emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.|$|E

Here we investigated AAPB genetic {{diversity in the}} surface waters and upper twilight zones of the central Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans by amplifying an AAPB marker gene (pufM, encoding photosynthetic reaction center small subunit) directly from bacterioplankton community DNA. Phylogenetic and statistical analysis of 267 pufM partial sequences in six clone libraries revealed a high diversity pattern in open ocean AAPB communities. Various AAPB subgroups belonging to Alpha- and Gamma-proteobacteria were found in both surface and upper twilight zone waters.

We observed that, while Lcv> 0. 5 may represent forests with large tree size inequality, Lskew> 0 can be an indicator for areas lacking a closed dominant canopy. Lcv= 0. 5 discriminated forests with trees of approximately equal sizes (even tree size classes) from those with large tree size inequality (uneven tree size classes) with kappa κ = 0. 48 and overall accuracy OA = 92. 4 %, while Lskew= 0 segregated oligophotic and <b>euphotic</b> <b>zones</b> with κ = 0. 56 and OA = 84. 6 %.

The study was carried out with low-density datasets from the national program on ALS surveying of Finland, which shows potential for replication with the ALS datasets typically acquired at nation-wide scales.

The earliest ore-scale phosphorite depositions formed almost at approximately 2. 0 - 2. 2 billion years ago bear evidence for the earliest bloom of aerobic life. The cycling of nutrient phosphorus and how it constrained primary productivity in the anaerobic world of Archean-Palaeoproterozoic eons are still open questions. The controversy centers about whether the precipitation of ultrafine ferric oxyhydroxide due to the microbial Fe(II) oxidation in oceans earlier than 1. 9 billion years substantially sequestrated phosphate, and whether this process significantly limited the primary productivity of the early biosphere. In this study, we report apatite radial flowers of a few micrometers in the 2728 million-year-old Abitibi banded iron formation and the 2460 million-year-old Kuruman banded iron formation and their similarities to those in the 535 million-year-old Lower Cambrian phosphorite. The lithology of the 535 Million-year-old phosphorite as a biosignature bears abundant biomarkers that reveal the possible similar biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus in the Later Archean and Palaeoproterozoic oceans. These apatite radial flowers represent the primary precipitation of phosphate derived from the phytoplankton blooms in the <b>euphotic</b> <b>zones</b> of Neoarchean and Palaoeproterozoic oceans.

In this chapter, the organisation of PGCs in 10 AAPB strains belonging to the Roseobacter, Eryth Citro and NOR 5 /OM 60 clades is summarised. The distribution of four types of gene arrangements, based on permutation and combination of the two conserved regions bchFNBHLM-Iha-puhABC and crtF-bchCXYZ does not correspond to the phylogenetic affiliation of individual AAPB. While PGCs of all analysed species contain the same set of genes for BChl synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic centres, they differ greatly in the carotenoid biosynthetic genes. Spheroidenone, spirilloxanthin, and zeaxanthin biosynthetic pathways were found separately in each clade. The AAPB in Roseobacter and the NOR 5 /OM 60 clades are closely related to purple non-sulfur bacteria. To date, only the AAPB in the Eryth Citro clade are obligately aerobic phototrophs with unique carotenoid biosynthetic pathways and pigments, compared to the other clades. Interestingly, members of the Eryth Citro clade possess the shortest and simplest PGC structure of the known AAPB, and the light-harvesting complex 2 genes are completely absent; perhaps this indicates that the AAPB in this clade arose more recently than their counterparts in other clades.

JL 354, which contains two copies of RC genes, and Citromicrobial strain JLT 1363, which is chemotrophic, revealed evidence for the loss of photosynthesis genes. The incomplete PGC (pufLMC-puhCBA) in strain JL 354 was located within a putative integrating conjugative element, which indicates a potential mechanism for the horizontal transfer of genes for phototrophy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{remote sensing}} {{reflectance}} Rrs, concentrations of chlorophyll a and other pigments Ci, {{suspended particulate matter}} concentrations CSPM and coloured dissolved organic matter absorption coefficient aCDOM(λ) were measured in the <b>euphotic</b> <b>zones</b> of 15 Pomeranian lakes in 2007 – 2010. On the basis of 235 sets of data points obtained from simultaneous estimates of these quantities, we classified the lake waters into three types. The first one, with the lowest aCDOM(440 nm) (usually between 0. 1 and 1. 3 m− 1 and chlorophyll a concentrations 1. 3 10 m− 1, up to 17. 4 m− 1 in Lake Pyszne; it has a relatively low reflectance (Rrs 4 mg m− 3, up to 336 mg m− 3 in Lake Gardno). The remote sensing reflectance spectra in these waters always exhibit three peaks (Rrs > 0. 005 sr− 1) : a broad one at 560 – 580 nm, a smaller one at ca 650 nm and a well-pronounced one at 690 – 720 nm. These Rrs(λ) peaks correspond to the relatively low absorption of light by the various optically active components of the lake water and the considerable scattering (over the entire spectral range investigated) due to the high SPM concentrations there. The remote sensing maximum at λ ≈ 690 – 720 nm is higher still {{as a result of}} the natural fluorescence of chlorophyll a. Empirical relationships between the spectral reflectance band ratios at selected wavelengths and the various optically active components for these lake waters are also established: for example, the chlorophyll a concentration in surface water layer Ca= 6. 432 e 4. 556 X, where X=[max Rrs(695 ≤ λ ≤ 720) – Rrs(λ= 670) ]/max Rrs(695 ≤ λ ≤ 720), and the coefficient of determination R 2 = 0. 95...|$|R
40|$|Diatoms are microscopic, phototrophic, {{unicellular}} algae {{encased in}} a porous, rigid, siliceous, cell wall known as a frustule and they inhabit the <b>euphotic</b> <b>zones</b> in bodies of seawater and freshwater globally. It is not yet fully understood how diatoms compete with swimming microorganisms for nutrients in their environment. It is believed that the frustule does {{play a role in}} giving them a competitive advantage, however, the function of the diatoms&rsquo; frustule is not yet fully understood. Among other functions it has been proposed that the frustule acts like a filter for the diatom, sorting nutrients from harmful entities such as pathogens, poisons, colloids and pollutants, from their natural environment. As a result of the micro- and nanoscopic nature of the frustule and its features, diffusion is thought {{to play an important role}} in the frustules filtering capabilities. It has been proposed that specific centric species of diatom employ the drift ratchet mechanism to sort and control mass transport towards and away from the diatom cell. This research has determined that this is unlikely due to the size and configuration of the diatom girdle band pores. Instead, a new theory is presented herein, termed &ldquo;Hydrodynamic Immunity&rdquo;, in which diatoms use diffusiophoresis to separate nutrients from harmful entities. In conjunction with this work the dimensionless numbers critical for dynamic similarity analysis of a drift ratchet are determined to allow for easy comparison between dynamically similar experiments. Finally, a novel hydrodynamic drift ratchet microfluidic device was designed and fabricated as a proof-of-concept to prove definitively whether the drift ratchet mechanism can be generated in an experimental environment, following inconclusive findings from past research experiments. This remains unresolved due to experimental complications; however improvements are suggested to ensure future work is successful at recreating a drift ratchet in experiments...|$|R
