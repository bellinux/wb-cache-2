5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found <b>in</b> <b>people</b> with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected <b>in</b> <b>people</b> without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E

5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred <b>in</b> <b>people</b> under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred <b>in</b> <b>people</b> under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the Russian flu.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated <b>in</b> <b>people</b> with myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used <b>in</b> <b>people</b> with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history}} of alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E

5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, <b>in</b> <b>people</b> with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. <b>In</b> <b>people</b> requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed <b>in</b> <b>people</b> undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal <b>in</b> <b>people</b> with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
