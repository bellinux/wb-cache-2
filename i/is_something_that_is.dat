Human activities can also impose forcings, for example, through changing the composition of the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|I {{must tell}} you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E
25|$|While {{objective}} truths are {{final and}} static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective {{experience that is}} always {{in the process of}} becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.|$|E
25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> very seldom {{found in the}} art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had seen them in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut I talked with a man who might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E

25|$|This {{perspective}} {{examines how}} the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged {{new and different}} forms of creativity in language, especially in literature. It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study {{because it is an}} amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen. Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. This <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> usually not found in written language.|$|E
25|$|On the {{philosophy}} behind {{the process of}} reservation itself, the people in favour of reservation feel that reservation is necessary to undo and counter the 'evils' of centuries of caste system that prevailed in the country. Reservation proponents also contend that merit as it is defined today <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> achieved {{with the help of}} cramming, tutoring, constant guidance, quality schooling and knowledge of English and poor Dalits, poor MBC's lack most of these. This (the argument cnetering on cramming, tutoring, etc.) the anti-reservationists do not accept, pointing out that not all high-scorers at the exams can hope to eventually succeed in translating their knowledge into skills, but low-scorers especially in higher education will also score badly on the skill ladder proportionately much more than high-scorers. They also suggest that the examination-based approach to merit evaluation calls for a modification to better reflect meritorious performance in practical demonstration of skills, but casteist reservation does not have anything to offer as a solution in this regard. Which, they add, only goes to expose the foul game of the politicians of India many of whom have a record of strongly alleged offences and crimes of numerous types.|$|E

500|$|In 1994 Keating led a {{group of}} liberals in a failed coup to remove state Senate President William Bulger, a fellow Democrat, from his position. Keating, a staunch liberal {{relative}} to the more socially conservative Bulger, sought to reform the Senate rules to greatly reduce the president's power. Bulger, who had held the Senate gavel for 15 years, exerted strict control over the body's operations, but was gradually losing his power base with new crops of Democratic freshmen replacing his longtime allies. Keating's campaign failed, but he said during his 2010 election campaign: [...] "The thought that I took on the most powerful person in Massachusetts, risking my whole career, a member of my own party, <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> resonating in this campaign, that helps define me as independent." ...|$|E

500|$|Scenes showing Kristy McNichol innocently burying {{her hands}} in the dog's fur and his normal loving {{behavior}} when alone with her provides a stark image of [...] "how hatred can be familiar, reassuringly close." [...] J. Hoberman argues that the film [...] "naturalizes racism in an unnatural way" [...] in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog's behavior, and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life. The film's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller's own view that racism <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> learned, but that once learned is a [...] "poison" [...] that can never truly [...] "be banished from those it infects." [...] But on the other hand, the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks, but not cured of his own hatred since the last thing he does is to attack a white man, and without being provoked into doing so at that. The ending implies therefore that it is hatred (and not racism) that cannot be banished from those it infects.|$|E
500|$|Borscht is {{associated}} with and claimed by several ethnic groups, especially Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews, as their own national or ethnic dish and cultural icon. Such claims are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as the soup's history predates the emergence in Eastern Europe of modern nation states with their ever-shifting borders. Borscht, {{in the words of}} Burlakoff, [...] "is perfectly suited to a global culture." [...] He describes it as [...] "a global phenomenon", in which [...] "local variants are so numerous and diverse that it is hard sometimes for a non-specialist to grasp that any single example of it <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> part of a unified tradition." [...] In his view, borscht [...] "is an almost perfect example of... 'glocalization' – a phenomenon that is global in distribution but reflective of local needs and ways in its variants and adaptation;... a highly localized product that became globalized, and in the process adapted to conditions other than the original ones." [...] However, according to Irina Perianova, a Russian linguist and anthropologist, [...] "people tend to be very proprietal about their food and proud of it." [...] Perianova offers competing Russian and Ukrainian views on the origin and ingredients of borscht as an example of [...] "a common connection between culinary and territorial claims", which results in the culinary area turning into [...] "a battlefield generating and proliferating all kinds of myths." ...|$|E
