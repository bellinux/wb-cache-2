500|$|Later {{commentators}} generally {{described the}} Arthurdale experiment as a failure. Roosevelt herself was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit {{in which she}} felt the town had become excessively dependent on outside assistance. However, the residents considered the town a [...] "utopia" [...] compared to their previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency. Roosevelt personally considered the project a success, later speaking of the improvements she saw in people's lives there and stating, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> think that is worth half a million dollars. But I do." ...|$|E
500|$|URBs Dan Vidal {{called the}} album [...] "a {{spectrum}} of sound — packed and arranged perfectly into a masterfully composed (debut) full-length body of work... genre-defying masterpiece". Comparing it to singer Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989), Brentin Mock of The Atlantic called The ArchAndroid [...] "a smothered funk, though perhaps at times too thick, too inaccessible, {{but not so}} much I didn't want to shake my ass" [...] and viewed it as musically progressive, stating [...] "Monáe has given pop music its first Toni Morrison moment, where fantasy, funk, and the ancestors come together for an experience that evolves one's soul... You really don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> want to diagram it, dance to it, or just be dumbstruck. It owes as much to Parliament-Funkadelic as it does to Samuel R. Delany and Octavia E. Butler. She is finally doing what a number of artists—particularly black artists—have not been able to do in years, and that's move pop music forward". Robert Christgau was less impressed in The Barnes & Noble Review, deeming it [...] "the most overrated album of the year" [...] while writing that Monáe's [...] "songwriting is 60th percentile, her singing technical, her sci-fi plot the usual rot".|$|E

2500|$|It was {{incredible}} really. In 1977, I flew over to England {{with the players}} {{and that was the}} flight on which Rodney Marsh broke the world beer drinking record. Three-quarters of the players on that flight had signed these sensational Packer contracts and they were all as drunk as you could imagine. But the secret still didn't get out. I sat beside Hookesy on the flight over and I had been best man at his wedding and not even he breathed a word of it to me... I went up and talked to Hookesy he said: [...] "Sorry mate, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> had signed or not." [...] Hookesy said he had wanted to tell me, but he just couldn't.|$|E
2500|$|Pete McCloskey gave {{an address}} to the Institute for Historical Review (IHR) in 2000. [...] When he ran in the 2006 Republican Party primary for congress, there was {{controversy}} over exactly what he said about the Holocaust at the event. According to the San Jose Mercury News McCloskey said at the time, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> are right or wrong about the Holocaust," [...] and referred to the [...] "so-called Holocaust". McCloskey replied that he has never questioned the existence of the Holocaust, and the 2000 quote referred to a debate over the number of people killed. McCloskey {{said in an interview with}} the Contra Costa Times on January 18, 2006 that the IHR transcript of his speech was inaccurate. Journalist Mark Hertsgaard of The Nation, in response to criticism of an article he wrote praising McCloskey's campaign against Pombo, stated that a tape he had viewed of McCloskey's speech to the IHR did not contain the [...] "right or wrong" [...] wording present in the transcript.|$|E

2500|$|On October 14, 1912, while {{campaigning in}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Roosevelt {{was shot by}} a saloonkeeper named John Flammang Schrank. The bullet lodged in his chest after {{penetrating}} his steel eyeglass case and passing through a thick (50 pages) single-folded copy of the speech titled [...] "", which he was carrying in his jacket. Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not reached his lung, and he declined suggestions {{to go to the}} hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his [...] with blood seeping into his shirt. He spoke for 90 minutes before completing his speech and accepting medical attention. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> fully understand that I have just been shot, but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose." [...] Afterwards, probes and an x-ray showed that the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt's chest muscle, but did not penetrate the pleura. Doctors concluded that it would be less dangerous to leave it in place than to attempt to remove it, and Roosevelt carried the bullet with him for the rest of his life.|$|E
