5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the <b>end</b> <b>consumer.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 19th {{century and}} early 20th century, {{unwanted}} gas was usually burned off at oil fields. Today, unwanted gas (or stranded gas without a market) associated with oil extraction often {{is returned to}} the reservoir with 'injection' wells while awaiting a possible future market or to repressurize the formation, which can enhance extraction rates from other wells. In regions with a high natural gas demand (such as the US), pipelines are constructed when it is economically feasible to transport gas from a wellsite to an <b>end</b> <b>consumer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sharad Joshi, {{founder of}} Shetkari Sangathana (farmers association), has {{announced}} {{his support for}} retail reforms.

Joshi feels retail reform is just a first step of needed agricultural reforms in India, and that the government should pursue additional reforms.|$|E

50|$|The use tax, {{like the}} sales tax, is {{assessed}} upon the <b>end</b> <b>consumer</b> of the tangible property or service, {{but the difference}} is who calculates the tax {{and how it is}} accounted for. The sales tax is collected by the seller, who is acting as an agent of the state and thus remits the tax to the state on behalf of the <b>end</b> <b>consumer.</b> On the other hand, the use tax is self-assessed and remitted by the <b>end</b> <b>consumer.</b> From an entitiy',s perspective, the shift from sales to use tax is the equivalent of shifting from an expense account (profit and loss statement implication) to a liability account (balance sheet implication).|$|E
