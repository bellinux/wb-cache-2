To {{study the effects of}} <b>interplanting</b> with zero tillage and straw manure on rice growth and quality, an experiment was conducted in a wheat-rotation rotation system. Four treatments, i. e.

ZIS reduced plant height, leaf area per plant and the biomass of rice plants, but the biomass accumulation of rice at the late stage was quicker than that under conventional transplanting cultivation. In the first year (2002), {{there was no significant difference}} in rice yield among the four treatments. However, rice yield decreased in <b>interplanting</b> with zero-tillage in the second year (2003). Compared with the transplanting treatments, the number of filled grains per panicle decreased but 1000 -grain weight increased in <b>interplanting</b> with zero-tillage, which were the main factors resulting in higher yield. <b>Interplanting</b> with zero-tillage improved the milling and appearance qualities of rice. The rates of milled and head rice increased while chalky rice rate and chalkiness decreased in <b>interplanting</b> with zero-tillage. Zero-tillage and <b>interplanting</b> also affected rice nutritional and cooking qualities. In 2002, ZIS showed raised protein content, decreased amylose content, softer gel consistency, resulting in improved rice quality. In 2003, zero-tillage and <b>interplanting</b> decreased protein content and showed similar amylose content as compared with transplanting treatments. Moreover, protein content in PTS was obviously increased in comparison with the other three treatments. The rice in <b>interplanting</b> with zero-tillage treatments had higher peak viscosity and breakdown, lower setback, showing better rice taste quality. The straw manure had no significant effect on rice viscosity under <b>interplanting</b> with zero-tillage, but had the negative influence on the rice taste quality under transplanting with plowing tillage...|$|R

Measurements at 4, 8, and 11 years showed that T. amazonia grew significantly better when mixed with Inga. In 2004 (11 years) we tested whether improved nitrogen nutrition was the mechanism for the effect. We analysed standing crops of vegetation and their nitrogen content in controls, the <b>interplanted</b> treatment, and nearby grazed pasture. Foliar N in Inga was more than double that in other foliage, supporting our assumption that the legume could {{be a source of}} N. However, by 2004 soil N was only slightly higher in the <b>interplanted</b> treatment than in controls, suggesting that N might be incorporated rapidly by the other vegetation. In fact, when the <b>interplanted</b> treatment was compared to controls, above-ground biomass and foliar N of T. amazonia was higher. The total nitrogen content in crowns of T. amazonia (biomass × % foliar N) was higher in the <b>interplanted</b> treatment than in controls. Finally, basal diameter and height correlated with foliar N in T. amazonia. Our data were consistent with the hypothesis that improved nitrogen nutrition accounts for improved growth of T. amazonia when <b>interplanted</b> with I. edulis.

50|$|Yam crop {{begins when}} whole seed tubers or tuber {{portions}} are planted into mounds or ridges, {{at the beginning}} of the rainy season. The crop yield depends on how and where the setts are planted, sizes of mounds, <b>interplant</b> spacing, provision of stakes for the resultant plants, yam species, and tuber sizes desired at harvest. Small-scale farmers in West and Central Africa often intercrop yams with cereals and vegetables. The seed yams are perishable and bulky to transport. Farmers who do not buy new seed yams, usually set aside up to 30% of their harvest for planting the next year. Yam crops face pressure from a range of insect pests and fungal and viral diseases, as well as nematode. Their growth and dormant phases correspond respectively to the wet season and the dry season. For maximum yield, the yams require a humid tropical environment, with an annual rainfall over 1500 mm distributed uniformly throughout the growing season. White, yellow, and water yams typically produce a single large tuber per year, generally weighing 5 to 10 kg.|$|E

The <b>interplant</b> distances were 15 cm (520000 plants/ha, strong allo-competition), 30 cm (128630 plants/ha, medium allo-competition) and 100 cm (11500 plants/ha, without competition). In addition, the inbred lines were evaluated in replicated plot trials under an agronomically accepted plant stand (520000 plants/ha, crop environment) and the ranking of the 28 lines based on the average yield per plot over growing seasons was determined. Selection was applied in each season for each <b>interplant</b> distance and the three and six top lines with the highest average yield per plant were identified. These top lines from each <b>interplant</b> distance were compared with the three and six top lines (say: proven superior lines) identified after their evaluation under crop environment over seasons. In addition, selection was applied at the individual plant level with six selection pressures in each season and each <b>interplant</b> distance. Then we determined for each experiment and selection pressure the number of the selected plants which belonged to the six proven top lines. It was observed that the ranking obtained under crop environment was best correlated with the ranking at the intermediate <b>interplant</b> distance (30 cm), followed by the ranking at the high <b>interplant</b> distance (100 cm). In contrast this correlation was very weak for the ranking at low <b>interplant</b> distance (15 cm). In addition, the <b>interplant</b> distance identifying the highest number of the proven high yielding lines after their evaluation in one season was the intermediate <b>interplant</b> distance followed by the high <b>interplant</b> distance and certainly not the low <b>interplant</b> distance. The relative effectiveness was further increased when selection was based on average performance of the lines across seasons. This, together with the relatively small number of seeds produced per plant, renders selection at low <b>interplant</b> distance less favorable than selection at the intermediate or high <b>interplant</b> distance. The individual plant selection was effective at all three <b>interplant</b> distances. Selection effectiveness generally increased as the selection pressure increased.

Planting E. camaldulensis with cowpeas and maize had no marked effect on the yields of the two annual crops.

However, E. camaldulensis <b>interplanted</b> with maize showed a slightly higher performance (branching and circumference) than that <b>interplanted</b> with cowpeas. This was probably related to the fertilizer added to the maize/£. camaldulensis intercrop since no fertilizer was added to the cowpea/£. camaldulensis intercrop. Management factors such as clean weeding in sole Eucalyptus markedly increased tree performance as observed through parameters of stem circumference and branching compared to those of the unweeded sole Eucalyptus situation.

We took <b>interplant</b> variability in expansion kinetics and the model’s ability to simulate this variability into account. Changes in leaflet and internode dimensions over thermal time were recorded for primary shoot expansion, on 83 plants from three crops grown in different climatic conditions and densities. An empirical model was developed, to reproduce organ expansion kinetics for individual plants of a real crop of bush rose primary shoots. Leaflet or internode length was simulated as a logistic function of thermal time. The model was evaluated by cross-validation. We found that differences in leaflet or internode expansion kinetics between phytomer positions and between plants at a given phytomer position were due mostly to large differences in time of organ expansion and expansion rate, rather than differences in expansion duration. Thus, in the model, the parameters linked to expansion duration were predicted by values common to all plants, whereas variability in final size and organ expansion time was captured by input data. The model accurately simulated leaflet and internode expansion for individual plants (RMSEP = 7. 3 % and 10. 2 % of final length, respectively).

Many different environmental factors play an important part in the process of soybean germination and emergence. Environmental factors that can adversely affect germination and emergence are moisture, oxygen supply, temperature, and diseases. All of these factors can reduce the emergence percentage and increase the time for emergence of soybeans. In the past management options for a deficient soybean stand consisted of leaving the existing stand till harvest or destroying the present stand and starting over by replanting. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate a third option in managing deficient soybean stands: <b>interplanting.</b> <b>Interplanting</b> is the process of planting additional seeds into an existing deficient stand.

40|$|Predicting the {{dynamics}} of hosts and pathogens in natural systems requires {{a thorough understanding of}} the disease transmission process. It has been argued that, unlike for airborne diseases, the transmission of vector-borne diseases such as the anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum {{is a function of the}} frequency rather than the density of disease in a population. However, recent models indicate that frequency- dependent transmission of vectored diseases is only expected if the time required for <b>interplant</b> movement (host search) by the vector is short relative to the time spent per visit (handling time). Hence, frequency dependence is only expected to dominate at lower ranges of <b>interplant</b> distances. We test this prediction by analyzing disease transmission of M. violaceum in relation to <b>interplant</b> distance in a natural population of the host species Silene latifolia and Silene dioica. We conclude that (1) The infection probability of uninfected hosts strongly increased with the frequency of diseased hosts within a patch, whereas the number of infected plants within a patch had no effect in either of the host species. (2) In agreement with predictions based on vector behavior, the probability of infection in patches of S. dioica increased more strongly with increasing disease frequency among patches with high average host density (i. e., small <b>interplant</b> distance) than among patches with low host density. This finding is consistent with the idea that transmission should shift from a more frequency- to a more density-dependent process when host search time increases relative to handling time. (3) In addition to local disease frequency and host density, individual host traits (host sex, size, and phenology) explained a significant part of the variation in infection probability within host species. The precise effects of individual host traits depended on local neighborhood characteristics. For instance, in S. latifolia, male hosts were on average more susceptible than female hosts, but the difference diminished with increasing disease frequency.

40|$|Improving crop {{production}} via adjustment of plant population density (PPD) largely depends on canopy development and light interception. Accordingly, {{it is essential}} to investigate the details of how canopy development responds to PPD. A field experiment was undertaken in China in 2009 to examine maize organ development across plant densities i. e. 2, 6, 12 and 20 plants m – 2. Lengths of laminae and sheaths were both increased in lower phytomers due to greater extension duration and decreased in upper phytomers due to reduced extension rate in response to more <b>interplant</b> competition as PPD increased. However, sheath extension appeared less affected by competition stress than lamina extension. Internode length was increased due to higher extension rate at high PPD. This study indicated that leaves and internodes utilized different strategies to cope with <b>interplant</b> competition induced by increased plant density. In addition, the findings can be used in modelling canopy production under different plant densities...|$|E
50|$|G. sepium {{trees are}} used for {{intercropping}} {{in part because they}} fix nitrogen in the soil and tolerate low soil fertility, so when they are <b>interplanted</b> with crops they can boost crop yields significantly, without the need of chemical fertilizers.|$|R
50|$|This is ancient {{woodland}} and has {{a canopy}} comprising mainly ash (including coppiced stools), pedunculate oak and field maple, and some crab apple and holly. There has been some <b>interplanting</b> with beech, Scots pine, spruce and larch. The understorey is dominated by hazel. This also contains goat willow and dogwood.|$|R
50|$|Southern Highbush Cultivars, in {{addition}} to lower chilling requirements, also have greater tolerance to high summer temperatures, somewhat greater drought tolerance and develop superior fruit quality under Southern U.S. growing conditions. As a rule, Southern highbush blueberries are self-fertile. However, larger and earlier-ripening berries result if several cultivars are <b>interplanted</b> for cross-pollination.|$|R
