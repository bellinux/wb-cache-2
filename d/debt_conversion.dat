Some losses by private creditors are likely to be part of any resolution of the debt crisis, and such losses are implicit in some of the many proposals for dealing with the crisis. However, through a combination of self interest and public policy the current impasse in the debt crisis should be overcome. This may be done partly through large scale debt swaps sponsored by private or public agencies.

40|$|This paper formulates a multisectoral {{accounting}} framework {{to assess the}} potential effects on perceived private wealth of alternative schemes for voluntary debt reduction. Swaps of private equity for public foreign debt increase private wealth when private agents behave ultrarationally, that is, when they regard public foreign debt as discounted future taxes, and when their subjective valuation of foreign debt exeeds its redemption price. With direct buybacks and collateralized <b>debt</b> <b>conversions,</b> private wealth increases when agents behave ultrarationally and their subjective valuation of debt is higher than secondary market prices. Using this framework to examine recent experience in Brazil, Chile and Mexico, the paper concludes that the surge in consumption-GNP ratios - along with record levels of voluntary debt reduction in Brazil, Chile and Mexico in 1988 - {{is consistent with the}} hypotheses that private agents have behaved ultrarationally and have valued foreign sector liabilities at more than redemption/secondary market prices.

40|$|The idea of <b>debt</b> <b>conversion</b> is {{that instead}} of {{continuing}} to make payments on outstanding loans in hard currency {{in the face of}} debt servicing difficulties, the debtors find some other way to settle debts that is satisfactory to themselves and the creditor. The author discusses the importance of <b>debt</b> <b>conversion</b> as a development tool, contrasts conversion of debt owed to public and private creditors,touches on the issue of its impact on inflation, and examines criteria for determining which kinds of debt are suitable for conversion. <b>Debt</b> <b>conversion</b> projects may be a useful, noncontroversial vehicle for bringing in domestic managerial talent from local nongovernment organizations on contract as responsible parties for implementation of a specific project. The author concludes by discussing two ways to strengthen institutions for carrying out debt conversions. One way is through establishment of a trust fund. National environmental trust funds have been established in several countries in connection with debt-for-nature swaps. Another way is for sector policymakers to approach international counterpart nongovernment organizations directly to find out if interest exists in funding specific development activities through debt conversions to support a well-defined sectoral program.

40|$|Voluntary debt {{reduction}} schemes (VDR), such as debt-equity swaps (DES) or collateralized <b>debt</b> <b>conversions</b> (CDC), {{are bound to}} play a relevant role in the foreign debt strategy of highly indebted countries (HICs). This paper assesses the impact of VDR on domestic macroeconomic variables. More specifically, it evaluates the impact of DES and CDC on inflation, equity prices and on sovereign debt prices. For that purpose a short-term portfolio balance model with domestic and foreign assets/liabilities is formulated. A distinctive feature of the model is that all current transactions take place at end of period prices. The model supports the view that DES are inflationary, and indicates that in the short-term, DES and CDC are likely to raise equity prices and sovereign debt prices. This paper shows {{that the impact of}} DES on sovereign debt prices depends on a host of factors: the expected trade surplus; the stocks of debt and foreign-held equity; the redemption price of debt; restrictions on profit remittances; the physical rate of return on equity; and the technology that determines it. A discussion regarding the dynamics of adjustment to the steady state illustrates possible linkages between DES subsidies, rates of return and investment levels. The paper concludes with a parametrization of the conditions under which DES can lead to higher debt prices in selected Latin American countries.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} why, {{in contrast}} to the predictions of finance theory, firms do not call convertible <b>debt</b> when the <b>conversion</b> price exceeds the call price. The empirical results suggest that the principal reason is because some firms enjoy an advantage of paying less in after-tax interest than they would pay in dividends were the bond converted. This cash flow incentive is the inverse of an investor's incentive to convert voluntarily if the converted dividends are greater than the bond's coupon. Because of taxation, however, the decisions by investors and firms are not symmetric, and there exist bonds which the firm may not call and an investor will not convert. The results also find that voluntary conversion is significantly related to both the conversion price and the differential between the coupon and the dividends on the converted stock.

The Spanish Empire abroad became the source of Spanish wealth and power in Europe. But as precious metal shipments rapidly expanded late in the century it contributed to the general inflation that was affecting the whole of Europe. Instead of fueling the Spanish economy, American silver made the country increasingly dependent on foreign sources of raw materials and manufactured goods.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>Debt</b> 2 Health <b>Conversion</b> Scheme of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria {{is used to}} {{reassess}} a range of recent initiatives that propose debt relief in exchange for spending in the health sector. The experience with debt swaps in the mid 1990 s was far from positive, and recent improved insight in the economics of debt relief suggests extreme caution. We argue that the recent spade of debt swap proposals, even if targeting countries and debt titles that fall outside current major international debt relief mechanisms, share most of the design faults of previous initiatives. Proposals such as Debt 2 Health do not constitute efficient vehicles to increase net transfers to poor countries, to reduce the economic disadvantages of indebtedness, or to strengthen public health systems of partner countries. For debt relief to constitute a valuable mechanism to provide aid, it should be designed as a large-scale and comprehensive operation, with spending earmarked to broad country-established priorities, and reinforce rather than undermine national implementation systems...|$|R
