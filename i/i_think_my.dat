25|$|Despite {{his failure}} to take power, Khiêm said he was “very happy. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> {{objective}} has been realized.” The new junta decided to ignore Khiêm's involvement in the coup and he remained in Washington as the ambassador, with no further action taken. In October 1965 the junta of Kỳ and Thiệu made Khiêm the Ambassador to Taiwan; he served there until mid-1968, then returned to Vietnam and served under President Thiệu as Interior Minister for a year before becoming Deputy Prime Minister {{at the start of}} 1969. In September 1969 he became prime minister and defense minister, and he stayed in the role until April 1975 when he resigned and left the country as the communists {{were in the process of}} completing their victory over South Vietnam. However, he had little power as Thiệu operated virtually one-man rule.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

500|$|The title [...] "The Holy Bible" [...] {{was chosen}} by Edwards to reflect an idea, {{according}} to Bradfield, that [...] "everything on {{there has to be}} perfection".

Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea.

500|$|Kafka {{was invited}} to the 2010 NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, which started on February 24, along with {{teammates}} Corey Wootton and Sherrick McManis. Kafka chose Mike McCartney of Priority Sports of Chicago as his agent, who also represents Wootton. Priority hired former Chicago Bears quarterback Erik Kramer and a trainer in Phoenix, Arizona, to help Kafka prepare for the NFL Scouting Combine. To prepare for the Combine, Kafka worked out twice a day in Arizona, and held practice sessions with Notre Dame wide receiver Golden Tate. At the Combine, Kafka said, [...] "I {{want to be an}} NFL starter. I'm not going to the league to be a No. 2. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> whole game can go to another level.

500|$|Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change {{became more}} {{apparent}} than the tweaks he implemented in the past (see above for more). As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think {{the thing is that}} I have a lot of younger audience , and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E

500|$|McCaw predominately {{played at}} openside flanker, {{although}} he has played in the other [...] "loose forward" [...] positions of blindside flanker and number eight for the Crusaders. The openside flanker binds [...] {{to the side of}} the scrum farthest from the touch-line and is usually one of the first players to reach a breakdown. In 2008, McCaw told the IRB:"My main role as a flanker is, defensively, to tie in with the back line to ensure that the defence works well. On attack <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> primary role at first phase is to look after our ball. You attack the back line and I'm usually the first person there to make sure we secure that ball. Thirdly I put pressure on break downs and make sure I disturb their ball and try to turn their ball over." ...|$|E
500|$|... "First and {{foremost}} I {{thought it was}} a good record.

Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The other thing that 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So it was a strange example of synchronicity that I should be ready to go with a Latin track which I had written almost a year before".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} New York in October 1986. Madonna {{would ask for}} five minutes to study the script for the scene they were filming. For example, before {{a scene in which}} she needed to appear out of breath, she did a series of push-ups before going on set. Dunne {{observed}} that [...] " [...] likes her first take best. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> best is around fourth. She always says, 'You got it, you got it,' and she was driving me crazy just like her character would. We had to make a compromise as to which take is the best." [...] Madonna wanted Foley to give her proper direction on set, but he preferred her to be her real self, rather than the persona in her music videos. Regarding her acting abilities, Foley stressed on the fact that Madonna was very uptight and into every detail, determined to have the correct portrayal. [...] "That's probably why it wasn't so good. In Desperately Seeking Susan, when she didn't know what she was doing, she was being natural and at her best." ...|$|E

500|$|Much of {{her early}} career {{is filled with}} near misses in casting, as she was up for {{significant}} roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses. In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E
500|$|After {{being named}} Most Valuable Player (MVP) {{at the prestigious}} Boston Shootout and {{acknowledged}} as the leading participant at the Nike camp, Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country. By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering UNLV as well. Following his time at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement: [...] "Contact my coach. I do not want my grandmother and aunt upset about calls at all {{times of the day}} and night. I'm not the only person who lives in this house. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> wishes should be respected. If not, {{when it comes time to}} make my decision, I'll take those things into account." [...] Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects. [...] Despite Howard's most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit. [...] By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.|$|E

Following the airing of [...] "Home", Harington issued a public apology to fans of the show, stating that he would [...] "like to say sorry for lying to everyone. I'm glad that people were upset that he died. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> biggest fear was that people were not going to care. Or it would just be, 'Fine, Jon Snow's dead.' But it seems like people had a, similar to the Red Wedding episode, kind of grief about it. Which means something I'm doing — or the show is doing — is right." [...] Harington was simply referred to as [...] "LC", for Lord Commander, in all scripts, call sheets, props or wardrobe materials, in order to maintain the secrecy involved with his eventual resurrection in the episode. It was also revealed that during production of the season, even verbal communication of the name 'Jon Snow' was disallowed, except in on-camera dialogue during actual taping of the series.|$|E

500|$|The My Little Pony toys {{have been}} {{collected}} mainly by women {{who grew up with}} the toys during the 1980s and 1990s, before Hasbro revived the toy series with its Friendship Is Magic line. Bonnie Zacherle, the original creator of the franchise, noted that the toys and show were originally conceived to appeal to preschool children of both genders, and considers it a [...] "good thing" [...] for the adult fandom to have the same appreciation of the show as the collectors. According to Summer Hayes, author of six books about My Little Pony toy collections and organizer of the annual My Little Pony collectors' fair, some of these collectors appreciated the attention of the brony community. Hayes said that the brony community has participated in the toy fair, and that other collectors resent the sudden popularity of Friendship Is Magic. She said that that these earlier fans and collectors had thought; [...] "...what about us? We've been here forever, and nobody seemed to care. But now that there are all these guys in their 20s that are crazy about it, it's suddenly important and it means something." [...] Hayes also said, [...] "To the bronies, I say, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>My</b> Little Pony is awesome, so more power to you".|$|E
500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E
