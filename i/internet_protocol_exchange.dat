40|$|Cryptographic network {{security}} services {{are essential for}} providing secure data communication over an insecure public network such as the Internet. Recently there has been tremendous growth in the requirements for, and use of, secure virtual private networks (VPNs) to interconnect enterprises with business partners, traveling staff, and remote office locations. <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> Security (IPsec) tunnels have {{become one of the}} most widely adopted means to build secure VPNs between sites and individual computers. To date, most IPsec VPNs are statically configured and are of moderate scale. To facilitate future large-scale VPNs with potentially rapidly changing memberships and varying security policies the industry must move to the use of dynamic protocols for the establishment and managment of cryptographic keys and security policies. Adopting such on line management systems will ease the administrative burden associated with VPN instantiation and operation. In this paper we examine the relative performance characteristics and dynamic behavior of large scale VPN environments based upon IPsec and the <b>Internet</b> Key <b>Exchange</b> <b>protocol</b> (IKE) version 1 1. We introduce the NIST IPsec/IKE Simulation Tool (NIIST) and use its detailed, packet level, simulation models to characterize the performance impact of varying: key management scenarios, security association (SA) policies and management parameters, cryptographic algorithms, and implementation options in IPsec/IKE suites. Our results highlight the significant performance impact of subtle IPsec/IKE implementation and policy decisions on the overall performance and behavior of TCP based applications in large scale VPNs...|$|R
