5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl {{is used as}} an additive in {{unleaded gasoline}} to boost octane rating and reduce <b>engine</b> <b>knocking.</b> The manganese in this unusual organometallic compound is in the +1 oxidation state.|$|E
25|$|Spark {{ignition}} {{engines are}} designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone, rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time. This causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine. This {{is often referred to}} as <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline's resistance to autoignition, which is expressed by its octane rating.|$|E
25|$|In the US it {{has been}} used in {{gasoline}} at low levels since 1979, replacing tetraethyl lead as an antiknock (octane rating) additive to prevent <b>engine</b> <b>knocking.</b> Oxygenates also help gasoline burn more completely, reducing tailpipe emissions from pre-1984 motor vehicles; dilute or displace gasoline components such as aromatics (e.g., benzene) and sulfur; and optimize oxidation during combustion. Before the introduction of other oxygenates and octane enhancers, most refiners had chosen MTBE primarily for its blending characteristics and low cost.|$|E
40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>knock</b> {{has long}} been a well {{recognized}} phenomenon in the automotive industry. Detecting <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> opens up the possibility for an indirect feedback of the engine's internal combustion without installing a pressure transducer inside the cylinder. Knock detection has mainly been used for spark advance control, making it possible to control the engine close to its knock limit in search for the optimal ignition timing. This application has to a lesser extent been applied to lightweight two-stroke engines, which is the focus of this study. The investigation features a modern chainsaw <b>engine</b> whose <b>knock</b> characteristics were first determined with a pressure transducer. The structural vibrations originating from the <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> are filtered out of the signal from a remote located accelerometer. The knock intensity is compared with the signal from the pressure transducer which shows a correlation with an accepted extent between the two sensors. Parameters that affect the knock intensity have also been investigated. These include engine temperature, different types of fuel and ignition timings...|$|R

25|$|In {{petrol engine}} {{turbocharger}} applications, boost pressure {{is limited to}} keep the entire engine system, including the turbocharger, inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range. Over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine {{in a variety of}} ways including pre-ignition, overheating, and over-stressing the engine's internal hardware. For example, to avoid <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> (also known as detonation) and the related physical damage to the engine, the intake manifold pressure must not get too high, thus the pressure at the intake manifold of the engine must be controlled by some means. Opening the wastegate allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe, thus reducing boost pressure. The wastegate can be either controlled manually (frequently seen in aircraft) or by an actuator (in automotive applications, it is often controlled by the engine control unit).|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} Jupiter Fighter was {{evaluated}} at Martlesham Heath and found wanting, being lost on 23 November 1923 when the engine seized at high altitude, {{the second was}} sent to Sweden for evaluation, where it coped excellently with the extreme cold of the Swedish winter, with the Jupiter, using normal fuels and winter motor oil, operating without trouble in temperatures which normally caused engine oil to freeze in hours. The second Type 76 was therefore purchased by the Swedish Air Force, who operated it from May 1924 until 1935, when it was sold to a private buyer, finally being written off in 1936. The final Type 76 {{was used as a}} testbed for a high compression version of the Jupiter intended for use at high altitudes, which was fitted with a bi-fuel system to allow use of alcohol at low altitudes, then switching to normal petrol once the aircraft had reached sufficient altitude to prevent premature detonation (<b>Engine</b> <b>knocking).</b> This system was rejected in favour of supercharging.|$|E
2500|$|Combustion {{consists}} of various radical chain reactions that the singlet radical can initiate. The flammability {{of a given}} material strongly depends on the concentration of free radicals that must be obtained before initiation and propagation reactions dominate leading to combustion of the material. Once the combustible material has been consumed, termination reactions again dominate and the flame dies out. [...] As indicated, [...] promotion of propagation or termination reactions alters flammability. [...] For example, because lead itself deactivates free radicals in the gasoline-air mixture, tetraethyl lead was once commonly added to gasoline. This prevents the combustion from initiating in an uncontrolled manner or in unburnt residues (<b>engine</b> <b>knocking)</b> or premature ignition (preignition).|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Diesel engines {{operate on the}} {{principle}} of compression ignition, so that a fuel which resists autoignition will cause late ignition, which will also lead to <b>engine</b> <b>knock.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Research work {{undertaken}} {{to understand the}} benzene system opened a new field in organic chemistry leading to the modern understanding of aromatic systems as common throughout the chemical world. [...] Benzene itself is a useful solvent {{as well as a}} gasoline additive due to its high octane number and ability to reduce <b>engine</b> <b>knocking,</b> although methylbenzene is now being used as an alternative. [...] Benzene is also a precursor used in the manufacture of styrene, nylon, and epoxy resins. [...] Naphthalene is the active ingredient in traditional mothballs and is used to make the insecticide carbaryl. [...] Aromatic systems appear in many other important industrial products including Bakelite, polystyrene, and PET plastics.|$|E
2500|$|All Brazilian {{automakers}} {{have adapted}} their gasoline engines to run smoothly with this range of mixtures, thus, all gasoline vehicles are built {{to run with}} blends from E20 to E25, defined by local law as [...] "common gasoline type C". Some vehicles might work properly with lower concentrations of ethanol, but with a few exceptions, {{they are unable to}} run smoothly with pure gasoline, which causes <b>engine</b> <b>knocking,</b> as vehicles traveling to neighboring South American countries have demonstrated. Flex-fuel vehicles, which can run on any type of gasoline E20-E25 up to 100% hydrous ethanol (E100 or hydrated ethanol) ratios, were first available in mid-2003. In July 2008, 86% of all new light vehicles sold in Brazil were flexible-fuel, and only two carmakers build models with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate with pure gasoline (E0): Renault with the models Clio, Symbol, Logan, Sandero and MÃ©gane, and Fiat with the Siena Tetrafuel.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} of a combat or {{emergency}} situation, the mixture control may be moved to the auto rich position, providing extra fuel to the engine, or in military aircraft, into military position, if the aircraft is so equipped. [...] When in the military position, the Anti-Detonation Injection (ADI) system is activated, injecting the ADI fluid into the engine intake system. [...] The pressure in the ADI system moves the derichment diaphragm in the fuel control to close off the derichment jet, reducing the fuel flow to a leaner mixture which produces higher engine power by raising the mean effective pressure. This causes the cylinder head temperature to increase to a very high level, which dramatically increases the risk of detonation (see: <b>engine</b> <b>knocking).</b> Adding the ADI fluid raises the mean octane level of the charge preventing pre-ignition and also lowers the cylinder temperatures to a more acceptable level. As this operation takes the engine well beyond its normal design limits, this power setting is not suitable for prolonged use. Once the ADI fluid is exhausted or if the mixture control valve is moved out of the military position, the fuel control derichment diaphragm pressure is lost, and the derichment jet is opened once again for normal fuel flow.|$|E

50|$|Methanol is (In {{automotive}} terms) hygroscopic, {{meaning it}} will absorb water vapor {{directly from the}} atmosphere. Because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the methanol (although it suppresses <b>engine</b> <b>knock),</b> and may cause phase separation of methanol-gasoline blends, containers of methanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the torque}} control problem for {{spark-ignition}} engines is considered. The {{objective is to}} provide good output torque tracking with minimum fuel consumption, while avoiding <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> and misre. To this end, three control strategies are proposed: a feed-forward controller with recalibrated engine maps, a PI control scheme and a model predictive controller. For the model predictive control strategy, a simplied air-path engine model is developed based on the Wiener model structure. The proposed controllers are shown to provide safe engine operation by avoiding <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> and misre. The performance of each control strategy is evaluated over a specic driving cycle and compared with a baseline control strategy.

However {{it has also been}} used in motor sport and notably in drag racing. In Otto cycle engines, the cooling effects of water injection also enables greater compression ratios by reducing <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> (detonation). Alternately, this reduction in <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> in Otto cycle engines means that some applications gain significant performance when water injection is used in conjunction with a supercharger, turbocharger, or modifications such as aggressive ignition timing.|$|E
