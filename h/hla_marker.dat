We show that the model which best explains all the observations assumes a cis or trans complementation of two tightly linked genes within the HLA region, an additional maternal effect, and other familial factors. The HLA molecule corresponding to the complementation of Arg 52 (+) and Asp 57 (-) has been recently proposed as explaining susceptibility to IDDM. However, this hypothesis does not account for the overall observations made on the <b>HLA</b> <b>marker</b> in IDDM patients and their relatives. The MASC method may also be applied to evaluate the risk for relatives of an affected individual (the "index").

40|$|Abstract: This study characterizes {{findings}} on sleep testing and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) markers {{in a group}} of patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). One hundred eighteen patients seen in a general neurology practice over 5 years meeting standard clinical criteria for FM or CFS were analyzed retrospectively. Cases of untreated sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome were excluded prior to inclusion in this study. Ninety-two patients had multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT). Seventy-three (80 %) were abnormal by standard criteria. Of 57 females having positive MSLTs, 22 (39 %) had one or more periods of sleep onset rapid eye movement (SOREM), and 5 of 16 (31 %) males with positive MSLTs had one or more SOREM. Highly fragmented sleep, as previously described in FM, was seen but not analyzed quantitatively. HLA DQB 1 * 0602 was obtained in 74 patients, and positive in 32 (43 %), P < 0. 0001 compared with published values in 228 populations. In our patients, who presented with neuromus-cular fatigue or generalized pain, we found a sleep disorder characterized by objective hypersomnia. Some patients had characteristics of narcolepsy.

GAD 65 ab sensitivity/specificity was 70 / 96 %, ver-sus 84 / 96 % for ICA, 56 / 97 % for IAA, 93 / 93 % (any posi-tive), 39 / 99. 7 % (all positive), and 41 / 99. 7 % (GAD 65 ab plus IAA). The latter's 25 % predictive value was not im-proved by requiring concomitant high-risk HLA genotypes. GAD 65 ab were associated with DQA 1 * 0501 /Bi * 0201 (DQ 2; P = 0. 007) but not DQA 1 * 0301 /Bl* 0302 (DQ 8), and IAA with DQA 1 * 0301 /Bl* 0302 (DQ 8; P = 0. 03) but not DQA 1 * 0501 /B 1 * 0201 (DQ 2).

40|$|Characterizing the {{distribution}} of parameters of iron metabolism by hemochromatosis genotype remains an important goal vis-à-vis potential screening strategies to identify individuals at genetic risk, since a specific marker to detect the abnormal gene has not been identified as yet. In the present investigation, we analyze serum iron values in ascertained families using a method which incorporates both segregation of the clinical affection status and the HLA linkage information to identify the underlying genotypes. The analysis is performed using {{an extension of the}} model presented by Bonney et al., comprising regressive models for segregation analysis and the multipoint linkage strategy implemented in LINKAGE. The gene was found to be completely recessive with respect to both clinical manifestations and serum iron abnormalities, with significant differences in expression by sex. Clinical manifestations were present for all male homozygotes in this data set, suggesting that the recessive hemochromatosis genotype is fully penetrant at all ages in males. This was not the case for younger females. Significant genotype-specific age and sex effects were found for serum iron values. It is interesting that deletion of the <b>HLA</b> <b>marker</b> information did not affect our ability to resolve the genetic model when we analyzed a bivariate phenotype. This serves as a reminder that a search for relevant biological markers can be equally important in discerning the genetic etiology of a disease trait, as a search for linked genetic markers...|$|E

In an attempt to identify some of the many genes (quantitative trait loci; QTL) responsible for the substantial heritability of this quantitative trait, the IQ QTL Project uses an allelic association strategy. Allelic frequencies are compared for the high and low extremes of the IQ dimension using DNA markers in or near genes that are likely to be relevant to neural functioning. Permanent cell lines have been established for low-IQ (mean IQ = 82; N = 18), middle-IQ (mean IQ = 105; N = 21), and high-IQ (mean IQ = 130; N = 24) groups and for a replication sample consisting of even more extreme low-IQ (mean IQ = 59; N = 17) and high-IQ (mean IQ = 142; N = 27) groups. Subjects are Caucasian children tested from 6 to 12 years of age. This first report of the IQ QTL Project presents allelic association results for 46 two-allele markers and for 26 comparisons for 14 multiple-allele markers.

In Asian patient cohorts several <b>HLA</b> <b>markers</b> were described {{to be associated}} with MMA, but in Caucasians very little is known about genetic susceptibility of this angiopathy. METHOD: We analysed DNA of 33 Caucasian patients with MMA for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DRB 1, and HLA-DQB 1 <b>markers,</b> respectively. <b>HLA</b> frequencies of all 33 patients with MMA were compared with HLA-frequencies of Caucasian controls. Additionally, subgroup analysis of 22 patients with Moyamoya disease (MMD) and 11 patients with unilateral type of MMA was performed. FINDINGS: Significant association was observed for HLA-DRB 1 * 03 and HLA-DRB 1 * 13 in all 33 patients (P (c) [*]<[*] 0. 001 and P (c) [*]<[*] 0. 001, respectively). Moreover, HLA-A* 02 (P (c) [*]=[*] 0. 009); HLA-B* 08 (P (c) [*]=[*] 0. 009), and HLA-DQB 1 * 03 (P (c) [*]=[*] 0. 003) frequencies were higher in all patients with MMA when compared with the controls.

To {{define the}} {{contribution}} of HLA genes other than HLA-B 27 in conferring susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS), through analysis of HLA-B 27 haplotypes in Sardinian subjects. Methods. Ninety-eight patients with AS, 133 HLA-B 27 -positive controls (of whom 33 were positive for HLA-B* 2709), and 190 randomly selected controls were genotyped for microsatellites and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the HLA region. Results. Haplotypes carrying either the B* 2705 or the B* 2709 allele were found to share a conserved region downstream of the HLA-B gene and a functional polymorphism in the HLA-E gene (W 28 G), while differing in all other markers. Notably, {{the presence of an}} A at SNP rs 1264457, encoding for Arg- 128, was significantly increased in the cohort of patients (P = 6 x 10 (- 6), corrected P = 3 x 10 (- 5)) but not in B* 2705 - or B* 2709 -positive controls. Comparing the alleles co-occurring at each <b>HLA</b> <b>marker,</b> we identified a region differentiating patients with AS and B* 2705 -matched controls. In particular, there was a markedly increased prevalence of heterozygosity at rs 1264457 among B 27 -positive controls (74 %, versus 47 % in patients and 54 % in random controls), suggesting a protective role of G 128 in AS. Moreover, other markers around the HLA-B gene were also differentially represented. Conclusion. These results demonstrate {{a significant difference in the}} frequency of some HLA markers between AS patients and B* 2705 -positive controls, which could be attributed to the opposite chromosome. In particular, the differential distribution of a functional polymorphism in the HLA-E gene suggests a possible role of natural killer function in AS pathogenesis...|$|E

The frequency of the HLA-A 3 -specific (r. 0. 97; p=lO-’O) RFLP band was 16. 4 %. Among 226 unrelated individuals, the homozygous genotype was observed only twice (0. 9 % vs. expected= 2. 7 %, p=O. lO). The genotypical -A 3 homozygosity was noted in chronic myeloid leukaemia (4. 0 $, n. 101; 11. 4 % in the early-onset group, p=O. OOl) and haemochrornatosis (31 %, 11. 29, p=lO-l”, RR= 50. 4) patients. This is the highest relative r i s k for any <b>HLA</b> <b>marker</b> in haemochromatosis. In the D 6 S 128 locus, homozygosity for the HLA-A 3 associated band was observed a t the expected rate. Healthy individuals homozygous for -A 3 have the 0. 7 kb HLA-A band, whereas, it lacks in disease-associated homozygous genotype. These results suggested that heterogeneity, detectable by an HLA-A probe, might exist in the HLA-A 3 haplotypes. Association of -A 3 with two HLA-F band supported t h i s possibility. Homozygosity for the disease-associated subtype is decreased in the healthy population. The examination of bone marrow donor r e g i s t r i e s confirmed this conclusion. In the Anthony Nolan registry (n= 63200), hornozygosity for the A 3 B 7 DR 2 haplotype was significantly decreased (p=lO-”). The same trend was observed in a smaller registry (the South Wales BTS registry, n: 6606) in which molecular typing results were available (p=O. O 8). In a cohort of 282 DNA-typed unrelated healthy individuals from the West of Scotland, there was no decrease in homozygosity for 87 DRZ(15) haplotype (2. 1 % vs. expected 1. 1 %).

Other reports did not find linkage to <b>HLA</b> <b>markers.</b> One found evidence of linkage to markers on chromosome 15, another to markers on chromosome 6, centromeric to HLA. We identified families through a patient with JME and genotyped markers throughout chromosome 6.

When linkage analysis was redone to allow independent male-female θs, the LOD score was significantly higher (4. 2) at a male-female θ of. 5,. 01. Although the overall pattern of LOD scores with respect to male-female θ could not be explained solely by heterogeneity, the presence of heterogeneity and predominantly maternal inheritance of JME might explain it. By analyzing loci between HLA-DP and HLA-DR and stratifying the families {{on the basis of}} evidence for or against linkage, we were able to show evidence of heterogeneity within JME and to propose a marker associated with the linked form.

40|$|In the {{presented}} professorial dissertation {{methods have}} been developed to analyse high polymorphic HLA- and STR-markers. Furthermore down stream applications in the fields of transplantation immunology, anthropology and forensic have been studied. The most critical stage in PCR-based forensic analysis as well as in chimerism analysis of low copy cell regions is DNA isolation, which should yield as much highly purified DNA as possible. Our work focuses mainly on sample preparation, obtaining the maximum possible amount of biological material, and the following cell lysis, to create a simple standardized protocol suitable for nearly all biological material. After optimization and validation, the automatic DNA extraction method based on magnetic particles has been used for more than 50, 000 routine samples. There has been no evidence of cross contamination or the presence of PCR inhibitors. Samples of the resulting DNA as small as 20 pg yield reliable complete STR amplification profiles. Further experiments to reduce the detection limit lead to the Whole Genome DNA Amplification (WGA) a promising method to generate large amounts of DNA from samples of limited quantity. With only 100 pg WGA template a profile could be established that may be considered error-free. But we detected unbalanced STR amplifications at a locus and between loci, allelic “drop-out’s” and additional alleles after WGA of low copy number DNA. Whole genome amplification could not reveal new horizons of STR analyses in low copy cell regions {{as is the case in}} forensic evidence as well as in chimerism monitoring of limited cell populations after stem cell transplantation. Early studies of <b>HLA</b> <b>marker</b> in forensic case work have already shown a high sensitivity of the used PCR system even for degraded DNA. The new established method of a short-range sequencing system using PyrosequencingTM for HLA-marker is especially suited for high-throughput. The approach was optimised and practically tested for genotyping in disease association studies. Our well-elaborated PyrosequencingTM-based protocols offered a new alternative to the existing HLA typing methods and represented a convenient and economic solution, a unique combination of high accuracy with high sample throughput. Haplotype specific extraction (HSE) allows the collection of individual alleles by separating diploid samples into their haploid components. Consequently, very long sequence regions of separate alleles, including exon and intron stretches for a specific locus, are available for further typing strategies. Novel polymorphisms in HLA-B alleles were clearly analysed after the alleles were separated by HSE, allowing new alleles to be easily detected without cloning. Repeated chimerism analysis of leukocyte subpopulations after allogeneic stem cell transplantation detected impending relapse before clinical diagnosis. Although chimerism analysis cannot distinguish prospectively between residual healthy leucocytes of the recipient or incipient leukaemia relapse, the data show that persistent or reappearing recipient cells indicate impending relapse. The phenomenon of persistence of donor cells in peripheral blood even for years after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), called microchimerism, could be clearly demonstrated. The described clinical case with unusual extramedullary presentation of an allograft-derived acute myeloid leukaemia after OLT was the first report demonstrating allograft-localised donor-derived leukaemia, diagnosed by STR analysis...|$|E

After validating the resulting frequency distributions through the original statistical method described in our companion article (Nunes et al. 2011), we compared the HLA genetic profile of the sampled Munda {{to those of other}} Asiatic populations, among which Dravidian and Indo-European-speakers from India and populations from East and Southeast Asia speaking languages belonging to different linguistic families...|$|R
40|$|The {{epidemiological}} {{approach has}} undoubtedly contributed {{to our knowledge}} of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) by providing some etiological hypotheses {{in spite of the}} fact that a definitive basis for the conclusive resolution of its enigma is still lacking. Epidemiological studies have indicated that MS has an uneven geographical distribution and a changing incidence over time at least in several areas of the world: this suggests an etiological role of both genetic and environmental factors. The racial difference in disease risk, the results of familial and twin studies as well as the association between MS and some <b>HLA</b> <b>markers,</b> support the great importance of genetic factors. On the other hand, the evidence of temporal trends and the data from migrant studies seem to underline the etiological contribution of environmental factors. In the light of these results much of the present views have emerged interpreting the disease as caused by multiple factors acting at a susceptible age in genetically predisposed subjects...|$|R

We aimed to characterize the different subgroups of ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) {{in a sample of}} Tunisian patients using the Aβ scheme based on {{the presence or absence of}} β-cell autoantibodies (A+ or A−) andβ-cell functional reserve (β+ orβ−) and we investigated whether HLA class II alleles could contribute to distinct KPD phenotypes. We enrolled 43 adult patients with a first episode of ketosis. For all patients we evaluated clinical parameters, β-cell autoimmunity, β-cell function and HLA class II alleles. Frequency distribution of the 4 subgroups was 23. 3 % A+β−, 23. 3 % A−β−, 11. 6 % A+β+ and 41. 9 % A−β+. Patients from the group A+β − were significantly younger than those from the group A−β − (P =. 002). <b>HLA</b> susceptibility <b>markers</b> were significantly more frequent in patients with autoantibodies (P =. 003). These patients also had resistance alleles but they were more frequent in A+β+ thanA+β − patients (P =. 04). Insulin requirement was not associated to the presence or the absence of <b>HLA</b> susceptibility <b>markers.</b> <b>HLA</b> class II alleles associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diabetes have not allowed us to further define Tunisian KPD groups.

40|$|Patients who cannot secrete ABO and Lewis {{blood group}} antigens into body fluids, an ability {{controlled}} by a single gene on chromosome 19, {{are known to be}} at increased risk of certain autoimmune diseases associated with human leucocyte antigen (<b>HLA)</b> <b>markers.</b> This study investigated the possibility of an association with coeliac disease using red cell Lewis (Le) blood group phenotype to infer secretor status. Among 73 patients with coeliac disease who had Le a or b antigen, 48 % were non-secretors (Le a + b-) compared with 27 % of 137 blood donors (p = 0. 004 : odds ratio 2. 49, 95 % confidence intervals 1. 37 to 4. 51) and 26 % of 62 medical and nursing staff controls (p = 0. 014 : odds ratio 2. 65, 95 % confidence intervals 1. 27 to 5. 50). Clinical characteristics did not differ between secretors and non-secretors with coeliac disease. Thus, the non-secretor state is significantly associated with coeliac disease, suggesting that genes on chromosome 19 may directly or indirectly participate in conferring susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|Haemochromatosis (HC) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disease with progressive iron overload leading to midlife onset of clinical complications. The causal gene (HFE) maps to 6 p, in close linkage with the HLA class I genes. An HFE candidate gene recently identified has two missense mutations (C 282 Y and H 63 D) {{associated with the}} disease. Here we document the phenotypic and genetic analysis of a nuclear family comprising two sibs with symptomatic and massive iron overload {{before the age of}} 25. The disease seemed to be recessively transmitted and fitted the agreed criteria for haemochromatosis, but was neither associated with the C 282 Y and H 63 D mutations nor linked with <b>HLA</b> <b>markers.</b> Our data strongly support locus heterogeneity in haemochromatosis by showing evidence that the gene responsible for juvenile haemochromatosis (JH) does not map to 6 p. In the absence of clear cut phenotypic distinction from typical haemochromatosis, patients below 30 years of age and C 282 Y negative should be considered as putative juvenile cases. This has practical implications in genetic counselling and family management...|$|R
40|$|Sacral {{agenesis}} {{is a rare}} {{disorder of}} uncertain incidence that {{has been reported in}} diverse populations. Although usually sporadic and most commonly associated with maternal diabetes, there is a hereditary form which may occur in isolation or with a presacral mass (anterior meningocele and/or presacral teratoma) and anorectal abnormalities, which constitute the Currarino triad (MIM 176450). The radiological hallmark of hereditary sacral agenesis is a hemi-sacrum (sickle-shaped sacrum) with intact first sacral vertebra. Bowel obstruction is the usual neonatal presentation, but, unlike other neural tube defects, adult presentation is not uncommon. The major pathology is confined to the pelvic cavity and may present as a space-occupying lesion or meningitis due to ascending infection. All recurrences in families have been compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance except for those associated with the isomerism gene at Xq 24 -q 27. 1 (ref. 3). Several associated cytogenetic defects have been reported, including 7 q deletions. Previous studies failed to detect linkage to <b>HLA</b> <b>markers,</b> but we now present evidence for a location on 7 q 36. The same region also contains a gene for holoprosencephaly, an early malformation of the extreme rostral end of the neural tube...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{population}} that inhabits the semiarid Northern zone of Chile arose from ethnic admixture between aborigines, Spanish conquerors and the influx, during the XVII century, of foreign aboriginal workers and {{a minority of}} African slaves. Aim: To study the phenotypic frequencies of 15 genetic markers among populations inhabiting valleys in the Northern zone of Chile and to estimate the percentage of indigenous, African and Caucasian admixture in these populations. Material and methods: Throughout five different field works, blood samples were obtained from 120 individuals living in the Elqui valley, 120 individuals living in the Limari valley and 85 living in the Choapa valley. Blood groups, erythrocyte enzymes, plasma proteins and <b>HLA</b> <b>markers</b> were typified. Results: In the populations studied, the contribution of non indigenous genes was low in relation with the time elapsed since the Spanish invasion. The Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium for MNS system would have microevolutive implications. The admixture percentages in these valleys confirm ethnic and historic information. The variation of the enzyme esterase D is identical {{to that of other}} Chilean populations. Conclusions: The phenotypic and genetic frequencies in the three populations studied and different admixture of indigenous genes is inversely proportional to the geographic distance from Santiago, in Central Chile.

40|$|After {{vaccinia virus}} {{vaccination}} of human volunteers, local indurations developed within 10 days, and regional adenopathy was detected in {{half of the}} individuals. Their peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) harvested at different days after vaccination showed specific activity against target cells infected with vaccinia virus with a peak activity at day 7. The specificity of the cytotoxic activity {{was not related to}} <b>HLA</b> <b>markers,</b> since autologous, homologous, and heterologous infected target cells were lysed with the same efficiency. The cytotoxic activity was caused by PBL that did not rosette with sheep erythrocytes and could be depleted by more than 90 percent by removing Fc receptor-bearing cells. T-cell- depleted PBL showed a one-half to two times greater cytotoxicity than intact PBL. The cytotoxic activity could also be abrogated by more than 95 percent by rabbit Fab(2) anti-human IgG. On the other hand, nonimmune PBL lysed vaccinia-infected target cells in the presence of specific antibodies against vaccinia virus, thus demonstrating that ADCC could be efficient in lysing vaccinia-infected target cells. We conclude that after vaccination, antibody-forming cells arise and provide specific anti-viral antibody and that the cytotoxic cells detected in this reaction are K cells. These experiments suggest that antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity may be of major importance in the recovery of man to virus infections...|$|R
40|$|Congenital {{heart block}} (CHB) is a {{syndrome}} of uncertain pathogenesis leading to cardiac conduction disturbances in the foetus and newborns. It {{has been proposed}} that maternal antibodies transmit immunological injury in the developing foetal heart, thus causing irreversible damage of the atrioventricular node, leading to third-degree atrioventricular block. However, some genetic or environmental factors may also be involved. We have searched for genetic markers that {{play a role in}} immune response and that would be pathognomonic for the disease, either in mothers by regulating their immune response or in children by affecting antigen presentation and target for the maternal immune response. We have compared HLA class I and II alleles of the children with their mother and with healthy individuals and searched for <b>HLA</b> <b>markers</b> that would be emphasized in children. We have shown that particular DQ alleles in the child predispose to CHB, perhaps serving as antigen-presenting molecules on site. In addition, the HLA-Cw 3 allele is involved, although its function remains to be clarified. In our results, children with CHB were often identical to their mothers in alleles of DRB, DQA and DQB loci, thus affecting foetomaternal recognition and suggesting that cell-mediated mechanisms could be involved in the pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|This study characterizes {{findings}} on sleep testing and Human Leukocyte Antigen (<b>HLA)</b> <b>markers</b> {{in a group}} of patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). One hundred eighteen patients seen in a general neurology practice over 5 years meeting standard clinical criteria for FM or CFS were analyzed retrospectively. Cases of untreated sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome were excluded prior to inclusion in this study. Ninety-two patients had multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT). Seventy-three (80 %) were abnormal by standard criteria. Of 57 females having positive MSLTs, 22 (39 %) had one or more periods of sleep onset rapid eye movement (SOREM), and 5 of 16 (31 %) males with positive MSLTs had one or more SOREM. Highly fragmented sleep, as previously described in FM, was seen but not analyzed quantitatively. HLA DQB 1 * 0602 was obtained in 74 patients, and positive in 32 (43 %), P [*]<[*] 0. 0001 compared with published values in 228 populations. In our patients, who presented with neuromuscular fatigue or generalized pain, we found a sleep disorder characterized by objective hypersomnia. Some patients had characteristics of narcolepsy.

40|$|We {{have studied}} major {{histocompatibility}} complex markers in randomly ascertained Caucasian patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy and their families. The frequencies of extended haplotypes, defined as haplotypes of specific HLA-B, DR, BF, C 2, C 4 A, and C 4 B allelic combinations, occurring more frequently than expected, were compared on patient chromosomes, on normal chromosomes from the study families, and on chromosomes from normal families. Over half of patient chromosomes consisted almost entirely of two extended haplotypes [HLA-B 8, DR 3, SC 01] and [HLA-B 44, DR 7, FC 31] which, with nonextended HLA-DR 7, accounted for the previously observed <b>HLA</b> <b>markers</b> of this disease: HLA-B 8, DR 3, and DR 7. There was no increase in HLA-DR 3 on nonextended haplotypes or in other extended haplotypes with HLA-DR 3 or DR 7. The distribution of homozygotes and heterozygotes for HLA-DR 3 and DR 7 was consistent with recessive inheritance of the {{major histocompatibility complex}}-linked susceptibility gene for gluten-sensitive enteropathy. On the other hand, by odds ratio analysis and from the sum of DR 3 and DR 7 homozygotes compared with DR 3 /DR 7 heterozygotes, {{there was an increase}} in heterozygotes and a decrease in homozygotes suggesting the presence of modifying phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The {{complement}} system (C-system) l {{is one of}} the principal mediators of the biological effects after the antigen-antibody reaction. Up to now 18 distinct complement components have been defined including 11 acting in the classical pathway of complement activation. Hereditary deficiencies of components of the C-system were first discovered in experimental animals (1 - 3). In 1960 a clinically healthy man was reported with low levels of hemolytic complement caused by a deficiency of the second component of complement (4) which could be shown to be a genetically inherited disorder (5). Subsequently, hereditary deficiencies have been described for almost all classical complement components. The hereditary deficiency reported most frequently is that of C 2. Homozygous or heterozygous deficiency of C 2 has been found in both healthy individuals and in association with systemic or discoid lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, various forms of vasculitis, anaphylactoid purpura, and rheumatic diseases (6 - 19). Fu et al. (16, 20, 21) and Day et al. (22) were the first to study <b>HLA</b> <b>markers</b> in families with inherited deficiencies of the C 2 complement component. They found that C 2 deficiency gene(s) (C 2 °) segregated in coupling with the haplotype HLA-A 10,BI 8. These observations could be confirmed by others (23 - 26). Furthermore HLA-D typing in such familie...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} <b>HLA</b> <b>markers</b> {{that may}} contribute to the genetic susceptibility of Koreans to psoriasis, we studied 84 psoriasis patients, with serologic HLA types of A, B, and genotypes of HLA-Cw, DRB 1, DQA 1, DQB 1, DPB 1 alleles. The distribution of <b>HLA</b> <b>markers</b> and the associated haplotypes were analyzed according to age and sex. HLA-Cw* 0602 showed the strongest association with psoriasis (relative risk[*]=[*] 36. 0, p <  10 − 8, Pc[*]<[*] 8 [*]×[*] 10 − 7). The frequencies of A 1 (relative risk[*]=[*] 17. 0, p <  9 [*]×[*] 10 − 7, Pc[*]<[*] 7 [*]×[*] 10 − 5), A 30 (relative risk[*]=[*] 5. 5, p <  2 [*]×[*] 10 − 5, Pc[*]<[*] 0. 001), B 13 (relative risk[*]=[*] 5. 6, p <  4 [*]×[*] 10 − 6, Pc[*]<[*] 3 [*]×[*] 10 − 4), B 37 (relative risk[*]=[*] 30. 3, p <  7 [*]×[*] 10 − 7, Pc[*]<[*] 6 [*]×[*] 10 − 5), DRB 1 * 07 (relative risk[*]=[*] 5. 9, p <  2 [*]× 10 − 6, Pc[*]<[*] 8 [*]×[*] 10 − 5), DRB 1 * 10 (relative risk[*]=[*] 26. 4, p <  4 [*]×[*] 10 − 6, Pc[*]<[*] 3 [*]×[*] 10 − 4), DQA 1 * 02 (relative risk[*]= 6. 2, p <  5 [*]×[*] 10 − 7, Pc[*]<[*] 4 [*]×[*] 10 − 4), DQB 1 * 02 (relative risk[*]=[*] 2. 5, p <  0. 005, Pc[*]=[*]ns) and DPB 1 * 1701 (relative risk[*]=[*] 24. 6, p <  9 [*]×[*] 10 − 6, Pc[*]<[*] 7 [*]×[*] 10 − 4) were also significantly increased in Korean psoriasis patients. Type I and type II psoriasis were subdivided into groups of below and above 30 [*]y of age, because of the significant difference found in HLA-Cw* 0602 phenotype frequency between the two groups (83. 9 % vs. 54. 5 %, p <  0. 009). In addition to HLA-Cw* 0602, the frequencies of B 37 and DPB 1 * 1701 were significantly higher in type I as opposed to type II psoriasis. HLA-A 30 -B 13 -Cw* 0602 -DRB 1 * 07 -DQA 1 * 02 -DQB 1 * 02 was identified as a high risk haplotype. This was particularly true at an early age in the female. HLA-A 33 -B 44 -Cw* 1401 -DRB 1 * 13 -DQA 1 * 01 -DQB 1 * 06 -DPB 1 * 0401 was defined as a protective haplotype for psoriasis. The extended haplotype HLA-A 1 -B 37 -Cw* 0602 -DRB 1 * 10 -DQA 1 * 01 -DQB 1 * 05 was discovered to be a high-risk factor in Koreans. To summarize, this study demonstrates the differential association of HLA according to sex, and identifies a newly found high-risk haplotype and a protective haplotype in Korean psoriasis patients...|$|R
