40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{assesses the}} assumption {{that more and more}} work is being detached from place and that this is a ‘win-win’ for both employers and employees. Based on an analysis of official labour market data, it finds that only one-third of the increase in remote working can be explained by compositional factors such as movement to the knowledge economy, the growth in flexible employment and organisational responses to the changing demographic make-up of the employed labour force. This suggests that the detachment of work from place is a growing trend. The paper also shows that while remote working is associated with higher organisational commitment, job satisfaction and job-related well-being, these benefits come at the cost of work intensification and a greater <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>off...</b>|$|E
40|$|Three new {{complementation}} {{groups of}} type 2 {{herpes simplex virus}} are described bringing {{the total number of}} complementation groups characterized to 13. Of the three new groups, ts I I fails to make virus DNA at non-permissive temperature (38 °C) whereas ts Iz and ts 13 synthesize only very small amounts of virus or cellular DNA at 38 °C. ts II, like ts 9 (Halliburton & Timbury, I 973) fails to switch off host cell DNA synthesis at 38 °C. That this is a failure to switch off cell DNA rather than a stimulation of cell DNA synthesis was confirmed in experiments using resting cells. Both the inability to make virus DNA and the <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> cell DNA are reversed in temperature shift-down experiments with cells infected with ts 9 or ts 11. In temperature shift-up experiments, cellular DNA synthesis is inhibited after the shift but virus DNA is only made in very small amounts, probably due to the continuing functioning of a protein made at permissive temperature (31 °C) before the shift but which cannot be made at 38 °C. The shift-down experiments and the fact that ts 9 and ts I I complement one another, suggest that the switch-off of host cell DNA synthesis may involve more than one virus specified function. U. v. irradiated virus fails to switch off host cell DNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|A {{missense}} mutation in the gene coding for the G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel, GIRK 2, {{is responsible for}} apoptosis in the external germinal layer (EGL) of the cerebellum and a nonapoptotic death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the weaver (wv) mouse. Failure of axonogenesis and migration {{are considered to be}} the primary consequences of GIRK 2 channel malfunction in the cerebellum. We investigated whether a disruption of the cell cycle precedes the failure of migration and axonogenesis and leads to massive apoptosis. To this end, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for PCNA, Cdk 4, cyclin D, cyclin A, and the Cdk inhibitor p 27 /kip 1, as well as in situ end-labeling for apoptotic DNA fragmentation, were applied to cerebella of P 7 -P 21 +/+, wv/+, and wv/wv mice. In +/+ and wv/+ mice, the expression of cell cycle proteins was limited to the outer, premigratory zone of the EGL. Antibodies to p 27, a marker of cell differentiation, gave a reverse staining pattern. Due to migration delay, patches of p 27 -positive cells persisted in the outer EGL in P 21 wv/+ mice. On the contrary, marked cell cycle up-regulation and absence of p 27 occurred throughout the EGL at all ages in wv/wv mice, indicating an <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> the cell cycle. Mitotic index evaluation showed that cell cycle activation was unrelated to proliferative events. Cell cycle proteins were not expressed in the substantia nigra, suggesting that nonapoptotic death of mature dopaminergic neurons is not preceded by abortive cell cycle re-entry. Our data show that abnormalities of the cell cycle in wv/wv cerebellum represent a major and early consequence of GIRK 2 channel malfunction and may strongly influence the susceptibility of EGL cells to apoptosis. These observations may help in understanding the pathogenesis of human neurological channelopathies...|$|E

40|$|Disruption of the mTOR {{nutrient}} complex, {{which is}} a crucial evolutionarily-conserved pathway that regulates cellular metabolism and protein translation, produces a cellular stress condition that disrupts the homeostasis of the ER and leads to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. This accumulation produces a condition known as ER stress. ER stress, through the UPR, produces a tripartite effect within the cell that includes the inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS- 1, a decrease in overall protein translation {{and an increase in}} the ER 2 ̆ 7 s protein-folding capacity. ^ The mTOR nutrient pathway regulates a variety of translational repressors, among which is PDCD 4. We have discovered that the loss of functionality of PDCD 4 within the cell leads to its <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> protein translation which in turn causes ER stress. The advent of ER stress induces a biochemical cascade that results in JNK activation, insulin resistance and ultimately, Type-II diabetes. ^ Obesity is known to induce ER stress and {{play a central role in}} the onset of insulin resistance and Type-II diabetes by triggering JNK activity and inhibiting insulin receptor signaling. To determine the role of ER stress produced by the deletion of PDCD 4 in the development of insulin resistance, cells undergoing ER stress were treated with molecules classified as artificial protein-folding chaperones. These molecules are known to protect the cell from ER stress and to facilitate the folding of proteins. The artificial protein-folding chaperone, 4 -phenyl butyric acid (PBA) was administered in the course of our investigation to obese mice that were experiencing insulin resistance. The drug-treated mice recovered their insulin sensitivity. These chaperone-treated mice then presented with undetectable levels of ER stress markers and also displayed no detectable JNK activation. ^ Having elucidated the above biochemical mechanism for the development of insulin insensitivity due to the deletion of PDCD 4, we have further discovered that the introduction of artificial protein-folding chaperones into animal models deficient in PDCD 4 restores full insulin functioning. Thus, these results indicate that existing pharmacological regimens may prove decisive in ameliorating the symptoms of Type-II diabetes that result from ER stress and the hypertranslation of proteins. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{models of}} visual {{attention}} (eg. Rizzolatti et al., 1987) {{have suggested that}} a similar system orients visual attention as is used to produce a saccadic eye movement. This thesis provides further support for {{the link between the}} attentional and eye orienting systems and has incorporated ideas from recent models of saccade generation. The time taken by normal subjects to initiate a saccade ('latency'), is examined in Chapters two, three and four. Subjects were given attentional instructions and saccades made to either: unilateral single, or, bilateral double, targets. Latency to attended targets was not greatly enhanced, while latency to non-attended targets was greatly slowed. The results support both the premotor model of visual attention and models of visual attention that emphasise the inhibitory consequence of directed attention. Bilateral double targets produced an additional slowing on saccade latency, which could reflect a further automatic attentional inhibition produced in the contralateral field by the stimulus onset. Fixation point offset (in 'gap' situations) is known to reduce saccade latency, which has been attributed to prior attentional disengagement (Fischer, 1987). In Chapter two, the use of a gap situation produced a generalised speeding which was independent of the effects of directed visual attention. This suggests that active fixation affects a separate component to that involved in orienting visual attention to a spatial location. This idea is incorporated into a model which emphasises the inhibitory consequences of attentive fixation. Chapters six and seven report the findings from an experimental investigation of a patient (B. Q.) with a 'unilateral spatial neglect', a condition often attributed to a deficit of visual attention. The 'gap' paradigm was shown to be effective at reducing the severity of B. Q. 's contralateral neglect. In contrast to normal subjects, bilateral double targets did not have an inhibitory effect on her saccade latency. These findings are explained in terms of a model that neglect results in part from the loss of attentional inhibition for the ipsilesional side of space and in part an <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> contralesional inhibition produced during active fixation. A functional model is proposed in Chapter eight to account for the findings. This supports the close link between the attentional orienting and saccade programming systems. An additional implication of the findings is that models of visual attention and saccade generation need to consider the inhibitory consequences of directing attention to a spatial location...|$|E

The study focused on leadership and creating an understanding of their own strengths and developmental areas, in order to understand the role they can play within a leadership team, how other members of a team can compliment them with their strengths and for them to get greater awareness of their impact on their subordinates, the rest of the management team and the organisation as a whole. The aim was also to inform personal development. in so far as the leaders now understand what their development areas are. The overall approach used in the stud) was quantitative in nature and involved survey research using the Occupational Personality Questionnaire (SHL). The target population consisted of identified employees who ere fulfilling leadership role in MACSF. The study was also conducted organisation wide at ever) Mmabana Cultural Center (Mmabatho, Head Office, Lehurutse, Taung and Tlhabane). Non-probability sampling was used; more specifically, availability sampling was utilised in which the researcher made use of all the available subjects due to MACSF's small size. The effective sample size was a small 39. The findings of this study revealed that a comprehensive investigation into the effective leadership and management competencies within the MACSF confirmed the descriptive hypothesis that certain elements within MACSF's leadership structure is underdeveloped and that specific remedial actions would be required to rectify the situation. This descriptive research found that many employees in managerial positions indicated no real concern or preference for leading other employees as they are indeed artists who would like to continue specialising in their specific art form. It was also found that personality preferences needed to be amazing artists, are in stark contrast to what is needed to be an effective administrator/manager. This, coupled with no formal training in financial management or management, leads to ineffective administration/management. It was also found that the past hardships which the Mmabana Foundation has been through, has taken its toll on the employees. Low levels of caring, trusting and optimism, coupled with high levels of stress and an <b>inability</b> <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>off</b> after work, were found. The researcher recommends personal and professional development interventions, focused on business relation skills, which includes amongst others Strategic Planning, General Business Management, Project Management. Communications techniques, Monitoring & Evaluation, Financial Management for non-financial managers and Human Resource Management with the focus on Performance Management Development Systems and Asset Management at the beginning. It is also further proposed that the leadership team does team building activities where MACSF's strategy is defined, action plans are drawn up and a focus towards external competition (rather than departments/units competing against each) is created. Finally, better communication channels between management and staff, as well as between the Head Office and all the centres, should be used, as this can also assist in creating a unified Foundation.
