Most Americans obtain enough iron from their diets. Still, without enough iron, you can acquire a condition called iron-deficiency anemia, most common among women and children.

What most people don’t know is that through chronic exercise, your body adapts to these processes and increases the antioxidant enzyme activity that helps buffer oxidative damage.

40|$|Iodine is a {{trace element}} that is {{essential}} for the production of thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine. Iodine deficiency had in the past result in many serious diseases and disorders. At present is in the Czech Republic considered mastered. However, Iodine deficiency are vulnerable to specific groups of the population, including pregnant and nursing women, because of their need and the recommended daily dose of iodine is increased. Breastfeeding women should receive adequate amounts of dietary iodine for optimal saturation for themselves and their child. Otherwise, exposing themselves and their child risk of diseases and disorders of iodine deficiency. Increased supply of iodine can be replaced by eating foods rich in iodine. In the event that you cannot increase intake of iodine - rich food preferences in iodine, there are various supplements that contain iodine. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the intake of iodine supplements and supplements in nursing women and breast-feeding women to assess the awareness for greater needs of iodine and food iodine sources. There were set up the three research questions: How many nursing women used to supply iodine supplements and supplements?, What is the awareness of breastfeeding women need more iodine? and What is the awareness of breastfeeding women about dietary sources of iodine? A quantitative research strategy was used for the implementation of the research. The method used for data collection was made by an anonymous questionnaire. A questionnaire was handed in a printed copy to pediatricians and gynecologists in the southern Bohemia. With the doctors help were invited nursing women to fulfill the questionnaire. Part of the women was invited to complete the questionnaire directly. The research sample consisted of 117 female respondents. The research shows that 62 % of breastfeeding women know why it is important to increased need for iodine during lactation. But only 9 % of women know all the risks of iodine deficiency on the mother mentioned in the questionnaire and only one new mother knows all risk of iodine deficiency for infants listed in the questionnaire. The recommended daily intake of iodine properly reported or estimated 40. 2 % of women. It turned out that 46 % of respondents from the research group used food supplements and supplements containing iodine. Each of these respondents used only one preparation with iodine. The most commonly used products were: GS mamavit, a Smart baby and Femibion 400 and Gravital. 43 % of respondents had used a dietary supplement containing iodine from the beginning of pregnancy and in 57 % of the respondents were informed about food supplements through a doctor (gynecologist, pediatrician). The results showed that awareness of breastfeeding women about food sources of iodine is not good. 67 % of women know that settlement higher needs iodine during lactation is possible by eating foods rich in iodine, but all food sources of iodine in the questionnaires (sea fish, seafood and seaweed, iodized salt, and milk and dairy products) registered only one respondent. 39 % of women known as a rich source of iodine, seafood, seafood and seaweed, iodized salt, but none of them knew that the rich and a good source of iodine is also milk and dairy products.
