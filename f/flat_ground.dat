5|$|Kraft's {{world record}} {{initially}} came under scrunity, {{as it appeared}} that he touched the snow with his backside as {{he was forced to}} squat down on essentially <b>flat</b> <b>ground.</b> However, slow-motion replay analysis confirmed that his landing was valid, albeit with only millimetres to spare. A week later, Planica caught up to Vikersund with a plethora of more personal bests, and three athletes – including Kraft, twice – landing jumps of or beyond 250m. Kamil Stoch would claim the current hill record of 251.5m, with the season finale competition drawing an attendance of 16,500.|$|E
5|$|Most bee-eaters are gregarious. They form colonies, nesting in burrows {{tunnelled}} into vertical sandy banks, {{often at}} the side of a river or in <b>flat</b> <b>ground.</b> As they mostly live in colonies, large numbers of nest holes may be seen together. The eggs are white, with typically five to the clutch. Most species are monogamous, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} six well-situated and {{developed}} redoubts {{making up the}} strong Ottoman garrison position at Magdhaba reflected considerable planning; the redoubts were almost impossible to locate on the <b>flat</b> <b>ground</b> {{on both sides of}} the Wadi el Arish. Clearly, the move of the Ottoman garrison from El Arish had not been a sudden, panicked reaction; indeed it was first noticed by Allied aerial reconnaissance planes as early as 25 October.|$|E

This {{is known as a}} reluctance motor.|$|R
5|$|The {{topography}} of Coatbridge {{was an important}} feature in the towns development during the industrial revolution. Coatbridge rests 60 metres below the 'Slamannan plateau' which neighbouring Airdrie {{sits on the edge}} of. The low-lying <b>flat</b> <b>ground</b> of Coatbridge was a vital factor in the siting of the towns' blast furnaces and the Monkland Canal route. Although Airdrie was an already established town and had local supplies of ironstone, the Monkland Canal link did not extend into Airdrie because of its higher elevation. The Clyde Valley plan of 1949 described Coatbridge as 'situated over a flooded coalfield'. Tenement buildings in Coatbridge were not built to the same level as Glasgow tenements due to danger of local subsidence from centuries of local mining.|$|E
5|$|All these {{increasingly}} {{long distances}} {{came at a}} price, as illustrated by filmmaker Werner Herzog in his 1974 documentary The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner. During both the aforementioned events in Oberstdorf and Planica, several athletes including Steiner had far exceeded {{the limits of the}} hill by 'out-jumping' it or simply 'running out of slope'. Jumps were much further than in the 1950s, during which the old Kongsberger technique was still in use. The results were now potentially fatal each time: athletes were coming only metres away from landing on completely <b>flat</b> <b>ground,</b> or the equivalent of falling from a multi-storey building. Furthermore, only a wool cap and goggles – or no headgear at all – were worn; an antiquated feature left unchanged from the very earliest days of ski jumping more than 150 years prior. In 1979, at their 32nd International Ski Congress in Nice, France, the FIS mandated helmets to be worn by athletes at all ski jumping and flying events.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the 12th Brigade were {{elements}} of the 35th Division, the first of these was the 19th (Service) Battalion (2nd Tyneside Pioneers) of the Northumberland Fusiliers, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel W.P.S.Foord. It was deployed near the railway arch on the northwestern outskirts of Dernancourt. The right-hand gun of the 12th Machine Gun Company was positioned with this unit, which was {{under the control of the}} 106th Brigade. To their right the 106th Brigade was deployed along the railway line as far as Buire-sur-l'Ancre. This section of the railway ran along <b>flat</b> <b>ground.</b> On its right, the 104th Brigade line ran from Buire-sur-l'Ancre past Treux. The 104th Brigade overlapped and sheltered the left flank of the 10th Brigade of the 3rd Division, which was deployed just east of Méricourt-l'Abbé. The VII Corps positions had excellent observation of the surrounding countryside, but were tactically weak.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{building}} of Orford Castle, Suffolk was dominated by the Bigod family, who held {{the title of the}} Earl of Norfolk and owned key castles at Framlingham, Bungay, Walton and Thetford. Hugh Bigod had been {{one of a group of}} dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen, and Henry II wished to re-establish royal influence across the region. Henry confiscated the four castles from Hugh, but returned Framlingham and Bungay to Hugh in 1165. Henry then decided to build his own royal castle at Orford, near Framlingham, and construction work began in 1165, concluding in 1173. The Orford site was around two miles (3.2km) from the sea, lying on <b>flat</b> <b>ground</b> with swampy terrain slowly stretching away down to the river Ore, about half a mile (0.8km) away.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman {{artillery}} {{batteries and}} trenches {{were difficult to}} locate, but by 10:00 the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was advancing towards the firing line. At this time, an aerial report described small groups of the Magdhaba garrison beginning to retreat, {{and as a result}} the still-mounted reserve, the 1st Light Horse Brigade, was ordered to move directly on the town, passing the dismounted Imperial Camel Brigade battalions on their way. After meeting severe shrapnel fire as they trotted over the open plain, they were forced to take cover in the Wadi el Arish where they dismounted, continuing their advance at 10:30 against the Ottoman left. Meanwhile, the battalions of the Imperial Camel Brigade, continued their advance over the <b>flat</b> <b>ground</b> for , section by section, covering fire provided by each section in turn.|$|E
5|$|Many of the fortifications at {{sea level}} have survived, though not always in their {{original}} condition. A substantial number have been built over. The Inundation was drained after World War II {{and is now the}} site of the Laguna Estate, named after the Inundation's lagoon. The glacis was likewise used as the foundations of the Glacis Estate. The <b>flat</b> <b>ground</b> of the retired batteries made them prime building spots during Gibraltar's post-war building boom, thus many of them have disappeared under recent developments. The city walls have almost entirely survived and are progressively being cleared of modern structures to restore them to something more like their original appearance. However, they are no longer at the water's edge due to extensive land reclamation. Various parts of the fortifications have been converted to civilian use. After being used for some years as a hostel for Moroccan migrant workers, the Grand Casemates Barracks have been renovated and converted into restaurants and shops. An electricity generating station was built inside the King's Bastion in the 1960s but has since been demolished and the bastion has been converted into a leisure centre.|$|E

5|$|The Maratha {{army was}} {{a mix of}} Rohillas, Rajputs, and Marathas. It also {{included}} a small force of the Portuguese under their officer, de Pinto. The left flank of the Maratha army, commanded by Moropant Dixit and Raste, was stationed on the <b>flat</b> <b>ground</b> on which the University of Pune stands today. The centre was commanded by Bapu Gokhale and the right was under Vinchurkar. British troop movements began on 1 November 1817 when Colonel Burr moved his forces towards what is now Bund Garden via the Holkar Bridge. The Maratha were successful initially in creating and exploiting {{a gap in the}} British left and centre. These successes were nullified by the Maratha horses being thrown into disarray by a hidden canal and the temporary loss of command by Gokhale, whose horse was shot. The Marathas were rendered leaderless when Moropant Dixit on the right was shot dead. The British infantry advanced steadily, firing volley after volley, causing the Maratha cavalry to retreat in a matter of four hours. The British soon claimed victory. The British lost 86 men and the Maratha about 500.|$|E
5|$|The citadel {{is located}} in the {{northwest}} corner of the old walled city of Damascus, between the Bab al-Faradis and the Bab al-Jabiyah. Whereas most medieval Arabic castles are located on prominent hilltops, the citadel of Damascus was built on <b>flat</b> <b>ground</b> at the same level {{as the rest of the}} city, a feature it shares with the Citadel of Bosra. The location of the citadel ensured that it could control the Barada River, which flows north of the citadel. The location of the river also offered protection against attack from that side of the citadel. The Nahr Aqrabani, a canal branching off the Barada, flowed immediately below the northern wall and provided additional protection. The dry moats on the other sides of the citadel could be filled from these streams. Another branch of the Barada, the Nahr Banyas, entered the city under the citadel. Hydraulic structures below that made control of the flow of water into Damascus possible from within the citadel were probably constructed under Al-Adil. The citadel was fully integrated into the defences of Damascus, with the city walls abutting the citadel on its southwest and northeast corners.|$|E

The French Air Force established an air base, the Base aérienne tactique 192, which was very active during the First Indochina War. On 1 June 1955, Bien Hoa Air Base became the VNAF's logistics support base when the French evacuated their main depot at Hanoi. At that time the VNAF was in its final days as an auxiliary air arm under total French control.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} renowned aspect of Incan {{architecture}} {{is the use}} of terraces to increase the land available for farming.

25|$|This {{also meant}} {{increased}} freedom {{in searching for}} a female mate because the males could now transport the packet of sperm elsewhere if the first female slipped away. This ability would eliminate the need to either wait for another female {{at the site of}} the deposited sperm packet or to produce a new packet, wasting energy. Other advantages include the possibility of mating in other, safer places than <b>flat</b> <b>ground,</b> such as in trees or bushes.|$|E
