5|$|Prior to the group's debut, some of {{the members}} were already {{involved}} in the entertainment industry. Yoona <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> about 200 auditions for music videos, dramas, and movies before becoming a singer for Girls' Generation. Sooyoung was exposed to the Japanese music scene {{as a member of a}} pop duo named Route θ, which disbanded one year after its debut in 2002.|$|E

Miller played {{in the first game}} and scored six in his only innings and did not take a wicket, before being rested for the second match. Australia won both matches by an innings. As a result, Australia finished the tour with 25wins and nine draws. They <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> the summer without defeat.|$|E

5|$|Aston {{commented that}} {{throughout}} his life he suffered from poor health; he was afflicted with aspergillosis from the early 1980s, and was also asthmatic. He suffered a brain haemorrhage in March 2003, and was hospitalised for two weeks. The experience sent him into depression for eighteen months, during which time he read the autobiography of actress Jane Lapotaire, who <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> the same experience, something which he believed aided his recovery more than anything else.|$|E
5|$|Nolan {{worked with}} {{production}} designer Nathan Crowley {{to create the}} look of Gotham City. Crowley built {{a model of the}} city that filled Nolan's garage. Crowley and Nolan designed it as a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through.</b> Elements were drawn from New York City, Chicago, and Tokyo; the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails. The Narrows was based on the slummish nature of the (now demolished) walled city of Kowloon in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|The book debuted at No.9 on the New York Times best-seller list, {{rising to}} No.3 two weeks later. It {{remained}} on the list for eleven weeks. Four weeks after the book's initial publication, it was in Amazon's top ten. Clarke went on a 20-city tour to promote the novel, after its near-simultaneous publication in 20 countries. Endorsements from independent booksellers helped the book sell out its first printing; {{by the end of}} September 2004, it <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> eight printings.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the title}} win, Chapman kept faith with his squad, making only one new signing – outside right Joey Williams – as they {{successfully}} defended their League title in 1924–25. Huddersfield started brightly but a poor run of form in October and November (in part {{caused by an}} injury to goalkeeper Ted Taylor) saw them drop to ninth at one point. Taylor was replaced by new signing Billy Mercer and a resurgence in form saw Huddersfield climb the table, regaining top spot with a 5–0 win over Arsenal in February, and eventually finishing two points clear of runners-up West Bromwich Albion. As a testament to Chapman's philosophy of relying on a strong defence, {{it was the first}} time a title-winning side <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> a season without conceding more than two goals in any match.|$|E
5|$|Francis Marrash {{was born}} in Aleppo, a city of Ottoman Syria (present-day Syria), to an old Melkite family of merchants known for their {{literary}} interests. Having earned wealth and standing in the 18th century, the family was well established in Aleppo, although they <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> troubles: a relative of Francis, Butrus Marrash, was martyred by Greek Orthodox fundamentalists in April 1818. Other Melkite Catholics were exiled from Aleppo during the persecutions, among them the priest Jibrail Marrash. Francis' father, Fathallah, tried to defuse the Sectarian conflict by writing a treatise in 1849, in which he rejected the Filioque. He had built up a large private library to give his three children Francis, Abdallah and Maryana a thorough education, particularly {{in the field of}} Arabic language and literature.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Riefenstahl was {{the subject}} of the award-winning German {{documentary}} film The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, directed by Ray Müller. Riefenstahl appeared in the film and answered several questions and detailed the production of her films. The biofilm was nominated for seven Emmy Awards, winning in one category. Riefenstahl, who for some time had been working on her memoirs, decided to cooperate in the production of this documentary to tell her life story about the struggles she <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> in her personal life, her film-making career and what people thought of her. She was also the subject of Müller's 2000 documentary film , about her return to Sudan to visit the Nuba people.|$|E

5|$|Several facts {{point to}} a {{political}} motive behind the assassination. Leontovych's participation in the independence movement, such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella, aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state, earned him many enemies. His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying, shortly before his death, that he had documents {{to leave the country}} to Romania, and that he had these documents with him among his sheet music during a concert. However, after returning from tea following the concert, Leontovych noticed that someone <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> his papers. His plans to leave the country, along {{with the fact that he}} was killed by a Soviet agent, also indicate political reasons for his death.|$|E
5|$|Several journalists {{hypothesized}} that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness ("Showtime") and Boston/Indiana blue collar grit ("Celtic Pride"), and between blacks and whites. The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings. With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won {{a whole generation of}} new fans, drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. According to sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN, Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|The Historian was {{the first}} debut novel to land at number one on The New York Times bestseller list in its first week on sale, and as of 2005 was the fastest-selling {{hardback}} debut novel in U.S. history. The book sold more copies on its first day in print than The Da Vinci Code– 70,000 copies were sold {{in the first week}} alone. As of the middle of August 2005, the novel had already sold 915,000 copies in the U.S. and <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> six printings. (For comparison, according to Publishers Weekly, only ten fiction books sold more than 800,000 hardcover copies in the US in 2004.) Little, Brown and Company also released an edition of Dracula in September 2005 with an introduction by Kostova, thinking her readers would want to delve into the original novel after reading hers. Kostova {{is one of the few}} female bestselling authors, but her popularity is unusual because it is founded on a literary novel.|$|E

5|$|Victorian {{painting}} <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> radical changes, {{and by the}} 1870s the {{realism of}} Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites {{had given way to}} the ideas of the Aesthetic Movement, abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty's. The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict passivity, rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty's works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from Paul Cézanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.|$|E
5|$|With a {{director}} finally secured, the next hurdle was finishing the script, which <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> several revisions by numerous writers. The initial villain {{of the film}} was Ernst Stavro Blofeld; however Kevin McClory, who owned the film rights to Thunderball forced an injunction on Eon Productions against using the character of Blofeld, or his international criminal organisation, SPECTRE, which delayed production of the film further. The villain was later changed from Blofeld to Stromberg so that the injunction would {{not interfere with the}} production. Christopher Wood was later brought in by Lewis Gilbert to complete the script. Although Fleming had requested that no elements from his original book be used, the film characters of Jaws and Sandor are based on the novel characters Sol Horror and Sluggsy Morant, respectively. Horror is described as having steel-capped teeth, while Sluggsy had a clear bald head.|$|E
