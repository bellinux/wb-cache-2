5|$|For {{the three}} {{dangerous}} {{days of the}} passage to Alexandria the passengers subsisted on oranges and wine. On board with the Smiths were the novelist Robert Liddell, the Welsh poet Harold Edwards, and their wives– the Smiths shared a cramped cabin with the Edwardses. Mrs. Edwards had brought with her a hat box full of expensive Parisian hats, which Manning kept placing in the passageway outside the cabin, and from whence Mrs. Edwards kept returning it. The two were not on speaking terms {{by the end of}} the voyage, but Manning <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> word: when Mrs. Edwards later opened her hatbox she found that Manning had crushed the hats with a chamberpot.|$|E
5|$|Milan almost {{took the}} lead in the 70th minute, after Dudek dropped a low cross towards Shevchenko, whose effort was cleared off the line by Traore. Gerrard then had a chance to score but he sent his shot over the crossbar. About ten minutes later García could not control a pass from Gerrard which led to a Milan attack, Crespo played the ball back to Kaka, whose {{subsequent}} shot was blocked by Jamie Carragher. A number of substitutions were made before the end of full-time with Liverpool replacing Milan Baroš with Djibril Cissé, while Milan replaced Hernán Crespo and Clarence Seedorf with Jon Dahl Tomasson and Serginho respectively. Milan <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> chance before full-time but Kaka failed to direct Jaap Stam's header towards goal, meaning the final would go to extra time for the 13th time in the competition's history.|$|E
5|$|The MCC {{match was}} {{followed}} by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. Loxton top-scored with 39 as Australia batted first and were bowled out for 204 after the first day was washed out. He then took 0/18 from eight overs and made 52 in the second innings before being run out while batting with Harvey as the match ended in a draw. In the second innings, Loxton attempted to attack the bowling of Malcolm Hilton—who had troubled Bradman in the first innings—in an attempt to throw him off his game. However, Hilton <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> laugh and removed Bradman for the second time.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} of the show was a steel cage match between long-time rivals Konnan and Perro Aguayo, while the semi-main event was a tag team Lucha de Apuestas, Mask vs. Hair match between the popular duo of Octagón and El Hijo del Santo taking on La Pareja del Terror ("The Terror Team"; Art Barr and Eddie Guerrero). While not the main {{event of the}} show, the semi-main event was rated 5 stars by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, which also voted La Pareja del Terror the Team of the Year and Art Barr the Heel of the Year. After the match, Barr and Guerrero first cut off each other's hair and then <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of it shaved off {{as a result of}} their loss.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Lord Evershed {{resigned}} as Master of the Rolls, and Denning {{was appointed to}} replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of £9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' he was pleased with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the Court of Appeal than the House of Lords. Court of Appeal judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so {{it was suggested that}} to get his way in the Court of Appeal Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House of Lords it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the Court of Appeal is that it hears more cases than the House of Lords, and so has a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of the Rolls, Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> word; comparatively few cases went on to the House of Lords, which was at that time Britain's highest court of law.|$|E

25|$|However, Muralitharan <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> word when he {{dismissed}} both these well-set batsmen within an over of each other. Shortly afterwards, Ryan Sidebottom was dismissed to a controversial lbw decision (replays showed a big inside edge onto pad) which ended the stiffest {{of the resistance}} the lower order could offer. Matthew Hoggard was clean bowled by a Lasith Malinga yorker a few overs later, and Sri Lanka had won the match by 88 runs.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, the Gernatt's transitioned their {{dairy farming}} {{business}} {{to one of}} breeding and racing Standardbred horses with the purchase of Lieutenant Gray.

Among some of the Gernatt's top money-winning horses were Gallo Blue Chip, Bye Tsem (formerly Holden S. Collins), Vernon Blue Chip, Roz T. Collins, Adios Bob, Sir Taurus, Lotto S. Collins, and Elitist.|$|E

25|$|The new Elector, George William, who {{resided in}} Prussia, was appalled {{when he heard}} of his mother's {{independent}} action. He wrote to Gustavus Adolphus to refuse his consent to the marriage until Sweden and Poland had settled their differences. It was the Electress Dowager, however, who, in accordance with Hohenzollern family custom, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> word in bestowing her daughter's hand in marriage. She sent Maria Eleonora to territory outside of George William's reach and concluded the marriage negotiations herself.|$|E
25|$|Cronje {{once again}} came up against Australia {{and once again}} ended on the losing side. In the {{triangular}} one day series they won the group with Australia just scraping through, they also won the first 'final' but South Africa lost the last two finals. During the group matches Cronje had threatened to lead his team off after Pat Symcox had missiles thrown at him, Symcox <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> laugh ending the match with 4/24. Before the Test series started he scored consecutive centuries against Tasmania and Australia A these were his first in two years.|$|E
25|$|In 398/399 a Roman {{army was}} again {{transferred}} to Britain. The panegyrist, Claudian, {{reported that the}} West Roman magister militum, Stilicho, led a campaign against the Picts and Scots at Hadrian's Wall. The Comes Britanniarum clearly placed nine units of comitatenses under Stilicho. In 402, however, he withdrew most of these soldiers back to Italy to use against the rebellious West Gothic army of Alaric. Around this time, the praepositus, Justinian, had a tower replaced in the Roman camp of Ravenscar and <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> known Roman inscription in Britain placed on it for this occasion.|$|E

25|$|In September 1854 Darwin <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of his {{barnacle}} monographs {{ready for}} publication, {{and he turned}} his attention fully to questions about how species originated. He freely discussed his intention to write a book on the subject, and planned avenues of research with other scientists. He went over his previous notes and writings on the topic, and drew up proposals for investigations and research into the implications of his theory. One topic was explaining geographical distribution of organisms; he got information from international correspondence, and experimented on the viability of methods of dispersal. He widened his investigations into variability in nature, and experimented on plant hybridisation and cross-fertilisation.|$|E
25|$|The Spurs won 56 {{games in}} the {{succeeding}} 2007–08 season, but relinquished the Southwest Division title to the New Orleans Hornets due to a tie-breaker. The Spurs <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> laugh, though, defeating the Hornets in seven games. But their chance of defending their title was denied by the Los Angeles Lakers in five games of the conference finals. After that, age and injury took its toll on the Spurs, as they proceeded to win only a single playoff series in three years (2010, vs. Dallas 4–2 of the first round), before getting upset by the Memphis Grizzlies {{in the first round}} of the 2011 NBA Playoffs despite finishing with 61 wins.|$|E
25|$|Attack {{criteria}} and approval: The political {{dimensions of the}} attack were carefully considered, such as the timing of an election in the enemy camp, or the appointment of certain government officials. Planning involved a coordinated effort by military and logistics staff and the all-important political operatives, the party cadres who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> word. Proposals for an operation were first sent up the chain of command. Depending {{on the scale of}} the planned operation, an idea to attack a certain village post might float up from Provincial, to Zone, to Interzone levels. Great stress was placed on a successful outcome that would be beneficial in terms of actual military results or propaganda. Numerical superiority was deemed essential.|$|E

25|$|Charles was a {{brilliant}} strategic general, who also was a tactical commander par excellence, able {{in the heat of}} battle to adapt his plans to his foe's forces and movement — and amazingly, to defeat them repeatedly, especially when, as at Tours, they were far superior in men and weaponry, and at Berre and Narbonne, when they were superior in numbers of fighting men. Charles <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> quality which defines genuine greatness in a military commander: he foresaw the dangers of his foes, and prepared for them with care; he used ground, time, place, and fierce loyalty of his troops to offset his foe's superior weaponry and tactics; third, he adapted, again and again, to the enemy on the battlefield, shifting to compensate for the unforeseen and unforeseeable.|$|E
25|$|Connecticut {{entered the}} game having won its last 37 games, but their {{opponent}} Stanford {{was the last}} team to have beaten them. Just over nine minutes into the game, Stanford led 14-13. Jayne Appel scored ten of Stanford's 14 points, and assisted {{on one of the}} other two baskets. Then Renee Montgomery scored nine of UConn's next eleven points and assisted on the other basket in the stretch. Maya Moore added five points, part of an 18-4 run to bring the score to 31-18. Connecticut entered the halftime break with a 13-point lead, one more than they had <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time they had played a Final Four game in St. Louis: a 2001 game in which, despite the large halftime lead, Notre Dame went to win the game and the Championship.|$|E
25|$|England's start was shaky. Ian Botham was {{dismissed}} for a duck by Wasim Akram, followed by Alec Stewart, Hick and Gooch, which left England tumbling at 69/4. A solid partnership of 71 between Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother caused Imran {{to give an}} early second spell to his main pacer Wasim Akram in the 35th over. The decision wrote {{the fate of the}} match. Two deliveries from the left arm fast bowler dismissed Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis. Soon Fairbrother was caught by Moin Khan off Aaqib Javed to seal England's last hope. When the cards were laid down, captain Imran Khan <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> laugh when Richard Illingworth was caught by Ramiz Raja off his delivery to finish off the final and crown Pakistan world champions of cricket.|$|E
