5|$|The New Zealand Parliamentary Commissioner <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b> {{found that}} the solar PV would have little impact on the country's {{greenhouse}} gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources (primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal) and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, meaning a large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants.|$|E

She was elected a senator in 2007, the first politician in her caste, but was arrested the following year after a coup d'état.
