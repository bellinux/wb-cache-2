40|$|System {{integration}} {{is a key}} enabler to maximize information value in an engineering context. The valuable information is normally represented by <b>information</b> <b>models</b> which play a decisive role {{in the implementation of}} system integration. The <b>information</b> <b>models</b> are designed to efficiently and effectively capture, process and communicate information among different functional and business units. However, use of the <b>information</b> <b>models</b> in implementing system {{integration is}} challenged by insufficient support from current settings of modeling architectures. This situation calls for new strategies to ease the use of <b>information</b> <b>models.</b> To address this challenge, this study presents a new twofold solution: Model driven system integration. It includes 1) a modeling architecture to guide the development of <b>information</b> <b>models</b> and 2) an integrated implementation process to guide the use of <b>information</b> <b>models.</b> Thus, this work improves practical applicability of an <b>information</b> <b>model</b> in its entire modeling lifecycle. The results contribute not only to the performance of modeling practices but also to improved understanding of <b>information</b> <b>modeling</b> in system integration. Implementation contexts and implementation models are introduced to develop an implementation-oriented modeling architecture. Further, the potential of <b>information</b> <b>models</b> as a knowledge base to sup-port implementation practices is identified. To concretely discuss behaviors and structures of <b>information</b> <b>models,</b> this study adopts ISO 10303 and the related standards as major references of existing <b>information</b> <b>models.</b> Case studies on model driven system integration validate this research in scenarios concerning kinematic modeling, kinematic error modeling, cutting tools classification and product catalogue modeling.

40|$|Building <b>information</b> <b>models</b> are {{increasingly}} being utilised for facility management of large facilities such as critical infrastructures. In such environments, it is valuable to utilise the vast amount of data contained within the building <b>information</b> <b>models</b> to improve access control administration. The use of building <b>information</b> <b>models</b> in access control scenarios can provide 3 D visualisation of buildings {{as well as many}} other advantages such as automation of essential tasks including path finding, consistency detection, and accessibility verification. However, there is no mathematical <b>model</b> for building <b>information</b> <b>models</b> {{that can be used to}} describe and compute these functions. In this paper, we show how graph theory can be utilised as a representation language of building <b>information</b> <b>models</b> and the proposed security related functions.

We extend the IETF's draft "Policy Framework Core Information Model" and integrate it with our goal specification <b>information</b> <b>model.</b> Further, following the IETF's refinement of the core <b>information</b> <b>model</b> into a QoS <b>information</b> <b>model,</b> we show how the general goal <b>information</b> <b>model</b> is extended to specify specific types of goals, including service-level QoS goals. The relationship of goals and rules in policy specification is considered. A prototype implementation of a management server that uses the given <b>information</b> <b>model</b> to specify and enforce QoS goals on a per-user, perapplication basis is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Many {{authors have}} {{discussed}} the importance of ontological concerns {{in the development of}} information systems, emphasizing the benefits of ontology-based approaches to conceptual modeling tasks. A principled ontology-driven approach typically relies on the definition of a domain ontology and its use in subsequent phases of information system design and integration. Many of the challenges in the application of such an approach are related to addressing ontological concerns (defining the nature of phenomena of interest) and addressing <b>information</b> <b>modeling</b> concerns (defining the information demand about the phenomena of interest). In this paper we argue that ontological concerns should be clearly separated from <b>information</b> <b>modeling</b> concerns. We have observed that ontology-based approaches and <b>information</b> <b>modeling</b> approaches have been treated mostly in isolation, with the consequence that the relation between a domain ontology and an <b>information</b> <b>model</b> is still in need of clarification, despite the efforts of the formal ontology and <b>information</b> <b>modeling</b> communities. We strive to provide the initial steps for a principled two-level approach in which a domain ontology addressing ontological concerns is used {{as a starting point for}} the definition of an <b>information</b> <b>model,</b> according to a certain information demand. We identify some important decisions that should guide the construction of <b>information</b> <b>models.</b> Ontology-driven conceptual <b>modeling,</b> ontology-driven <b>information</b> systems design, <b>information</b> <b>modeling.</b> I...|$|R
