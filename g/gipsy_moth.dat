A de Havilland DH.60 <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> was {{exhibited}} at a car showroom in Tunbridge Wells, causing severe traffic congestion {{due to the}} number of people visiting the town to see it. Home Counties Aircraft Service Ltd was registered later that year. By October 1930, Mr Waters, the manager of Home Counties Aircraft Service Ltd had formed the Surrey Aero Club, based at Gatwick Racecourse Aerodrome.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, No.1 FTS {{started running}} two courses each year, the first commencing in January {{and the second}} in July; it also ceased graduating non-commissioned {{officers}} as pilots, and thus took on a character resembling the other armed services' cadet colleges, the Royal Australian Naval College and the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The roughly 1,200 applications for each flying course competed for around twelve places. Wing Commander Hippolyte DeLa Rue became commanding officer in early 1933. The following year, No.1 FTS commenced regular courses in signals, photography, air observation, and aircraft maintenance. In April 1936, the school took delivery of its first Avro Cadets, procured as an intermediate trainer {{to bridge the gap}} between the <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> employed for elementary flying instruction and the Wapiti used for advanced training. De La Rue was succeeded by Wing Commander Frank Lukis in January 1938. By this time the school was training up to 96 new pilots per year, a small percentage of whom were slated for secondment to the RAF on short-service commissions. Link Trainer simulators were introduced in March 1939.|$|E
5|$|In December 1935, No.1 AD's workshops, {{under the}} command of Squadron Leader Arthur Murphy, {{specially}} modified a Wapiti and a deHavilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> for Antarctic conditions, to enable an Air Force team led by Flight Lieutenant (later Group Captain) Eric Douglas and Flying Officer Alister Murdoch to rescue explorer Lincoln Ellsworth, who was presumed lost on a journey across the continent. On 3May 1937, Recruit Training Squadron acquired a new sub-unit, the Communications and Survey Flight, utilising Tugan Gannets and Dragon Rapides for ongoing photographic survey work; the squadron was re-formed as No.1 Recruit Depot on 2March 1940. Coupled with its aircraft assembly and test facilities, the recruit training unit made Laverton an obvious choice for the establishment of future RAAF squadrons. No.1 AD's commanding officers during this decade included Wing Commanders Frank McNamara (February 1933 to April 1936), Frank Lukis (April 1936 to January 1938), and Arthur Murphy (January 1938 to May 1940).|$|E

5|$|The first {{training}} courses at No.3 EFTS were not conducted by RAAF instructors {{under the auspices}} of EATS but by Essendon's civil organisations under government contract. The training aircraft were privately owned deHavilland Tiger Moths and Gipsy Moths. All air cadets were subject to RAAF discipline, and the school's training program was directed by Squadron Leader King. The initial intake of sixteen students arrived on 8January 1940, and received eight weeks of instruction that finished on 4March; {{all but one of the}} trainees had prior flying experience, and the course was accident-free. The next student intake at No.3 EFTS arrived on 5February 1940. The school's inaugural EATS course commenced in May. Overall student numbers at this time were reported as being 48, while staff totalled 50. The second EATS course began in July. By this time, Essendon's civilian presence had effectively been absorbed by the military organisation; privately owned aircraft were taken over by the RAAF, which had also begun employing its own aircraft, the first being a <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> that arrived in March. Training accidents were frequent, particularly during landings, but did not result in any fatalities.|$|E

Its first commanding officer was Squadron Leader D.E.L. Wilson. [...] Allan Walters commanded the squadron in 1937–38, during which time it received a number of Avro Ansons.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} {{began as}} an airmail delivery service, with a government contract to fly airmail between Cape Town and the major centres in South Africa. Mail was collected from the Union Castle steamships from Britain that docked at Cape Town harbour on Monday mornings and flown to Port Elizabeth by a single Gypsy Moth. At Port Elizabeth two more <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moths</b> were waiting to continue the service, one to fly mail to Bloemfontein and Johannesburg {{and the other to}} East London and Durban. On 29 August the first return service was operated, reaching Cape Town in time for the departing UK-bound steamship.|$|R

The aircraft flown included a number of Avro Tutors, de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moths</b> and a few other light aircraft. On 15 November 1937, No. 12 Army Cooperation Squadron was renumbered No. 112 Army Cooperation Squadron, flying a variety of aircraft types including the Avro 626 and de Havilland Tiger Moth.|$|R

He worked in a law office before joining the Royal New Zealand Air Force on 26 October 1939.|$|E
25|$|No. 21 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Laverton on 21 April 1936, as a Citizen Air Force (reserve) {{squadron}}. Under {{the command of}} Squadron Leader J.H. Summers, the squadron had a cadre of regular RAAF personnel who served alongside the part-time members of the CAF and initially operated a variety of aircraft including Hawker Demons, Westland Wapitis and de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moths.</b> With these aircraft, the squadron undertook several tasks. As a CAF squadron, training was its main role; its personnel were instructed in fighter tactics, bombing and army co-operation duties; they were also used for search-and-rescue tasks and public relations duties. The squadron also received Avro Ansons and Bristol Bulldogs in late 1936 and early 1937. In May 1937, Charles Eaton took over as squadron commander.|$|R
500|$|No.3 Flying Training School {{was renamed}} No.2 Elementary Flying Training School on 2January 1940. Its first fifteen deHavilland Tiger Moth {{training}} aircraft were delivered three days later. These were augmented by privately owned Tiger <b>Moths</b> and <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moths</b> pressed into military service. The first training course, lasting eight weeks, began on 10January; twenty-one students graduated. By {{the end of}} the month, the school's strength included 105 officers and men, one civilian instructor, and twenty-six students. The unit log book reported the lack of a telephone system, kitchen facilities, beds, desks, hot water, blackboards, typewriters, flags, maps, charts, and [...] "clothing other than stockings". A second civilian instructor, from the Queensland Aero Club, joined the school on 12February 1940. Later that month, No.2 EFTS was assigned to the control of the proposed Northern Area Command, which was eventually formed in May 1941. In the interim, all units in Queensland came under the control of Central Area Command, headquartered in Sydney.|$|R

25|$|On 2 November 1930, the King of Egypt and Sudan, Fuad I {{announced}} {{the creation of}} the Egyptian Army Air Force (EAAF). On 27 May 1931 the Egyptian Council of Ministers approved the purchase of five aircraft and the building of an airfield at Almaza with a budget of 50,000 pounds. The aircraft chosen was the British de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> trainer, the five modified aircraft were flown from England to Egypt and on arrival in May 1932 the air force was founded and the Almaza airfield was formally opened.|$|E
25|$|Widerøe was {{established}} as a merger between two small airlines established during the 1930s. Lotsberg & Skappel, owned by Helge Skappel, Leiv Brun, Ditlef Smith and Erik Engnæs, operated a <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth.</b> Widerøe & Bjørneby, which was founded by Viggo Widerøe and Halvor Bjørneby, operated a Simmonds Spartan. The two started a cooperation between themselves and Norsk Aero Klubb to establish air shows in Eastern Norway. During the winter the aircraft were stationed at mountain resorts and generated revenue by flying skiers into the wilderness. Advertisement flights were introduced, where a company or product name was painted on the hull, with a neon-light version underneath, and leaflets dropped from the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Finch Hatton used Blixen's {{farmhouse}} as a {{home base}} between 1926 and 1931. On safari with his clients, {{he died in the}} crash of his de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> biplane in March 1931. At the same time, the failure of the coffee plantation, as a result of mismanagement, the height of the farm, drought and the falling price of coffee caused by the worldwide economic depression, forced Blixen to abandon her beloved estate. The family corporation sold the land to a residential developer, and Blixen returned to Denmark in August 1931 to live with her mother. She remained in Rungstedlund {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
500|$|The first {{training}} courses at No.4 EFTS were not conducted {{under the auspices}} of EATS but by civil organisations under government contract. The instructors from these organisations were commissioned as officers in the RAAF. The flying school was divided into four flights: [...] "A" [...] (training conducted by the Royal Aero Club of New South Wales), [...] "B" [...] (conducted by Kingsford Smith Air Services Pty Ltd), [...] "C" [...] (conducted by Airflite Pty Ltd), and [...] "D" [...] (conducted at Newcastle by the Newcastle Aero Club). The training aircraft were deHavilland Tiger <b>Moths</b> and <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moths.</b> All air cadets were subject to RAAF discipline, and the school's training program was directed by the commanding officer. The initial intake of twenty-four students arrived on 8January 1940. Accommodation was severely limited at the new flying school: No.4 EFTS headquarters was housed in the clubhouse of the Royal Aero Club, the base sick quarters utilised the Department of Civil Aviation's casualty room, and cadets had to pay for their own rooms at the nearby Brighton-Le-Sands Hotel.|$|R
500|$|The inaugural flying course {{commenced}} in January 1923. Basic instruction {{took place}} on the Avro 504Ks, and more advanced or specialised training on the school's other aircraft. Fourteen students commenced the year-long course, and twelve graduated. As well as flying, they studied aeronautics, communications, navigation, armament and general military subjects. Squadron Leader Anderson resumed command of No.1 FTS in 1925; the following year he handed over to Wing Commander Adrian Cole, who led the unit until 1929. The first Citizen Air Force (active reserve) pilots' course ran from December 1925 to March 1926, 26 of 30 students completing the training. Although 24 accidents occurred, there were no fatalities, leading Cole to remark at the graduation ceremony that the students were either made of India rubber or had learned how to crash [...] "moderately safely". However, the 1926 Permanent Air Force (PAF) cadet course was marred by three fatal accidents. The following year, 29 students graduated—thirteen PAF, nine reserve, and seven destined for exchange with the Royal Air Force (RAF). In June 1928, the school's Avro 504Ks were replaced by deHavilland DH.60 Cirrus Moths; these were augmented by <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moths</b> commencing in 1930.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of formation, No.1 SFTS came {{under the control of}} Southern Area Command, {{headquartered}} in Melbourne. The school's complement of 52 aircraft included Wapitis, Cadets, Avro Ansons, Hawker Demons, and a deHavilland Tiger Moth. Group Captain John McCauley served as commanding officer from October 1940 until July 1941, when he handed over to Wing Commander Roy King, who went on to take charge of Station Headquarters Point Cook in October. As of July, No.1 SFTS was operating more than 100 aircraft, including <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moths,</b> deHavilland DH.89 Dragon Rapides, Douglas C-47 Dakotas, CAC Wirraways and Airspeed Oxfords, the last two being the mainstays. In August 1941, control of all training units in Victoria passed from Southern Area Command to the newly formed No.1 Training Group. By September, the school had an establishment of 100 officers and over 2,000 airmen, including 300 cadets. It was organised into Intermediate Training Squadron, Advanced Training Squadron, Maintenance Wing, Armament School, and Signal School. Wing Commander Charles Read held command of No.1 SFTS from October 1943 until its disbandment on 15September 1944, by which time almost 3,000 pilots had graduated. Among these were Nicky Barr, who became one of Australia's leading fighter aces in North Africa, and Bill Newton, awarded the Victoria Cross for bombing raids in New Guinea. The RAAF had ordered the school's closure in August 1944 as part of a general reduction in aircrew training, after being informed by the British Air Ministry that it no longer required EATS graduates for the war in Europe. Significant reserves of trained Commonwealth aircrew had been built up in the UK early in 1944 prior to the invasion of Normandy, but lower-than-anticipated casualties had resulted in an over-supply that by 30June numbered 3,000 Australians.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was designed in 1929 by an amateur designer Władysław Kozłowski. It was a wooden biplane, similar to de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth.</b> The PZL State Aviation Works in Warsaw {{took over the}} design, searching for an aircraft {{to participate in a}} contest for a trainer aircraft, announced by the LOPP paramilitary organization (Air- and Anti-Gas Defense League). Kozłowski worked out a documentation, with a help of PZL bureau and fitted the example with a more powerful 100hp Gipsy I engine, instead of a planned 85hp version. The first prototype of PZL-5 was built and flown in May 1930, followed by two pre-series aircraft in June 1930, built on the factory's initiative specially for the International Touring Competition 1930 (Challenge) (registration SP-ACW and SP-ACX).|$|E
25|$|At the 1927 International Radio-Telegraph Conference the United Kingdom was {{allocated}} radio callsign prefixes B, G, M, VP, VQ and VR. Within {{this new}} allocation the United Kingdom {{continued to use}} the prefix G- for all aircraft but the sequence was restarted at G-AAAA, which continued into the 21st century. The first registration in the sequence, G-AAAA, was allocated to a de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth,</b> registered on 30 July 1928 to Geoffrey de Havilland. At first nearly all registrations were issued in sequential alphabetical order but since the 1970s personalised ("out of sequence") registrations are available using any four-letter combination. Except in very rare circumstances, no registration is ever re-issued to a different aircraft. Countries in the British Empire that had used the G- prefix were allocated new two-letter allocations.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} a conversion course, Headlam {{was assigned to}} the Seaplane Squadron at Point Cook. No larger than a flight according to the official history of the pre-war RAAF, Seaplane Squadron was part of No.1 FTS and operated Supermarine Southampton flying boats and de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> floatplanes, among other types. During this posting Headlam was promoted to flying officer, on 1July 1935, and wrote a paper on national defence in which he suggested that with [...] "strong air forces, naval forces (including submarines), and fixed defences, Australia may be made practically invulnerable". According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, this paper [...] "in effect, defined the 'anti-lodgment' concept which has been a persistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking".|$|E

50|$|It was {{incorporated}} on 29 May 1928, and commenced instructions on 13 January 1929 when they received {{their first two}} De Havilland Moth aircraft, presented {{to them by the}} Government of India. A third aircraft, A D.H. <b>Moth</b> (<b>Gipsy)</b> was won by the Club as prize offered by Sir Charles Wakefield to the first Indian flying club which should turn out 12 qualified pilots, of whom at least six were to be Indians. The Club used these aircraft for tuition, joy-rides, and air travel.The activities of the club were, unfortunately, limited {{by the fact that the}} aerodrome at Juhu was not suitable during the monsoon. This problem was solved by 1937. The Club received its licence to build a hangar and garages at the aerodrome on 17 August 1931.|$|R
500|$|The {{first plane}} {{to appear on}} the island was in 1931 when Francis Chichester alighted on the lagoon in a de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> {{converted}} into a floatplane. It was damaged there in an overnight storm but repaired with the assistance of islanders and then took off successfully nine weeks later for a flight to Sydney. After World War II, in 1947, tourists arrived on Catalina and then four-engined Sandringham flying boats of Ansett Flying Boat Services operating out of Rose Bay, Sydney, and landing on the lagoon, the journey taking about [...] hours. When Lord Howe Island Airport was completed in 1974, the seaplanes were eventually replaced with Qantaslink twin-engined turbo-prop Dash 8-200 aircraft.|$|E
500|$|No.2 Flying Training School's first {{thirteen}} de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> {{training aircraft}} were delivered to Parafield on 16–17 December 1939. The unit was renamed No.1 Elementary Flying Training School (No.1 EFTS) on 2January 1940. The first eight-week flying training course began on 8January with twenty-three students; another joined a week later. According {{to the unit}} operations book, limited flying was possible owing {{to the number of}} available parachutes but, on 19January, [...] "permission was granted to continue training without them until supplies were forthcoming". The second flying course began on 5February. An instructor and his cadet were killed in a crash on 19March. No.1 EFTS's complement of aircraft was augmented on 20April with the arrival of six de Havilland Tiger Moths.|$|E
500|$|Fired {{partly by}} his mother's stories of joy flights in pre-war Britain, {{and a desire}} to become a flying boat captain for Imperial Airways, Cresswell applied to join the Royal Air Force (RAF) in September 1937. Receiving no answer from the RAF, he applied for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and was accepted. He entered No.1 Flying Training School at Point Cook, Victoria, as an air cadet in July 1938. Over the next twelve months he learnt to fly in Avro Cadet, deHavilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> and Westland Wapiti trainers, and {{graduated}} as a pilot officer. His first posting was to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron at Richmond, New South Wales, where he began flying Hawker Demon fighters in July 1939. Cresswell recalled a mix of excitement and panic within the squadron when World WarII broke out two months later: [...] "The second night we all slept on the hangar floor next to our aircraft. Imagine it: there was war over in Europe and here we were at action stations!" ...|$|E
500|$|Raised to {{squadron}} leader, Murphy {{was given}} temporary command of No.1 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, {{in the opening}} months of 1933. He subsequently {{took charge of the}} unit's workshops. Towards the end of 1935, he was responsible for specially modifying a Westland Wapiti and a de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> for Antarctic conditions, to enable an Air Force team led by Flight Lieutenant (later Group Captain) Eric Douglas and Flying Officer (later Air Marshal Sir) Alister Murdoch to rescue explorer Lincoln Ellsworth, who was presumed lost on a journey across the continent. In 1936, Murphy was selected to join Wackett on a mission to investigate aircraft production overseas with a view to setting up local construction plants. The team determined that the North American NA-16 was most suitable for Australian conditions and manufacture; following testing of a prototype, designated the NA-33, the design went into production in January 1939 as the CAC Wirraway. [...] Murphy was promoted to wing commander in November 1936 and appointed commanding officer of No.1 Aircraft Depot in January 1938.|$|E
500|$|Murdoch {{enlisted in}} the Air Force on 10December 1930, and {{completed}} his pilot training the following year. He was commissioned in 1932 and later qualified as a flying instructor and seaplane pilot, undertaking navy cooperation and maritime patrol operations. In December 1935, Flying Officer Murdoch was selected to join an RAAF rescue mission for explorer Lincoln Ellsworth and his pilot, Herbert Hollick-Kenyon, who were presumed lost while journeying across the Antarctic. Flying a de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth,</b> Murdoch located Hollick-Kenyon near the Bay of Whales. Hollick-Kenyon led the search party to Ellsworth, who protested {{that he was not}} lost and did not need rescuing. Murdoch was posted to England in 1936–37 to undertake a course in long navigation at RAF Manston and serve on attachment with No.114 Squadron. [...] Returning to Australia, he married Florence Miller on 27December 1937; the couple had a daughter. [...] Murdoch spent the next two years {{on the staff of the}} Directorate of Operations and Intelligence at Air Force Headquarters, Melbourne. In June 1938, he helped inaugurate RAAF instruction in long navigation, with a nine-month course in the discipline.|$|E
500|$|In October 1929, Seaplane Squadron {{received}} a locally designed amphibian, the Wackett WidgeonII; it {{crashed into the}} sea off Point Cook on 6January 1930, killing all three occupants. Another Wackett design, the WarrigalII landplane, was fitted with floats and assigned to Seaplane Squadron in September 1932 for trials and possible use as a trainer and patrol aircraft; it was considered successful in the latter role but maintenance issues led to its disposal in July 1933. The squadron also operated deHavilland Moths. In May 1934, one of these was flown to Darwin, Northern Territory, where it was fitted with floats and undertook reconnaissance and survey work in cooperation with HMAS Morseby, before being converted back to a landplane and returning to Point Cook in July. In December 1935, a <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> fitted with skis embarked for Antarctica aboard the RRS DiscoveryII to locate missing explorer Lincoln Ellsworth. Seaplane Squadron began operating Avro Ansons for navigation courses and cross-country exercises in 1937; one [...] exercise in November 1938 involved a round-Australia flight. A new headquarters building for the squadron was constructed at Point Cook in the late 1930s, as part of general improvements to RAAF facilities owing {{to the threat of}} war in Europe.|$|E
500|$|For its 1937 {{aerial survey}} program, the RAAF formed the Communications and Survey Flight under No.1 Aircraft Depot's Recruit Training Squadron at Laverton on 3May. [...] The flight {{was divided into}} Western and Eastern Air Detachments, the former under Hely. Flying a Tugan Gannet, Hely's first task became searching for survey {{director}} Sir Herbert Gepp, whose Rapide (A3-2, the same one Hely crash landed the previous year) had gone missing on an inspection flight in the Northern Territory between Tennant Creek and Tanimi. Hely located the downed Rapide on 23May, guiding in a ground party that was able to clear a makeshift runway and allow Gepp and his team to take off and resume their journey. On 25September, Hely was again diverted from survey work {{to search for a}} lost plane, this time the de Havilland <b>Gipsy</b> <b>Moth</b> of flying doctor Clyde Fenton, who had gone missing north-east of Newcastle Waters. Hely, once more piloting Rapide A3-2, found the Moth three days later and landed to rescue the lost doctor. Fenton was subsequently quoted as saying [...] "I have only the highest praise for the efficient manner in which Hely conducted a difficult search and the skilful way in which he located me and picked me up". [...] The rescue efforts made Hely one of the RAAF's best-known public figures. Completing his posting to the survey flight, he served as adjutant at Laverton in 1938. He was awarded the Air Force Cross on 9June for [...] "zeal and initiative in searching for Sir Herbert Gepp's party and later for Dr. Fenton when lost in Central Australia". On 29November 1938, he married secretary Jean McDonald at St Aidan's Anglican Church in Launceston, Tasmania; the couple would have two daughters. [...] Hely spent the following year in Britain, attending the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and was promoted to squadron leader in September.|$|E
