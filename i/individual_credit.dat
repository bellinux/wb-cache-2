25|$|The {{cooperative}} model inverted this method, instead {{scaling up}} one of its founding principles: individual cooperation between members. <b>Individual</b> <b>credit</b> unions delegated specific powers for specific purposes to a federal body, with residual powers remaining in local hands.

25|$|Although all {{the four}} credit {{information}} companies have developed their <b>individual</b> <b>credit</b> scores, {{the most popular}} is CIBIL credit score. The CIBIL credit score is a three-digit number that represents a summary of individuals' credit history and credit rating. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with no credit history will have a score of -1. If the credit history is less than six months, the score will be 0. CIBIL credit score takes time to build up and usually it takes between 18 and 36 months or more of credit usage to obtain a satisfactory credit score.|$|E
25|$|Several factors affect <b>{{individual}}'s</b> <b>credit</b> scores. One {{factor is}} the amount an individual borrowed {{as compared to the}} amount of credit available to the individual.

60|$|It may {{be asked}} here by some simple-minded reader why we should not resort to crude Communism as the disciples were told to do. This would be quite {{practicable}} in a village where production {{was limited to the}} supply of the primitive wants which nature imposes on all human beings alike. We know that people need bread and boots without waiting for them to come and ask for these things and offer to pay for them. But when civilization advances to the point at which articles are produced that no man absolutely needs and that only some men fancy or can use, it is necessary that individuals should be able to have things made to their order and at their own cost. It is safe to provide bread for everybody because everybody wants and eats bread; but it would be absurd to provide microscopes and trombones, pet snakes and polo mallets, alembics and test tubes for everybody, as nine-tenths of them would be wasted; and the nine-tenths of the population who do not use such things would object to their being provided at all. We have in the invaluable instrument called money a means of enabling every individual to order and pay for the particular things he desires over and above the things he must consume in order to remain alive, plus the things the State insists on his having and using whether he wants to or not; for example, clothes, sanitary arrangements, armies and navies. In large communities, where even the most eccentric demands for manufactured articles average themselves out until they can be foreseen within a negligible margin of error, direct communism (Take what you want without payment, as the people do in Morris's News From Nowhere) will, after a little experience, be found not only practicable but highly economical to an extent that now seems impossible. The sportsmen, the musicians, the physicists, the biologists will get their apparatus for the asking as easily as their bread, or, as at present, their paving, street lighting, and bridges; and the deaf man will not object to contribute to communal flutes when the musician has to contribute to communal ear trumpets. There are cases (for example, radium) in which the demand may be limited to the merest handful of laboratory workers, and in which nevertheless the whole community must pay because the price is beyond the means of any individual worker. But even when the utmost allowance is made for extensions of communism that now seem fabulous, there will still remain {{for a long time to}} come regions of supply and demand in which men will need and use money or <b>individual</b> <b>credit,</b> and for which, therefore, they must have individual incomes. Foreign travel is an obvious instance. We are so far from even national communism still, that we shall probably have considerable developments of local communism before it becomes possible for a Manchester man to go up to London for a day without taking any money with him. The modern practical form of the communism of Jesus is therefore, for the present, equal distribution of the surplus of the national income that is not absorbed by simple communism.|$|E

50|$|A chapter 7 {{bankruptcy}} {{stays on}} an <b>individual's</b> <b>credit</b> report for 10 {{years from the}} date of filing the chapter 7 petition. This contrasts with a chapter 13 bankruptcy, which stays on an <b>individual's</b> <b>credit</b> report for 7 years from the date of filing the chapter 13 petition. This may make credit less available or may make lending terms less favorable, although high debt can have the same effect. That must be balanced against the removal of actual debt from the filer's record by the bankruptcy, which tends to improve creditworthiness. Consumer credit and creditworthiness is a complex subject, however. Future ability to obtain credit is dependent on multiple factors and difficult to predict.|$|R
