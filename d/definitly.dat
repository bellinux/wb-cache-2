These were the dictionaries by Nebrija, Cristóbal de las Casas, Heinrich Hornkens and Jean Palet. However, Oudin enriched these sources to such a point that his Tesoro… became an innovative piece of work which, in its turn, would later become a model for a great many lexicographers such as Lorenzo Franciosini, César-Joachim Trognesius, Arnaldo De la Porte, Nicolas Mez de Braidenbach and Francisco Sobrino.

40|$|In this paper, I {{intend to}} explore the theory of prosaics, which offers a quite {{different}} approach to life and historical events in particular. This theory was introduced;by the American scholar Gary Saul Morson. Morson coined the term prosaics in order to describe a concept that permeates the work of Mikhail Bakhtin (1895 - 1975), a Russian literary critic and philosopher. The most important concepts developed by Bakhtin are prosaics (Morson 2 ̆ 7 s and Emerson 2 ̆ 7 s term), unfinalizability, and dialogue. Bakhtin created also various theories: a comprehensive theory of literature that privileges prose and the novel, theories of languages, and of literary genres. Bakhtin was first rediscovered in the Soviet Union and the West in the 1960 s and 1970 s.

40|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19 th century Portuguese {{economic}} backwardness was apparent to the most attentive intellectuals who tried to analyse its causes. António Oliveira Marreca (1805 - 1889), an economist and politician, was one of them. At first he supported free trade, but as time went by he became closer to the nationalist, protectionist doctrines. His arguments reveal an impressive similarity to the economic views of Friedrich List (1789 - 1846), though Marreca had never showed to be aware of List's writings. However Marreca’s analysis of the effects of Portuguese economic dependence from England- an important cause of Portuguese backwardness in his opinion- and the very concepts he applies- namely the concept of nation-are extremely close to the ideas developed by the German economist. As far as economic policy is concerned, Marreca’s prescriptions were also <b>definitly</b> similar to the policies advocated by List. Both emphasized the need of a temporary industrial protectionism, no protection for the agricultural sector {{and the development of a}} transport network to support the implementation of a national economy...|$|E

In these cases, had been equipped for elecktlically induced ventricular fibrillation, the blood loss {{might have been}} mininal and facilitated exposure to permit rapid suturing of the defect, so I would like to emphasize to the usefulness of induced vontricular fibrillation in the control of massive hemorrhage from the heart. So I had been carried on laboratory studies to induced ventricular fibrillation in normothermic dogs and obtained the following results. 1) Continuing the ventricular fibrillation for over 5 minutes duration, there were no surviveddogs, but all survived to the cirrulatory arrest within 4 minutes, three of the 4 dogs died but only I dog stayed alive between 4 to 5 minutes. It has been showed that in dog the safe length of circulatory arrest inducing ventricular fibrillation under normothermic conditions is 4 minutes. 2) Incising left atrium, the mean blood loss was 120 ml per minute, equal to 15 ml prokilogramm per minute. Inducing ventricular fibrillation soon after atriotomy, the mean blood loss was 80 ml, equal to 12 ml prolkilogramm per minut.

The aim of the project is to develop multivariate {{measurement}} anda,analysis methods of the skeletal muscle physiology. One of the methods used to scanthe muscle is functional ultrasound. In a study performed by the project group datawas aquired, where test subjects were instructed to follow a certain exercise scheme,which was measured. Since there currently is no superior method to analyze the result-ing data (in form of ultrasound video sequences) several methods are being looked at. One considered method is called Independent Vector Analysis (IVA). IVA is a statisticalmethod to ﬁnd independent components in a mix of components. This Master’s Thesisis about segmenting and analyzing the ultrasound images with help of IVA, to validateif it is a suitable method for this kind of tasks. First the algorithm was tested on generated mixed data to ﬁnd out how well itperformed. The results were very accurate, considering that the method only usesapproximations. Some expected variation from the true value occured though. When the algorithm was considered performing to satisfactory, it was tested on thedata gathered by the study and the result can very well reﬂect an approximation of truesolution, since the resulting segmented signals seem to move in a possible way. But themethod has weak sides (which have been tried to be minimized) and all error analysishas been done by human eye, which <b>deﬁnitly</b> is a week point. But for the time being itis more important to analyze trends in the signals, rather than analyze exact numbers. So as long as the signals behave in a realistic way the result can not be said to becompletley wrong. So the overall results of the method were deemed adequate for the application at hand.

40|$|O presente estudo teve como objetivo, estudar a influência dos aspectos cronobiológicos individuais na tolerância dos profissionais de enfermagem ao serviço noturno {{hospital}}ar. Classificou os profissionais de enfermagem do serviço noturno de acordo com o perfil cronobiológico, quantificou a sonolência desses profissionais, relacionou o grau de sonolência dos mesmos com seus respectivos cronotipos e discutiu teoricamente a aplicação da cronobiologia na organização do trabalho de enfermagem. Caracterizou-se como pesquisa de natureza aplicada; quantitativa quanto à forma de abordagem do problema; descritiva, do ponto de vista de seus objetivos e de levantamento, quanto aos procedimentos técnicos. A instituição campo da pesquisa foi um hospital universitário situado no estado do Rio de Janeiro. Através da técnica de amostragem não probabilística intencional, 33 profissionais de enfermagem, foram selecionados como sujeitos da pesquisa. Os instrumentos utilizados foram o Questionário Matutinidade/Vespertinidade de Horne e Ostberg e a Escala de Sonolência de Epworth. A coleta de dados durou dez dias do mês de agosto de 2008, cobrindo os três plantões da escala 12 X 60 h. Os dados foram analisados através de estatística descritiva e os resultados apresentados sob a forma de gráficos. Diante dos resultados apresentados, verifica-se que houve o predomínio de técnicos de enfermagem na amostra estudada; a maior parte foi do sexo feminino, com idade média de 46 anos. O cronotipo predominante foi o indiferente e não se encontraram os extremos definitivamente matutinos e definitivamente vespertinos. Quanto ao grau de sonolência, a maioria dos sujeitos apresentou resultados diferentes da normalidade nos mais diferentes níveis. Quando o grau de sonolência foi aplicado a cada cronotipo separadamente, observou-se que os sujeitos de cronotipo moderadamente vespertino apresentaram uma boa tolerância ao trabalho noturno. Os sujeitos de cronotipo indiferente demonstraram uma tolerância regular, enquanto que os sujeitos de cronotipo moderadamente matutino mostraram uma maior dificuldade de tolerância a este turno. Em relação ao grau de sonolência aplicado a cada faixa etária, houve uma piora progressiva dos graus de sonolência com o aumento da idade; a faixa acima de 40 anos apresenta a maior porcentagem de indivíduos com grau de sonolência moderado a grave. Os estudos teóricos mostraram a importância da aplicação da cronobiologia na organização do trabalho de enfermagem. Concluiu que os plantonistas noturnos de enfermagem tendem a sofrer as conseqüências da privação do sono, com uma piora progressiva dos graus de sonolência, e que os aspectos cronobiológicos individuais podem exercer importante influência na tolerância dos profissionais de enfermagem ao serviço noturno hospitalar. The {{present study}} has as objective {{to study the}} influence of the individual chronobiological aspects in the tolerance of the nursing professionals to the hospital night shift. Classified the professionals of nursing of the hospital night shift in accordance with their chronobiological profile, quantified the sleepiness of these professionals, related the degree of sleepiness of the professionals of nursing of the night shift with its respective chronotips and argued, in theory, the application of the chronobiology in the organization of the nursing work. This research was characterized as applied nature; quantitative to the form of boarding of the problem; descriptive, of {{the point of view of}} its objectives and survey, according to technician procedures. The institution of the research was an university hospital located in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Through the intentional sampling, 33 professionals of nursing is selected as citizens of the research. The instruments used were the Eveningness / Morningness Questionnaire and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The collection of data lasted ten days of the month of August of 2008, covering the three shifts in a 12 X 60 h scale. The data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and the results presented under the form of graphs. Ahead of the presented results, most was verified that it had the predominance of nursing technician in the studied sample; of female sex, with average age of 46 years. Predominant chronotip was the indifferent one and it does not meet the <b>definitly</b> morningness and <b>definitly</b> eveningness one extrems. About the sleepiness degree, the majority of the citizens presents resulted different of normality in the most different levels. When the sleepiness degree was applied to each chronotip separately, was observed that the citizens of moderately eveningness chronotip presented a good tolerance to the night shift work; the citizens of indifferent chronotip demonstrated a moderate tolerance, whereas the citizens moderately morningness chronotip shown a bigger difficulty of tolerance to this turn. In relation to the degree of sleepiness applied to each band age, it had a gradual worsening of the degrees of sleepiness with the increase of the age, the band above of 40 years presented the biggest percentage of individuals with moderate to serious degree of sleepiness. The theoretical studies had shown the importance of the application of the chronobiology in the organization of the nursing work. It concluded that the nursing hospital night shift workers can suffer the consequences of the privation of sleep with the increase of sleepiness, also that the individual cronobiological aspects, can exert important influence in the professionals of nursing`s tolerance to the night shift...|$|E
40|$|Background: Freemartinism {{occurs in}} some speices of {{ruminants}} and affects most female bovine fetuses in hterrosexual, multiple pregnancies owing of susion of the chorionic blood circulations soon after implantation. Maldevelopment of the ovaries and Müllerian ducts {{have been described}} and recognized as resulting from exposure of their respective primoridia to an excess of anti-Müllerian hormone. The Present study aimed to analyse the prenatal growth {{the development of the}} gubernaculum in freemartins to find out its pssible affliction through foetal testis hormones derived from their male co-twin. Methods: Histolgical sections of young and frawings and photographs of further developed freemartins and conrol male and female bovine foeuses were analysed. The specimens had been collected ealier for analsis of the time course of male and female gonadal and gential development and its impairment associated with freemartinism. Results: The gubernaculum of 35 – 40 day-old male and female fetuses was in the intial stage of development and of similar appearance in all specimens. Gubenacula of 60 – 70 -day-old male fetuss differed from those of females of similar age in various respects: the male gubernaculum size was larger and extension of the processus vaginalis was deeper. Freemartins showd and intermediate development with some individuals resembling male and othes resembling female agemates. During furher development, gubernacula in males developed into muscular cremaster sacs, whereas those in females generally did not develop beyond the size and structural complexity of 70 -day-old foetuses. Beyond day 70 of fetal life, gubernaculum development in freemartins <b>definitly</b> showed male characteristics with respect to size and growth of a processus vaginalis with a cremaster muscular wall. The male-like pattern of the outgrowth of the processus vainalis changed {{during the second half of}} prenatal life. Rather than its further deepening as in mals, this structure became inveted to become emerging as a papilla-like structure from the inguinal abdomen bottom. An explanation is proposed for this unprecedented inversion, taking into account: (1) the faster and higher reaching rightsided ascent of the kidneys and gonads, (2) the femalelike outgrowth of the cranial gonadal suspensory ligaments, and (3) the absence of scrotum development. The ovaries and mesonephric remnants in developing freemartins, during their ascent together with the kidneys while remaining attached to the bottom of the developing processus vaginalis sacs via the gubernaculum ligament, are proposed to act together to pull up the bottom of the processus vaginalis sacs. From this action, “inverted hernia sacs” result as the irreversible consequence. Conclusion: The data support the concept that foetal testes act, via as an yet unidentified third hormone, to establish malelike development of gubernacula into muscular cremaster sacs. Further work is required to reveal the identity of this hormone. Furthermore, the apparent similarity of the freemartins' inverted processus vaginalis sacs and the fetal rodents' gubernacular cones suggests that the ruminants' and rodents' processus vaginalis are essentially similar structures. Thus there is no longer an urgent need to distinguish between two different types of gubernaculum development and testis descent in rodents and ruminants, respectively, and involving or not fetal gubernacular cones. The present observations may thus contribute to the development of a unified hypothesis for sexually dimorphic development of the gubernaculum throughout the mammalian class. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to find out whether nitrosative stress (via peroxynitrite(ONOO-)) plays a role or even causes various {{neurological}} diseases in children. In literature there have been several examples of neurological diseases which seem to caused or at least influenced by nitrosative stress, such as Alzheimers disease, ALS, inflammations, multiple sclerosis etc. Therefore cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) of 40 children and 3 adults (= 43 patients) with various neurological diseases and CSF of 18 children out of a controll group was tested. The 43 patients suffered from diseases which in one way or the other could have been influenced by increased production of peroxynitrite. To show the excess of peroxynitrite production, 3 -nitrotyrosine (3 -NT) was measured, since peroxynitrite itself is a very instable product. 3 -NT can be seen as an indicator of nitrosative stress (and peroxynitrite), since it is a stable product out of the reaction of tyrosine und peroxynitrite. High performance liquid chromotography (HPLC) combined with electrochemical detection was used to determine the amount of 3 -NT. It seemed to be the method of choice because using this method even very small amounts of 3 -NT could be detected. Furthermore this method isnt that expensive compared to other methods such as mass-spectroscopy, which is an important factor in routine 3 -NT-investigation. At first, several experiments were made to show that our used machine worked exact and linear, and to show the influences of various parameters such as pH of mobile phase. This was followed by the investigation of CSF of patients and controll-group. But only eight out of the 43 patients had increased levels of 3 -NT. In addition one child out of the cotroll group showed increased rates. The average concentration of 3 -NT in the " 3 -NT-positive" probes was 4. 73 nM. In the other probes no 3 -NT could be determined, that means the concentration was 0 nM. Now theres the question why only in eight out of the 43 patients an increased level of 3 -NT could be detected. Three out of these eight patients were adults suffering from multiple sclerosis. All of the detected increased rates werent as high they were expected to be, compared to literature. One reason could be that never before children had been tested for 3 -NT, so there is no direct comparison in literature. Mayby no 3 -NT is produced in childrens brains at all, so no 3 -NT could be shown in the controll group. Compared to this, the average rate of 4. 73 nM 3 -NT in "positive" probes could be an excessive increased level. Furthermore only free, not protein-bound 3 -NT was measured. All of the in literature described 3 -NT-increases were found in CSF probes, which proteins had been hydolysated before. Therefore, protein-bound- 3 -NT was as well detected. Protein-bound 3 -NT wasnt detected in this study, so of course the detected rates were lower. Another thing is that one cant tell for sure that the detected substance really is 3 -NT or another substance which has the same retention time and coelutes with 3 -NT. To make sure that it is indeed 3 -NT,one could gather the eluted substance and investigates it mass spectroscopidly. Finally one can say that there are many open questions,which need further studys. The CSF probes of the examined children should once more be tested for 3 -NT hydrolysatinproteins. The found substanz should furthermore be <b>definitly</b> be identified as 3 - NT. Only then the results can really be compared to results in literature. Therefore this study shall only be looked upon as a beginning of investigation in nitrosative stress causing neurological diseases in children, which has to followed by many other studys. It should be rather be looked upon as establishing a new method showing investigation starts...|$|E
