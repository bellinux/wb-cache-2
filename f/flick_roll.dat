50|$|Due to this, the Slick 360 was envisaged as a newer {{version of}} the Extra 230, using the same basic concept and design, but with as many {{upgrades}} and improvements as possible. To this end, the size, basic wing shape and control system of the Extra 230 were {{used as the basis}} for the new aircraft, but the <b>flick</b> <b>roll</b> characteristics were designed to be closer to that of the Laser, from which the Extra 230 was originally derived.|$|E
50|$|The Slick 360 was {{designed}} {{to fill a gap}} in the light aerobatic aircraft segment, as the aircraft which dominate this segment, the Yak-55, Zlin Z-50 and Extra 230 have all ceased production, making them increasingly hard to obtain. While other Extras are still in production (260, 300, 300S, 300L and 330), they are fitted with six-cylinder (260/300 hp) engines and therefore not allowed to compete in the AWAC. New aircraft have been created in an attempt to replace these three, such as the One Design and the Cap 222, but they have failed to dominate, purportedly due to their excessively-high aileron roll rates, which, being faster than their <b>flick</b> <b>roll</b> rates, results in the <b>flick</b> <b>roll</b> scores being downgraded. In addition, their small size has made them difficult to judge. The result being that neither of the two new designs has yet managed to achieve better results than the older established designs, with the past five AWAC events being won by the Extra 230, Zlin Z-50 and Yak-55. This was borne out by the winner of 2003 AWAC, who was a French pilot who chose to fly an Extra 230 {{despite the fact that he}} had access to the French team's Cap 222.|$|E
25|$|Because of its smaller, lighter airframe, the Bf 109 was 30km/h (20mph) {{faster than}} the He 112 in level flight, and {{superior}} in climbing and diving. The Commission ultimately ruled in favour of the Bf 109 because of the Messerschmitt test pilot's demonstration of the 109's capabilities during a series of spins, dives, <b>flick</b> <b>rolls</b> and tight turns, throughout which the pilot was in complete control of the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|In Aresti notation, solid lines {{represent}} upright or positive-g manoeuvers {{and dashed}} lines represent inverted or negative-g manoeuvers; these are sometimes depicted in red. Thick dot represents {{the beginning of}} the manoeuver, while a short perpendicular line represents the end. Stalled wing manoeuvers such as spins and snap (<b>flick)</b> <b>rolls</b> are represented by triangles. Arrows represent rolling manoeuvers with numbers representing the extent and number of segments of the roll.|$|R
5000|$|The Spitfires {{stood in}} two lines outside 'A' Flight pilots' room. The dull grey-brown of the {{camouflage}} could not conceal the clear-cut beauty, the wicked simplicity of their lines. I hooked up my parachute and climbed awkwardly into the low cockpit. I noticed how small was my field of vision. Kilmartin swung himself on to a wing {{and started to}} run through the instruments. I was conscious of his voice, but heard nothing of what he said. I was to fly a Spitfire. It was what I had most wanted through all the long dreary months of training. If I could fly a Spitfire, {{it would be worth}} it. Well, I was about to achieve my ambition and felt nothing. I was numb, neither exhilarated nor scared. I noticed the white enamel undercarriage handle. [...] "Like a lavatory plug," [...] I thought.Kilmartin had said, [...] "See if you can make her talk." [...] That meant the whole bag of tricks, and I wanted ample room for mistakes and possible blacking-out. With one or two very sharp movements on the stick I blacked myself out for a few seconds, but the machine was sweeter to handle than any other that I had flown. I put it through every manoeuvre that I knew of and it responded beautifully. I ended with two <b>flick</b> <b>rolls</b> and turned back for home. I was filled with a sudden exhilarating confidence. I could fly a Spitfire; in any position I was its master. It remained to be seen whether I could fight in one.|$|R
