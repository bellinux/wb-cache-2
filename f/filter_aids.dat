40|$|For decades, {{kieselguhr}} {{has been}} the most common <b>filter</b> <b>aid</b> for beer filtration. However, costs for disposal are severely increasing and brewers today are concerned about replacing kieselguhr filtration by a greener technology. Filtration trials were carried out with the regenerable <b>filter</b> <b>aid</b> oxidized high-density polyethylene (OxPE) on a pilot-scale candle filter using green lager beer from settling tanks. OxPE has an average particle size distribution of 37 μm and its outer surface presents nodular structures. The porosity of the OxPE media is 0. 6 compared with 0. 85 for kieselguhr. OxPE retains a good amount of haze and yeast cells without clogging; however, the expected clarity was reached only when using Brewtan. The use of polyvinyl-polypyrrolidone (PVPP) mixed with the OxPE <b>filter</b> <b>aid</b> (25 / 75 %) showed the best results for filtration because of the shape of PVPP particles and their slight compressibility. Regeneration {{is one of the most}} important steps to achieve because the <b>filter</b> <b>aid</b> has to be reused as many times as possible while keeping its properties of retention toward haze and yeast cells.

50|$|Pre-treatment of the {{slurries}} before filtration {{is required}} if the solid suspension has settled down.

Varying the temperature, concentration and pH can control {{the size of the}} flocs. Moreover, if the filter cake is impermeable and difficult for the flow of filtrate, filter aid chemical can be added to the pre-treatment process to increase the porosity of the cake, reduce the cake resistance and obtain thicker cake.

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{performance}} of formulated PrekotAC <b>filter</b> <b>aids</b> on pressure drop across two different types of filter media, i. e polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyimide (P 84) was carried out in a laboratory scale fabric filtration system. <b>Filter</b> <b>aids</b> is applied in order to prolong the lifespan of the fabric filter by reducing the pressure drop across a filter cake. PrekotAC which is a combination of 90 %wt activated carbon and 10 %wt PreKotTM was tested under various material loadings of 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 6 mg/mm 2 at a constant filtration velocity of 5 m/min across its cake and filter media. The results showed that PrekotAC presents a lower pressure drop across the P 84 compared to PTFE filter media under various material loadings. This is because of its different characteristics that effect the porosity of the filter media and allow a higher volumetric airflow passing through, resulting in lower pressure drop compared to PTFE filter media. In addition, the diversity in terms of particle size distribution of the formulated PrekotAC that increase its permeability property helps to reduce the pressure drop across the media and its filter cake. Thus, PrekotAC has a promising characteristic as a two in one <b>filter</b> <b>aids,</b> a pre-coating and adsorbent material for fabric filtration system...|$|E

The present study describes the use of a charge-modified (Zeta Plus) <b>filter</b> <b>aid</b> (AMF Cuno, Meriden, Conn.) for the concentration of coliphages from large volumes of water and sewage. Coliphages MS- 2 and f 2 were efficiently adsorbed from water and sewage to the positively charged <b>filter</b> <b>aid.</b> Elution was accomplished with 4 % beef extract [...] 0. 5 M NaCl adjusted to pH 9. 5. The recovery of f 2 from 10 - to 20 -liter volumes of tap water ranged between 11 and 70 %, and the recovery of MS- 2 ranged between 43 and 70 %. The efficiency of recovery of naturally occurring coliphages from secondarily treated sewage ranged between 16 and 44 %. This technique appears to be promising because it requires low-cost equipment (47 -mm polypropylene filter housing), is easy to handle, and can filter large volumes of water (greater than or equal to 20 liters) with good recoveries. Filtrations can be conducted at the ambient pH of the water, and the unit cost per filtration (i. e., the cost of <b>filter</b> <b>aid)</b> comes to less than three cents per sampling.

50|$|To {{extract the}} alginate, the seaweed is broken into pieces and stirred {{with a hot}} {{solution}} of an alkali, usually sodium carbonate. Over {{a period of about}} two hours, the alginate dissolves as sodium alginate to give a very thick slurry. This slurry also contains the part of the seaweed that does not dissolve, mainly cellulose. This insoluble residue must be removed from the solution. The solution is too thick (viscous) to be filtered and must be diluted with a very large quantity of water. After dilution, the solution is forced through a filter cloth in a filter press. However, the pieces of undissolved residue are very fine and can quickly clog the filter cloth. Therefore, before filtration is started, a <b>filter</b> <b>aid,</b> such as diatomaceous earth, must be added; this holds most of the fine particles away {{from the surface of the}} filter cloth and facilitates filtration. However, <b>filter</b> <b>aid</b> is expensive and can make a significant contribution to costs. To reduce the quantity of <b>filter</b> <b>aid</b> needed, some processors force air into the extract as it is being diluted with water (the extract and diluting water are mixed in an in-line mixer into which air is forced). Fine air bubbles attach themselves to the particles of residue. The diluted extract is left standing for several hours while the air rises to the top, taking the residue particles with it. This frothy mix of air and residue is removed from the top and the solution is withdrawn from the bottom and pumped to the filter.|$|R
