This new edition covers changes such as the revised Public Law Outline, new case law and the latest law and regulations (eg the Care Planning Regulations 2010) are covered. The book also {{takes into account the}} <b>Family</b> <b>Procedure</b> Rules 2010, new statutory guidance and Government initiatives. The separate field of adoption law is not included, but the book does deal with selected provisions of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and the Children and Adoption Act 2006. In addition to explaining the general principles of the law relating to child care and protection, the authors provide valuable insights into assessments, care planning, expert evidence, taking instructions, case preparation and courtroom skills. Presented in a compact, user-friendly format, the book is enhanced by checklists and flowcharts. The authors of this timely new edition are a great practice team - together they provide a unique combination of academic and research information and practice experience in child protection which has added fresh dimensions to the new edition of this book.

40|$|Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is a consensual {{process where}} {{the parties agree}} {{to come to a}} solution, which means that {{autonomy}} is a central characteristic of this category of dispute resolution processes. Tidwell identifies that “mediation is predicated upon mediation’s flexibility informality and consensuality opening up the full dimension of the problem facing the parties. Parties come to mediation because it is flexible and thus convenient. Mediation is used because it is not adversarial, but rather seeks to satisfy the needs of the presenting parties”. The very nature of mediation and other ADR processes is that it is based upon a consensual process, which is outside of the judicial system. The problem with co-optation is that it is judicialising ADR processes through avenues such as mandatory mediation or adjunctive adjudication processes. The implication of this {{is that there is a}} framework in place that is no longer consensual in nature; rather, it is merely an extension of the coercive power of the judicial system. In the UK, there is arguably a system of co-optation through Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) and <b>Family</b> <b>Procedure</b> Rules (FPR), because instead of promoting consensual mediation and ADR processes they are coercing individuals to comply with an obligation to engage in ADR prior to entering the courts. Thus, this paper is going to examine the content of the CPR and FPR to determine whether there is a process of cooptation is occurring within English law...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{choice of}} the {{variable}} to flip in the Walksat <b>family</b> <b>procedures</b> is always random {{in that it is}} selected from a randomly chosen unsatisfied clause c. This choice in Novelty or R-Novelty heuristics also contains some determinism in that the variable to flip is always limited to the two best variables in c. In this paper, we first propose a diversification parameter for Novelty (or R-Novelty) heuristic to break the determinism in Novelty and show its performance compared with the random walk parameter in Novelty+. Then we exploit promising decreasing paths in a deterministic fashion in local search using a gradient-based approach. In other words, when promising decreasing paths exist, the variable to flip is no longer selected from a randomly chosen unsatisfied clause but in a deterministic fashion to surely decrease the number of unsatisfied clauses. Experimental results show that the proposed diversification and the determinism allow to significantly improve Novelty (and Walksat). ...|$|R
40|$|Students new {{to family}} law {{are likely to}} find that a {{significant}} portion of the syllabus focuses on the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA). Part I is primarily concerned with divorce and nullity and Part II with financial provision on breakdown of a marriage 1 and it is the latter which this article will consider. By way of overview for students new to the subject the law does not normally intervene in respect of how money and property are distributed amongst family members. Ownership of family property is largely governed by the law of property and equity and trust. However, following divorce or dissolution of a civil partnership the courts may split assets according to what is fair between the parties having regard to the individual needs and circumstances of the parties and any children. This can include an order for a lump sum or periodical payments 2; a property adjustment order or order for sale 3 and orders relating to pension provision 4 with section 25 setting out what the court must take into account in deciding whether to exercise its powers in respect of those provisions. This area of family law has recently received considerable coverage in the legal press following the unanimous Supreme Court decision in Wyatt v Vince 5 to allow the appellant wife’s appeal against the striking out of her claim for financial relief 18 years after the grant of the decree absolute and direct that her application proceed to the High Court Family Division. This article will not focus on the procedural aspects of this decision other than to highlight that Lord Wilson, delivering the judgement, made it clear that Rule 4. 4 of the <b>Family</b> <b>Procedure</b> Rules does not confer on the family court the power of summary judgement equivalent to that found in the Civil Procedure Rules. Instead when a former spouse applies for a financial order, the court has a duty under section 25 (1) of the MCA to consider all the circumstances of the case including the eight areas set out in subsection 2...|$|E
