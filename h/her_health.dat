5|$|David {{made several}} visits to California, which she much enjoyed, but <b>her</b> <b>health</b> began to fail.

5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect <b>her</b> <b>health.</b> Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E
