5|$|A {{ridge of}} low Jurassic hills {{runs through the}} county, {{separating}} the basins of the Welland and Nene rivers. The county has good communications as it is crossed by two main railway lines and the M1 motorway, and it has many small industrial centres rather than large conurbations. The main architectural <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> its country houses and mansions.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1093 and 1537, Chester Cathedral {{includes}} {{a set of}} medieval choir stalls dating from 1380, with exquisite figurative carving. An unusual <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> the very large south transept. The Early English Lady Chapel is a harmonious composition in Lancet Gothic. It retains substantial monastic buildings including a large refectory.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Features</b> <b>are</b> {{split into}} Macro(global) and Micro(local) features.Macro <b>features</b> <b>are</b> {{calculated}} on entire document whereas Micro <b>features</b> <b>are</b> calculated on selected characters/bi-grams/words.

5|$|Chiropterans most {{distinguishing}} <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> {{that their}} forelimbs are developed as wings, making them the only mammals {{in the world}} naturally capable of flight. Bat species account for about 20% of all mammals.|$|E
5|$|Compared with Giraffititan, {{the inner}} ear of A. sp. shows a more basal morphology. That <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> {{possibly}} related to a restricted range of possible movements that involve head-turning.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 1098 to 1493, Gloucester Cathedral has a Norman nave {{with massive}} masonry piers, {{and a fine}} 15th-century Perpendicular tower, but its main <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> the eastern end, reconstructed in the 14th century as an early example of Perpendicular Gothic and with the largest medieval window in the world, the area of a tennis court. The cloisters have the {{earliest}} example of fan-vaulting.|$|E

5000|$|Defined by length, {{the first}} {{dramatic}} <b>feature</b> film <b>was</b> the Australian 70-minute film The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906). Similarly, the first European <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> the 90-minute film L'Enfant prodigue (France, 1907), although {{that was an}} unmodified record of a stage play; Europe's first feature adapted directly for the screen, Les Misérables, came from France in 1909. The first Russian <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> Defence of Sevastopol in 1911. [...] Early Italian <b>features</b> <b>were</b> The Inferno (L'Inferno) (1911), Quo Vadis? (1913), The Last Days of Pompeii (1913), and Cabiria (1914). The first UK <b>features</b> <b>were</b> the documentary With Our King and Queen Through India (1912), filmed in Kinemacolor and Oliver Twist (1912). The first American <b>features</b> <b>were</b> adaptations of Oliver Twist (1912), From the Manger to the Cross (1912), Cleopatra (1912), and Richard III (1912). The latter starring actor Frederick Warde starred {{in some of these}} movie adaptations. [...] The first Asian <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> Japan's The Life Story of Tasuke Shiobara (1912), the first Indian <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> Raja Harishchandra (1913), the first South American <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> Brazil's O Crime dos Banhados (1913), and the first African <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> South Africa's Die Voortrekkers (1916). 1913 also saw China's first feature film, Zhang Shichuan's Nan Fu Nan Qi.|$|R

5|$|Dating from 1158 to {{the early}} 16th century, Oxford Cathedral was always a small cathedral and was made smaller by the {{destruction}} {{of much of the}} nave in the 16th century. The stone spire, from 1230, {{is one of the oldest}} in England and contributes to Oxford’s tradition as “the city of dreaming spires”. Its most unusual <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> the late-15th-century pendant vault over the Norman chancel.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 1177 to 1512, Rochester Cathedral has a Norman nave and crypt, and Early English choir. Its most {{remarkable}} <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> the rare, exuberantly carved Norman portal, which has, unfortunately, suffered much damage.|$|E
5|$|It is {{sometimes}} mistaken for the deadly Inocybe erubescens. The rarer I.erubescens, like I.godeyi, bruises red, {{though it is}} lighter in colour to begin with. The most distinguishing <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> that I.erubescens lacks a bulbous base.|$|E

40|$|This report {{introduces}} {{a study on}} syntactic features used in a discriminative word alignment model. The <b>features</b> <b>are</b> implemented on a state-of-the-art discriminative word alignment system. The syntactic <b>features</b> <b>are</b> extracted from parse trees. Three types of syntactic <b>features</b> <b>are</b> experimented in this work: one global tree path feature and two first order tree features. Experimental {{results show that the}} syntactic <b>features</b> <b>are</b> helpful for improving the word alignment accuracy on Chinese-English parallel sentences...|$|R

5|$|Python uses {{whitespace}} indentation {{to delimit}} blocks – rather than curly braces or keywords. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; {{a decrease in}} indentation signifies {{the end of the}} current block. This <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> also sometimes termed the off-side rule.|$|E
5|$|Rochester Castle {{stands on}} the east bank of the River Medway in Rochester, Kent, South East England. The 12th-century keep or stone tower, which is the castle's most {{prominent}} <b>feature,</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the best}} preserved in England or France.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the basic}} {{nature of the}} language's design, {{it is capable of}} a great deal of expressiveness. Tables, lists, side floats, {{and a variety of other}} <b>features</b> <b>are</b> available. These <b>features</b> <b>are</b> {{comparable}} to CSS's layout features, though some of those <b>features</b> <b>are</b> expected to be built by the XSLT.|$|R
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} side of Mysteries of the Sith {{was received}} positively, {{but did not}} completely escape criticism. Emil Pagliarulo of The Adrenaline Vault questioned why certain features seemed to be missing from the multiplayer mode that {{were present in the}} single-player mode. One such <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> the rancor which appears prominently in a single-player level but is not in any multiplayer maps.|$|E
5|$|The nine-story building's {{most notable}} <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> its translucent, {{corrugated}} sunscreens. Supported by aluminum lattices throughout the building's facade, the sunscreens {{are made of}} Rohm and Haas's principal product, Plexiglas. In 2007 the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and today {{is considered one of}} the best examples of the International style.|$|E
5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top and bottom of the digit to make it more distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E

5|$|Age of Empires III {{builds on}} and {{introduces}} new features to the Age of Mythology engine, called Bang! Engine. One new <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> {{the inclusion of}} the Havok physics simulation middleware engine on the Windows version and the similar PhysX engine on Mac OS X. This means that many events such as building destruction and tree falls will not be pre-created animations, but will be calculated according to the physics engine, in an innovation for the series. Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E
5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} spiritual predecessor, the {{environment}} of the game {{takes the form of a}} series of isometric flip-screen rooms (which trace the outline of a large starship). There are a total of 129 rooms and most are filled with various objects, such as moveable platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens. As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> the use of remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.|$|E
50|$|Another game <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> a {{different}} in-game heroes pricing policy for {{male and female}} gamers. After much controversy this <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> cancelled and prices became the same for both male and female players. All gender <b>features</b> <b>were</b> later removed from the game as well as the gender indication in the game interface.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} recognition performances of various projection-based features applied on registered 3 D scans of faces. Some <b>features</b> <b>are</b> data driven, such as ICA-based features or NNMF-based <b>features.</b> Other <b>features</b> <b>are</b> obtained using DFT or DCT-based schemes. We apply the feature extraction techniques to three different representations of registered faces, namely, 3 D point clouds, 2 D depth images and 3 D voxel. We consider both global and local <b>features.</b> Global <b>features</b> <b>are</b> {{extracted from the}} whole face data, whereas local <b>features</b> <b>are</b> computed over the blocks partitioned from 2 D depth images. The block-based local <b>features</b> <b>are</b> fused both at feature level and at decision level. The resulting <b>feature</b> vectors <b>are</b> matched using Linear Discriminant Analysis. Experiments using different combinations of representation types and <b>feature</b> vectors <b>are</b> conducted on the 3 D-RMA dataset...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{statistical}} classification of multivariate normal (Gaussian) observations in the subspace of informative <b>features</b> <b>is</b> studied. The iterative stepwise method for non-informative <b>feature</b> rejection <b>is</b> proposed {{and efficiency of}} transition to the selected <b>features</b> <b>is</b> analytically investigated...|$|R
