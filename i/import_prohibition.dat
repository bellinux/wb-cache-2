Since its inception in 1993, the project has developed into a long-term nesting and tagging research program that incorporates a highly successful volunteer program. [...] In 2004, she extended her work to cover the critically endangered river terrapins of Terengganu. This work is now carried out as community-based projects in the Setiu and Kemaman Rivers under the Turtle Conservation Society of Malaysia. Her contributions in marine turtle conservation were recognised by the United Nations Environment Programme when she was conferred the UNEP Global 500 Roll of Honour in 2001. She was listed in the UNEP's Who's Who of Women and the Environment in 2006. In Malaysia, she was conferred the title Pingat Jasa Kebaktian (PJK) by the late Sultan of Terengganu in 1991 in recognition of her contributions in the state. She has also received several research awards in the university. Chan has published extensively in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, magazines and newsletters. She has also authored several books, including a book for children entitled [...] "Little Turtle Messenger". Many of her works have been applied directly in the conservation of turtles in Malaysia, either to enhance existing efforts, or to develop new approaches in protecting turtles. Her publications were cited extensively in {{the report of the}} WTO (World Trade Organization) Panel on the United States - <b>Import</b> <b>Prohibition</b> of Certain Shrimp and Shrimp Products, WT/DS58/R, 15 May 1998.

5000|$|Mexico {{brings the}} {{complaint}} through GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) dispute resolution system utilizing the WTO committee {{arguing that the}} US MMPA product ban on tuna imports was inconsistent with the provisions of GATT. Mexico argues through WTO panel dispute resolution mechanism that the <b>import</b> <b>prohibition</b> was inconsistent with Article XI, Article XIII, Article III of GATT. Mexico also claimed that the embargo {{did not meet the}} exceptions of Article XX. Article III refers to the National treatment provision and the fact that countries must apply tariffs equally to similar products of all other contracting parties. This also brings to debate the Product vs. process debate. Also known as PPM's (Process and Production Methods), referring to desire of some countries to regulate international trade on like for like goods {{on the basis of their}} process technologies or harvesting techniques in this case. Although the intention of the embargo is to bring to light the externalities of dolphin casualties due to the purse-seine harvesting techniques, the issue of PPMs is that the process is irrelevant if the product is the same. Developing countries have historically been wary of including PPM's in the WTO. The fear being that this will create an imposition of environmental, technological and other qualitative standards with high thresholds set by industrialized countries thus creating a technical disadvantage for developing countries. Essentially what Mexico argues is that MMPA is discriminating against like products based on their production methods. Article XI addresses the quantitative restriction provision which involves the dispute over embargoes vs. tariffs. Article XI says that a country is permitted to impose tariffs as a trade restriction but prohibits any type of non-tariff restriction such as quotas or limiting importing/ exporting licenses. Further, Mexico argues the Article XX provision of GATT is inconsistent with that of the MMPA. Specifically Article XX(b) and XX(g) which refer to the allowance of trade restrictions when it is deemed [...] "necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health" [...] or [...] "relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources". The issue with Article XX is that even while it may be valid, it cannot be applied outside the jurisdiction of the United States, hence making the argument in the favor of Mexico. The outcome of this challenge fell in the favor of Mexico however these findings were not adopted formally due to the upcoming NAFTA negotiations, however the argument was revisited in the Dolphin Tuna II case in 1992.|$|E

Results indicate that, for agricultural goods in particular, the price hike associated with an import ban is lower in border states. However, we find little evidence that bans disrupt the cointegration relationship between states. These results are consistent with a large diffusion of smuggled goods across Nigerian states, and with the higher price elasticity to distance in the illegal trade sector.

The research revealed that the use of quotas and prohibitions for economic reasons has declined, but most countries use prohibitions as part of their regulatory frameworks for protecting human safety and health or the environment, and this tendency appears to be increasing. Traders would benefit from greater transparency of these measures.

For their part, environmentalists have developed long lists of amendments to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) {{that they would like}} to see adopted. In response, free traders have honed their arguments responding to these suggestions and have added some counterclaims from the trade perspective. Indeed, taxonomies of trade and environment problems abound. The standard menu of concerns usually includes: GATT Article XX reform, <b>import</b> <b>prohibitions,</b> export restraints, product standards, restrictions on production processes and methods, taxes and subsidies, unilateral and extraterritorial actions, and the use of trade penalties to enforce international environmental agreements.

40|$|Peru {{experienced}} radical {{economic policy}} changes {{during the first}} half of the decade of 1990. An analysis of these new economic policies, especially those related to foreign trade are presented in this article. Between 1990 and 1994, the Peruvian government eliminated price controls and exchange rate restrictions; measures were given to promote national and foreign private investment; state monopolies to import goods were suppressed; <b>import</b> <b>prohibitions</b> were phased out; most import tariffs were drastically reduced; a much more uniform tariff structure was imposed, and export subsidies were eliminated. Local import substituting activities that used to be highly protected before the reform were forced to adapt to the new open market conditions, with smaller effective rates of protection. Many of them closed down business, but others were able to stabilize and continued growing, although they had to invest in new equipment and had to reduce their sale prices in the internal market, which benefited consumers. Overall, total GDP as well as manufacturing GDP both grew up during the period. There was not any industrial collapse that some analysts predicted to happen. Employment level in the manufacturing sector contracted, but labor productivity picked up. Imports increased faster than exports, thus generating serious balance of trade deficits that were financed by capital inflows. Trade openness did no eliminate the prevailing anti export bias, but this bias certainly was reduced, and a basis for the future development of new exporting sectors was established. Initially, tariff reduction caused fiscal revenue losses, but they were compensated later on by the increase in import volumes.

On 12 January 2007, President George W. Bush signed the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (MSRA). The MSRA required the U. S. Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) {{to establish a}} Bycatch Reduction Engineering Program (BREP) to develop technological devices and other conservation engineering changes designed to minimize bycatch, seabird interactions, bycatch mortality, and post-release mortality in Federally managed fisheries. The MSRA also required the Secretary to identify nations whose vessels are engaged in the bycatch of protected living marine resources (PLMR’s) under specified circumstances and to certify that these nations have 1) adopted regulatory programs for PLMR’s that are comparable to U. S. programs, taking into account different conditions, and 2) established management plans for PLMR’s that assist {{in the collection of}} data to support assessments and conservation of these resources.

In addition, the international provisions of the MSRA have provided an innovative tool through which the United States can address bycatch by foreign nations.

Each program virtually prohibits the import of completely built-up vehicles, specifies minimum local content requirements for vehicles assembled in the country from imported completely knocked-down kits, and requires that firms assembling kits export to earn foreign exchange {{to cover the cost}} of the kits. Similar protective regimes have existed in a number of countries, especially in Latin America. The author develops a model to illustrate the economic impact and welfare cost of <b>import</b> <b>prohibitions,</b> local content requirements, and export requirements. She applies that model to Philippine data. Her results indicate that the protective regime in the Philippines imposes substantial costs on consumers and encourages the allocation of resources to relatively high-cost activities. Eliminating all of the restrictions overnight may lead to adjustment problems, but gradual liberalization could limit these problems. The proportion of domestic content required, the percentage of compensatory exports required for kits, and the tariff rates on kits could be lowered in stages, according to a preannounced schedule, to allow gradual adjustment. The <b>prohibition</b> on <b>imports</b> of assembled vehicles could be replaced by a tariff and phased out gradually. To avoid proportionately more protection of the assembly industry, the tariff on finished autos could be phased out more quickly than the other tariffs, to avoid sending false signals to the domestic industry about the direction of adjustment. To avoid increasing the effective rate of protection on assembly operations during liberalization, elimination of the domestic content and compensatory export requirements should be accompanied by decreases in the tariff rates on assembled vehicles.

40|$|Includes bibliographySummary During the 1980 's, the Dominican Republic made {{attempts}} at macroeconomic reform that saw little success. A decade later a stabilization and structural reform package was implemented. This package included, among other aspects, inflation control through monetary restraint and a tax and tariff reform {{which sought to}} increase the efficiency of the prevailing tax structure and eliminate its relative price distortion while maintaining fiscal equilibrium. Price stabilization was achieved, nominal import tariff rates were reduced and the economy started on a growth trajectory that has lasted into the present. The tariff and tax reforms saw light in September 1990 and June 1992, respectively. The tariff reform sought to simplify the existing tariff structure and reduce the tariff dispersion as well as the average effective rate of protection. Accordingly, the tariff interval was initially reduced from 0 %- 200 % to 5 %- 35 % and then to 0 %- 35 %. The tariff rates which were seven in number {{at the beginning of the}} reform increased to nine by 1997. The average tariff rate was estimated at 17. 3 % in 1997. The tariff reform was also accompanied by the elimination of most <b>import</b> <b>prohibitions,</b> licenses and exemptions increasing thus the import tax base as well as the virtual elimination of export taxes. The elimination of export taxes coupled with the recent reforms regarding the oil tax differential have shielded the performance of budget accounts from commodity price volatility. Nonetheless an implicit export tax to traditional exporters exists as these have to surrender their foreign exchange earnings to the Central Bank. The quasi-fiscal revenue potential of this implicit tax depends on the difference between the official exchange rate and the market exchange rate. Still, external sources of revenue are important as they represent 36 % of total fiscal revenues and 6 % of GDP as of 1998. Import taxes represented during 1995 - 1998 more than a quarter of total fiscal revenues and 4 % of GDP. This dependence on trade taxes, which is one of the highest in Latin America and selected Caribbean countries, has become a source of concern as the Dominican Republic is opening up to external competition (the country is part of several regional agreements and since March 1995 is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 1998, it signed free trade agreements with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Central American Common Market (CACM). In short, how can the country carry out an outward looking economic policy while maintaining the present weight of trade taxes in fiscal revenue? In 1998, a tariff reform was elaborated seeking to reduce the tariff interval from the present 0 %- 35 % to 0 %- 15 %, diminishing effective rates of protection and the average mean tariff rate. While the proposal is still under inspection by the legislative power, if implemented it could decrease trade taxes substantially and endanger fiscal stability, especially since the present fiscal account surplus falls short of the sustainability surplus boundary line by 1. 5 % of GDP. A reduction in internal interest rates could diminish the sustainability surplus boundary line. Additionally, the fiscal reform —also in the legislative chamber— which seeks to increase the value added tax rate from 8 % to 12 % coupled with substantial decrease in government subsidies (which the privatization law [1997] ultimately seeks to achieve) to state owned firms could generate earnings to compensate the fiscal gap and provide the necessary maneuver margin to distribute income. First approximation calculations indicated that even if the tariff proposal is carried out and all government subsidies to state owned firms were eliminated, the resulting surplus would, other things being equal, fall short of the sustainability surplus by 1 % of GDP...|$|R
5000|$|Marshall then {{addresses}} {{an issue}} that Maryland had argued [...] "with great reason": that prohibiting taxation of imports would greatly interfere {{in the power of}} taxation that is [...] "essential" [...] to the states. Maryland insisted that the point when the prohibition on taxation ends should be the time of importation, to which Marshall responded: It may be conceded that the words of the prohibition ought not to be pressed to their utmost extent; that in our complex system, the object of the powers conferred on the government of the Union, {{and the nature of the}} often conflicting powers which remain in the states, must always be taken into view, and may aid in expounding the words of any particular clause. But while we admit that sound principles of construction ought to restrain all courts from carrying the words of the prohibition beyond the object the Constitution is intended to secure, that there must be a point of time when the prohibition ceases and the power of the state to tax commences, we cannot admit that this point of time is the instant that the articles enter the country. It is, we think, obvious that this construction would defeat the prohibition.The constitutional prohibition on the states to lay a duty on <b>imports,</b> a <b>prohibition</b> which a vast majority of them must feel an interest in preserving, may certainly come in conflict with their acknowledged power to tax persons and property within their territory. The power and the restriction on it, though quite distinguishable when they do not approach each other, may yet, like the intervening colors between white and black, approach so nearly as to perplex the understanding, as colors perplex the vision in marking the distinction between them. Yet the distinction exists and must be marked as the cases arise. Till they do arise, it might be premature to state any rule as being universal in its application. It is sufficient for the present to say generally that when the importer has so acted upon the thing imported that it has become incorporated and mixed up with the mass of property in the country, it has perhaps lost its distinctive character as an import and has become subject to the taxing power of the state; but while remaining the property of the importer in his warehouse in the original form or package in which it was imported, a tax upon it is too plainly a duty on imports to escape the prohibition in the Constitution.|$|R
