5|$|Both {{farmers and}} {{scientists}} must continually {{draw on the}} irreplaceable resource of genetic diversity to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides farmers with plants that have a higher resilience to pests and diseases and allows scientists access to a more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic diversity as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. Farmers can increase within-crop diversity to some extent by planting mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field diversity by polycultural practices such as <b>intercropping</b> and companion planting.|$|E

The experiment consisted of the cultivation of castor bean &# 8216;BRS Energia&# 8217; in a monocrop system and <b>intercropped</b> with peanut &# 8216;BR 1 &# 8217;.

40|$|The {{productivity}} of each {{component of a}} sorghum/groundnut <b>intercrop</b> and its constituent sole crops is determined {{in terms of a}} ‘Crop Performance Ratio’ (CPR) defined as the {{productivity of}} an <b>intercrop</b> per unit area of ground compared with that expected from sole crops sown in the same proportions. The CPR allows productivity, intercepted radiation and seasonal transpiration to be compared so that conversion coefficients for radiation (e; g MJ− 1) and dry matter/water ratios (q; g kg− 1) can be calculated for each <b>intercrop</b> component and its constituent sole crops. In this experiment, CPR for total dry weight in the <b>intercrop</b> was 1. 08 and that for reproductive yield was 1. 27. These advantages in overall productivity and yield were typical of those reported elsewhere for sorghum/groundnut <b>intercrops.</b> The proportional increase in total dry matter in the <b>intercrop</b> was largely a result of its greater interception of radiation.

25|$|Pest control {{includes}} {{the management of}} weeds, insects, mites, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological (biocontrol), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used.

[...] Primary issues include the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina which attacks the roots and lower stems of the crop causing damping-off disease.

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{argument is}} that the way to [...] "save the environment" [...] and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.

40|$|In a {{changing}} context, farmers adapt their cropping systems and, in this respect, the response {{time of the}} soil-crop system (changes in the soil resources and in the grapevine vegetative or reproductive development) has to be considered to maintain its agronomic performances. This is particularly true for perennial crops such as grapevine. This paper aims to analyse the short- and long-term effects of changes in soil surface management on grapevine performances. Avineyard in which bare soil inter-rows had been compared with a tall fescue <b>intercrop</b> since 2002 had each of these treatments split into two in 2007, {{with half of the}} <b>intercrop</b> being ploughed in and half of the bare soil being sown with fescue, resulting in four treatments whose effects were studied in 2008 - 2009. Grapevine growth, yield formation and grape quality were assessed. After <b>intercrop</b> destruction, grapevine vegetative growth was enhanced by the mineralization of organic matter from the first year, whereas after <b>intercrop</b> introduction, the competition for soil resources affected growth only in the second year. The grape yield depended on the number of bunches, elaborated the year before. One year after the change in soil surface management, the ranking of yield was as follows: permanent <b>intercrop</b> < <b>intercrop</b> destroyed < <b>intercrop</b> introduced < bare soil. The second year, this ranking altered (still in relation to the number of bunches) to: <b>intercrop</b> introduced < permanent <b>intercrop</b> < bare soil=intercrop destroyed.

40|$|Background: Plant genotypes {{are rarely}} {{developed}} for mixed cropping systems despite {{the potential of}} these systems to provide multiple ecosystem services. One of the most ubiquitously grown mixed cropping systems is a common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) <b>intercrop,</b> {{but there is little}} consensus among researchers, and few known studies document farmer knowledge, about superior bean genotypes specifically for this <b>intercrop</b> system. Participatory plant breeding (PPB) is a well-accepted method of selecting varieties with farmers and could be a useful tool for identifying genotypes for <b>intercrops.</b> We used sole crop and <b>intercrop</b> PPB on-farm trials (n = 13) and interviews (n = 59) to document farmer knowledge about climbing bean genotypes and adaptation for <b>intercrops</b> in Rwanda, where smallholder farmers have traditionally grown beans and maize for generations. Results: Qualitative analysis demonstrated that farmers considered distinct attributes for different cropping systems. In <b>intercrops,</b> farmer evaluation prioritized five factors: universal traits and trait-based competitive ability, intrinsic competitive ability, environmental adaptation, and management. Farmers consider intrinsic competitive ability crucial, whereas most other studies have neglected this attribute in <b>intercrop</b> breeding strategies. Furthermore, farmers identified specific attributes that constitute an <b>intercrop</b> bean ideotype: adaptation, restricted height, columnar plant structure, even distribution of pods, fewer leaves, and earlier maturity. Farmers also had specific techniques for testing cropping system and environment interactions. Conclusions: PPB on-farm trial evaluations and interviews with farmers allowed us to combine traditional agroecological knowledge with plant breeding research to generate new knowledge that contributes to our understanding of <b>intercrop</b> breeding and bean traits for <b>intercrops.</b> Farmers demonstrated sophisticated understanding of methods to identify genotype adaptation, competitive ability, and specific traits that together create a bean ideotype for maize–bean cropping systems.
