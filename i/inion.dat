Brian's mother was Bé Binn <b>inion</b> Urchadh, daughter of Urchadh mac Murchadh (d. 945), king of Maigh Seóla in west Connacht. That they belonged to the Uí Briúin Seóla may explain why he received the name Brian, which was rare among the Dál gCais.|$|E
500|$|The dire wolf had smaller {{feet and}} a larger head when {{compared}} with a northern wolf of the same body size. The skull length could reach up to [...] or longer, with a broader palate, frontal region, and zygomatic arches compared with the Yukon wolf. These dimensions make the skull very massive. Its sagittal crest was higher, with the <b>inion</b> showing a significant backward projection, and with the rear ends of the nasal bones extending relatively far back into the skull. A connected skeleton of a dire wolf from Rancho LaBrea {{is difficult to find}} because the tar allows the bones to disassemble in many directions. Parts of a vertebral column have been assembled, and it was found to be {{similar to that of the}} modern wolf, with the same number of vertebrae.|$|E

40|$|The coastal {{shrimp trawl}} {{fisheries}} {{have long been}} the focus of conservation actions to reduce turtle bycatch and mortality in the Gulf of Mexico and the U. S. Atlantic (NRC, 1990). Calculation of catch rates of sea turtles in shrimp trawls is necessary to evaluate the impact on sea turtle populations. In this paper we analyze sea turtle bycatch to provide an estimate of the current number of interactions with otter trawl gear as well as an estimate of the number of fatal <b>inions</b> in Southeast U. S. waters and the Gulf of Mexico. We also provide an estimate of the number of individuals likely to die in the future with the new regulations that will require an increase {{in the size of the}} escape openings in trutle excluder devices (TEDs). The new regulations will allow many more turtles to escape. Other gears also are discussed. (PDF contains 24 pages...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} various anions on the {{photocatalytic}} activity of nano-sized TiO 2 {{was investigated in}} a methyl orange solution. The photocatalytic activity of the TiO 2 nanoparticles was significantly affected {{in the presence of}} SO 2 − 4, CO 2 − 3, NO− 3 and Cl−. Among the tested ions, Cl− was most effective anion in changing the photocatalytic activity. Addition of Cl− (0. 05 M) decreased the methyl orange photodegradation rate to only one quarter of that when TiO 2 was used alone. It was also demonstrated that the effects of these <b>inions,</b> on the rate of photocatalytic activity of the nanoparticles, were concentration dependent. There was a negative correlation between the concentrations of NO− 3 and Cl− and the methyl orange degradation rate by TiO 2. However, at low concentrations, CO 2 − 3 and SO 2 − 4 enhanced the photocatalytic activity; while at the higher concentrations, these two anions inhibited the photocatalytic activity of TiO...|$|R
30|$|Soil salt crusts {{are special}} layers at soil surface which are widely {{distributed}} in the Trim Desert Highway Shelterbelt under drip-irrigation with high salinity groundwater. In order to reveal annual variation of their chemical characteristics, soil salt crusts in shelterbelt of different ages in hinterland of the Taklimakan Desert were sampled. SOM, total salt, <b>inions</b> and pH were analyzed. Following results were obtained. SOM of salt crusts increased with the shelterbelt ages, but increasing trend became lower gradually. Total salt, ions, and pH of salt crusts reduced gradually with the shelterbelt ages. Total salt of salt crusts in shelterbelt of different ages was much higher than shifting sandy land. Ions were higher than shifting sandy land, Cl-, Na+, and SO 42 - increased more obvious, then Mg 2 +, K+, Ca 2 + and HCO 3 -, CO 32 - was little and nearly had no change. pH was all alkaline, pH of salt crusts in shelterbelt of 11 years was even lower than shifting sandy land. We can include {{that the quality of}} shallow soil (0 ~ 30 cm) in the Trim Desert Highway Shelterbelt becomes better gradually.|$|R
40|$|Background. A {{study on}} the cephalic index was carried out on {{subjects}} from school students in Ogbia tribe of Bayelsa state in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. This study determined the cephalic indices among the school students. In the present study, seven hundred subjects {{were randomly selected from}} secondary schools comprising 350 males and 350 females, respectively, with age range from 11 – 20 years, with both parents and grandparents of Ogbia tribe. The length and breadth of the head were measured using a spreading caliper from standard bony landmarks. The measurable point for head length was measured between the glabella and <b>inions</b> while the head breadth was the widest biparietal diameter. The cephalic index was head breadth divided by the head length and multiplied by 100. The result showed that the mean cephalic index was 76. 56. Males had a cephalic index of 77. 21, while females had a cephalic index of 76. 50. Based on this study, 78. 68 % of individuals were mesocephalic, 11. 4 % dolichocephalic, 9. 0 % Brachycephalic, and 0. 43 % hyperbrachycephalic. This research showed that the school students have mesocephalic phenotype. The data from this research will be useful in anthropology, genetics, forensic medicine, and clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} disturbance history on interactions between floristic composition and environmental factors in a single community type in karri forest (site type 10, after <b>Inions</b> et al., 1990) in south-western Australia. The relationship of six disturbance and site-based environmental variables, and three plant species richness variables (native, introduced and total vascular plant species) were compared using numerical taxonomic, regression and correlation approaches. Disturbance and site variables were highly intercorrelated, limiting the opportunity to directly attribute causes to observed floristic patterns. Nevertheless, management practices in karri forest are based on interrelated disturbances (e. g. high intensity slash burns were used to initiate regeneration for timber production), limiting the necessity to separate effects. Community types in karri forest have both, low alpha diversity (quadrat-based species richness) and species richness of the community in comparison with neighboring vegetation types. For community type 10, alpha diversity was negatively correlated with time-since-fire (P < 0. 002) and time-since-regeneration (P < 0. 004), but was lowest at intermediate times since disturbance (11 - 20 years). Although ordination revealed no discernable pattern of sites based on floristic composition, four plant assemblages defined a priori according to time-since-disturbance were significantly {{different from one another}} (P < 0. 01 by ANOSIM). Time-since-fire (and other disturbance) influenced floristic composition more than the number of recent past fires in contrast to the more species-rich, but drier and nutrient-poor neighboring jarrah forest communities where the number of past fires is more influential. Under the current climatic regime, karri forest communities are likely to undergo less long-term change in floristic patterns following disturbance than neighboring vegetation types. This is primarily because of the greater intervals between disturbance events, the few transformer weeds in the area and the rapid recovery of native plant cover following disturbance. This study has demonstrated the resilience of karri forest to various discrete disturbances currently associated with these environments, although more profound changes are likely following continuing disturbance intervention such as clearing and grazing...|$|R
