5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E

25|$|Another truck full of {{explosives}} went up, taking {{with it all}} my personal kit. That was another two trucks gone. My equipment was now reduced to an automatic pistol, a prismatic compass and one plated teaspoon. From now onwards <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> travelling light.|$|E
25|$|I {{am trying}} to resume my pen... Whenever I sit alone, or walk alone, I find myself dreaming about stories, as of old; but these forenoons in the Custom House undo all that the afternoons and evenings have done. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> happier if I could write.|$|E

25|$|In 2006 Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney {{revealed}} {{that she had}} received a death threat from Hal Turner.

25|$|In May 1213 King John yielded {{and thus}} in July, Stephen (who since his consecration had lived at Pontigny Abbey in Burgundy) {{and his fellow}} exiles {{returned}} to England.

25|$|I am {{sometimes}} {{inclined to}} think that in some parts - not all - of the Commonwealth, the old-fashioned traditional, and almost instinctive, standard of fair play to {{be observed by the}} Crown in dealing with subjects, which I learned a very long time ago to regard as elementary, is either not known or thought out of date. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> glad to think that I am mistaken.|$|E

25|$|If I were to {{say that}} the {{so-called}} philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> quite right.|$|E

25|$|Out in {{the real}} world, however, the {{response}} has been overwhelmingly positive. I've signed books in five stores, with more than 1,000 buyers at each site. I've had one negative remark—that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> tried for treason—and one caller on C-SPAN said that I was an anti-Semite. My most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I have been most encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and members of Congress who have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, {{because after}} so many heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} whether those claims and schemes and avengings, {{in the same}} way as mentioned in the historical sources, were actually proposed by Ardashir himself or were later attributed to him as the founder of the empire has still remained without answer due to the lack of sufficient sources; though the attribution of these claims to Ardashir after his lifetime seems more logical. According to these, it is undoubtedly true that Ardashir's grandiose views about policy and relations with the outside world had formed based on rebooting and repeating the Achaemenids' successes. However, the Sasanians' knowledge of the Achaemenids were superficial and vague information and did not have a regular and historical basis. About that, Richard Frye and Daryee believe that the section of the Arabic-Persian sources (like Al-Tabari) that contain the Sasanian history since the beginning until the age of Khosrow <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> looked at suspiciously; they consider this suspicious look at texts like Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan too. The suspicious look has been due to that most of the Iranian history sources were edited in the age of Khosrow I and by the royal writers and clerics in order to accommodate their predecessors' history with then world view of the Sasanian empire and draw a picture of Ardashir idealistic and aligning with Khosrow's ideals in the best way.|$|E

500|$|... "Traditional" [...] {{accounts}} of Steinitz {{describe him as}} having a sharp tongue and violent temper, perhaps partly because of his short stature (barely five feet) and congenital lameness. He admitted that [...] "Like the Duke of Parma, I always hold the sword {{in one hand and}} the olive branch in the other", and under severe provocation he could become abusive in published articles. He was aware of his own tendencies and said early in his career, [...] "Nothing would induce me to take charge of a chess column ...Because <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> so fair in dispensing blame as well as praise that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sure to give offence and make enemies." [...] When he embarked on chess journalism, his brutally frank review of Wormald's The Chess Openings in 1875 proved him right on both counts.|$|E
