40|$|We {{show that}} <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> may benefit {{innovation}} by improving {{the efficiency of}} innovative activities. We measure firm-level innovative efficiency by patents (or patent citations) scaled by R&D (research and development) investment {{or the number of}} employees, and find that <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> are positively associated with innovative efficiency. Tests using the 1989 junk bond crisis as an exogenous shock to <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> suggest a causal interpretation for the link. Consistent with agency problems, the positive effect of <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> on innovative efficiency is stronger among firms with high excess cash holdings and low investment opportunities, and among firms in less competitive industries. <b>Financial</b> <b>constraints</b> appear to mitigate free cash flow problems that induce firms to make unproductive R&D investment in fields out of their direct expertise.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} whether small-scale businesses face <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> {{that affect their}} survival. We develop a model of moral hazard in which <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> arise endogenously.

We test this proposition using German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) data, which cover the period 1984 - 2004. The release from <b>financial</b> <b>constraints</b> is measured by inheritance. The empirical analysis confirms that the entrepreneur has a higher propensity to stay in business when she inherits capital. This effect is particularly strong for entrepreneurs that switch from self-employment into wage employment. These results are consistent with hypothesis that financial frictions have a perceptible impact on bankruptcy among small business firms.
