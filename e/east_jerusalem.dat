The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, and the International Committee of the Red Cross {{refer to it as}} Occupied Palestinian Territory. The area and population of Jerusalem includes that of <b>East</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> which has been de facto annexed by Israel and incorporated within Jerusalem's municipal borders under the Jerusalem Law. This, however, is not recognized by the international community who regard <b>East</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> as part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.|$|E

5|$|After Israel {{captured}} <b>East</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> from Jordan in 1967, {{a number}} of plans were submitted {{for the design of}} a new building. After years of deliberation and indecision, a commemorative arch was erected instead at the site in 1977, itself becoming a prominent landmark of the Jewish Quarter. The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its 19th-century style received approval by the Israeli Government in 2000, and the newly rebuilt synagogue was dedicated on March 15, 2010.|$|E

5|$|Being {{located just}} inside the Lions' Gate, {{one of the major}} entries to the Old City, the <b>East</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> Development Company {{initially}} intended to excavate the reservoir and build a multi-storey car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
5|$|Glubb {{nevertheless}} {{knew that}} the Israeli army would sooner or later be stronger than his {{and that he had}} to prevent the strengthening of the Harel and Etzioni brigades to secure <b>East</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b> He redeployed his strength on 23 May to reinforce the blockade. The Iraqi army, at that time seconded by tanks, relieved the Legion units in northern Samaria and these were redeployed towards the Jerusalem sector. The 2nd Regiment of the Legion moved to Latrun. A full Jordanian brigade was placed in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a {{separation}} barrier. In the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from the Gaza Strip, but maintained military control of numerous {{aspects of the}} territory including its borders, air space and coast. Israel's ongoing military occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and <b>East</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> {{continues to be the}} world's longest military occupation in modern times.|$|E

Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Ahmad Hussein is {{the head}} imam and manager of the al-Aqsa Mosque and was {{assigned}} the role of Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in 2006 by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. Ownership of the al-Aqsa Mosque is a contentious issue in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel claims sovereignty over the mosque along {{with all of the}} Temple Mount (Noble Sanctuary), but Palestinians hold the custodianship of the site through the Islamic waqf. During the negotiations at the 2000 Camp David Summit, Palestinians demanded complete ownership of the mosque and other Islamic holy sites in <b>East</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b>|$|E
5|$|Palestinian desserts include baklawa, halawa and kanafeh, as well {{as other}} {{semolina}} and wheat pastries.

Burma Til-Kadayif, or simply Burma, especially popular in <b>East</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> has the same filling as baklawa, but is cylndrical in shape and made with kanafeh dough instead of phyllo. Halawa is a block confection of sweetened sesame flour served in sliced pieces. Muhalabiyeh is a rice pudding made with milk and topped with pistachios or almonds.|$|E

5|$|Muslim {{residents}} of Israel and Palestinians living in <b>East</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> are normally {{allowed to enter}} the Temple Mount and pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times restrictions have prevented all men under 50 and women under 45 from entering, but married men over 45 are allowed. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced {{on the occasion of}} Friday prayers, other times they are {{over an extended period of}} time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons.|$|E
