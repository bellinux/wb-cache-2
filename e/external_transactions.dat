40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we present <b>External</b> <b>Transaction</b> Logic, a logic that extends Transaction logic {{with the ability}} to model and execute {{transactions}} requiring interactions with external entities, as e. g. external web-source, web-services or agents. Transactions are defined in a logic programming style by the composition of internal and external primitives. These primitives are incorporated in a quite general manner, as a parameter of the <b>External</b> <b>Transaction</b> Logic theory, allowing the specification of transactions integrating knowledge and actions from multiple sources and semantics. Since one has different control over internal and <b>external</b> domains, different <b>transaction</b> properties are ensured depending on where actions are executed. Namely, internal actions executed in a knowledge base that we fully control, follow the standard model of transactions, where the failure of the transaction leaves the knowledge unaffected. On the other hand, transactional properties over actions executed externally need to be relaxed, as it is impossible to roll back actions executed in a domain that is external. To deal with this, external actions can be defined along with compensating operations. If a transaction fails after executing some external action, then these compensations are executed in a backward order to achieve a relaxed model of atomicity. We provide a model theory for <b>External</b> <b>Transaction</b> Logic, {{that can be used to}} reason about the conditions of execution of transactions that require the issuing of both internal and external actions on abstract knowledge bases with potentially different state semantics. We also present here a corresponding proof theory (sound and complete w. r. t. the model theory) that provides means to execute such transactions in a top-down manner...|$|R

40|$|The article {{addresses}} {{the reasons for}} the domination of large-scale corporate farms in the Moscow oblast of Russia and concludes that high <b>external</b> <b>transaction</b> costs are likely to be an important determining factor. Over the nine year period studied, larger farms are shown to achieve higher performance. Increasing returns to scale, however, were not significant in explaining the superior performance of the larger farms. It is hypothesised that high <b>external</b> <b>transaction</b> costs due to lack of transparency in the milk market, typical of underdeveloped markets, give the larger farms a competitive advantage. Their search costs per unit of output are relatively low and they are able therefore to achieve higher farm-gate prices for milk as a result. The results confirm the dependence of the farm-gate milk price on farm size due to the presence of high transaction costs in the market of milk, the major output of the studied farms. The high performance farms were able to grow during the study period whereas the lower performing farms had limited growth capacity. A more competitive and transparent market environment along with improved infrastructure could lower transaction costs and entry barriers and provide opportunities for smaller scale corporate farms to compete more effectively.

40|$|In active {{database}} systems, rule processing {{occurs when}} an external transaction generates events. Certain rules are initially {{triggered by the}} events, and they are executed automatically when certain conditions are satisfied. Their execution can trigger other rules or the same rules, and so on-conceivably resulting in a finite set of triggered rules. The seemingly unpredictable activation of rules, however, produces two main problems: termination and confluence problems. So far, most research efforts to solve these problems have concentrated on compiletime rule analysis. In compile-time rule analysis, {{it is difficult to}} determine which rules will be executed and what events will occur. It is therefore necessary to solve those problems at run-time. This thesis introduces a new transaction management protocol that allows not only deterministic execution but also terminated execution of rules in active database systems. To solve the confluence problem, a strategy is introduced that eliminates the situation where different executions of rules in the finite set produce different results. This strategy is based on an assumption that there should only be one execution semantic for a given system of rules in the finite set. A unique execution semantic can be easily enforced by associating with each rule a priority that determines a global execution order. A property that execution of rules in the finite set is equivalent to execution of respective database transactions suggests a solution based on one of the transaction management techniques. The transaction management protocol enforces serializable executions of rules such that the respective serial execution order is consistent with an order determined by the rule priorities. To solve the termination problem, this thesis uses a directed graph called a rooted graph. The rooted graph has a set of ordered pairs, called edges, representing the trigger relationship between two rules. A n infinite cyclic execution is detected when the resulting rooted graph contains a cycle. This thesis suggests a solution to the question: what should be done when a transaction attempts to access a data object in a mode that has the potential to violate a given serial execution order? The solution is to replicate both data and processes. Replication of data is a well known technique that requires a multiversion concurrency control mechanism. Replication of process is achieved by transaction cloning. This thesis proposes two hybrid approaches to the construction of concurrency control algorithms for transactions in active database systems. 1. H(n,k) concurrency control algorithms for <b>external</b> <b>transactions</b> in active database systems. 2. H(l,m) concurrency control algorithms for respective transactions of rules in the finite set. The parameter n of H(n,k) determines the acceptable size of cascading abort of <b>external</b> <b>transactions</b> and the parameter k determines the total number of <b>external</b> <b>transactions</b> that execute concurrently with a particular external transaction. The parameter I of H(l,m) determines the maximum number of clone transactions of a rule transaction and the parameter m determines the maximum probability that the database state on which a command is executed is changed in the future by other commands. The two hybrid approaches have the ability to dynamically adjust the behaviour of concurrency control algorithms to changing environmental parameters. It is proved that for extreme values of parameters: as far as the concurrency control of <b>external</b> <b>transactions</b> is concerned, the H(n,k) algorithm reduces itself either to strict two-phase locking algorithm or serialization graph testing. as far as the concurrency control of respective transactions of rules is concerned, the H(l,m) algorithm reduces itself either to altruistic locking approach or to serialization graph testing...|$|E

In particular, we consider the creation of virtual organizations in which agents commit to certain cooperation efforts regulated by appropriate norms. The supervision of norm fulfillment {{is based on the}} notion of institutional reality, which is constructed by assigning powers to agents enacting institutional roles. Constitutive rules make a connection between the illocutions of those agents and institutional facts, certifying the occurrence of associated <b>external</b> <b>transactions.</b> Contract specification is based on conditional prescription of obligations.
