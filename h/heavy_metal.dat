But the main problem related with the use of RDF gasification processes is the <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> conversion. The objective of this study is to investigate the <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> conversion characteristics during RDF's pyrolysis and gasification process. Experiments were carried out by a two-stage reactor under a temperate range from 600 ̊C to 750 ̊C. The effect of oxygen presenting and catalyst using on <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> conversion was studied. The results showed that with the increase of temperature, the <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> migrate into tar and liquid products, leading to the decrease of the <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> residue in char. The residual of Cd in char are less than Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn. Moreover, the addition of oxygen makes more <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> fixed in char.

40|$|Brassinosteroids play a {{significant}} role in the amelioration of various abiotic and biotic stresses. In order to elaborate their roles in plants subjected to <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> stress, Chlorella vulgaris cultures treated with 10 − 8 M brassinolide (BL) were exposed to 10 − 6 – 10 − 4 M <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> (cadmium, lead and copper) application. Under <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> stress, the growth and chemical composition (chlorophyll, monosaccharides, and protein content) have been decreased during the first 48  h of cultivation. The inhibitory effect of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> on C. vulgaris cultures was arranged in the following order: copper > lead > cadmium. C. vulgaris cultures treated with BL in the absence or presence of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> showed no differences in the endogenous level of BL. On the other hand, treatment with <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> results in BL level very similar to that of control cell cultures. These results suggest that the activation of brassinosteroids biosynthesis, via an increase of endogenous BL, is not essential for the growth and development of C. vulgaris cells in response to <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> stress. Simultaneously, BL enhanced the content of indole- 3 -acetic acid, zeatin, and abscisic acid in cultures treated with <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> Levels per cell of chlorophylls, protein, and monosaccharides are all increased by BL treatment when compared to nontreated control cells. Application of BL to C. vulgaris cultures reduced the accumulation of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> stress on growth, prevented chlorophyll, monosaccharides, and protein loss, and increased phytochelatins content. The arrested growth of C. vulgaris cells treated with <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> was restored by the coapplication of BL. It suggested that BL overcame the inhibitory effect of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> From these results, it can be concluded that BL plays the positive role in the alleviation of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> stress...|$|R
40|$|Crop straw {{returning}} is {{an important}} measure for increasing soil carbon fixation and soil fertility in China, but it also may result in some risk of raising activity of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the soil. In {{order to understand the}} effects of different sources of crop straw on <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> activity in soil with different pollution levels, and to take appropriate measures to prevent the activation of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the soil, both pot and field experiments were carried out to study the effects of crop straw returning with lime on activity of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd in paddy soil. The experiments were carried out in the soils with both light and heavy pollution of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> In the pot experiment, three straws, including rice straw with heavy pollution of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> rice straw with light pollution of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> and rape straw with light pollution of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> were tested. Two dosages of lime(0 kg&# 183;hm - 2 and 750 kg&# 183;hm - 2) were applied. Field experiment had three treatments, ie., control without application of straw and lime, straw returning and straw returning + lime. Soil available <b>heavy</b> <b>metals,</b> accumulation of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in rice grain, and chemical forms of soil <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> were dynamical monitored. The results showed that crop straw returning increased significantly the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and water soluble <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in paddy soils at the early stage of experiment (in first 20 days). The increase in water soluble <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the soil with heavy pollution of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> was most obvious as compared with the control treatment. After 60 th day of the experiment, the effects of straw returning on the activity of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the soil decreased gradually with the time, and became no obvious. The concentrations of water soluble <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in the soil treated with rape straw was generally lower than that of rice straw, while those in the soil treated with heavy pollution of rice straw was higher than low pollution of rice straw. The results of both pot and field experiments showed that the accumulation of Cd in rice grains could be slightly increased by application of rice straw with heavy pollution. However, application rice straw or rape straw with slight pollution had little effects on the accumulation of Cd in rice grain. The effects of all three tested straws on the accumulation of Pb, Cu and Zn in rice grains were not obvious. The content of soil water soluble <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> and <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> accumulation in rice grain could be significantly reduced by the application of lime. It was suggested that the rice straw returning should be controlled in the field with heavy pollution of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> When returning straw to the field, it was better to cooperate with the application of lime...|$|R

An attempt was, therefore, made to isolate fungi from sites contaminated with <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> for higher tolerance and removal of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> from wastewater. Many fungal isolates tolerant to <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> like Pb, Cd, Cr and Ni were isolated from sewage, sludge and industrial effluents containing <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> There are various fungi (Aspergillus foetidus,Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Aspegillus awamori, Rhizopus sp., Aspergillus flavus, Trichoderma viride) which are used for removal of different metal. The majority of the fungal isolates were able to tolerate up to 400 ppm concentration of Co,Pb, Cd, Cr,Cu and Ni. The tolerant fungi were studied for removal of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> from liquid media at 50 ppm concentration.
