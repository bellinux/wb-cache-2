The inlet hydrogen sulphide concentration was about- 2600 ppm. A flat breakthrough curve showed that diffusion through the sulphide layer controlled the rate <b>of</b> sulphidization. The <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>utilization</b> varied between 5 and 11 %. Experimental data {{formed the basis}} of a kinetic evaluation with the fixed bed model and the unreacted core model. Rate constants, reaction orders, and effective diffusion constants were calculated. When chemical reaction controlled the rate, the order of reaction was between zero and unity. The rate of reaction increased with temperature. Effective diffusivities were of the order of 10 (- 5) m 2 s- 1, increasing slightly in the temperature range between 500 and 600 -degrees-C. The activation energy was determined as 54 kJ mol- 1, which corresponds to an unexpectedly strong temperature dependence of the diffusion-controlled reaction. The low <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>utilization,</b> and also the strong temperature dependence, are explained by sintering of the sulphidized zinc ferrite...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} in a post-Keynesian/Kaleckian {{model of}} growth and distribution a constraint on firms’ investment induced by increasing adjustment costs and/or limited financial resources.

Moreover, an increase in the saving propensity or a fall in wages do not always cause a reduction in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>utilization</b> – the so-called paradoxes of thrift and costs – as predicted by the standard post-Keynesian/Kaleckian analysis; and growth could be profit led.
