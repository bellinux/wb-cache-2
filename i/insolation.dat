5|$|Coma Berenices {{has seven}} known exoplanets. One, HD 108874 b, has Earth-like <b>insolation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{receives}} 174petawatts (PW) {{of incoming}} solar radiation (<b>insolation)</b> {{at the upper}} atmosphere. Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest is absorbed by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet. Most of the world's population live in areas with <b>insolation</b> levels of 150–300 watts/m², or 3.5–7.0 kWh/m² per day.|$|E
5|$|A high {{obliquity}} {{would probably}} result in {{dramatic changes in}} the climate and may destroy the planet's habitability. When the axial tilt of the Earth exceeds 54°, the yearly <b>insolation</b> at the equator is less than that at the poles. The planet could remain at an obliquity of 60° to 90° for periods as long as 10million years.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and World Energy Council {{published}} {{an estimate of}} the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as <b>insolation,</b> cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans. The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,575–49,837EJ per year (see table below).|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} a Milankovitch cycle {{in the range of}} 100,000 years, related to Earth's orbital eccentricity, its {{contribution}} to variation in <b>insolation</b> is much smaller than those of precession and obliquity. The 100,000-year-problem refers to the lack of an obvious explanation for the periodicity of ice ages at roughly 100,000 years for the past million years, but not before, when the dominant periodicity corresponded to 41,000 years.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 an {{extrasolar planet}} similar {{in size to}} Jupiter {{designated}} HD 28185 b was discovered in orbit around the star with a period of 1.04 years. Unlike many long-period extrasolar planets, it has a low orbital eccentricity. The planet experiences similar <b>insolation</b> to Earth, {{which has led to}} speculations about the possibilities for habitable moons. In addition, numerical simulations suggest that low-mass planets located in the gas giant's Trojan points would be stable for long periods. The planet's existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Program in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Planetary atmospheres are {{affected}} by the varying <b>insolation</b> or internal energy, leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes, (on Earth), planet-wide dust storms (on Mars), a greater-than-Earth-sized anticyclone on Jupiter (called the Great Red Spot), and holes in the atmosphere (on Neptune). At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.|$|E
5|$|String {{inverters}} {{are substantially}} lower in capacity, {{of the order}} of 10kW, and condition the output of a single array string. This is normally a whole, or part of, a row of solar arrays within the overall plant. String inverters can enhance the efficiency of solar parks, where different parts of the array are experiencing different levels of <b>insolation,</b> for example where arranged at different orientations, or closely packed to minimise site area.|$|E
5|$|The southwestern United States {{is one of}} the world's best {{areas for}} <b>insolation,</b> and the Mojave Desert {{receives}} up to twice the sunlight received in other regions of the country. This abundance of solar energy makes solar power plants a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy, produce virtually no emissions, and consume no fuel other than sunlight. Some groups are also encouraging more distributed generation, or rooftop solar.|$|E
5|$|The Chaco Low is a semi–permanent low {{pressure}} system situated {{east of the}} Andes that is approximately located between 20oS and 30oS during summer (displaced to the north in winter). It is stronger in the summer than in winter due {{to a combination of}} high <b>insolation,</b> dry surface conditions, and southward displacement of the South Atlantic and South Pacific High (this makes it difficult for cold fronts to enter at lower latitudes). The Chaco Low interacts with the South Atlantic High, generating a pressure gradient that draws moist air from the northeast to coastal and central regions of Argentina. It also forces easterly winds from the Amazon basin to move southward, which is reinforced by the funneling effect from both the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau. The Chaco Low brings large amounts of moisture that favour the development of convective thunderstorms during summer, reaching as far south as 35oS. This movement of air from the north owing to the interaction between the Chaco Low and the South Atlantic high is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low is at its strongest. These winds bring hot, humid tropical air from the north. Sustained and intense winds from the north are responsible for severe weather events such as heat waves and severe convection. During winter, the Chaco Low weakens as a result of lower <b>insolation.</b> This is partly responsible for the decrease in winter precipitation over much of Argentina (in addition to northward displacement of westerlies) due to a weaker transport of air masses from the tropics. This excludes areas south of 40oS where it is dominated by westerlies.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to <b>insolation,</b> or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in the Mojave Desert which supply power to the {{electricity}} grid. <b>Insolation</b> (solar radiation) in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Different {{climatic factors}} {{influence}} {{the climate of}} Buenos Aires. The semi–permanent South Atlantic High influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to {{the city in the}} form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high <b>insolation</b> in the summer months form a low pressure system called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the Pampas, Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting air mass – the cold, dry Pampero from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location results in a strong maritime influence, causing extreme temperatures (hot or cold) to be rare.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and <b>insolation</b> of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower <b>insolation,</b> leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E
5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced <b>insolation.</b> Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E
5|$|In general, La Niña {{events are}} {{associated}} with lower temperatures (particularly colder winters) in the Pampas. During winter, frosts are more common during La Niña events compared to El Niño events. This {{is due to a}} stronger southerly flow during La Niña events caused by a higher concentration of high pressure systems in the South Pacific and an increase in cyclonic activity (more low pressure systems) in the South Atlantic. This creates conditions that are favourable for bringing cold air from the south, particularly when there is a formation of a high pressure system over Patagonia (associated with the passage of a front) that is responsible for bringing cold air from the south. Thus, invasions of cold air from the south are more common during La Niña events. In contrast, warm spells in the Pampas and northern parts of the country are more intense and frequent during El Niño events. This is due to stronger westerly winds south of 40oS, leading to less frequent incursions of cold air from the south while enhancing winds from the north that bring in warm air. Although La Niña events lead to colder winters with more frequent incursions of cold air in both the north and central parts of the country, it leads to more frequent and intense warm spells in the last months of the year. In other regions, El Niño events lead to more frequent and intense warm spells in Northwest Argentina (during autumn), northeast Argentina (during spring) and central Argentina (during summer). Cold air anomalies arising from El Niño events are observed during spring and are the result of an increase in rainfall that lead to reductions in <b>insolation.</b> For the southern parts of the country, El Niño events {{are associated with}} more intense and frequent cold spells during the coldest months. In summer, El Niño events are associated with warmer summer temperatures in the southern parts of the country.|$|E
25|$|Earth is not homogeneous. Milankovitch did {{not relate}} Earth's ice ages {{to the total}} amount of solar {{radiation}} (<b>insolation)</b> reaching Earth but to the <b>insolation</b> striking 65°N in summer, due to the relative ease of heating the larger land masses of the northern hemisphere. Later studies have suggested that <b>insolation</b> hitting ice would simply be reflected away.|$|E
25|$|India's {{solar energy}} <b>insolation</b> is about 5,000 T kWh per year (i.e. ~ 600 TW), {{far more than}} its current total primary energy consumption. India's {{long-term}} solar potential could be unparalleled in the world because it has the ideal combination of both high solar <b>insolation</b> and a big potential consumer base density.|$|E
25|$|Global dimming, global {{reduction}} in ground <b>insolation,</b> {{due to the}} atmospheric injection of aerosols from various sources.|$|E
25|$|The current {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} tilt, by itself, will promote milder seasons (warmer winters and colder summers), {{as well as}} an overall cooling trend. Because most of the planet's snow and ice lies at high latitude, decreasing tilt may encourage the onset of an ice age for two reasons: There is less overall summer <b>insolation,</b> and also less <b>insolation</b> at higher latitudes, which melts less of the previous winter's snow and ice.|$|E
25|$|Dalton Minimum, 1790 to 1830, {{a period}} of {{prolonged}} solar minimum activity, resulting in Earth receiving lower <b>insolation</b> values.|$|E
25|$|Artifacts {{taken from}} the Earth have been studied to infer the cycles of past climate. A study of the {{chronology}} of Antarctic ice cores using oxygen-nitrogen ratios in air bubbles trapped in the ice, which appear to respond directly to the local <b>insolation,</b> concluded that the climatic response documented in the ice cores was driven by northern hemisphere <b>insolation</b> as proposed by the Milankovitch hypothesis. Analysis of deep-ocean cores and a seminal paper by Hays, Imbrie, and Shackleton provide additional validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis through physical artifacts.|$|E
25|$|Blending of arches and domes. The {{most visible}} feature of Byzantine churches {{is the absence}} of a formal cornice between the dome and its support. Instead, the {{supporting}} arcade blends directly into dome roof; tin roofing flows smoothly around the arches. Arches were designed for maximum <b>insolation</b> via wide window openings. A few designs (Sevastopol Cathedral, 1862–1888, Livadia church, 1872–1876) also had wooden window shutters with circular cutouts, as used in medieval Byzantium. In the 20th century this pattern was reproduced in stone (Kuntsevo church, 1911), actually reducing <b>insolation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over {{long time}} scales, ice sheet mass balance {{is governed by}} the amount of {{sunlight}} reaching the earth. This variation in sunlight reaching the earth, or <b>insolation,</b> over geologic time is in turn determined by the angle of the earth to the sun and shape of the Earth's orbit, as it is pulled on by neighboring planets; these variations occur in predictable patterns called Milankovitch cycles. Milankovitch cycles dominate climate on the glacial–interglacial timescale, but there exist variations in ice sheet extent that are not linked directly with <b>insolation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Geoengineering: {{planetary}} engineering applied {{specifically to}} Earth. It includes only those macroengineering concepts {{that deal with}} the alteration of some global parameter, such as the greenhouse effect, atmospheric composition, <b>insolation</b> or impact flux.|$|E
25|$|Per hectare per year, the biomass {{produced}} {{corresponds to}} 0.27 TJ. This {{is equivalent to}} 0.86 W per square meter. Assuming an average <b>insolation</b> of 225 W per square meter, the photosynthetic efficiency of sugar cane is 0.38%.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, further {{evidence}} was provided {{that changes in}} solar <b>insolation</b> provide the initial trigger for the earth to warm after an Ice Age, with secondary factors like increases in greenhouse gases accounting for {{the magnitude of the}} change.|$|E
25|$|For example, in Germany with {{electricity}} prices of 0.25 euro/kWh and <b>Insolation</b> of 900 kWh/kW one kWp will save 225 {{euro per year}} and with installation cost of 1700 euro/kWp means that the system will pay back in less than 7 years.|$|E
25|$|The surface {{temperature}} of Earth {{has been relatively}} constant through geologic time despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation (<b>insolation),</b> indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric albedo. This proposal {{is known as the}} Gaia hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Increased tilt {{increases}} the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in <b>insolation,</b> providing more solar radiation in each hemisphere's summer and less in winter. However, these effects are not uniform everywhere on the Earth's surface. Increased tilt {{increases the}} total annual solar radiation at higher latitudes, and decreases the total {{closer to the}} equator.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphogenetic}} {{movements of}} the PMCs are an autonomous cellular behavior. Experimentally grafting PMCs into heterotopic tissue does not prevent the cells from ingressing. In studies where PMCs are cultured in <b>insolation,</b> the cells were observed to gain affinity for fibronectin and simultaneously lose affinity for extraembryonic matrix, independent of the embryonic environment.|$|E
25|$|All the Kepler circumbinary {{planets are}} either close to or {{actually}} in the habitable zone. None of them are terrestrial planets, but large moons of such planets could be habitable. Because of the stellar binarity, the <b>insolation</b> received by the planet will likely be time-varying in a way quite unlike the regular sunlight Earth receives.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the orbital}} cycles, Milankovitch {{believed}} that obliquity {{had the greatest}} effect on climate, and that it did so by varying the summer <b>insolation</b> in northern high latitudes. Therefore, he deduced a 41,000-year period for ice ages. However, subsequent {{research has shown that}} ice age cycles of the Quaternary glaciation over the last million years have been at a 100,000-year period, which matches the eccentricity cycle.|$|E
25|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) is a photovoltaic {{technology that}} contrary to conventional flat-plate PV systems uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction (MJ) solar cells. In addition, CPV systems often use solar trackers {{and sometimes a}} cooling system to further increase their efficiency. Ongoing research and development is rapidly improving their competitiveness in the utility-scale segment and in areas of high solar <b>insolation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Sun's {{radiation}} is that {{arriving at the}} top of the atmosphere (TOA). As can be read from the table, radiation below 400nm, or ultraviolet, is about 12%, while that above 700nm, or infrared, starts at about the 49% point and so accounts for 51% of the total. Hence only 37% of the TOA <b>insolation</b> is visible to the human eye. The atmosphere shifts these percentages substantially in favor of visible light as it absorbs most of the ultraviolet and significant amounts of infrared.|$|E
