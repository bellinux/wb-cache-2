40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of structures is normally carried out through displacement <b>method</b> while the <b>force</b> <b>method</b> is considered {{as an alternative}} approach for this purpose and used on occasion. The generation of compatibility conditions (the transpose of self-stress matrix) {{is one of the}} major and complicated parts of any structural analysis using <b>force</b> <b>method.</b> In this paper, an efficient method is proposed for producing orthogonal self-stress matrix related to space truss structures with cyclic symmetry. This is actually performed by eigen-decomposition of a special matrix having the same null basis as in equilibrium matrix. Then, the advantages of the obtained compatibility conditions are demonstrated with respect to different formulations such as standard <b>force</b> <b>method,</b> eigen <b>force</b> <b>method</b> and integrated <b>force</b> <b>method.</b> Finally, the efficiency of the presented method is comprehensively compared with three well-known numerical methods and tested on a set of practical examples. The results indicate clearly the significant superiority of the proposed approach in terms of both computational time and the accuracy of the results...|$|R
40|$|The body <b>force</b> <b>method</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} methods to analyze bent or branched cracks. In particular, a more accurate solution of the stress intensity factor can be obtained by applying the resultant force boundary condition (resultant <b>force</b> <b>method).</b> However, the crack displacement of bent or branced cracks cannot be obtained continuously by the resultant <b>force</b> <b>method,</b> and it is necessary to divide a crack into very small elements to achieve high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new resultant <b>force</b> <b>method</b> to obtain continuous crack displacement of bent or branched cracks, which dramatically improves the accuracy of the solution. The effectiveness of this new method is illustrated by solving some typical crack problems. Moreover, simulation of crack propagation through grain boundaries is performed...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Few data {{exist on}} kidney {{dysfunction}} (KD) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) in {{acute coronary syndrome}} (ACS) patients treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and whether they impact on long-term outcome since most frequently patients with various degrees of KD are excluded. Study Design: Comparison of independent but concomitant arms of a randomized investigation on GPI. Place and Duration of Study: The Sant’ANna TIrofiban Safety study (SANTISS www. clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT 00566891) was an open-label investigator-initiated single centre registry at Sant’Anna Hospital, Catanzaro, during a 5 -year enrollment period. Methodology: We considered 726 ACS patients with PCI under either triple (aspirin, clopidogrel including high-dose tirofiban) or double (aspirin and clopidogrel) antiaggregating drugs (AAD). Serum creatinine levels, creatinine clearance (CrCl, using the Cockcroft-Gault formula) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, using both MDRD and CKD_EPI formulas) were used as continuous co-variables. Cox’s proportional hazards model tested the multivariable contribution of covariates all fitted simultaneously (<b>forced</b> <b>method)</b> in order to predict the incidence of 1 -year cumulative ischemic events (CIE). Results: There were 69 (9. 5 %) 1 -year CIE. Incidences were 5. 4, 9. 8 and 13. 4 % (P= 0. 012) in CrCl tertiles 1 (96 - 216 ml/min), 2 (73 - 95 ml/min) and 3 (15 - 72 ml/min), respectively. Compared to CrCl, the percentile distributions of eGFR, by MDRD or CKD_EPI formulas were similar: all were comparable and significant predictors multivariately (p< 0. 001) of long-term CIE. The presence of diabetes (hazard ratios, HRs 1. 84 - 1. 91), intra aortic balloon pump (HRs 3. 59 - 4. 03), and thrombolysis (a protective factor) by tenecteplase (HRs 0. 30 - 0. 30) were further significant risk factors. With highdose tirofiban there was a 20 % lower but not statistically different incidence of 1 -year CIE. Conclusion: KD assessed by CrCl or eGFR in ACS patients treated by PCI equally predicted and similarly impacted on 1 -year CIE, independent of the formula adopted for eGFR calculation {{and the presence of}} GPI with high-dose tirofiban...|$|E

The integrated <b>force</b> <b>method</b> produces accurate stress, displacement, and frequency results even for modest finite element models. This version of the <b>force</b> <b>method</b> should be developed as an alternative to the stiffness method because the latter method, which has been researched for the past several decades, may have entered its developmental plateau. Stress plays a primary role in the development of aerospace and other products, and its analysis is difficult.

The two integrated <b>force</b> <b>methods,</b> which bestow simultaneous emphasis on stress equilibrium and strain compatibility, yield accurate solutions with fewer elements in a model.

Substituting the solution into compatibility condition and boundary conditions, the governing equation expressed by dynamic tension is derived, which is named <b>force</b> <b>method</b> dynamic equation (FMDE).
