50|$|Robiquet has {{analysed}} {{the chemical}} byproducts {{that could be}} obtained {{from a variety of}} plants: asparagus, madder root, as already mentioned, with the important associated discoveries, and also others, which mostly helped in consolidating the existence of some molecules {{in a wide range of}} plants. Thus, in 1809, Robiquet extracts from liquorice root a sweetish matter which he dubs <b>glycyrrhizine,</b> from Glycirrhiza, the denomination of the genus to which belongs liquorice. He also obtained an oily fraction (0.8%), small quantities of a matter with properties of a gum, albuminic substances, tannins, starch, a yellowish dye, a fraction with bitter taste, and, as from asparagi, a fraction that can be crystallized and seemingly close to asparagin, which it will be indeed proven to be in 1828 by Plisson.|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the methods}} of {{determination}} of <b>Glycyrrhizine</b> in the roots of Liquorice are non - specific and relying on indirect methods. The results obtained from these methods are usually unreal and unreliable. In this paper <b>Glycyrrhizine</b> iv various Liquorice roots was estimated directly by HFLC without hydrolysing <b>Glycyrrhizine</b> to its aglycone. Hence the existing problems that considerably change results are eliminated. In this method, <b>Glycyrrhizine</b> was separated from other components of total extract using reverse phase high performance liquid chromathography {{and the results of}} determinations have been satisfactory and reproducible. The <b>Glycyrrhizine</b> content was 2. 15 - 5. 4 percent in the various liquorice roots. "nAlso suitable condition is reported for HPLC of Glycyrrhetic acid in hydrolyzed total extract. Therefore <b>Glycyrrhizine</b> was also determinated by indirect method. This method is based on hydrolysing <b>Glycyrrhizine</b> and estimating Glycyrrhetic acid. Results of direct method are compared with this method...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{effects of}} various amino acids an d medical drugs upon urinary protective colloids {{has been investigated}} by three differing procedures : 1) addition of various substances in vitro, 2) administration of various substances to the patients with urolithiasis, 3) salts prezipitated experiment. 1) In this experim ent, both Ogawa's method and Yamazoe's method were utilized as a test for protective activity of urinary colloids. Triptophan, cystine and 1 -methionin increased the effect of urinary protective colloids both in Ogawa's method and Yamazoe's method in vitro. On the other hand, arginine hydrochloride, isoleutine, lysin and glutamic acid increased the protective colloidal effect only in Yamazoe's method in vitro. Polytamin, mastigen B 12, rutin, neo-strong Minophagen C and its co n stituent components (<b>glycyrrhizine,</b> glycyrrhezic acid and glucose cysteine) incresed the protective colloidal effect both in Yamazoe's method and Ogawa's method in vitro. On the other hand, methio-mastigen B 12 revealed the effect only in Ogawa's method, and chondroitin sulfate revealed the effect only in Yamazoe's method. 2) As a clinical experiment, neo-s t r ong Minophagen C, hyaluronidase and chondroitin sulfate {{were given to the}} patients with urolithiasis. It was found that neo-strong Minophagen C and chondroitin sulfate increased the protective colloidal effect in urine, and hyaluronidase did not show an obvious increasing effect. It is obscure, however, that such an increasing effect of chondroitin sulfate is due to the chondroitin sulfate itself or some unknown substance in the metabolic process of chondroitin sulfate. The protective effect of neo-strong Minophagen C seems to be a direct protection for urinary salts, and <b>glycyrrhizine</b> particularly glycyrrhezic acid, above all other constituent elements of neostrong Minophagen C, seems most effective. 3) From the results of salt p rezipitated experiment, electrodes were inserted into urine, with or without addition of polytamin, neo-strong Minophagen C and its constituent components and chondroitin sulfate, it was recognized that the amount of prezipitated salts were decreased by the addition of these substances. Also in this experiment, the amount of prezipitated salts were increased with addition of salts or colon bacilli...|$|E
