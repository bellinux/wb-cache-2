Typically, a Miniature Poodle will be the smallest dog of all in the field as it weighs less than 25 lbs or about 10 kg: this is even less than a Boykin Spaniel, the former smallest dog, which weighs closer to 35 lbs, or 16 kg. [...] However, hunters in the USA and Canada have found them very useful for woodcock, chukar, mallards, and smaller ducks like the green-winged teal [...] and bufflehead: their tiny size is an asset in getting at corners and brush that comparatively more massive retrievers cannot reach or where bramble is too thick for cocker spaniels to access.|$|E

50|$|A <b>hunt</b> <b>test</b> is {{an event}} at which the natural ability and {{training}} of gun dogs are evaluated against a written standard. Each dog that meets this standard earns a pass. This is unlike a field trial in which dog/handler teams compete against one another with only one dog being declared the winner. Hunt tests are organized by the American Kennel Club (AKC), the North American Hunting Retriever Association (NAHRA), the United Kennel Club (UKC) {{under the auspices of}} the Hunting Retriever Club (HRC), and the Société Centrale Canine (SCC).|$|E

5|$|The breed {{was made}} the state dog of Wisconsin in 1985. The American Water Spaniel remains a rare breed. During 1998 only 233 puppies were {{registered}} with the AKC, with an estimated 3,000 dogs in existence mostly around the Midwestern United States, in particular in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. In 2010, the breed was ranked 143rd most popular breed in the United States, out of 167 breeds. This is a decrease since 2000, when the breed was ranked 125th. The dogs are not classified specifically as either retrievers or as spaniels and so may not compete in AKC field trials, but may compete in AKC <b>hunt</b> <b>tests</b> (spaniel and retriever <b>tests)</b> and retriever <b>hunting</b> <b>tests</b> sponsored by the AWSC, the breed club in the United States. The American Water Spaniel Field Association {{was set up in}} 1993 by breed enthusiasts supporting AKC Spaniel classification and looking to provide field training opportunities to owners of the breed. In a vote held of members of the AWSC in 1999, they chose to keep the breed unclassified.|$|R

50|$|The NAHRA awards {{the titles}} Started Hunting Retriever (SR), Working Retriever (WR), Master Hunting Retriever (MHR), and Grand Master Hunting Retriever (GMHR). The {{standard}} of {{training for the}} higher levels of NAHRA <b>hunt</b> <b>test</b> require a more advanced degree of training than those of AKC hunt tests. These simulate actual hunting by testing for the following skill sets. Quartering, trailing a crippled duck, and sit to flush. NAHRA tests are primarily for nonslip retrievers, although many spaniel and versatile breeds may compete. Poodles, and Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers(NSDTR) are often found on the NAHRA scene.|$|E
50|$|Today, this breed is {{experiencing}} a resurgence in usage as a working and hunting dog. Dogs from working lines are noticeably distinct in appearance. As {{is the case with}} the English Springer Spaniel, the working type has been bred exclusively to perform in the field as a hunting companion. Their coat is shorter and ears less pendulous than the show-bred type. Although registered as the same breed, the two strains have diverged significantly enough that they are rarely crossed. The dogs that have dominated the <b>hunt</b> <b>test,</b> field trial and hunting scene in the United States are field-bred dogs from recently imported English lines. Working-dog lines often have physical characteristics that would prevent them from winning in the show ring. This is a result of selecting for different traits than those selected by show breeders. The longer coat and ears, selected for the show ring, are an impediment in the field. Cuban authorities train and use English Cocker Spaniels as sniffer dogs to check for drugs or food products in passengers' baggage at Cuban airports.|$|E
50|$|The UKC, in {{conjunction}} with <b>hunt</b> <b>test</b> events held under the organizational auspices of the Hunting Retriever Club Inc. (HRC) and its affiliated regional clubs, awards the titles of; Started Hunting Retriever (SHR), Hunting Retriever (HR), Hunting Retriever Champion (HRCH) and Grand Hunting Retriever Champion (GRHRC). There is also an Upland Hunter (UH) title awarded to dogs that pass a separate and distinct upland hunting test. To gain these titles there are four levels of testing where dogs earn points toward these specific titles. Each of these tests are of increasing difficulty and require increasing refinement in skill level that a hunting retriever must demonstrate while under judgment. These test levels are the; Started, Seasoned and Finished tests which are offered by regional HRC clubs. The final and most difficult level of test is called the “Grand” which is held twice a year by the HRC Inc. where all dogs that have previously earned the title of HRCH can be tested for the GRHRC title. As mentioned previously there is a separate upland hunter test that is also offered by local HRC clubs. These titles, once earned, are used as a prefix to the dogs registered name in the UKC.|$|E

25|$|The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a {{versatile}} breed competing in field trials, <b>hunt</b> <b>tests,</b> conformation, obedience, agility and tracking, yet remains true to its roots as a hunting dog of great stamina and ability. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is an intelligent breed and learns {{at a high}} speed. Historically considered stubborn and difficult to train, many trainers thought this breed required more physical discipline than other retriever breeds. Some trainers now recommend that the Chesapeake Bay Retriever owner use consistent, daily obedience training with play time before and after to keep the dog wanting to work {{with little or no}} physical discipline required.|$|R

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported {{our efforts to}} minimize postgastrectomy symptoms in two patients with benign disease who underwent resection {{of the head of}} the pancreas and the duodenum. In these cases the pylorus and first portion of the duodenum were preserved during pancreaticoduodenectomy. Our experience has now been extended to encompass 18 patients, eight of whom were available for comprehensive evaluation an average of six months postoperation. These studies have attempted to differentiate malabsorption of pancreatic insufficiency from possible gastrointestinal dysfunction of the new alimentary connection. Pancreatic insufficiency was evaluated by a 72 -hour stool collection and radioactive trioctanoate (RATO) test. Gastrointestinal absorption was evaluated by D-xylose excretion and the Schilling test, as well as serum vitamin. A, vitamin B- 12, carotene, folate, iron, and total iron binding capacity. Gastrointestinal secretion and motility were assessed by using pyloric fluoroscopy, gastric barium emptying, the <b>Hunt</b> <b>test,</b> and gastric acid analysis. Finally, a questionnaire regarding clinical symptoms of postgastrectomy syndromes and malabsorption was answered. Although every patient exhibited marked pancreatic insufficiency by laboratory tests, 88 % described normal formed bowel movements, and weight loss was claimed by only 25 %. Other test findings were generally normal. While the follow-up period has been limited to three years, the current data demonstrate that gastrointestinal function subsequent to preservation of the pylorus has not thus far predisposed to postgastrectomy syndromes or marginal ulcers. All of the patients required intensive pancreatic enzyme replacement...|$|E
