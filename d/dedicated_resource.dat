40|$|This {{paper is}} proposing a new {{platform}} for implementing services in future service oriented architectures. The basic premise of our proposal {{is that by}} combining large volume of uncontracted resources with small clusters of <b>dedicated</b> <b>resources,</b> we can dramatically {{reduce the amount of}} <b>dedicated</b> <b>resources</b> while the goodput provided by the overall system remains at a high level. This paper presents particular strategies for implementing this idea for a particular class of applications. We performed very detailed simulations on synthetic and real traces to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategies. Our findings on compute-intensive applications show that preemptive reallocation of resources is necessary for assured services. The proposed preemption based scheduling heuristic can significantly improve utilization of the <b>dedicated</b> <b>resources</b> by opportunistically offloading the peak loads on uncontracted resources, while keeping the service quality virtually unaffected...|$|R

While such tools were developed targeting ASIC technologies, HLS currently draws wide interest for FPGA designers. However with most of HLS techniques, traditional resource sharing models are very inaccurate for FPGAs: for example, multiplexers can be very expensive with such technologies. Resource usage optimizations and <b>dedicated</b> <b>resource</b> binding have to be applied. In this paper a HLS process which takes care of data-width and combines scheduling and binding to carefully take into account interconnect cost is presented.

Moreover, once a collision is detected, the <b>dedicated</b> <b>resource</b> is allocated to the next transmission and so the collision that may occur again is resolved. We investigate some implementation issues for the practicality of CSMA/CR and compare it with the typical distributed MAC protocols.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case for}} exploiting the synergy of dedicated and opportunistic network resources in a distributed hosting platform for data stream processing applications. Our previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of combining <b>dedicated</b> reliable <b>resources</b> with opportunistic resources in case of high-throughput computing applications, where timely allocation of the processing units is the primary concern. Since distributed stream processing applications demand large volume of data transmission between the processing sites at a consistent rate, adequate control over the network resources is important here to assure {{a steady flow of}} processing. In this paper, we propose a system model for the hybrid hosting platform where stream processing servers installed at distributed sites are interconnected with a combination of dedicated links and public Internet. Decentralized algorithms have been developed for allocation of the two classes of network resources among the competing tasks with an objective towards higher task throughput and better utilization of expensive <b>dedicated</b> <b>resources.</b> Results from extensive simulation study show that with proper management, systems exploiting the synergy of <b>dedicated</b> and opportunistic <b>resources</b> yield considerably higher task throughput and thus, higher return on investment over the systems solely using expensive <b>dedicated</b> <b>resources.</b> ...|$|R

While the COTS standard IEEE 1394 adequately supports power management, high performance and scalability, its topological criteria impose restrictions on fault tolerance realization. To circumvent the difficulties, we derive a "stack-tree" topology that not only complies with the IEEE 1394 standard but also facilitates fault tolerance realization in a spaceborne system with limited <b>dedicated</b> <b>resource</b> redundancies. Moreover, by exploiting pertinent standard features of the 1394 interface which are not purposely designed for fault tolerance, we devise a comprehensive set of fault detection mechanisms to support the fault-tolerant bus architecture...|$|E
