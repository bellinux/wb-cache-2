5|$|Allergic symptoms, {{including}} rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who {{come into contact with}} guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig <b>dander.</b> People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Mup {{genes from}} other mammals also encode {{allergenic}} proteins, for example Feld4 is primarily {{produced in the}} submandibular salivary gland and is deposited onto <b>dander</b> as the cat grooms itself. A study found that 63% of cat allergic people have antibodies against the protein. Most had higher titres of antibodies against Feld4 than against Feld1, another prominent cat allergen. Likewise, Equc1 (Equus caballus allergen 1) is the protein product of a horse Mup gene that {{is found in the}} liver, sublingual and submaxillary salivary glands. It is responsible for about 80% of the antibody response in patients who are chronically exposed to horse allergens.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris {{produces}} an apocrine secretion on scent glands near their elbow (brachial glands). This clear liquid, when mixed with its saliva, creates a volatile, noxious toxin. When startled, the slow loris licks its brachial glands and applies the secretion to its heads. The oily secretion contains a complex mixture of volatile and semi-volatile components; one chemical analysis indicated over 200 components were present. One {{of the components}} {{is a member of}} the secretoglobin family of proteins, and similar to an allergenic protein found in cat <b>dander.</b> The similarity between the brachial gland secretions and domestic cat allergens may account for anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other white}} conspirators' punishments {{were far more}} lenient than that of William Allen. John Igneshias was given a one hundred dollar fine and three months in prison, as was Jacob <b>Danders.</b> Igneshias {{was found guilty of}} inciting slaves to insurrection, but <b>Danders</b> was charged simply for saying that he [...] "disliked {{everything}} in Charleston, but the Negroes and the sailors." [...] <b>Danders</b> had said this publicly after the plot had been revealed; city officials thought his comment suspicious. <b>Danders</b> was found guilty for showing sympathy to the slaves who had been caught trying to support the conspiracy. The final white defendant, Andrew S. Rhodes, received a sentence of six months and a five hundred dollar fine although there was less evidence against him {{than any of the other}} whites.|$|R

25|$|Poodles {{are often}} cited as a hypoallergenic dog breed. Their {{individual}} hair follicles have an active growth period that is longer than that of many other breeds of dogs; combined with the tightly curled coat, which slows the loss of <b>dander</b> and dead hair by trapping it in the curls, an individual poodle may release less <b>dander</b> and hair into the environment. In addition, most poodles are frequently brushed and bathed to keep them looking their best; this not only removes hair and <b>dander,</b> but also controls the other potent allergen, saliva.|$|E
25|$|The word hypoallergenic, when {{referring}} to a dog, is also a misconception; all dogs shed. Poodles shed hair in minimal amounts, and also release <b>dander,</b> but are not as likely to trigger allergies as much as many other breeds. Additionally, poodle maintenance must include some amount of regular shaving, which releases hair dust in the air.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{sources of}} air {{pollution}} are also found indoors, as gases and airborne particulates. Pets produce <b>dander,</b> people produce dust from minute skin flakes and decomposed hair, dust mites in bedding, carpeting and furniture produce enzymes and micrometre-sized fecal droppings, inhabitants emit methane, mold forms on walls and generates mycotoxins and spores, air conditioning systems can incubate Legionnaires' disease and mold, and houseplants, soil and surrounding gardens can produce pollen, dust, and mold. Indoors, the lack of air circulation allows these airborne pollutants to accumulate more than they would otherwise occur in nature.|$|E

25|$|These {{biological}} chemicals {{can arise}} from {{a host of}} means, {{but there are two}} common classes: (a) moisture induced growth of mold colonies and (b) natural substances released into the air such as animal <b>dander</b> and plant pollen. Mold is always associated with moisture, and its growth can be inhibited by keeping humidity levels below 50%. Moisture buildup inside buildings may arise from water penetrating compromised areas of the building envelope or skin, from plumbing leaks, from condensation due to improper ventilation, or from ground moisture penetrating a building part. Even something as simple as drying clothes indoors on radiators can increase the risk of exposure to (amongst other things) Aspergillus - a highly dangerous mould that can be fatal for asthma sufferers and the elderly. In areas where cellulosic materials (paper and wood, including drywall) become moist and fail to dry within 48 hours, mold mildew can propagate and release allergenic spores into the air.|$|E
500|$|According to folklore, brachial gland {{secretions}} {{are generally}} thought to contain venom because of apparent anaphylactic reactions by humans following their bites. Slow lorises can indeed inflict painful bites. Animal dealers in Southeast Asia keep tanks of water nearby {{so that in}} case of a bite, they can submerge both their arm and the slow loris to make the animal let go. The secretion from the brachial gland of captive slow lorises is similar to the allergen in cat <b>dander,</b> hence the secretions may merely elicit an allergic reaction, not toxicosis. Loris bites cause a painful swelling, [...] and the single case of human death reported in the scientific literature was believed to have resulted from anaphylactic shock. However, although the toxin is only produced when the brachial secretion and saliva are mixed, both the secretion and saliva may have unique chemical properties and may act separately. Furthermore, secondary toxins may be introduced from the consumption of wild food, augmenting the toxicity. The combined brachial secretion and saliva of recently captured wild lorises was shown to contain batrachotoxins, which were not found in slow lorises held in captivity for more than a year.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} test {{the validity of the}} skin-prick test (SPT) with eleven common allergens (Lofarma series proposed by Italian National Research Council for epidemiological studies) as a method for predicting the presence of specific antibodies in serum. The relationship between SPT, evaluated by two different methods (MWD = mean weal diameter, AHWR = allergen histamine weal ratio), and specific IgE levels (RAST) has been investigated in 101 patients tested consecutively for suspected allergic disease. Sensitivity, specificity and overall efficiency were assessed for different criteria of SPT positivity ({{greater than or equal to}} 4 mm or greater than or equal to 5 mm using MWD; ++ or using AHWR). For pollens and moulds, a weal diameter greater than or equal to 5 mm gave better results than 4 mm, whereas for mites a MWD greater than or equal to 4 mm showed a better sensitivity and overall efficiency than 5 mm. <b>Danders</b> showed low sensitivity when either 5 or 4 mm criterion was considered. AHWR evaluation gave no better results, except for animal <b>danders.</b> Correlation coefficients between weal size and RAST class showed a good relationship for mites and pollens using both methods of SPT evaluation; a moderate relationship was observed with MWD criterion for moulds and with AHWR for <b>danders.</b> We conclude that a weal diameter greater than or equal to 5 mm can be assumed to to predict RAST positivity for pollens and moulds, and for mites, a weal greater than or equal to 4 mm can be a more accurate criterion.

2500|$|Although hair, <b>dander,</b> and saliva can be minimized, {{they are}} still present and can stick to [...] "clothes and the carpets and {{furnishings}} in your home"; inhaling them, or being licked by the dog, can trigger a reaction in a sensitive person.

2500|$|The lack of hair {{leads to}} a {{reputation}} for being clean, for being easy to wash with a sponge, and for a natural lack of fleas or other parasites. They also do not cause typical allergic reactions to dog-sensitive humans because they lack the normal dog <b>dander.</b> [...] Despite this, the dog needs care, but in another way. The skin should be washed {{from time to time to}} remove dirt and prevent clogging of pores. Baby cleaners are a good choice provided that they do not contain lanolin. Some dogs are prone to have acne or at least blackheads. The skin sometimes becomes too dry and can then be treated with moisturizing cream. Again, baby lotion without lanolin is a good product choice to soften and moisturize cleansed skin. [...] The dogs themselves seem to prefer olive, vegetable or coconut oil, possibly because of the perfumes and other chemicals found in commercial moisturizing creams.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe further {{course of}} asthma severity, lung function, {{bronchial}} hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to cold air challenge (CACh), clinical allergies and allergic sensitization in young middle adulthood was studied in {{a cohort of}} 55 subjects with childhood asthma. All subjects (27 females) have attended all five previous and the current follow-up visit, undertaken at {{a mean age of}} 35 years. Twelve subjects (22 %) reported no current asthma, 28 (51 %) mild/intermittent, and 15 (27 %) moderate/severe asthma. Asthma severity changed little in the individual subjects over the last 5 -year period. Females continued to have higher asthma severity scores than the males, but the previously noted lower resting and post-bronchodilator % predicted FEV 1 in females was not confirmed now. Pathological BHR to CACh tended to be more common among the males. Forty-four subjects were still allergic to animal <b>danders</b> and 35 to pollens. Sensitization rates (skin prick test or RAST) were similar to those recorded 5 years earlier and there was no clear evidence of tolerance developing. Five subjects have never shown evidence of allergy or sensitization. The extent of sensitization to animal <b>danders</b> showed statistically significant relationships to asthma severity and BHR to CACh.
