5|$|After King Richard {{went to the}} Holy Land on the Third Crusade, Nonant {{supported}} the efforts of Prince John, King Richard's brother, to seize power in England. Nonant joined with John in trying to wrest control of the castles of Tickhill and Nottingham from William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who had been named justiciar and chancellor during Richard's absence. It was probably Nonant that was responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> at Loddon Bridge on 5 October 1191 that ended in the deposition of Longchamp from office. Nonant supported John's side throughout the time that Richard was on Crusade and in captivity, and was tried with John after Richard's return to England in 1194. Nonant was only restored to royal favour in 1195 after the payment of a fine of 5000 marks. The bishop lost his three sheriffdoms, and retired to Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{was scheduled}} to take up to 133 days, although the actual filming took 128. Filming began on 7 November 2011 in and around London, with the cinematographer Roger Deakins using Arri Alexa digital cameras to shoot the entire film. Scenes were shot in London Underground stations, Smithfield car park in West Smithfield, the National Gallery, Southwark, Whitehall, Parliament Square, Charing Cross station the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, Cadogan Square and Tower Hill. St Bartholomew's Hospital {{was used as the}} filming location for the scene in which Bond enters MI6's underground headquarters, while the Old Vic Tunnels underneath Waterloo Station in London served as the MI6 training grounds. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> between Q and Bond, production worked during the National Gallery's closing hours at night. The Department of Energy and Climate Change was used in the scene when Bond stood on the roof {{near the end of the}} film. The Vauxhall Bridge and Millbank was closed to traffic for filming the explosion at the MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross. Unlike The World Is Not Enough, which also featured an explosion at the building‚Äîwhich was filmed at a large-scale replica‚Äîthe explosion in Skyfall was added digitally in post-production. Shooting of the finale was planned to take place at Duntrune Castle in Argyll, but was cancelled shortly after filming began. Glencoe was instead chosen for filming of these scenes. Although supposedly based in Scotland, Bond's family home of Skyfall was constructed on Hankley Common in Surrey using plywood and plaster to build a full-scale model of the building.|$|E
5|$|Sainsbury's scores dipped {{again for}} Somerset in 1888; his highest total {{for the county}} was an unbeaten 42 against the MCC. In contrast, in a match played for the MCC, Sainsbury struck his highest total for the side, scoring 180runs against Wiltshire at Lord's. Somerset were rated as {{the best of the}} second-class {{counties}} in both 1887 and 1888, but at the club's annual general meeting, a long discussion took place regarding the captaincy of the club. Sainsbury was unable to be present <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>meeting,</b> but had sent a letter advising that if he was removed as captain, he did not feel he could play for the county any more. His letter was not well received at the meeting, and it was decided to replace him as captain with another player who lived closer to Taunton, and was able to play more of the county matches, as Sainsbury had missed a number during 1888. Roe was selected as his replacement, with Hewett as vice-captain. A vote of thanks was given to Sainsbury for his service to the county club.|$|E
