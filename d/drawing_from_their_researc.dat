40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if technological advancements have progressed enough to make a man-portable satellite laser communications system feasible. To determine this feasibility three objectives were accomplished: an end-to-end system analysis on the communications link; evaluation of atmospheric effects; and evaluation of semi-conductor lasers as the laser source. Baseline satellite communication systems were analyzed for both conventional radio frequency systems and a laser communication system. Modifications to the laser communications system were explored, and found to be feasible for some applications. Atmospheric effects were explored and are a major contributor to system degradation. Semiconductor laser sources were evaluated and are currently useful for some satellite laser communication applications. I received an enormous amount of help from numerous people. I am deeply indebted to both my faculty advisors, Capt. M. C. Roggemann and Dr. B. M. Welsh for their undying patience and guidance.
