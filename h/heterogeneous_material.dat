25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>material.</b> SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase. The Ca-bearing minerals anorthite, gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.|$|E

Currently, {{tearing resistance}} of <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>materials</b> is determined by standards developed for homogeneous materials. The fracture behaviour of <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>materials</b> differs from fracture behaviour of homogeneous materials. Thus standards developed for homogeneous materials are not necessary directly applicable to <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>materials.</b> To develop a standard for <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>materials</b> {{the current level of}} knowledge of fracture behaviour in heterogeneous specimens needs to be increased. To enhance the knowledge of fracture in <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>materials</b> tearing resistance of 10 × 10 × 55 mm 3 and 10 × 20 × 100 mm 3 single edge bend (SE(B)) specimens extracted from a NPP ferrite-austenite DMW were measured. The specimens were extracted at three different crack locations in a region close to the fusion line between ferritic steel and weld metal of the DMW. As tearing resistance curves of the two specimen geometries are compared toughness and scatter varies, which can be explained by differing crack location with respect to the fusion line. However, the effect of crack location on tearing resistance was not microstructurally quantified, but the qualitative analysis of crack location done in this work implies that a standard developed for <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>materials</b> shall contain guidelines on characterisation of crack location...|$|R

6000|$|It {{was many}} years after this that a middle-aged man, of {{somewhat}} threadbare appearance and restricted travelling conveniences, was seen carefully tying his horse at the outer enclosure of an elegant mansion {{in the town of}} ----, in one of our Western States; which being done, he eyed the house rather inquisitively, as people sometimes do when they are doubtful as to the question of entering or not entering. The house belonged to George Lennox, Esq., a lawyer reputed to be doing a more extensive business than any other in the state, and the threadbare gentleman who plies the knocker at the front door is the Reverend Mr. Stanton, a name widely spread in the ecclesiastical circles of the land. The door opens, and the old college acquaintances meet with a cordial grasp of the hand, and Mr. Stanton soon finds himself pressed to the most comfortable accommodations in the warm parlor of his friend; and even the slight uneasiness which the wisest are not always exempt from, when conscious of a little shabbiness in exterior, was entirely dissipated by the evident cordiality of his reception. Since the conversation we have alluded to, the two friends pursued their separate courses with but few opportunities of personal intercourse. In the true zeal of the missionary, James Stanton had thrown himself into the field, where it seemed hardest and darkest, and where labor seemed most needed. In neighborhoods without churches, without school houses, without settled roads, among a population of disorganized and <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>material,</b> he had exhorted from house to house, labored individually with one after another, till he had, in place after place, brought together the elements of a Christian church. Far from all ordinances, means of grace, or Christian brotherhood, or coöperation, he had seemed to himself to be merely the lonely, solitary [...] "voice of one crying in the wilderness," [...] as unassisted, and, to human view, as powerless. With poverty, and cold, and physical fatigue he had daily been familiar; and where no vehicle could penetrate the miry depths of the forest, where it was impracticable even to guide a horse, he had walked miles and miles, through mud and rain, to preach. With a wife in delicate health, and a young and growing family, he had more than once seen the year when fifty dollars was the whole amount of money that had passed through his hands; and the whole of the rest of his support had come in disconnected contributions from one and another of his people. He had lived without books, without newspapers, except as he had found them by chance snatches here and there,[1] and felt, as one so circumstanced only can feel, the difficulty of maintaining intellectual vigor and energy in default of all those stimulants to which cultivated minds in more favorable circumstances are so much indebted. At the time that he is now introduced to the reader, he had been recently made pastor {{in one of the most}} important settlements in the state, and among those who, so far as worldly circumstances were concerned, were able to afford him a competent support. But among communities like those at the west, settled for expressly money-making purposes, and by those who have for years been taught the lesson to save, and have scarcely begun to feel the duty to give, a minister, however laborious, however eloquent and successful, may often feel the most serious embarrassments of poverty. Too often is his salary regarded as a charity which may be given or retrenched to suit every emergency of the times, and his family expenditures watched with a jealous and censorious eye.|$|E

50|$|Given the (linear and/or nonlinear) {{material}} {{properties of the}} constituents, one important goal of micromechanics of materials consists of predicting {{the response of the}} <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>material</b> {{on the basis of the}} geometries and properties of the individual phases, a task known as homogenization. The benefit of homogenization is that the behavior of a <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>material</b> can be determined without resorting to testing it. Such tests may be expensive and involve a large number of permutations (e.g., in the case of composites: constituent material combinations; fiber and particle volume fractions; fiber and particle arrangements; and processing histories). Furthermore, continuum micromechanics can predict the full multi-axial properties and responses of inhomogeneous materials, which are often anisotropic. Such properties are often difficult to measure experimentally, but knowing what they are is a requirement, e.g., for structural analysis involving composites. To rely on micromechanics, the particular micromechanics theory must be validated through comparison to experimental data.|$|E
