5000|$|When {{asked in}} 2007 how well Reality Bites had aged, Janeane Garofalo replied, [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more to people younger than me. I {{was not the}} target audience. I was 29 playing a 21-year-old, so I don't think I {{understand}} why younger people like it." ...|$|R
500|$|... "You Already Know What You Are" [...] {{is about}} {{negative}} people and music critics, and doing {{whatever you want}} no matter what others say. The song's title was a saying from {{a friend of the}} band. The title for [...] "Another Song About the Weekend" [...] is a reference to Secret Lives of the Freemasons's album Weekend Warriors (2008), while the lyrics are about [...] "a sick cycle" [...] of [...] "life on the road [...] Every time you're gone, you miss home and when you get home, you miss the road". [...] "If <b>It</b> <b>Means</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>to</b> You" [...] had been written {{over the course of a}} year, and McKinnon said he wrote it about himself. McKinnon described the song as a [...] "great way to end" [...] the album, describing it as one of their [...] "biggest songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's last match {{before the}} final was against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup, which they won 6–1. Despite the margin of victory, Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was adamant that the result meant nothing {{in regards to the}} final: [...] "Defeating Brighton has got us to the next round, but it doesn't really help us in the Carling Cup, we've got a cup final but we won't get carried away." [...] Despite missing the match against Brighton, Dalglish was {{confident}} that Daniel Agger and Craig Bellamy would be fit for the final. Going into the match Liverpool had not won a trophy since they beat West Ham United in the 2006 FA Cup Final. Dalglish stated that victory: [...] "means a lot to me, more importantly <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> {{a lot of people who}} have had to endure a few years when we've not been [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} James Christopher Monger said [...] "The Downfall of Us All" [...] {{would gain}} an extra [...] "life in countless montages on MTV reality shows and 30-second cola commercials". Monger {{said that the}} album consisted [...] "of perfectly executed and fairly standard clean vocal post-hardcore emo-pop" [...] which shows the [...] "limitations of the genre". Monger called the backing vocals [...] "exciting at first", but felt that they [...] "eventually dissolve into the waves of distortion mid-album", becoming an [...] "audio equivalent of an energy drink crash". The final track, [...] "If <b>It</b> <b>Means</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>to</b> You", as Monger noted, {{was different from the}} preceding tracks, as they were [...] "deafening, ultimately forgettable, over-compressed slabs of twentysomething angst". Sputnikmusic's John Hanson said the album was an [...] "incredibly derivative and plodding record" [...] that was filled with [...] "laughable moments". He also noted the band [...] "haven't seemed to progress that basic combination of ideas" [...] in combining pop-punk and metalcore, and that the intro to [...] "The Downfall of Us All" [...] is [...] "just one example of embarrassing decisions".|$|E

2500|$|Of the match, Nixon said, [...] "that was {{an amazing}} game of cricket. There was some {{tremendous}} batting from West Indies. We had to do something, we'd all talked about Duncan Fletcher and <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> for him. The lads paced the game so well. Michael Vaughan played beautifully, Kevin Pietersen came in and played magnificently and then the Leicestershire partnership finished it off." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lyrically, Banks sings {{about her}} self-love and self-hate. It {{was the last}} song she wrote for the album. [...] "There's so many {{meanings}} to it", {{she said of the}} song. [...] "It could be like, 'I fuck with myself', like, 'I mess with myself more than anybody else.' It could be, 'I fuck with myself', kind of like, 'I'm feeling myself.' <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of different things that I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people can relate to." ...|$|R
500|$|Homesick was {{produced}} by Gilbert, and was mixed by Adam Dutkiewicz of Killswitch Engage, with mixing taking place in December 2008, at Zing Studios. Mastering took place at West West Side Studios, by Alan Douches. The album features three guesting vocalists: Mike Hranica of The Devil Wears Prada on [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?", Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain on [...] "Welcome to the Family", and Sierra Kusterbeck of VersaEmerge on [...] "If <b>It</b> <b>Means</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>to</b> You". The latter featured harmonica played by Dave Guynn. One of the tracks written for Homesick was held over for What Separates Me from You (2010). An instrumental entitled [...] "Money Maker" [...] was also recorded during the sessions, but McKinnon had difficulties with it. He later explained: [...] "when {{it came down to}} writing vocal parts [...] I just couldn't get that song done. [...] I think it was the best music for the whole record. The music was just so catchy on its own [...] so we said we will just set this aside for next time around." ...|$|E
500|$|Planned for a mid-February 2009 release by Victory {{before being}} moved forward two weeks, the album sold 22,000 copies {{in the first}} week and charted at number 21 on the U.S. Billboard 200. It also charted at number 165 in the UK. It was the band's final album {{featuring}} Tom Denney on guitar, who was replaced on tour by Kevin Skaff.

Only the third [...] of these charted, at number 40 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. A re-release with additional tracks was released in October 2009.

[...] The album was certified Silver in the UK by the BPI in 2015, and Gold in the United States the following year.|$|E
2500|$|Dupré's {{only public}} {{comment on the}} affair {{remained}} the brief interview with The New York Times which broke the story of [...] "Kristen's" [...] identity on March 12, in an article accompanied by photographs taken from Dupré's MySpace page. [...] "I just don't want {{to be thought of}} as a monster," [...] Dupré told the newspaper. [...] "This has been a very difficult time. It's complicated." [...] On the day the story broke, she posted a message to her MySpace page that said [...] "Yeah, I did it"; it was later changed to read, [...] "Thank you for your support, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> me."

5000|$|A {{fortnight}} later, Palentino {{was again}} {{subject to a}} protest after finishing first in the Group 1 Australian Guineas, with Tarzino's jockey Craig Newitt claiming interference with 600 metres remaining {{and again in the}} straight. This time the protest was dismissed, with stewards saying the opposing horse had also rolled towards Palentino. Jockey Mark Zahra said, [...] "It was a shame we had to go through all that because you can’t enjoy the moment {{and then you have to}} sweat <b>it</b> out. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> and I said after last time, I’ll cop that as long as we win the Guineas." ...|$|R
2500|$|Mr Dinos {{was then}} aimed, as expected, at the Group One Ascot Gold Cup over {{two and a}} half miles. The {{build-up}} to the race was exceptionally difficult for Paul Cole as seventy percent of the horses at Whatcombe were affected by a viral infection and Mr Dinos had to be kept in isolation, attended only by his stable lad Tom Pirie. Kieren Fallon took over the ride in Gold Cup 19 June and Mr Dinos started 3/1 second favourite behind his old rival Mamool. Black Sam Bellamy, Pole Star, Kasthari and Persian Punch were again in the field whilst the other runners were Fight Your Corner (Chester Vase), Tholjanah (Noel Murless Stakes), Jardines Lookout (Goodwood Cup), Savannah Bay (Prix de Lutece), Pugin (runner-up in the Irish St Leger) and Alcazar. Persian Punch set the pace with Mr Dinos settling third before moving up into second place with nine furlongs left to run. Fallon sent the colt into the lead three furlongs out and Mr Dinos [...] "forged clear" [...] in the straight to win [...] "easily" [...] by six lengths from Persian Punch. After the race Fallon said [...] "I rode a horse who could take me there. He travelled well, he travelled all the way, even though he was a bit lazy. When I switched him on he found another gear and that's the sign of a good horse". Cole commented [...] "I've never had a runner in the Gold Cup and it's a race I've always wanted to win. I can't believe it's happened. We've had a terrible six weeks and we isolated him, and we've taken every single possible move to stop him getting the virus. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> everybody".|$|E
