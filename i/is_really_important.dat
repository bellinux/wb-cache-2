25|$|Sea ice {{serves to}} {{stabilise}} methane deposits on {{and near the}} shoreline, preventing the clathrate breaking down and venting into the water column and eventually reaching the atmosphere. From sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from the subsea permafrost into the Ocean (a process called ebullition), and found that 100–630mg methane per square meters is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, methane levels {{in the water column}} drop dramatically, when wind-driven air-sea gas exchange accelerates the ebullition process into the atmosphere. This observed pathway suggests that methane from seabed permafrost will progress rather slowly, instead of abrupt changes. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by global warming and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more release from this methane cache, which <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> for the Arctic. An update to the mechanisms of this permafrost degradation, implying the possibility of being close to an acceleration of methane release was published in 2017.|$|E

They were no longer dole reliant, as they had been when they made their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Drummer Jon Coghill told The Sydney Morning Herald [...] "we wanted to have more fun and enjoy that we were a band, rather than chase what you're supposed to do", and guitarist Ian Haug said [...] "We all found that this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> to us, but we wanted to make it more fun".|$|E

O'Brien said: [...] "The context of each song <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important...</b> It's not a concept album but there is a continuity there." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} create a balance in the track listing, Lafourcade wrote [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] as a [...] "simple song" [...] about wanting to be with someone. The track was co-written by Marian Ruzzi, and was {{inspired}} by the music of the 1970s, including a chorus with answering voices, emulating musical theatre. The lyrics for [...] "Lo Que Construimos", deals with the decision to leave someone and going separate ways. [...] "Estoy Lista" [...] is a ballad about being ready to be well, and Lafourcade worked on the track in her spare time, taking a year to finish it. The last track, [...] "No Más Llorar", was written during a family reunion with her father and sister in Chile. Lafourcade wrote it about a love that could not be, her mourning and search for stability, forgiveness, and healing. In live performances, the singer dedicates the track to Mexico, to send hope through her music and help people deal with situations such as the Iguala mass kidnapping. [...] "I feel that nowadays <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> that we acknowledge the social part.

500|$|Burt {{is shown}} to have deeply loved his first wife, Kurt's mother, a strong woman who died eight {{years prior to the}} premiere of the show. He later characterizes his life after losing her as [...] "being asleep". Kurt {{introduces}} him to Carole Hudson, Finn's widowed mother, and they begin dating. He falls in love with her and she with him: he tells Finn that she is an [...] "angel who came down to wake me up after all these years". At Carole's behest, Burt becomes something of a father figure to Finn, taking him to ball games, though this development does not sit well with Kurt, who works to win his father's attention back from Finn by emulating his father's dress and interests before Burt realizes how hurt Kurt is. The relationship between Burt and Carole progresses {{to the point that they}} decide to live together, and she and Finn move in with the Hummels, since their house is the larger of the two. However, after Finn uses a homophobic slur against Kurt, Burt tells Finn that his behavior is unacceptable and he cannot live in the house any more, imperiling his romance with Carole. Following his appearance in this episode, O'Malley spoke of future reconciliation between Burt and Finn. He stated, [...] "One of the things I think <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> in life and for human beings is to forgive and be able to rise up from our mistakes. I'm hoping that Finn and Burt are able to cross that chasm." ...|$|E

I didn't want to fit any mold. I wanted it to be something that couldn't be replicated by anyone else. It was important to me that the album began with [...] "Cannonball" [...] and ended with [...] "If You Say So". I have to acknowledge what I've been through this year. It was really difficult, which I think is represented in [...] "If You Say So" [...] and a song like [...] "Cannonball" [...] represents finding strength and hope.

2500|$|Noting {{the growing}} union support, {{an article in}} the progressive-leaning Mother Jones {{magazine}} said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a clear chain of command, Occupy Wall Street is the opposite in that they are [...] "a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought." [...] However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that [...] "effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics." [...] As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan. Damon Silvers, the AFL–CIO's policy director, said, “We think the Occupy movement has given voice to something very basic about what’s going on in our country right now. The fact that they’ve figured out certain concepts and language for doing that, we think <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> and positive.” The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) has endorsed the movement saying, [...] "We recognize the need to work together and learn from each other.

6000|$|It is a {{very curious}} circumstance, showing how {{sometimes}} records of the most trivial and insignificant things come down to us from ancient times in a clear and certain form, while all that <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> to know is involved in doubt and obscurity--that the household expense-book of Anne at Middleham is still extant, showing all the little items of expense incurred for Richard's son, while all is dispute and uncertainty in respect to the great political schemes and measures of his father. In this book there is a charge of 22s. 9d. {{for a piece of}} green cloth, and another of 1s. 8d. for making it into gowns for [...] "my lord prince." [...] There is also a charge of 5s. for a feather for him, and 13s. 1d. paid to a shoemaker, named Dirick, for a pair of shoes.

There are several charges on the journey for offerings and gifts made by the child at churches on the way. Two men were paid 6s. 8d. for running on foot by the side of his carriage. These men's names were Medcalf and Pacock. There is also a charge of 2d. for mending a whip! ...|$|E
60|$|There was a Jere. Clemens {{who was a}} United States Senator, and in his day {{enjoyed the}} usual Senatorial fame--a fame which perishes whether it spring from four years' service or forty. After Jere. Clemens's fame as a Senator passed away, he was still remembered for many years on account of another service which he performed. He shot old John Brown's Governor Wise in the hind leg in a duel. However, I am not very clear about this. It may be that Governor Wise {{shot him in the}} hind leg. However, I don't think it is important. I think that the only thing that <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> is that one of them got shot in the hind leg.

I never had a historical mind. Let it go. Whichever way it happened I am glad of it, and that is as much enthusiasm as I can get up for a person bearing my name.

60|$|Among the mediaeval relics, the carvings in ivory {{are often}} very {{exquisite}} and elaborate. There are likewise caskets and coffers, {{and a thousand}} other Old World ornamental works; but I saw so many and such superior specimens {{of them at the}} Manchester Exhibition, that I shall say nothing of them here. The seal-ring of Mary, Queen of Scots, is in one of the cases; {{it must have been a}} thumb-ring, judging from its size, and it has a dark stone, engraved with armorial bearings. In another case is the magic glass formerly used by Dr. Doe, and in which, if I rightly remember, used to be seen prophetic visions or figures of persons and scenes at a distance. It is a round ball of glass or crystal, slightly tinged with a pinkish hue, and about as big as a small apple, or a little bigger than an egg would be if perfectly round. This ancient humbug kept me looking at it perhaps ten minutes; and I saw my own face dimly in it, but no other vision. Lastly, I passed through the Ethnographical Rooms; but I care little for the varieties of the human race,--all that <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> and interesting being found in our own variety.
