25|$|In MDK2, the {{two other}} playable {{characters}} are Kurt's employer, the inventor/scientist Dr. Fluke Hawkins, and Max, a two-legged four-armed genetically engineered robotic dog. Max <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> of the three characters, with 200 health points. His gameplay is focused on high-impact firepower; standing on his two back legs, he can equip and shoot up to four guns at once. He is also able to wear {{two different types of}} jet pack. The standard jet pack uses fuel and when empty, must be refuelled at a fuelling pump. The atomic jetpack does not use fuel, instead refilling automatically when not in use. Hawkins' levels focus on puzzle solving and platforming, with some elements of combat. He is the weakest of the characters, with 60 health points. Most of his gameplay revolves around combining objects to create new objects, which in turn allow him to proceed through the level. He has two independent inventories, one for his right hand and one for his left. Items from one inventory can be combined with items from the other, but items within the same inventory cannot be combined. His main weapon is an atomic toaster, which shoots radioactive toast.|$|E
500|$|Buttercup (voiced by E. G. Daily) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> of the three. Her {{personality}} ingredient is spice, {{her signature}} color is green, {{and she has}} short black hair in a flip. She is a fun-loving tomboy who loves to get dirty, fights hard and plays rough; she does not plan and is all action. Buttercup is the only Powerpuff Girl without a unique super power (aside {{from being able to}} curl her tongue as shown in the episode [...] "Nuthin' Special"). McCracken originally wanted to name the character [...] "Bud" [...] until a friend suggested the name Buttercup.|$|E
500|$|The {{three girls}} all have oval-shaped heads, {{abnormally}} large eyes (inspired by Margaret Keane's art), stubby arms and legs, and lack noses, ears, fingers, necks, and flat feet with toes (McCracken preferred {{them to look}} more symbolic of actual girls rather than going for a [...] "realistic" [...] look, meaning fewer body parts were needed). Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup wear dresses that match the colors of their eyes with black belts, as well as white tights and black Mary Janes. The closing theme to the cartoon offers a nutshell description of the two Powerpuff Girls' personalities: Blossom, commander and the leader. Bubbles, she is the joy and the laughter. Buttercup, she <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> fighter.|$|E

500|$|Box-office {{analysts and}} critics debated the film's underperformance. Analyst Jeff Bock, of Exhibitor Relations, {{reasoned}} the film underperformed {{at the box}} office due to two reasons; the first, he said, is the genre. Bock stated that Americans get horror and comedy, but with the idea [...] "of those two things together in one place, people suddenly get very dumb". [...] "The horror-comedy genre <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> sell in Hollywood", he said. He noted films Tremors, Slither, Shaun of the Dead, Eight Legged Freaks and The Evil Dead series, and said that while many of those are considered critical and business successes, [...] "none of them have brought in the megabucks that a simple horror or comedy can." [...] In addition, he labeled the Scream franchise as more [...] "straight-up horror" [...] than comedy and stated Zombielands box office performance would determine the horror-comedy genre's current viability.|$|E

The relaunched Edun featured Sharon Wauchob as its new chief designer. By 2010, the company had outsourced much of the manufacturing for its new fashion line to China, generating some negative reactions, while simpler garments were still African-made. Hewson said that business realities compelled this action, but that she hoped more work {{could be done in}} Africa in the future. Hewson devoted a large amount of time to Edun, saying in 2011, [...] "I think [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> business there is," [...] and that despite the obstacles and struggles, [...] "you just keep going." [...] The proposition remained difficult, however, and Edun lost €6.8million in 2011 and €5.9million in 2012. The Hewsons said the company was in an investment phase and they were satisfied with the five-year strategic business plan underway.|$|E

[...] hit Honshu. The {{earthquake and}} the resulting tsunami not only devastated wide coastal areas in Miyagi Prefecture but also caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster triggering a widespread permanent evacuation surrounding the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant. German chancellor Angela Merkel immediately expressed her deepest sympathy to all those affected and promised Japan any assistance it would call for. As a consequence rescue specialists from the Technisches Hilfswerk as well as a scout team of I.S.A.R. Germany (International Search and Rescue) were sent to Japan, however parts of the German personnel had to be recalled due to radiation danger near the damaged power plant. Furthermore, the German Aerospace Center provided TerraSAR-X- and RapidEye-satellite imagery of the affected area. In the days after the disaster, numerous flowers, candles and paper cranes were placed in front of the Japanese embassy in Berlin by compassionates, including leading German politicians. Though never materialised, additional proposals for aid included sending special units of the German Bundeswehr to Japan, as the German Armed Forces' decontamination equipment belongs to the most sophisticated in the world.|$|E

2500|$|The 12 to 6 curveball <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> type of curveball to hit, {{because it}} moves vertically, {{and has no}} {{horizontal}} break. [...] The difference of the speed from a fastball and the break make the pitch difficult to hit if a pitcher uses it correctly in a pitching sequence. The 12 to 6 curveball is usually pitched from the overhand motion, as a three-quarters or sidearm delivery would cause the ball to break 2 to 8 instead of 12 to 6. The sharp vertical break on the 12–6 curveball is created when pitchers apply topspin to the ball with their fingers {{in the process of}} releasing it.|$|E
