50|$|A <b>diamond</b> <b>stylus</b> {{is moved}} {{vertically}} {{in contact with}} a sample and then moved laterally across the sample for a specified distance and specified contact force. A profilometer can measure small surface variations in vertical stylus displacement {{as a function of}} position. A typical profilometer can measure small vertical features ranging in height from 10 nanometres to 1 millimetre. The height position of the <b>diamond</b> <b>stylus</b> generates an analog signal which is converted into a digital signal, stored, analyzed, and displayed. The radius of <b>diamond</b> <b>stylus</b> ranges from 20 nanometres to 50 μm, and the horizontal resolution is controlled by the scan speed and data signal sampling rate. The stylus tracking force can range from less than 1 to 50 milligrams.|$|E
5000|$|Neumann was {{responsible}} for manufacturing the actual DMM cutting equipment {{as part of its}} VMS80 series lathes.

40|$|Scratching experiments, using <b>diamond</b> <b>styli</b> {{and single}} point diamond tools, were {{performed}} to simulate Single Point Diamond Turning (SPDT).

The depths of the scratches produced at different loads were measured and correlated to the ductile and brittle response of the material. The DBT depth for Chemically Vapor Deposited (CVD) coated Silicon Carbide (SiC) samples was determined. The analysis for the critical depth (DBT) did confirm the possibility for SPDT of CVD coated SiC in the ductile regime. These results were further used for SPDT of CVD SiC. Post experimental analysis of the machined surface did reveal a final surface roughness of 8 - 20 nm, successfully demonstrating ductile regime machining of CVD coated SiC...|$|R
50|$|A {{major new}} feature {{incorporated}} into the standard is coverage of non-contact measurement methods, already commonly used by industry, but up until now lacking a standard to support quality audits {{within the framework of}} ISO 9000. For the first time, the standard brings 3D surface metrology methods into the official domain, following 2D profilometric methods that have been subject to standards for over 30 years. The same thing applies to measurement technologies that are not restricted to contact measurement (with a <b>diamond</b> point <b>stylus),</b> but can also be optical, such as chromatic confocal gauges and interferometric microscopes.|$|R
50|$|Inventor Thomas Edison, {{who always}} favored the {{cylinder}} {{for all its}} advantages, also cut his discs with vertically modulated grooves from their introduction in 1912 until {{a year or two}} before his company's demise in 1929 (Edison Disc Records). Edison pioneered fine groove discs that played for up to five minutes per 10-inch side; they were very thick to remain perfectly flat and played back with a precision-ground <b>diamond</b> <b>stylus.</b> A commercially unsuccessful extension of the system introduced grooves nearly twice as fine as those of microgroove LPs, yielding playing times of up to 20 minutes per side at 80 RPM and again requiring a special <b>diamond</b> <b>stylus.</b> Even more than with Pathé discs, Edison's vertical-cut records called for specially designed equipment for playback.|$|E
5000|$|Roughness can be {{measured}} by manual comparison against a [...] "surface roughness comparator" [...] (a sample of known surface roughness), but more generally a surface profile measurement is made with a profilometer.

From Tissot, Helleu saw, for the first time, the possibilities of drypoint etching with a <b>diamond</b> point <b>stylus</b> directly on a copper plate. Helleu quickly became a virtuoso of the technique, drawing with the same dynamic and sophisticated freedom with his stylus as with his pastels. His prints were very well received, and they had the added advantage that a sitter could have several proofs printed to give to relations or to friends. Over the course of his career, Helleu produced more than 2,000 drypoint prints.|$|R
5000|$|First V-M {{designed}} a two speed changer after Columbia Records introduced the LP in 1948. V-M then added the 45rpm speed after RCA brought that innovation to market in 1949. Finally V-M added the fourth speed (16⅔ rpm) for [...] "talking books" [...] in 1954. The changer mechanism, {{used throughout the}} fifties, sixties, and the seventies was developed in 1950. The basic design was retained until record changer production was terminated. The changer mechanism, responsible for operating the tone arm and the dropping of the records, was updated throughout the years to keep V-M's record changers competitive with their competitors, as technology advanced. The speed control mechanism was, however, completely redesigned in 1961. V-M Corporation claimed that their record changers were jam proof. These V-M record changers had a reputation of being both well built and reliable. These mass-produced record changers, while competitive with other manufactures mass-produced record changers, i.e. BSR and Garrard, in both build quality and product specifications, were not competitive with professional record changers. Like other mass-produced record changers, the tone arms had heavier vertical tracking force (VTF), poorer speed accuracy, and poorer rumble specification than the professional record changers. V-M mass-produced record changers, like their competitors mass-produced record changers, were used in low to medium priced audio equipment-compact stereo systems, console stereos, and portable stereo systems. They were sold also as separate components. Most had ceramic cartridges and <b>diamond</b> <b>styluses</b> (needles), with a separate stylus for 78rpm records. Most had two pole synchronous motors. V-M developed their first professional record changer in 1966. This record changer had a twenty-four pole synchronous motor, and a separate motor for operating the tone arm and lowering the record to the turntable. This professional record changer was only a two speed unit-it did not play 78rpm records. This professional record changer was marketed under the Voice of Music trademark, and also sold to other manufactures such as Sherwood, Philco Ford and Westinghouse. V-M's second generation professional record changers design was developed in 1971, and was sold to BIC. V-M's deteriorating financial condition did not permit V-M to market this design under the Voice of Music trade mark.|$|R

40|$|Hard CrNx {{coatings}} of 3. 3 - 4. 1 mu m in thickness were deposited {{by means}} of reactive sputter deposition in an industrial PVD coater. The coatings were deposited under various N- 2 flows on high-speed steel (HSS) and {{hot work tool steel}} (HWTS). For all coatings, the hardness, reduced modulus and density were approximately 30 GPa, 240 GPa and 6400 kg /m(3), respectively. The composition, however, varied with the N- 2 flow from CrN 0. 6 to CrN 1. 0. The coatings were subjected to scratch testing with a <b>diamond</b> Rockwell <b>stylus</b> under a progressive load. From the scratch tests, the critical load for the onset of chipping and/or spalling for each coating was determined. The tribological properties of the coatings were characterised by pin-on-disk testing employing an Al 2 O 3 ball as counter part. The wear track depth profile measured with a laser scanning confocal microscope was used to obtain the wear area. From the wear area, the specific wear rate was determined. The CrN 1. 0 coatings outperform the CrN 0. 6 coatings with respect to specific wear rate and critical load. For the CrN 0. 6 coating, similar failure was observed in both the wear test and the scratch tests. The similarity of failure in both tests is discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Measuring {{the amount}} of wear {{in the case of}} revised hip {{replacements}} {{is considered to be a}} prerequisite of understanding and assessing true in vivo performance of the implant. Whilst most case studies have been focused on developing methods for measuring wear on the bearing surface an increased revision rate of LHMOM implants compared to resurfacing suggests that all interfaces have to assessed to evaluate overall wear. This paper describes the main characteristics of a method developed by the authors for quantifying taper wear as well as general taper interface parameters. Previous studies have mostly relied on visual inspection to assess the wear of the taper interface. The method aims at characterizing any surface and form changes caused by the wear process through the use of a roundness measurement machine. The measurement process enables a full 360 degree scan on the taper surface using a <b>diamond</b> tip <b>stylus.</b> Wear is determined by analyzing the data through a custom developed Matlab program. Along with assessing the volumetric wear linear wear and contact parameters can also be determined. The method was applied to 100 retrieved LHMOM femoral head components in order to quantify the wear at the taper junction. Initial results show that the taper interface is a contributing factor to overall wear with a wear volumes ranging from 0. 2 to 25 mm 3. The wear on the femoral heads can mostly be characterized as a localized area covering the whole contact length between the stem and the femoral head. Maximum linear depth is mostly present in the distal end of the femoral head. In some cases wear is only present on one half of the contact length suggesting unilateral loading. The results suggest the geometric form errors between components are one of the contributing factors of wear at the taper interface...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of the head-stem taper {{junction}} {{requires the}} estimation of material loss from the taper surfaces of both femoral head and stem. This paper describes a method for the measurement and analysis of material loss from the modular taper junction of hip replacements, in particular femoral stem tapers where generally the entire taper surface has been engaged. In such cases no direct unworn datum is readily identifiable to assess material loss. The highly anisotropic topology of some stem designs poses additional challenges to the measurement and analysis process. Estimation of material loss of retrieved femoral stems is further complicated by retrieval damage or surface deposits often present on the taper surface. The femoral head tapers typically exhibit areas of pristine surface attributed to the difference in taper length compared to the engaging stem. These areas can be selected as unworn when employed in the analysis process, provided they do not show surface damage or deposits. Measurement of the taper surfaces has been performed using a Talyrond (Ametek, Inc., US) out-of-roundness measurement instrument equipped with a 5 µm <b>diamond</b> tip <b>stylus.</b> Vertical axial traces were employed to digitize {{the surface of the}} taper. Measurement data has been analyzed using a multi stage process that has been specifically adapted for stem tapers. The underlying stem taper geometry is determined by means of a morphological filter to remove the high aspect ratio microstructure. This paper presents a study of 40 retrieved LHMoM hip replacements that have been analyzed to ascertain the material loss at the modular taper junction. The {{purpose of this study was}} to ascertain the viability of characterizing material loss from the stem taper junction and to provide insight into the overall material loss contribution...|$|R

The disc was freely rotating on a thin cushion of air between the disc and a fixed plate at 1500rpm (25 Hz), the disc being stabilized only by centrifugal force. The sampling frequency of the combined audio-video signal was about 2.7 MHz.

5000|$|Within the [...] "cobblestones", nodules, clusters, or [...] "sponges" [...] (the volumes {{in which}} local bonding is sp3) bond angles may be {{distorted}} from {{those found in}} either pure cubic or hexagonal lattices because of intermixing of the two. The result is internal (compressive) stress that can appear {{to add to the}} hardness measured for a sample of DLC. Hardness is often measured by nanoindentation methods in which a finely pointed <b>stylus</b> of natural <b>diamond</b> is forced into the surface of a specimen. If the sample is so thin that there is only a single layer of nodules, then the stylus may enter the DLC layer between the hard cobblestones and push them apart without sensing the hardness of the sp3 bonded volumes. Measurements would be low. Conversely, if the probing stylus enters a film thick enough to have several layers of nodules so it cannot be spread laterally, or if it enters on top of a cobblestone in a single layer, then it will measure not only the real hardness of the diamond bonding, but an apparent hardness even greater because the internal compressive stress in those nodules would provide further resistance to penetration of the material by the stylus. Nanoindentation measurements have reported hardness as great as 50% more than values for natural crystalline <b>diamond.</b> Since the <b>stylus</b> is blunted in such cases or even broken, actual numbers for hardness that exceed that of natural diamond are meaningless. They only show that the hard parts of an optimal ta-C material will break natural diamond rather than the inverse. Nevertheless, from a practical viewpoint it does not matter how the resistance of a DLC material is developed, it can be harder than natural diamond in usage. One method of testing the coating hardness is by means of the Persoz pendulum.|$|R
50|$|In the {{recording}} process, a sufficiently amplified audio signal {{was sent to}} a heavily weighted electromagnetic recording head with a blunt <b>diamond</b> <b>stylus</b> that indented, rather than cut or engraved, a sound-modulated groove into the surface of the metal. Normally, a completely blank disc was used and {{the recording}} head was slowly carried toward its center by a dedicated feed mechanism. Some low-end recording units economized by eliminating the feed mechanism, relying instead on the use of discs already cut with a narrow blank groove that guided the stylus, which simply impressed its vibrations into the upper region of the existing groove. This cost-cutting approach produced recordings with a very limited dynamic range and generally inferior sound. In either case, because of the grain structure of the metal and its resistance to the side-to-side motions of the recording stylus, significant surface noise was inherent and the high-frequency signal content was heavily attenuated.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{method is to}} use a <b>diamond</b> <b>stylus</b> profilometer. The stylus is run {{perpendicular}} to the lay of the surface. The probe usually traces along a straight line on a flat surface or in a circular arc around a cylindrical surface. The length of the path that it traces is called the measurement length. The wavelength of the lowest frequency filter that will be used to analyze the data is usually defined as the sampling length. Most standards recommend that the measurement length should be at least seven times longer than the sampling length, and according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem it should be at least two times longer than the wavelength of interesting features. The assessment length or evaluation length is the length of data that will be used for analysis. Commonly one sampling length is discarded from each end of the measurement length. 3D measurements can be made with a profilometer by scanning over a 2D area on the surface.|$|E
5000|$|Among their {{advantages}} over the competition, they were {{played with a}} so-called [...] "permanent" [...] precisely shaped <b>diamond</b> <b>stylus,</b> while lateral-cut records were played with a ten-for-a-penny steel needle that quickly wore to fit the groove contour and {{was meant to be}} replaced after one use. A feed screw mechanism inside the player moved the reproducer across the record at the required rate, relieving the groove of that work and thus reducing record wear. The playing speed for Diamond Discs was specified at exactly 80 revolutions per minute, at a time when other makers' recording speeds had not been standardized and could be as slow as 70 rpm or even faster than 80 rpm, but were typically somewhere around 76 rpm, leaving users who cared about correct pitch to adjust the playback speed for each record until it [...] "sounded right". Above all, there was, and still is, general agreement that the Diamond Disc system produced the clearest, most [...] "present" [...] sound of any non-electronic disc recording technology.|$|E
5000|$|The long-playing 33 rpm {{microgroove}} vinyl record, or [...] "LP", {{was developed}} at Columbia Records and introduced in 1948.

In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs {{by the end of}} the 1950s, but in some corners of the world the [...] "78" [...] lingered on far into the 1960s. Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable and the compact [...] "45" [...] format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. If played with a good <b>diamond</b> <b>stylus</b> mounted in a lightweight pickup on a well-adjusted tonearm, it was long-lasting.

5000|$|The Edison Diamond Disc Record {{is a type}} of {{phonograph}} record marketed by Thomas A. Edison, Inc. on their Edison Record label from 1912 to 1929. They were named Diamond Discs because the matching Edison Disc Phonograph was fitted with a precision-made semi-permanent <b>diamond</b> <b>stylus</b> for playing them. Diamond Discs were incompatible with ordinary disc record players, the disposable steel needles of which would damage them while extracting hardly any sound. Uniquely, they are about 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick.Edison had previously made only phonograph cylinders but decided to add a disc format to the product line because of the increasingly dominant market share of the shellac disc records (later called [...] "78s" [...] because of their typical rotational speed) made by competitors such as the Victor Talking Machine Company. Victor and most other makers recorded and played sound by a lateral or side-to-side motion of the stylus in the record groove, while in the Edison system the motion was vertical or up-and-down, known as [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] recording, as used for cylinder records. An Edison Disc Phonograph is distinguished by the diaphragm of the reproducer being parallel {{to the surface of the}} record. The diaphragm of a reproducer used for playing ordinary records is at a right angle to the surface.|$|E
5000|$|Gramophone record formats: lateral versus {{vertical}} [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] groove cutting. When Edison {{introduced his}} [...] "Diamond Disc" [...] (played with a <b>diamond</b> <b>stylus</b> {{instead of a}} steel needle) record in 1912, it was cut [...] "hill-and-dale", meaning that the groove was modulated along its vertical axis, {{as it had been}} on all cylinders—unlike other manufacturers' discs, which were cut laterally, meaning that their grooves were of constant depth and modulated along the horizontal axis. Machines designed to play lateral-cut discs could not play vertical-cut ones and vice versa. Pathé Records also adopted the hill-and-dale format for their discs, first issued in 1906, but they used a very wide, shallow groove, played with a small sapphire ball, which was incompatible with Edison products. In 1929 Thomas Edison quit the record industry, ceasing all production of both discs and cylinders. Pathé had been making a transition to the lateral format during the 1920s and in 1932 decisively abandoned the vertical format. There was no standard speed for all disc records until 78 rpm was settled on during {{the latter half of the}} 1920s, although because most turntables could be adjusted to run at a fairly wide range of speeds that did not really constitute a format war. Some Berliner discs played at about 60 rpm. Some of Pathé's largest discs, which were 50 cm (nearly 20 inches) in diameter, played at 120 rpm. Diamond Discs were 80 rpm. Those makers aside, speeds in the mid-70s were more usual.|$|E
