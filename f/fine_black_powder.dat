5|$|Real estate {{companies}} {{continued to}} advertise and sell land along newly dug canals. In April 1912—the {{end of the}} dry season—reporters {{from all over the}} U.S. were given a tour of what had recently been drained, and they returned to their papers and raved about the progress. Land developers sold 20,000lots in a few months. But as news about the Wright report continued to be negative, land values plummeted, and sales decreased. Developers were sued and arrested for mail fraud when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south Florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater. Advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks, but for many it took at least as long just to clear. Some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a <b>fine</b> <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> and created dust storms. Settlers encountered rodents, skinks, and biting insects, and faced dangers from mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and alligators. Though at first crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason. It was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked copper and other trace elements. The USDA released a pamphlet in 1915 that declared land along the New River Canal would be too costly to keep drained and fertilized; people in Ft.Lauderdale responded by collecting all of the pamphlets and burning them.|$|E

50|$|The P−1 form of Ni2B can be {{generated}} by mixing nickel(II) sulfate and sodium borohydride in alkaline aqueous solutions.

50|$|Through the years, several {{methods of}} igniting the {{propellant}} have been developed. Originally, {{a small hole}} (a touch hole) was drilled into the breech so that a <b>fine</b> propellant (<b>Black</b> <b>powder,</b> the same propellant used in the gun) could be poured in, and an external flame or spark was applied, (see matchlock and flintlock). Later, Percussion caps and self-contained cartridges (see Cartridge (firearms)), had primers that detonated after mechanical deformation, igniting the propellant. Electric current {{can also be used}} to ignite the propellant, (see Primer (firearm), electric-primed).|$|R
5000|$|Initially Māori {{found it}} very hard to obtain muskets as the missionaries refused to trade them or sell powder or shot. The Ngāpuhi put missionaries under intense {{pressure}} to repair muskets even at times threatening them with violence. Most muskets were initially obtained while in Australia. Pakeha-Maori such as Jacky Marmon were instrumental in obtaining muskets from trading ships in return for flax, timber and smoked heads. Most muskets sold were low quality, short barrel trade muskets, made cheaply in Birmingham with inferior steel and less precision in the action. The range and accuracy of a trade musket (40m range) could not be compared with that of a proper military musket such as a Brown Bess or the later standard issue Enfield which required the less common <b>fine</b> grain <b>black</b> <b>powder.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Again, I {{spoke of}} the produce of {{fermentation}} as [...] "spirit of wine." [...] Now what a very curious phrase that is, {{if you come to}} think of it. The old alchemists talked of the finest essence of anything as if it had the same sort of relation to the thing itself as a man's spirit is supposed to have to his body; and so they spoke of this fine essence of the fermented liquid as being the spirit of the liquid. Thus came about that extraordinary ambiguity of language, in virtue of which you apply precisely the same substantive name to the soul of man and to a glass of gin! And then there is still yet one other most curious piece of nomenclature connected with this matter, and that is the word [...] "alcohol" [...] itself, which is now so familiar to everybody. Alcohol originally meant a very fine powder. The women of the Arabs and other Eastern people are in the habit of tingeing their eyelashes with a very <b>fine</b> <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> which is made of antimony, and they call that [...] "kohol;" [...] and the [...] "al" [...] is simply the article put in front of it, so as to say [...] "the kohol." [...] And up to the 17th century in this country the word alcohol was employed to signify any very fine powder; you find it in Robert Boyle's works that he uses [...] "alcohol" [...] for a very fine subtle powder. But then this name of anything very fine and very subtle came to be specially connected with the fine and subtle spirit obtained from the fermentation of sugar; and I believe that the first person who fairly fixed it as the proper name of what we now commonly call spirits of wine, was the great French chemist Lavoisier, so comparatively recent is {{the use of the word}} alcohol in this specialised sense.|$|E

30|$|Molybdenum {{disulfide}} (MoS 2) nanosheets were synthesized by liquid ultrasound exfoliation {{as reported}} in the literature [35, 36]. Typically, MoS 2 power (0.25  g, Aladdin) was dispersed in ethyl cellulose (EC) isopropanol solution (1  % w/v dispersion, 100  ml) in a SEBC bottle. The dispersion was sonicated for 24  h at 60  W in water bath. The resulting dispersion was centrifuged (Desktop High-speed Refrigerated Centrifuge Model TGL- 16) at 5000  rpm for 15  min, and then the supernatant liquid was directly collected. Deionized water was mixed with the supernatant liquid (3 : 4 weight ratio) and subsequently centrifuged at 7500  rpm for 10  min. Whereafter, the lower precipitation was collected and dried. The resulting precipitation was redispersed in ethanol (10  mg/ml). NaCl aqueous solution (0.04  g/ml) was mixed with the redispersion (9 : 16 weight ratio) and centrifuged at 5000  rpm for 8  min, discarding the supernatant. To debride any residual salt, the resulting MoS 2 precipitation was washed with deionized water and collected by vacuum filtration (0.45  μm filter paper). Finally, the MoS 2 nanosheet product was dried as a <b>fine</b> <b>black</b> <b>powder.</b> The final MoS 2 nanosheets were defined as n-MoS 2. For the preparation of p-MoS 2 nanosheets, the n-MoS 2 powder was taken a UV-ozone plasma treatment for 40  min to completely change to p-MoS 2 nanosheets.|$|E
40|$|Kajjali (Black Sulphide of Mercury) is a Sagandha (together with sulphur), Niragni (fire is not {{involved}} in the process) Parada yoga (mercurial preparation). The Bandha (bond) involved in this preparation is Kajjali Bandha, where purified Parada (mercury) and Gandhaka (sulphur) are thoroughly ground in definite proportion, to get a <b>fine</b> <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> called Kajjali. Among Khalviya rasayana (mortar pestle apparatus used medicinal preparations), Kajjali is having prime importance as it forms base to many mercurial preparations. Though Ancient scholars mentioned some quality checks and end points in preparing Bhasma like Varitaratva, Rekhapurnatva, etc., these are not sufficient in the present scenario. Apart from these testing procedures, there is need of more sophisticated testing methods for determining the quality of Kajjali. The Present work illustrates the chemical characteristics of Kajjali obtained by well-defined process in the Ayurvedic classics.

40|$|A {{review of}} metal-mediated {{epoxidation}} is given. Jacobsen's catalyst and the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation catalyst are discussed. The origins of enantioselectivity are explained using stereochemical models. Several new salen-type ligands were synthesized based on biphenol and binaphthol. The synthesis of these ligands and their subsequent coordination to transition metals were described. The transition metal complexes were structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction of single crystals. The manganese (III) complexes were evaluated for catalytic activity in epoxidation reactions. Despite {{the fact that}} these many of these complexes were optically active, little asymmetric induction was observed in any of the epoxidation reactions. The investigation of a soluble nickel salen complex for the epoxidation of olefins led to the discovery of a new heterogeneous catalyst for the epoxidation of ?,?- unsaturated carboxylic acids. Nickel salen complexes, upon reaction with commercial bleach, yield a <b>fine</b> <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> which we identified as nickel oxide hydroxide-a known but poorly characterized nickel peroxide containing species. The reaction of an aqueous nickel (II) source with commercial bleach also yields nickel oxide hydroxide. This material was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Extremely broad peaks in the X-ray diffraction pattern suggested that this material consisted of particles with a very small diameter and this was confirmed by TEM. This insoluble material was found to function as a heterogeneous catalyst for the epoxidation of ?,?-unsaturated carboxylic acids in the presence of sodium hypochlorite. The high activity of this catalyst in the epoxidation of certain olefins {{is due in part to}} its small particle size, which increases the overall surface area of this heterogeneous catalyst. Large particles of nickel oxide hydroxide were prepared and the catalytic activity was comparatively less. The oxidation of several other organic substrates was also explored using this catalyst. Both primary and secondary alcohols can be oxidized with our nickel-based system. Primary alcohols go through an aldehyde intermediate which is then in turn oxidized to the carboxylic acid...|$|E
