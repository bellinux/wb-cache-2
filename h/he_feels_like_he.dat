25|$|Bobby (McCulloch) is {{a rebellious}} {{teenager}} whose love of rock'n'roll {{serves as the}} basis for most of his sketches. Bobby views rock as an expression of personal freedom, and always fights back when <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is being denied that freedom. He is frequently in conflict with his parents, played by McKinney (father) and Foley (mother). He has also taken on a sarcastic jazz-loving teacher (Foley), and once even faced off against the Devil himself (McKinney) in a guitar-playing contest. Despite his rebellious attitude toward authority, he emphatically enjoys the taste of his mother's ham steak. A pre- Nicole de Boer appeared in three sketches as Bobby's girlfriend Laura. He, like Bauer above are a tongue-in-cheek satire of the rebellious late-80/1990s Grunge/Generation X subculture.|$|E
25|$|The song's lyrics {{feature the}} phrase {{identity}} ga nai, umarenai, which leads {{the song and}} feature in the song's chorus. The song's protagonist says that going by measures such as what his favourite clothes, books and food are, he's just a regular person, and that him thinking about the morning's rain {{that led to a}} woman's shirt becoming set were inelegant thoughts. A scene is depicted in the lyrics where someone {{at the beginning of a}} concert compares himself with the other members of the audience, and realises that comparing yourself to others is not a proper way to live. Later, he thinks about childhood memories of defeat, and realises that these memories are his pure self. After understanding this, <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> wants to scream, and begins to cry.|$|E
25|$|Introduced {{in chapter}} six, {{he prefers to}} be called Joseph, and is known also as the Wandering Jew, or the “Magician of the Flow”, he is a mysterious being {{that looks like a}} young boy, but is much older. A long time ago, people said that “God’s Son” cast an immortal curse on him. Holding no clear intention, he’s just a monster that simply does what <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> seems to travel around the world experimenting with the living and dead {{for the sake of his}} experiments, {{although}} he has apparently forgotten why he experiments. He has the appearance of a human but the body of a non-human – as seen in chapter eleven when he was struck with a magic bullet. He dislikes his “Cartaphilius” name.|$|E

5000|$|On the film's title, Sohn stated [...] "The {{title is}} deceptively simple. It has more meaning than it seems." [...] He {{additionally}} explained: [...] "Arlo {{has a lot}} of issues when he's born.

500|$|In the 2016 MLS Cup Final against Seattle, held at BMO Field on 10 December, Giovinco's {{performance}} was largely stifled by Seattle's heavy and aggressive defending, despite initially creating an early goalscoring chance for Altidore; throughout the match, he was fouled {{a total of}} six times and had several shots blocked. A scoring opportunity came in the 48th minute, but his shot was skewed wide of the near post. He was eventually substituted for Tosaint Ricketts in the 103rd minute, due to an apparent injury, and consequently, despite being the club's main penalty kick taker, was not used in the resulting shoot-out, which Toronto lost 5–4, following a 0–0 draw after extra-time. Regarding Giovinco's surprising substitution, Toronto's coach, Greg Vanney, stated in the post-match press conference: [...] "He couldn't move. He looked at me. It's not like I take him off because I want to. I look at him and he gives me the sign that he can’t go any more and when <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> can’t go, he feels like he’s more of a liability to the group than anything. That’s the decision. It's not one that I generally want to make, but we had to." ...|$|E

2500|$|Phil's {{behaviour}} {{earned him}} a number of sworn enemies in Albert Square and by 2001 the character {{had become one of}} the soap's nastiest villains. In an interview with The Guardian McFadden commented on his alter ego's descent into villainy [...] "Phil's been had over by a lot of people, so now <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> can do it back. It's his history". However the character finally received his comeuppance in one of EastEnders most highly anticipated storylines, dubbed [...] "Who Shot Phil?". Phil was gunned down outside his home in March 2001 in a [...] "Dallas-style" [...] whodunnit mystery. Various key characters were in the frame for the deed and viewers were left guessing for weeks as to which of them was the real culprit. Several outcomes were allegedly filmed and it was reported that only a few TV executives knew the identity of the would-be assassin – even the actors were kept in the dark. A spokesman commented [...] "The cast are only getting their own scripts. They are not being told anyone else's storylines. Not even Phil knows who shot him. It's top secret." [...] Script writers were reportedly given private security after a writer's laptop was stolen in what was believed to be an attempt to gain the identity of the assailant. The storyline captivated the public's imagination leading to thousands of bets being placed at the bookies across the UK – bookmaker William Hill said there was about 50,000 bets on who was responsible.|$|E

5000|$|... "The {{song was}} {{written about the}} character, the Scorpion King, in the movie," [...] Erna {{explained}} {{on the set of}} the accompanying video. [...] "It's about him being this big, masculine badass, but he has this hidden sensitive side to him. <b>He</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> isolated, and <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> to do things alone because he was hurt in the past or whatever. I don't really know why he is the way he is. I guess there's always this mystique about those people who are really tough but maybe feel a little bit lonely inside. So the lyrics are kind of based on his character — being as masculine as he can be but yet isolated and a loner." ...|$|R
