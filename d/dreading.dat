5|$|Lexie's death devastates Meredith, who {{is still}} desperately trying to find her husband. Eventually, she and Shepherd reunite and they fix his hand as best as they can. Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of what has {{happened}} to the other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are <b>dreading.</b> Avery makes the choice to take a job offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his surgical internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith repeats the opening to the speech that Webber gave in the pilot episode of the series.|$|E

A Pathēt Lao minister took over the defence portfolio, removing any chance of the Army resisting the Pathēt Lao takeover. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, <b>dreading</b> further conflict and apparently trusting Souphanouvong's promises of a moderate policy, gave instructions that the Pathēt Lao were not to be resisted, and the U.S. began to withdraw its diplomatic personnel.|$|E

We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer all night, and a weary time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; but our signals of distress were not answered, though a light we saw at some distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand. The masts were cut down to lighten the ship, and the crash as they fell into the water sounded very fearful.|$|E

25|$|If the muster-roll of Laudonnière is accurate, the {{garrison}} which Ribault left behind him to defend Fort Caroline was ill-fitted to resist {{an attack of}} the well-fed and well-disciplined Spanish soldiery. The total number of colonists remaining in the fort was about two hundred and forty. Three days passed without any news of Ribault, and {{with each passing day}} Laudonnière became more anxious. Knowing the proximity of the Spaniards, and <b>dreading</b> a sudden descent upon the fort, he resolved to make shift for his own defense. Although food stores were depleted, as Ribault had carried off two of his boats with the meal which had been left over after making the biscuit for the return to France, and although Laudonnière himself was reduced to the rations of a common soldier, he yet commanded the allowance to be increased in order to lift the morale of his men. He also set to work to repair the palisade which had been torn down to supply material for the ships, but continued storms hindered the work, which was never completed.|$|E

Robert Dudley was shocked, <b>dreading</b> [...] "the malicious talk that I know the wicked world will use". William Cecil, the Queen's Principal Secretary, felt himself {{threatened by the}} prospect of Dudley's becoming king consort and spread rumours against the eventuality. Already knowing of her death before it was officially made public, he told the Spanish ambassador that Lord Robert and the Queen wished to marry and were about to do away with Lady Dudley by poison, [...] "giving out that she was ill but she was not ill at all". Likewise strongly opposed to a Dudley marriage, Nicholas Throckmorton, the English ambassador in France, {{went out of his way}} to draw attention to the scandalous gossip he heard at the French court. Although Cecil and Throckmorton made use of the scandal for their political and personal aims, they did not believe themselves that Robert Dudley had orchestrated his wife's death.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave a mostly positive review, {{giving it a}} 7.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was a}} [...] "good" [...] episode. He stated, [...] "Things are still a bit wobbly on Veronica Mars this season, though this episode had some elements that hopefully herald a turn in the right direction." [...] While criticizing the case-of-the-week, he was more laudatory to the subplots, calling Sheriff Lamb arresting Weevil [...] "the most entertaining scene of the episode" [...] and that [...] "the episode definitely picked up in the last act." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a very mixed review, commenting positively on Veronica and Weevil's relationship while criticizing other aspects of the episode. [...] "While 'President Evil' was not a favorite, and has a few annoying moments, it was generally a perfectly adequate episode of Veronica Mars. That is, until the ending. [...] The implication here is one that I've been <b>dreading</b> for a few episodes: that the radical feminist Lilith House has staged Claire's rape, and possibly others." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B-".|$|E

Dot tells Jim everyone is missing him, and {{that she has been}} <b>dreading</b> recording the message. She talks about her Christian faith and remembers her childhood, her first marriage to Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) and her friendship with Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin). She talks about when she was evacuated to Wales during the Second World War and how she did not cry when she left her mother. She says she was happy moving away to live with her guardians, a Welsh couple named Gwen and Will, as they made her feel special, and recalls the happiest day of her life. She remembers how Will would sing [...] "Pretty Baby" [...] to her at night, but says since then everyone she has cared about has died.

500|$|ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas {{said the}} fact that Andy and April's wedding was subdued, not overhyped in {{commercials}} to attract ratings, shows how much the writers understand and respect their characters. He also praised the episode's blend of [...] "humor and heart", of which he said: [...] "No show on the air, and few shows I can think of ever, does it better." [...] Zap2it writer Rick Porter said he {{was surprised by the}} wedding twist, particularly by {{the fact that}} the wedding was not stopped at the last moment by a [...] "TV-style complication". He also praised the subplot with Ann and Donna, and said he hoped the two characters would continue to interact with each other throughout the season. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow said [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party" [...] showed how well the April and Andy characters have developed since their romantic story arc began in the second season episode [...] "Hunting Trip". Meslow said the episode [...] "couldn't have been better" [...] and was even effective during unabashed sentimental scenes, like the wedding itself and April voicing her appreciation for Leslie. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said the wedding felt appropriate for the two characters, and he enjoyed the progression of Leslie going from <b>dreading</b> the wedding to accepting it. Heisler wrote, [...] "Truly, I don't think I've ever watched an episode of Parks & Rec without feeling great at the end." ...|$|E

The singer continued to say that because of this, she felt comfortable with her immediately. The music video and production was featured on the Through Nicola's Eyes webisodes, in which Roberts stated that she found {{the production of the}} music video very stressful. Talking about the experience in an interview with MTV News, Roberts stated that [...] "I'm nervous and I'm <b>dreading</b> the night before... I know I'm going to be like losing half a stone in weight overnight, so I'm {{going to have to get}} myself into the zone." [...] Roberts attributed her stress on the set of the video to her time with Girls Aloud, as she had always recorded music videos with four other members; this was the first time she had performed on her own. This meant that critical responses would only be aimed only at her. During the video shoot, Roberts further discussed the anxiety of a solo career claiming pressure from Morgan was making her feel uncomfortable. During the production, Roberts feared that feeling uncomfortable whilst shooting could have an overall negative effect on the video, explaining [...] "You've got to be strong and be professional and get through it, obviously enjoy it, but if you feel uncomfortable, you can't look uncomfortable otherwise it's not going to work".|$|E

So these cast lots for them and divided them all up among themselves, arms and all, as each happened to win them.
