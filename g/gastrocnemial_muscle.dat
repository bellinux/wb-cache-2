40|$|BackgroundTreatment of {{isolated}} calf muscle vein thrombosis (ICMVT) is controversial. There are no data from prospective, controlled studies. Objective {{of this article}} was to compare the efficacy and safety of a short-term course of anticoagulation with compression therapy alone. MethodsWe prospectively randomized patients with symptomatic, sonographically proven ICMVT in the soleal and/or <b>gastrocnemial</b> <b>muscle</b> veins in two treatment arms. The first received low-molecular-weight heparin for 10 days at therapeutic dosage (nadroparin 180 anti-activated factor X units once daily) and compression therapy for three months, and the second received compression therapy alone. Primary efficacy endpoint of the study was sonographically proven progression of ICMVT into the deep veins and clinical pulmonary embolism (PE) as confirmed by objective testing. Secondary efficacy and primary safety endpoints were major bleeding, death not due to PE, and complete sonographically proven recanalization of the muscle vein. We assessed transient and permanent risk factors for venous thromboembolism. ResultsOne-hundred seven patients were finally ruled eligible for evaluation: 89 % outpatients, 11 % hospitalized patients. In the heparin group (n = 54) progression to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred in two patients (3. 7 %), in the group compression therapy alone (n = 53) progression to DVT occurred in two patients (n. s.). No clinical PE and no death occurred. Thrombus recanalization after 3 months was not statistically significant different between the two study groups. No major bleeding occurred. ConclusionThe data do not show superiority of a short-term regimen of low-molecular-weight heparin and compression therapy in comparison with compression therapy alone in patients with ICMVT in a rather low-risk population...|$|E
