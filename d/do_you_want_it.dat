Sets for the episode were built, and Bobbi Jo Lathan was cast as flight attendant Lucy Merrit and Ernie Sabella was cast as gun salesman Mo Korn, who was described in the script as [...] "overweight, greasy, slow and low-key". The table reading of the episode was held on December 12, 1990. Louis-Dreyfus stated, [...] "I read the script and I remember thinking 'we're {{not going to do}} this'." [...] According to Alexander, when she read a scene in which she holds the gun to her head stating [...] "where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> Jerry? The Kennedy? [...] The McKinley?" [...] (referencing the assassination of the two American presidents), Louis-Dreyfus turned to Alexander, stating [...] "I'm not doing this." [...] Both Alexander and Cherones, who would direct the episode, felt that the gun content in the story was too provocative. Richards was concerned that his character would be open about arming Elaine, though in a later interview he stated [...] "although, why not? I think Kramer could justify the use of a weapon." ...|$|E

[...] We had demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word [...] "Bengal" [...] has a history, has a {{tradition}} of its own. You can change it only after the people have been consulted. So far as the question of One Unit is concerned it can come in the Constitution. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to be taken up just now? What about the state language, Bengali? We will be prepared to consider one-unit with all these things. So I appeal to my friends on that side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of referendum or in the form of plebiscite.|$|E
