5|$|The Cambrian {{explosion}} {{took place}} around 540 to 520 {{million years ago}} (Mya). In this geologically brief period, all the major animal phyla diverged and these included the first creatures with mineralized skeletons. Brachiopods and bivalves made their appearance at this time, and left their fossilized remains behind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The faster-moving streams took {{advantage}} of uplift-created joints <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b> Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.|$|E

5|$|The site spans 185 {{million years}} of {{geological}} history, coastal erosion having exposed an almost continuous sequence of rock formation covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. At different times, {{this area has}} been desert, shallow tropical sea and marsh, and the fossilised remains of the various creatures that lived here have been preserved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in this {{chain is}} calc-alkaline, {{yielding}} both andesite, dacite, and rhyolite. Three million years ago, {{a change in}} the chemistry of volcanism occurred, with an increased content of potassium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b> This change in composition geographically coincided with the volcanic activity crossing a lineament known as the Trotus line.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these {{formations}} {{much higher}} than where they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> to remove all Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. Lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area during the later part of this process.|$|E

5|$|As {{marine mammal}} species often play {{a large part}} in their ecosystems, it is {{possible}} that the sea mink was an important intertidal predator. It may have had a similar diet to the American mink, and may have consumed seabirds, seabird eggs, and hard-bodied marine invertebrates, though in greater proportions. Fur traders reported that sea mink dens had two entrances, and were made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> piled up by the waves. Remains of toad sculpins and ocean pout were the most common around their dens, and garden banded snails were also reported to have been part of their diet. Their seafood-oriented diet may have increased their size. According to fur traders, the sea mink was nocturnal and resided in caves and rock crevices during the day. Due to the overlap of American mink and sea mink ranges, {{it is possible that}} they hybridized with each other. Although not a truly marine species, being confined to coastal waters, the sea mink was unusually aquatic compared to other members of Musteloidea, being, next to otters, the most aquatic member of the taxon.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
5|$|Temperature: The species {{appears to}} require the cool, mild {{temperatures}} and relatively constant conditions provided by the waterfalls and the mist they generate. Water volume and flow rates within the Chittenango Creek watershed influence {{the size of the}} waterfall as well as the mist-zone and the actual temperature at the site. Active Novisuccinea chittenangoensis are generally found at temperatures from 12 to 20°C. During warmer periods, snails retreat to cool areas provided by the moist rock and moss, or aestivate in the vegetation. During cold winter temperatures, it is believed that the snails at the Falls retreat into cracks or fissures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> and remain inactive. Various temperature readings were gathered during the summers of 1980-1982. In the spray zone, the rock surface temperatures averaged 16°C, the moss averaged 14°C, and the combined temperatures of the substrate, water, and vegetation averaged 16°C. Seasonal and daily temperature variation has been monitored for 2 years using data loggers that record temperature every hour, but this data has not yet been analyzed (Breisch, unpublished data).|$|E

5|$|As Ethalion subdued Thetis the {{remainder}} of the British squadron continued southwards in pursuit of Santa Brigida. Pillon was an experienced officer with a good knowledge of the Northern Spanish coast and he intended to lose his pursuers in the rocky channels of Cape Finisterre. Early on 17 October he reached Spanish coastal waters, rounding Finisterre just beyond the Monte Lora rocks. Captain Gore on Triton, which was in full flow at seven knots, was unaware of the obstacle and at 05:00 crashed into them, coming to a juddering halt and inflicting severe damage to his ship's hull. Gore was able however to bring Triton off soon afterwards and continued pursuit, assisted by Digby on Alcmene who was able to block Pillon's route into Porte de Vidre. Both frigates opened fire on Santa Brigida at 07:00 as the Spanish ship sought shelter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> at Commarurto close to the safe harbour at Muros, Pillon's movement hampered by the coastal rias that blocked the wind. After an hour of resistance, with Naiad belatedly approaching, Pillon was forced to surrender his ship to superior British forces. Santa Brigida had lost two men killed and eight wounded, Alcmene one killed and nine wounded and Triton a single man wounded.|$|E

25|$|Many of the 736 convicts {{who survived}} the voyage of the First Fleet from Portsmouth, England arrived {{suffering}} from dysentery, smallpox, scurvy, and typhoid.

25|$|The early {{administrators of}} the colony at Sydney Cove sent groups of prisoners to an area nearby, named The Rocks, to eke out what ever {{existence}} they could from the land and build housing for themselves. These first occupants hewed out sandstone from the outcrops and built simple houses. Convicts were also employed tunnelling through {{what is called the}} 'Argyle Cut' <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Rocks.</b> The rock was dumped in the mangrove swamps {{at the head of the}} Tank Stream to begin to make Circular Quay. Later development <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Rocks</b> area led to bond stores and warehouses being built on the bay, with better housing and pubs for entertainment. Millions of cubic feet of sandstone was excavated from Sydney's Cockatoo Island to create a dry dock on the island.|$|E
