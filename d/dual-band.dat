5|$|The 5th {{generation}} iPad and 2nd generation iPad mini introduced {{support for}} many additional LTE bands worldwide. The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models {{come in two}} variants each, all of which support nano-SIMs, quad-band GSM, penta-band UMTS, and <b>dual-band</b> CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and B. Additionally, one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and TD-LTE bands 38, 39 and 40. Apple's ability to handle many different bands in one device allowed it to offer, for the first time, a single iPad variant which supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers {{at the time of}} the device's introduction. Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).|$|E
5|$|The insertion-loss {{method of}} {{designing}} filters is, in essence, to prescribe a desired function of frequency for the filter as an attenuation {{of the signal}} when the filter is inserted between the terminations relative to the level {{that would have been}} received were the terminations connected to each other via an ideal transformer perfectly matching them. Versions of this theory are due to Sidney Darlington, Wilhelm Cauer and others all working more or less independently and is often taken as synonymous with network synthesis. Butterworth's filter implementation is, in those terms, an insertion-loss filter, but it is a relatively trivial one mathematically since the active amplifiers used by Butterworth ensured that each stage individually worked into a resistive load. Butterworth's filter becomes a non-trivial example when it is implemented entirely with passive components. An even earlier filter which influenced the insertion-loss method was Norton's <b>dual-band</b> filter where the input of two filters are connected in parallel and designed so that the combined input presents a constant resistance. Norton's design method, together with Cauer's canonical LC networks and Darlington's theorem that only LC components were required {{in the body of the}} filter resulted in the insertion-loss method. However, ladder topology proved to be more practical than Cauer's canonical forms.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, 2009, Apple {{unveiled}} a new AirPort Extreme with simultaneous <b>dual-band</b> 802.11 Draft-N radios. This allows full 802.11 Draft-N 2x2 communication in both 802.11 Draft-N bands {{at the same}} time.|$|E

25|$|MT6630 (2014) is a five-in-one combo {{wireless}} SoC integrating <b>dual-band</b> 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, advanced Wi-Fi Direct and Miracast support, Bluetooth 4.1, ANT+, tri-band GPS and FM transceiver. It {{is intended}} to be paired with chips like the MT6595 octa-core smartphone processor which features an integrated 4G modem but no built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/GPS/FM functionality. It could also be used in tablets in conjunction with a stand-alone application processor.|$|E
25|$|Circa 2005 the Israeli Air Force {{purchased}} five Gulfstream G550-based Eitam {{aircraft to}} serve as the new IDF platform for its newer generation of AEW systems. The new aircraft use the EL/W-2085 <b>dual-band</b> sensor suite, and are more capable and less expensive to operate than the older Boeing 707-based EL/M-2075. Extensive modifications were made to the Gulfstream's fuselage by IAI, such as the addition of protruding composite radomes, to house the radar arrays in conformal body modifications. Based at Nevatim Airbase.|$|E
25|$|The missile {{carries a}} <b>dual-band</b> seeker in both IR and visible low-light video. The IR seeker is not cooled, which would {{restrict}} some performance for an anti-aircraft missile {{but is a}} major simplification for an infantry missile. In particular it avoids relying on a pressurised gas supply which {{would need to be}} replenished. A data link from the missile presents the seeker images back to the firing station for Man In The Loop control. This also allows a launch to be aborted without detonation, should a collateral civilian suddenly obscure the target.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2010, Pentagon {{acquisition}} chief Ashton Carter {{announced that}} they will be removing the SPY-4 S-band Volume Search Radar from the DDG-1000's <b>dual-band</b> radar to reduce costs as part of the Nunnâ€“McCurdy certification process. Due to the SPY-4 removal, the SPY-3 radar is to have software modifications so as to perform a volume search functionality. Shipboard operators will be able to optimize the SPY-3 for either horizon search or volume search. While optimized for volume search, the horizon search capability is limited. The DDG-1000 is still expected to perform local area air defense. This system is thought to provide high detection and excellent anti-jamming capabilities, particularly when used in conjunction with the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC). It is, however, not reported if the CEC system will be installed on the Zumwalt-class destroyers upon commissioning, but it is scheduled for eventual incorporation in the ship type.|$|E

[...] It gave the Hub 2 4.5 out of 5 stars and named it its new Editors' Choice for home automation hubs. In contrast, CNET gave the device three stars. The reviewer said the device is easy to set up and compatible with many devices, but gave the reviewer error messages. The reviewer was never able to successfully set it up the way she wanted. Tom's Guide gave the Wink Hub 2 7 out of 10. It also said the device was easy to use and compatible with many devices, but missing some advanced features.

2500|$|The Mectron / CTA / IAE / Avibras {{presented}} {{a new set}} of air-air missile MAA-1B (Bravo) during LAAD 2007. The missile uses the main structure of the fuselage, the warhead and proximity fuze and impact of the MAA-1A (Alpha), the rest being completely new. The new <b>dual-band</b> sensor (UV and IR) has 80% of nationalization, with great capability against countermeasures, high off-boresight capability (up to 90 degrees) with a very high speed browser and can be pointed at the target by radar at the pilot's helmet or perform autonomous search.

2500|$|Comcast {{operates}} {{a network of}} public Wi-Fi hotspots for Xfinity internet subscribers known as Xfinity WiFi, which consists of a mixture of hotspots installed in public locations and businesses, and those generated by supported Xfinity home gateways on an opt-out basis. Users on the [...] "Performance" [...] tier or higher receive unlimited usage of these hotspots after signing in with their Xfinity Account. By default, all <b>dual-band</b> Xfinity home gateways operate both a private network, and a public network with the SSID [...] "xfinitywifi". To conserve bandwidth, these hotspots are capped at 5 simultaneous users. Customers can opt out of providing Xfinity WiFi through either the Comcast website, or by installing a third-party router.|$|E
2500|$|Ubuntu Edge was a {{proposed}} smartphone with high-end specifications, often called a [...] "superphone". Edge {{would have been}} powered by a multi-core processor and at least 4GB of RAM. The internal storage would have been 128GB. A micro-SIM slot {{would have been a}}vailable. An 8 MP rear camera and 2 MP front-facing camera would also be available. The screen would have been a 4.5" [...] sapphire crystal display (claimed to be scratchable only by diamond) with 1280 x 720 HD resolution. On the connectivity side Edge would have included Dual-LTE, <b>dual-band</b> 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4 and NFC. GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, compass, barometer etc. would be included from the input side. It would have had Stereo speakers with HD audio and allowed use of a dual microphone recording system with active noise cancellation. Edge would have had an 11-pin connector providing simultaneous MHL and USB OTG. A 3.5mm jack would have been included and a silicon-anode Li-Ion battery would power the device.|$|E
