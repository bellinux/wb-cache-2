40|$|SUMMARY: Heavy metals, such us Pb and Cd {{are common}} {{pollutants}} in urban soils mainly due to traffic emissions. In order {{to investigate the}} spatial distribution of Pb and Cd in urban soils of Chania city, the soil samples were collected from the roadside of the major squares, parks and traffic islands at three depths (0 - 5 cm, 5 - 15 cm and 15 - 30 cm). The total and bioavailable forms of Pb and Cd were determined by using flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, after their extraction with boiling Aqua Regia and DTPA respectively. Total concentration data in the three depths, according to Polish contamination standards (<b>environmental</b> <b>guideline</b> for metal pollution in soils) indicated that the studied soils can be considered medium polluted of Pb and Cd. In all sampling sites, the total contents of Pb and Cd decreased with depth suggesting undisturbed conditions and airborne deposition. The bioavailable concentrations of the studied metals were low maybe due to basic soil pH and to high content of free calcium carbonate and decreased slightly with soil depth. The relative availability of Pb was about four times higher than Cd. The highest total and bioavailable concentrations of Pb and Cd {{were found in the}} centre of the city (Agora square) mainly due to heavy traffic load. Also GIS analysis was used to visualise the spatial distribution of the total concentrations of Pb and Cd in the surface soils (0 - 5 cm) in Chania city. 1...|$|E

40|$|The soil of a {{residential}} area in Tokyo {{was found to}} contain dioxins, namely polychlorinated dioxins, furans, and dioxin-like biphenyls, the levels of which exceeded the <b>environmental</b> <b>guideline</b> [1, 000  pg toxic equivalent (TEQ) /g] by up to 6. 8 times. To assess the exposure levels {{of people living in}} this area and to study the possible relationship of blood dioxin concentrations of children with breast milk and/or formula feeding, a health survey was carried out in 2006, involving a total of 138 people, including 66 children aged 3 – 15  years, and blood dioxin concentrations and the characteristics and lifestyles of these people were analyzed. Mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of blood dioxin concentrations (pg/g-lipid) of group  1 (3 – 6  years old), group  2 (7 – 15  years old), and group  3 (≥ 16  years old) were 13  ±  1. 9, 6. 6  ±  0. 65, and 10  ±  0. 54, respectively. The congener/isomer profile of dioxins in blood samples differed markedly from that of the contaminated soil samples. According to the feeding mode of children, blood dioxin concentrations (pg/g-lipid) were 17  ±  2. 9 for breast milk only, 7. 4  ±  0. 82 for both breast milk and formula, and 4. 7  ±  1. 1 for formula only, with a significant difference from one another.

40|$|Sheep dipping was a {{historic}} agricultural practice where sheep were immersed into insecticides to eradicate external parasites. Historical {{use of pesticides}} has caused localised soil contamination at former sheep dipping sites. There is limited information on offsite contamination such as in stream sediments, groundwater, and surface water. Predominant contaminants at historic sheep dipping sites are arsenic (As) and organochlorine (OC) compounds. There {{are estimated to be}} 50, 000 former sheep dip sites in New Zealand, of which, over 10, 000 are estimated to be in the Waikato Region. Contamination at historical sheep dip sites is potentially concerning for human and environmental health. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate a range of historic sheep dips to identify sites that had the highest leaching potential; (2) characterise the selected study sites; (3) establish the extent of contamination in soil, sediments, and water; (4) evaluate the extent of offsite contamination; and (5) assess compliance to <b>environmental</b> <b>guideline</b> limits. Soil samples from two former sheep dip sites were analysed for arsenic, copper, and organochlorines at depths of up to 20 cm. Further soil samples were analysed for arsenic at depths of up to 7. 5 cm. Stream water and sediment samples were analysed for arsenic, copper, and organochlorines at upstream, downstream, and discharge point of a dip site located on a flood zone. Arsenic (0 - 2, 839 mg/kg), dieldrin (0 - 8. 60 mg/kg), lindane (including by-products) (0 - 0. 560 mg/kg), DDT (including metabolites) (0 - 1. 200 mg/kg), and endrin (0 - 0. 127 mg/kg) were the main contaminants detected in soil samples. Concentrations of As (0. 9 - 32 mg/kg), dieldrin (0 - 0. 038 mg/kg), and benzene hexachloride (α-BHC and β-BHC) (0 - 0. 0031 mg/kg) were detected in stream sediments. Organochlorine was not detected in surface water. As in surface water ranged from 0 to 0. 0021 g/m 3, which was well below the maximum acceptable value (MAV) of 0. 01 g/m 3 for potable drinking water supplies. Arsenic concentrations in 142 soil samples were well above environmental guidelines for human habitation (30 mg/kg). Dieldrin recorded low to moderate contamination in soils with one sample exceeding the <b>environmental</b> <b>guideline</b> of 6 mg/kg. Arsenic in 4 of the 18 stream sediment samples were above the interim sediment quality low level guideline (ISQG-Low) of 20 mg/kg. Dieldrin concentrations in surface sediments up to 13 cm deep were well above the interim sediment quality high level guideline (ISQG-High) of 0. 008 mg/kg. α-BHC and β-BHC had no ISQG guideline. The levels detected were above the lindane guideline (ISQG-High) of 0. 001 mg/kg in surface sediments. Evidence of sheep dip chemicals moving away from a sheep dip site included arsenic, dieldrin, and DDT up to 100 m downhill from a dip site located on the margins of a steep slope with an adjacent gully. Elevated As was detected in stream sediments up to 40 m downstream of a dip site located on a flood zone. High level contamination from dieldrin, α-BHC, and β-BHC were recorded in downstream sediments. This study recommends that sheep dips located within 15 m of a stream and margins of steep slopes with an adjacent gully should be regarded as priority sites for contaminated land investigations that should include a monitoring programme...|$|E

Sediment samples were analyzed for trace metals, organic carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), emerging chemicals of concern (ECC) and sterols. Similarly, the biological and biochemical interaction between the reef and its environment was analyzed by the multi-omic tools of next-generation sequencing characterization of the bacterial community and microbial community metabolic profiling. Overall, the trace elements were observed {{at the lower end of}} the Australian <b>environmental</b> <b>guideline</b> values at the offshore sites, while higher values were observed for the onshore locations Nickel and copper were observed above the high trigger value threshold at the onshore sites. The levels of PAH were below limits of detection across all sites. However, some of the ECC and sterols were observed at higher concentrations at both onshore and offshore locations, notably, the cholesterol family sterols and 17 α-ethynylestradiol. Multi-omic analyses also indicated possible thermal and photo irradiation stressors on the bacterial communities at all the tested sites. The observed populations of γ-proteobacteria were found in combination with an increased pool of fatty acids that indicate fatty acid synthesis and utilisation of the intermediates of the shikimate pathways.

40|$|Golf is a {{precision}} sport {{and it is}} expected {{that there will be a}} trend in increasing the number of golfers playing in Sri Lanka, and perhaps new Golf courses to cater to the increasing demand, particularly among tourists, with the major development drive maintained by the government. Even though a golf course can contribute to the sustainability of the ecosystem, it may lead to many environmental risks associated with the activities of the golf courses, unless there are safeguards to protect the environment through proper environmental policies and practices, which can be adopted by all stakeholders, including the staff, clients and visitors of the Golf Course. To achieve the international standards while minimizing the environmental risks associated with them, it is necessary to have an environmental management system for golf courses. Even though the Government of Sri Lanka requires Environmental Imapact Assessments to be carried out for new Golf Courses, there are no monitoring regulations for operation of Golf Courses. Interviews with management staff of the Colombo Golf Club revealed that there is no proper <b>environmental</b> <b>guideline</b> for the golf courses in Sri Lanka at present. It is imperative to develop an <b>environmental</b> <b>guideline</b> and self assessment method suitable for adoption for Golf Courses in Sri Lanka, to ensure proper practices during the operation of the courses before any further damage is done to the environment. This study was carried out to develop an <b>environmental</b> <b>guideline</b> for Sri Lankan golf courses and a self assessment method in order to assist the management of the courses to evaluate their own operations against benchmarks and identify weak areas and take corrective actions where necessary. Review of literature revealed that there are diverse methods adopted by golf courses in USA, UK, Canada and Australia in order to minimize environmental risks caused by Golf Course operations. Having understood the commitment to safeguard the environment in golf courses by the developed countries, it was decided to develop a questionnaire to assess the situation with respect to various aspects of the operation of golf courses relevant to Sri Lanka, and provide guidelines for improvement of the weak areas. General information regarding the operations was collected by using a general questionnaire. After evaluating the methods used in the developed countries, it was decided that the most appropriate method suitable for adoption for the Sri Lankan situation was the Environmental Quotient Questionnaire method for self assessment used by the Unites States Air Force (USAF) and guidelines for preparation of a supporting document such as the Breckland Pines Golf Course Environmental Management Plan. The model questionnaire was prepared with 50 questions in ten subcategories, based on the relevant environmental aspects. The aspects covered were: policy, planning, wildlife & wildlife habitats, clubhouse operations, pest control, pesticide use, fertilizer use, water quality & use, safety and education & awareness. Even though the USAF self assessment method used equal weightages for all environmental aspects, it was decided to factor-in the importance of the aspects of the overall environmental profile of the local situation by giving weights to each category. Since all questions were of the type with three possible answers (yes/no/partial), the weights assigned to each aspect were reflected in the final total marks by varying the number of questions in each category. The number of questions was adjusted several times in order to achieve the intended purpose of capturing the importance as well as the status of environmental management of the golf courses. Thus, after several modifications, the model of the ECQ questionnaire was developed to a satisfactory level to be tested using field data. The final assessment of the Golf Course was obtained as a percentage of the possible 100 % if all 50 questions yielded positive answers, as two results - the actual ECQ (only 'yes' answers) and potential ECQ ('yes' and 'partial' answers). This questionnaire was tested with the data of Royal Colombo Golf Course (RCGC) and after minor modifications based on the results of the test, it was used to assess the other golf courses in the country. Benchmark values were also proposed for the status of the Golf Course depending on the ECQ values as per the table below. Total Yes or Partial response Environmental compatibility Level 90 % - 100 % Advance 70 % - 89 % Showing Progress 40 % - 69 % Getting Started 39 % or Less Urgent action needed The results of the assessment were compared to the actual status of the Golf courses as perceived by the employees and users of the courses, and were found to be comparable, which showed that the ECQ provided a reliable assessment of the environmental status of the Golf Course, and helped to identify the weak areas that needed urgent attention as well as long term improvements. Ten environmental best practice guidelines were prepared under the topics of policy, planning, wildlife & wildlife habitats, clubhouse operations, pest control, pesticide use, fertilizer use, water quality & use, safety and education & awareness, in order to help the Golf Course management to prepare their own Environmental Management Plans for present and future courses. The final recommendation is to use the ECQ method to assess the current status of existing courses, prepare an environmental management plan for each golf course using the guidelines and to monitor the golf courses annually with the self assessment method, in order to continually improve the ECQ and thus enhance the environmental performance of the Golf Course...|$|E
40|$|Areas of the subantarctic are isolated, cold, {{harsh and}} {{generally}} pristine. However, {{the presence of}} humans invariably leads to contamination, particularly around research stations and legacy refuse sites. Increases in ship visits to the region will heighten the chance of fuel spills and increase concentrations of contaminants including copper, due to its use as a biocide on ship hulls. Despite this increased risk of contamination, there is currently very limited data available on the sensitivity of subantarctic marine biota to contaminants, and no environmental quality guidelines exist for this region. This study is therefore the first marine-based comprehensive ecotoxicology study within the subantarctic. The aim of my thesis was to determine sensitivities of ten subantarctic marine invertebrates {{to a range of}} common metal contaminants (copper, lead, zinc). These data are intended ultimately to {{contribute to the development of}} water quality guidelines and risk assessments for the protection of the subantarctic. These guidelines would be applicable to many areas of the subantarctic, extending potentially to the southern areas of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. In addition, I determined the interactive effects of climate change stressors on the toxicity of copper to four taxa. This was particularly important as many areas of the subantarctic are already experiencing relatively rapid changes in climate. I conducted toxicity tests on ten marine invertebrate species at different life stages, collected from a variety of habitats within the intertidal and subtidal zones of subantarctic Macquarie Island. This required the development of specific test procedures in order to account for the unique characteristics of each species and of subantarctic biota in general. Copper was found to be the most toxic of the three metals tested. Sensitivity differed substantially between the ten species, and patterns appeared to correlate with the species distribution and habitat on the shoreline. Additionally, early life stages were generally more sensitive than adults, and additional climate change stressors altered copper toxicity. For example, an increase in as little as 2 °C significantly increased the toxicity of copper to a subantarctic copepod. Sensitivity to copper was particularly high for some species compared to analogous species from temperate and tropical regions. My work therefore highlights the need for the development of specific water quality guidelines for the subantarctic region based on the sensitivity of local taxa, as guidelines developed in other regions may not adequately protect subantarctic species from contaminants. This study emphasises that while the subantarctic is a relatively pristine environment, in the event of a large-scale contamination event, some species within the marine community would be highly susceptible and therefore long term impacts on this community are likely. Exacerbating this scenario, stressors associated with climate change are likely to further intensify impacts. I recommend that any future <b>environmental</b> <b>guideline</b> development for the subantarctic region consider early life stage sensitivity, include species from a wide range of habitats, and incorporate interactions with climate change variables...|$|E
40|$|The NSW Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) Environmental Guideline: Solid Waste Landfills state that, "the site capping (of a landfill) should {{ensure that}} the final surface {{provides}} a barrier to the migration of water into the waste, controls emissions to water and atmosphere, promotes sound land management and conservation, and prevents hazards and protects amenity". The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Guideline</b> identifies benchmark techniques to achieve these goals. The EPA recommends that the final capping should have five parts including a seal bearing layer, a gas drainage layer, a sealing layer, and infiltration drainage layer and a revegetation layer. This traditional approach to capping of the landfill aims to seal the surface so that rainfall cannot infiltrate the waste and landfill gas cannot escape into the atmosphere. This is a highly engineered and costly means of achieving the desired environmental goals. Experience in the Hunter Region is that the final covers created with a compacted clay sealing layer as recommended by the NSW EPA do not always achieve these required environmental goals. Problems relating to conventional covers include the availability of suitable materials, particularly for the low permeability sealing layer, the potential for cracking of the sealing layer particularly during extended dry conditions, the response to differential settlement within the waste and problems with revegetation. Thus opportunities exist to explore alternative options for the final cover of landfills. One type of alternative cover that is of i 8 ncreasing popularity in the United States is the evapotranspiration (ET) cover. In the United States, ET covers are in place or on trial {{at a variety of}} different types of landfill including those used for hazardous and municipal waste. Evidence suggests that these can perform well in a variety of climatic conditions. The principal behind ET covers id the effective management of water balance in the cover medium. Precipitation is balanced by evapotranspiration, water storage in the cover medium and influx to the underlying waste. In areas where the potential for evapotranspiration approaches or exceeds rainfall, the influx of water through the ET cover can be very low or neutral and can effectively control migration of water into the waste. This paper considers the potential for the use of ET covers in the Hunter Region. There are two key considerations: * Climatic factors - is evaporation greater than rainfall? Are there any critical climatic factors such as prolonged periods of high rainfall and low evaporation? Sample water balances are presented to demonstrate the applicability of ET covers in the Hunter Region. * Cover media factors - the water holding capacity of the cover medium, availability of materials and ability of the media to support vegetation. A variety of materials available in the Hunter, including naturally occurring soils and waste materials from power generation, coal mining and the waste management industries are assessed for their potential use in ET covers...|$|E

40|$|The federal {{sentencing}} <b>guidelines</b> for <b>environmental</b> crimes bark loudly, {{calling for}} sentences of imprisonment {{for all but}} the most trivial of environmental offenses. Although the terms of imprisonment are not long, the prospect of even a short period of incarceration is doubtlessly capable of getting the attention of the white-collar professionals who typically commit environmental offenses. Research I conducted in 2004, however, indicated that the bark of the <b>environmental</b> <b>guidelines</b> was considerably worse than their bite. Judges “departed” below the applicable guidelines range in an unusually high percentage of environmental cases, barely one-third of convicted environmental defendants received prison sentences, and only about forty percent of prison sentences exceeded one year in length. Although the data contained in my 2004 study were striking at the time, ensuing developments might appropriately raise questions as to their reliability today. For instance, the Supreme Court fundamentally restructured federal sentencing law through its 2005 decision in United States v. Booker, which changed the status of the federal sentencing guidelines from mandatory to advisory. With Booker and other developments in mind, the present article updates the data from my earlier study, demonstrating a surprising level of continuity from the Clinton to the Bush eras, and from pre-Booker to post-Booker. Simply put, despite notable institutional and legal changes, the bark of the <b>environmental</b> <b>guidelines</b> remains considerably worse than their bite. Finally, the article considers normative implications of the bark/bite gap. In light of the overarching purposes and premises of the federal sentencing system, the data provide important support for a fundamental redesign of the <b>environmental</b> <b>guidelines.</b> Failing such a redesign by the Sentencing Commission, the data should be regarded by the courts as providing some support for arguments by individual defendants that particular provisions of the <b>environmental</b> <b>guidelines</b> should not be applied to them...|$|R

40|$|Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is an {{alkaloid}} toxin {{produced by}} at least six bluegreen algal genera. In Australia, the most common producer organism is Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. This research determined the toxic effects and potential for toxin bioaccumulation associated with toxin-producing C. raciborskii, using environmentally relevant exposure scenarios. Short-term semi-static renewal ecotoxicity tests were conducted on four freshwater test organisms, using freeze-thawed C. raciborskii whole cell extracts or live cultures of C. raciborskii containing CYN. Duckweed (Spirodela oligorrhiza) demonstrated variable responses to whole cellextract exposures containing 0 – 500 μg L- 1 of CYN. Growth stimulation and growth inhibition were recorded from the duckweed, depending on toxin exposure concentrations and length of the incubation period. Chlorophyll content of Spirodela was also affected by toxin exposure, with small peaks in chlorophyll a recorded in conjunction with exposure to 8 μg L- 1 CYN. Changes to frond morphology (chlorosis, necrosis) and reduced root lengths were also noted, but these effects were not consistent throughout all trials. Bioconcentration of free CYN was not detected in the tissues of Spirodela; small quantities of toxin recovered from the tissues probably represented toxin sorption to the cell walls. Growth of water thyme (Hydrilla verticillata) was stimulated by exposure to whole cell extracts of C. raciborskii containing a maximum of 400 μg L- 1 CYN. Exposure to the test solutions appeared to promote the redistribution of plant resources in H. verticillata, and the possible benefits of this, {{particularly with respect to}} increased root production, were considered. Effects on the chlorophyll content of Hydrilla were variable and included decreases in total chlorophyll content and changes to the chlorophyll a:b ratio. Bioconcentration of free toxin was not detected in the tissues of Hydrilla. In trials with Melanoides tuberculata, exposure to whole cell extracts or live algal cultures did not significantly affect the behaviour or relative growth rates of adult snails. However, changes in the number of hatchlings released from parent snails were recorded: exposure to whole cell extracts corresponded with increased numbers of hatchlings compared with controls, whereas decreases in hatchling numbers compared with controls were recorded from treatments containing live C. raciborskii. Both bioconcentration and bioaccumulation occurred in the soft tissues of snails, although exposure to whole cell extracts resulted in only minor tissue contamination compared with that from live C. raciborskii exposures. Bioaccumulation of the analog deoxy-CYN was recorded in the soft tissues. M. tuberculata did not bioconcentrate CYN in the shell. Tadpoles of the cane toad (Bufo marinus) featured the most dramatic responses to the test solutions. Exposure to live C. raciborskii cultures resulted in up to 66 % mortality of B. marinus, whereas all tadpoles survived exposure to whole cell extracts of comparable CYN concentrations. Decreases in the time spent swimming and relative growth rates were recorded from surviving tadpoles during both types of exposure regimes. Histological examination of Bufo tissues revealed tissue injuries to multiple organs, with particular severity noted in the liver, intestine, nephric ducts and gill epithelia. The extent of cellular damage was similar in whole cell extract (containing a maximum of 400 μg L- 1 CYN) and the live culture trials (containing a maximum of 232 μg L- 1), despite the unequal toxin concentrations. Bioconcentration of CYN was not evident during the whole cell extract trial, whereas exposure to live cultures resulted in maximum average tissue concentrations of 895 μg toxin kg- 1 fresh weight. A secondary aim of the thesis was to identify and address gaps in management approaches for toxin bioaccumulation and possible environmental effects associated with toxin-producing C. raciborskii blooms. A predictive management strategy was developed to determine the likelihood of tissue contamination in aquatic organisms inhabiting water bodies affected by blooms. The ten-step framework for predicting bioaccumulation risk was based upon characteristics of cyanotoxin bioavailability, exposure and uptake routes during the progression of a toxic bloom. Key concepts included monitoring changes in toxin availability throughout the progression of a toxic bloom, and the prediction of bioaccumulation risks based on threshold toxin values for selected aquatic organisms. These threshold values were re-examined following the completion of the laboratory trials. Current approaches for the management of blooms with respect to environmental risks were discussed, and procedures for the proper evaluation of environmental risks associated with Cylindrospermopsis blooms were assessed. These included adequate detection and monitoring systems, setting of <b>environmental</b> <b>guideline</b> values, and options for the control and remediation of toxic blooms...|$|E
40|$|Chlorine has a {{wide variety}} of {{applications}} in water treatment. Because of its disinfectant efficacy, it is used world wide for the treatment of potable water, sewage, swimming pools and for the control of nuisance organisms in cooling towers. A problem arises when such chlorinated water enters the natural environment, as chlorine's greatest advantage, i. e. its germicidal capacity, becomes its greatest disadvantage. In particular, the discharge of heated, chlorinated water from cooling towers and chlorinated, treated sewage into rivers have severe consequences for the riverine flora and fauna. This study focused on the effects of chlorinated, treated sewage effluent on the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates in two rivers in KwaZulu-Natal viz. the Umsunduze River in the Pietermaritzburg area, and the Umbilo River in the Durban area. The study was conducted in three phases. The first two phases comprised a toxicological investigation of the effects of chlorine on a selected riverine macroinvertebrate, and the third phase comprised an ecotoxicological investigation of the effects of chlorinated treated sewage on benthic macroinvertebrate community structure. The first phase of the study involved the development of an artificial stream system which would be suitable for determining the response of a selected macroinvertebrate species to chlorine. Chlorine is both reactive and volatile, so this necessitated the development of a specialised flow-through system with apparatus which would allow continuous dosing of a sodium hypochlorite solution. The system was set up at the Process Evaluation Facility at Wiggins Waterworks, Durban, where raw water from lnanda Dam was used. The second phase involved the use of this artificial stream system to conduct acute 96 h toxicity tests. Baetid mayfly nymphs (Baetis harrisoni Barnard) were selected as the test organisms after a preliminary investigation found them to be suitable for survival under laboratory conditions. For comparative purposes, tests were run first on B. harrisoni from a relatively uncontaminated stream in a residential area of Westville, then on specimens from the severely impacted Umbilo River. The LC,O of chlorine for organisms from both sources was found to be in the region of 0. 004 mg/C (free chlorine). This value was well below the general effluent standard of 0. 1 mg/C in effect at the time. The recommended acute <b>environmental</b> <b>guideline</b> is 0. 001 mg/t. The third phase of the study involved field validation of the toxicity test results. It was hypothesised that since the LC so for free chlorine was 0. 004 mg/C, B. harrisoni would not be found downstream from a point source of chlorinated effluent where the concentration offree chlorine ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 2 mg/C, and that the macroinvertebrate community structure would also be altered. In order to test these hypotheses, benthic macro invertebrate community structure was investigated at several sites up- and downstream from the outlets of the Darvill Wastewater Works in the Umsunduze River and the Umbilo Sewage Purification Works in the Umbilo River. In addition, in order to differentiate between the effects of chlorinated and unchlorinated treated sewage, a section of the Umbilo River (upstream from the chlorinated discharge) was exposed to unchlorinated, treated sewage. In this way, a limited "before and after" sewage and an "upstream and downstream" from sewage investigation could be carried out. Organisms were collected from riffles (and from pools in the Umbilo River) and the samples were then sorted and organisms were identified to species level, where possible, otherwise to genus or family. Changes in community composition were shown graphically as pie charts of relative proportions of organisms found at each site, graphs of the average number of taxa at each site; and graphs of the average number of individuals at each site; Data from the Umbilo River were also analysed using TWINSPAN (Two-way indicator species analysis). In both the Umsunduze and the Umbilo rivers, the deleterious effects of the chlorinated effluent were clearly evident. At Umsunduze Site 3 and Umbilo Site 5 (both immediately downstream from the chlorinated effluent) both the number of taxa and number of individuals were substantially reduced, sometimes to zero. Where organisms were found at the next sites downstream (Sites 4 and 6 respectively), the samples were dominated by Chironomus. In contrast, the unchlorinated effluent in the Umbilo River caused very little difference in community structure. As predicted, B. harrisoni was not found in downstream samples in which chlorine was present, yet appeared to be relatively unaffected by the unchlorinated effluent, suggesting that chlorine, rather than the effluent was responsible for its absence at downstream sites. In conclusion, it would appear that while treated sewage effluent certainly causes changes in macroinvertebrate community structure, chlorination of this effluent leads to large scale destruction of the riverine community. This in tum delays the recovery process of the river, rendering a longer stretch unfit for use. The consequences of this delayed recovery are that the failure to meet the water quality requirements of the natural environment results in those of the other water users (agriculture, industry, domestic and recreation) not being met. This reduces the natural capacity of the riverine community to process organic waste and recover from the discharge of sewage effluent. Chlorination increases the distance of impaired water quality and environmental integrity which result from organically enriched treated sewage effluent. The results of the study indicated that the draft water quality guidelines for aquatic ecosystems, derived from inadequate data, and calculated with a safety factor, were the correct order of magnitude. The approach followed in the study will be useful in the development and refinement of water quality guidelines for aquatic ecosystems. ...|$|E
