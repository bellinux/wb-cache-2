5|$|Cullompton Manor House is a grade II* listed {{building}} with sections built in 1603 (dated panel and initials TT for Thomas Trock {{on the top}} corner of {{the front of the}} house) and 1718 (on a lead cistern head of a drainpipe, are the letters (L) S/WT (R) and the date 1718). It was originally a private residence and now forms part of the Manor House Hotel. It has a jettied half timbered front with four gables and stone <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> with upper windows on carved brackets. It was probably built in the sixteenth century but was refurbished in 1603 for Thomas Trock, a clothier. The original structure consisted only of the front part, in which there were three rooms and a passage on the ground floor, three rooms opening into each other on the floor above, and above again. The front room on the left was the former hall with large oak panels of the Queen Anne period, and a moulded and beamed ceiling. Part of an earlier newel stair which descended to the hall or kitchen survives above a back staircase. The house was remodelled in 1718 for William Sellock. At the front of the building is a hooded shell porch of the early 18th century supported on pilasters and the back of house is also early 18th century of red and blue brick, with windows with thick glazing bars beneath a hipped slate roof with coved eaves. It was given the name of The Manor House in 1850 by J. S. Upcott who owned the property at that time. During World War II it was requisitioned by the army and used to billet officers. The adjacent house, Veryards, was originally a separate residence but was bought by the owners of the Manor House Hotel and incorporated into the hotel in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The Kibbie Dome officially seats just 16,000 for football, {{making it}} the second {{smallest}} venue in Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A). A record crowd of 19,878 was recorded for the eightth consecutive rivalry game victory over Boise State in November 1989, during the schools' I-AA Big Sky era. The football field runs an unorthodox east-west, {{but even with the}} new translucent upper <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> (2009 and 2011), sun location is not a major visibility issue.|$|E
25|$|The side {{elevations}} {{have three}} windows {{similar to those}} on the east between the front and the transept. Below them the basement have three six-over-six double-hung sash windows. The single bay extent of the transept has another pointed window on the east and west, with a tripartite grouping of windows on the south end. The north transept has a fire escape on its east and north <b>end</b> <b>walls,</b> around the single round-arched window on that end. A shed-roofed addition fills the corner {{on the south side}} between the transept and the apse. It has a pointed window on the south face.|$|E
40|$|Secondary flows {{have been}} long {{recognised}} {{as a significant}} form of loss mechanism in turbomachinery. They have a major influence over {{the performance of the}} blade rows since they cause unsteadiness in the mainstream flow. This consequently affects not only the mechanical integrity of the blades but also causes extra loss. This research is aimed to reduce secondary flows using a novel method; <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling. Profile 2 <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> was designed by Rolls Royce pic. with improved design features compared to its predecessor, Profile 1 <b>end</b> <b>wall.</b> Profile 2 <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> was manufactured and tested using the test facility available at the University of Durham. The flow was measured at two different axial positions, together with <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> static measurements and flow visualisation. The inlet flow conditions were also checked for consistency. These results were analysed and compared to Profile 1 and Planar <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profile results, which have been studied previously by Hartland [1999]. Profile 2 <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> achieved better secondary flow reduction compared to the Planar <b>end</b> <b>wall.</b> However Profile 1 <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> still proved to be better compared to both Profile 2 and the Planar <b>end</b> <b>wall.</b> This project has provided a thorough understanding of the various flow mechanisms in turbines and the available techniques in eliminating secondary flows. The application of <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling has still shown potential in being a reliable method. It is also important that the flow physics is understood in detail to determine the shape of the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profile that will be effective...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} investigations, effect of {{streamwise}} <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> fences {{on the performance}} improvement of a turbine is studied. The fences with heights of 12 mm, 16 mm were attached normal to the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> and at a half pitch away from the blades. A miniaturized pressure probe was traversed at the exit of the cascade from midspan to the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> at 26 locations covering more points in the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> region. For each spanwise location, the probe was traversed in the pitchwise direction for more than 25 points covering one blade pitch. The boundary layer fence near the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> remains effective in changing the path of pressure side of leg of horseshoe and weaken the cross flow. The overturn in flow has reduced near the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> when fences are incorporated while outside <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> and in loss core region, it&# 13; underturns slightly as result of reduction in secondary loss. The total loss is reduced by 15 %, 25 % for fences of height 12 mm, and 16 mm respectively. The corresponding change was obtained in the drag and lift coefficients...|$|R

The device comprises an elongate cylinder having first <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> means at one end thereof and second <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> means {{at the opposite end}} thereof whereby to define a chamber. Inlet means are provided for forcibly introducing the particulate waste product and combustion supporting gas tangentially into the chamber adjacent the first <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> means and axially toward the second <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> means to form an outer helical flow layer adjacent the inner surface of the cylinder which reacts with the second <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> means to reverse axial direction and form a second helical flow layer {{within the confines of the}} outer layer. Exhaust conduit means extend through the first <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> means and present a discharge mouth disposed concentrically within the chamber and positioned beyond the inlet means toward the second <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> means. Means are further provided for heating the chamber sufficiently to at least partially decompose the waste products.

25|$|In December 1947, Eagle Farm {{was in the}} {{possession}} of the Department of Civil Aviation. Originally, the land had been acquired in the Department's name, but further areas were acquired through funds by the Department of Air. In April 1948, through the Commonwealth Disposals Commission, the Department of Civil Aviation took control of various assets erected for the RAAF at Eagle Farm from the Department of Air. In May 1949, the transfer took place of buildings, contents, equipment and services from the Commonwealth to the Department of Civil Aviation for £301,318.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} detailed {{investigations of}} the effect of <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling on the secondary loss in a turbine nozzle row. The purpose of this project was to obtain a detailed view of the flow structure downstream of the blade passage, especially of the area adjacent to the <b>end</b> <b>wall,</b> and the influence of the shaped <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> on both flow and loss. The cascade was designed and manufactured by Yan [1999] based on nozzle blades by ALSTOM Energy Ltd. The low speed wind tunnel used by Yan was also used for the experimental work of this thesis, which were carried out in Durham thermodynamic laboratories. Two finer probes were used for the experiments allowing closer to the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> measurements. ». The flow field was investigated at exit from the blade row through two traverse slots. The secondary flow structure was understood and the effect of the profiled <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> was demonstrated by a reduction in the secondary loss and boundary layer thickness. The data collected along with the previous work by Yan could be regarded as an indication of the possible advantages of <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling in a real turbine. The next step would be to carry out similar work on real turbomachinery...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{investigation of the}} motion of bi-sized particles in a short rotating drum by using Discrete Element Method (DEM). The side wall of the drum has equally spaced gaps whose width is just between the two particle diameters. One <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> of the drum is fixed while the other rotates with the side wall. Small particles are fed into the drum continuously at the center region in the axial direction. The effect of rotating speed on the volumetric holdup and residence time of small particle is investigated. A critical rotating speed is found, below which the decrease of rotating speed will increase the volumetric holdup and the residence time of the small particles sharply. A jump in the axial distribution of the outflow rate of the small particles is observed at the region adjacent to the fixed <b>end</b> <b>wall.</b> The flow pattern inside the drum is analyzed. In the region between the fixed <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> and the feeding point, all small particles, on average, move towards the fixed <b>end</b> <b>wall.</b> While in the region between the rotating <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> and the feeding point, the small particles curve away the rotating <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> in {{the upper part of}} the charge and return to this wall in the lower part. The particle temperature distributions at different rotating speeds are explored to understand the flow behavior observed in these simulations. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

They also now show the problem of dealing with multiple painted schemes on the same area of wall. The paintings were conserved in 1991, revealing multiple images from various time periods, and decisions will have been made about when to leave some paint in place, and when to reveal older paintings at the expense of those on top.|$|E
25|$|The furnace {{was placed}} in the space between the tube banks. Early boilers were {{manually}} coal fired, later oil fired. The boiler was enclosed in a sealed casing of steel, lined with firebricks. Brick-lined <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> to this casing housed the firedoors or oil burner quarls, but had no heating surface. The uptake flue from the boiler was in the centre top of the casing, the exhaust gases passing around the steam drum. To reduce corrosion from flue gases over the drum, it was sometimes wrapped in a simple deflector shroud. Usually {{the lower part of the}} water drums were exposed outside the casing, but only the ends of the steam drum emerged. The water level was at around one-third of the steam drum diameter, enough to cover the ends of the submerged water-tubes.|$|E

25|$|Employing asymmetry, heavy massing, {{high quality}} brickwork, {{semi-circular}} forms and simplified ornamentation, {{the design of}} St Paul's combines characteristics of Gothic, Romanesque and Arts and Crafts styles. The church is constructed in dark-red-brown Flemish bond brickwork, with painted render dressings defining features such as string courses, copings, lintels and sills (internally and externally). Stepped and plain buttresses support the exterior walls, and arched openings are constructed from multiple rowlock (brick-on-edge) courses. The prominent roof form is clad with rib-and-pan profile metal sheeting (replaced in 1997), and features flared eaves supported on decoratively trimmed rafters with a raked soffit of tongue-and-groove boards. The nave <b>end</b> <b>walls</b> are topped with stone cross finials, and gable ends to the vestries and entrance porch are finished with basket weave patterned brickwork. The entrance porch features a radiating arch with deep angled brick jambs, rounded window openings and a boarded ceiling. The belfry atop the octagonal bell tower is enclosed with fixed timber louvres between brick piers of alternating, three-course bands of rendered and face brickwork capped by a concrete hemispherical cupola.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{secondary}} flow feature, previously unreported for turbine blading {{as far as}} the authors are aware, has been discovered. It has been found {{that it is possible to}} separate part of the inlet boundary layer on the blade row <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> as it is being over-turned and rolled up into the passage vortex. This flow feature has been discovered during a continuing investigation into the aerodynamic effects of non-axisymmetric <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling. Previous work, using the low speed linear cascade at Durham University, has shown the potential of <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling for reducing secondary losses. The latest study, the results of which are described here, was undertaken to determine the limits of what <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling can achieve. The flow has been investigated in detail with pressure probe traversing and surface flow visualization. This has found that the inlet boundary locally separates, on the early suction side of the passage, generating significant extra loss which feeds directly into the core of the passage vortex. The presence of this new feature gives rise to the unexpected result that the {{secondary flow}}, as determined by the exit flow angle deviations and levels of secondary kinetic energy, can be reduced while at the same time the loss is increased. CFD was found to calculate the secondary flows moderately well compared with measurements. However, CFD did not predict this new feature, nor the increase in loss it caused. It is concluded that the application of non-axisymmetric <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling, although it has been shown to be highly beneficial, can give rise to adverse features that current CFD tools are unable to predict. Improvements to CFD capability are required in order to be able to avoid such features, and obtain the full potential of <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> profiling...|$|R

Secondary flow comparisons show the time-marching solution more accurately predicting the underturning of the flow in the outer portion of the <b>end</b> <b>wall</b> boundary layer while the space-marching method more accurately predicted the overturning of the flow very near the <b>end</b> <b>wall.</b> The prediction comparisons are discussed along with computational details and other attributes of the two methods...|$|R
