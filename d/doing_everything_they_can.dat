In January 2016, the creators of the couple's official fan site ceased operations indefinitely, feeling as if the writers and producers were not truly invested in writing for the couple outside of how they affected Neil.

On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC, A Concert for Hurricane Relief, West (a featured speaker) accused President George W. Bush of not [...] "caring about black people". When West was presenting alongside actor Mike Myers, he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the media's portrayal of hurricane victims, saying:I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, 'They're looting.' You see a white family, it says, 'They're looking for food.'

[...] At this point, telethon producer Rick Kaplan cut off the microphone and then cut away to Chris Tucker, who was unaware of the cut for a few seconds. Still, West's comment reached much of the United States. Bush stated in an interview that the comment was [...] "one of the most disgusting moments" [...] of his presidency. In November 2010, in a taped interview with Matt Lauer for the Today show, West expressed regret for his criticism of Bush. [...] "I would tell George Bush in my moment of frustration, I didn't have the grounds to call him a racist", he told Lauer. [...] "I believe that in a situation of high emotion like that we as human beings don't always choose the right words." [...] The following day, Bush reacted to the apology in a live interview with Lauer saying he appreciated the rapper's remorse. [...] "I'm not a hater", Bush said. [...] "I don't hate Kanye West. I was talking about an environment in which people were willing to say things that hurt. Nobody wants to be called a racist if in your heart you believe in equality of races."Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize. [...] "It was not the particulars of your words that mattered, it was the essence of a feeling of the insensitivity towards our communities that many of us have felt for far too long", argued Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons. Bush himself was receptive to the apology, saying, [...] "I appreciate that.
