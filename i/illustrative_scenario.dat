40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{strategy}} to compute minimum-time trajectories for quadrotors. In particular, we consider the motion in constrained environments, {{taking into account the}} physical limitations of the vehicle. Instead of approaching the optimization problem in its standard time-parameterized formulation, the proposed strategy is based on an appealing re-formulation. Transverse coordinates, expressing the distance from a "reference" path, are used to parameterize the vehicle position and a spatial parameter is used as independent variable. This re-formulation allows us to (i) obtain a fixed horizon problem and (ii) easily formulate (even complex) position constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is proven by numerical computations on two different <b>illustrative</b> <b>scenarios...</b>|$|R
