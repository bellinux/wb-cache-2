40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed to quantify the total <b>integrated</b> <b>dose</b> due to a radionuclide species i emplaced in a geologic repository; {{the focus is on}} the seven long-lived fission products (LLFPs). The methodology assumes continuous exposure water contaminated with species i at the accessible environment (i. e., just beyond the geologic barrier afforded by the geologic repository). The dose integration is performed out to a reference post-release time. The <b>integrated</b> <b>dose</b> is a function of the total initial inventory of radionuclide i the repository, the time at which complete and instantaneous failure of the engineered barrier (e. g., waste canister) in, a geologic repository occurs, the fractional dissolution rate (from waste solid form) of radionuclide i in ground water, the ground water travel time to the accessible environment, the retardation factor (sorption on the geologic media) for radionuclide i, the time after radionuclide begins to enter the biosphere. In order to assess relative dose, the ratio of total <b>integrated</b> <b>dose</b> to that for a reference LLFP species j (e. g., {sup 99 }Tc) was defined. This ratio is a measure of the relative benefit of transmutation of other LLFPs compared to {sup 99 }Tc. This methodology was further developed in order to quantify the <b>integrated</b> <b>dose</b> reduction per neutron utilized for LLFP transmutation in accelerator-driven transmutation technologies (ADTT). This measure of effectiveness is a function of the <b>integrated</b> <b>dose</b> due to LLFP species i, the number of total captures in LLFP species i chain per LLFP nuclide fed to the chain at equilibrium, and the number of total captures in related transmutation product (TP) chains per capture in the LLFP species i chain.

40|$|BACKGROUND The <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler is {{difficult}} to use correctly, synchronising actuation with inhalation being the most important problem. A breath actuated pressurised inhaler, designed to help patients with poor inhaler technique, was compared with a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler in terms of aerosol deposition and bronchodilator response. METHODS Radioaerosol deposition and bronchodilator response to 100 micrograms salbutamol were measured in 18 asthmatic patients, who inhaled from a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler by their own chosen <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler technique, from a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler by a taught <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler technique, and from a breath actuated pressured inhaler (Autohaler). RESULTS In the 10 patients who could coordinate actuation and inhalation of the inhaler on their own deposition of aerosol in the lungs and bronchodilator response were equivalent on the three study days. By contrast, in the eight patients who could not coordinate the mean (SEM) percentage of the dose deposited in the lungs with their own inhaler technique (7. 2 % (3. 4 %] was substantial lower than those attained by the taught <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler technique (22. 8 % (2. 5 %] and by Autohaler (20. 8 % (1. 7 %].

We aimed to obtain quantitative evidence supporting the radiation protection methods used dur-ing previous CT fluoroscopy. A multislice CT scanner was used to perform this study. OSL dosimeters were placed on the top and the lateral side of the chest phantom so that the lon-gitudinal direction of dosimeters was parallel to the orthogonal axis-to-slice plane for mea-surement of dose profiles in CT fluoroscopy.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 In the U. S., the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is {{responsible}} for setting annual dose limits. For cases of hot particle contamination these limits are set at depths in skin of 7 mg/cm², 300 mg/cm², and 1000 mg/cm². However, at such shallow depths, the lack of charged particle equilibrium (CPE) precludes the use of traditional fluence-to-dose conversion methods. In this work, an enhanced photon dosimetry model is constructed based on simulations of photon point sources using MCNP 5 (Monte Carlo N Particle version 5) transport code. An empirical relationship between KERMA and absorbed dose was established, and used to develop a correction factor, f[subscript CPE], accounting {{for the lack of}} charged particle equilibrium (CPE) at shallow depths. This correction factor, in conjunction with traditional point-kernel fluence-to-dose conversion, provides a more accurate prediction of photon dose. The photon model is implemented such that empirical mathematical formulations, rather than look-up tables, drive the estimation of <b>integrated</b> <b>dose</b> over a disk up to 10 cm².

With this device, regular manually operated <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhalers become automatic. During the study, an inhalation simulator was designed and tested with the newly developed mechatronic system. By adjusting the volume and the pressure of the vacuum tank, most human inhalation waveforms were able to simulate. As an example, regular quick-deep and slow-deep waveforms were matched within reasonable accuracy. Finally, with the help of dynamic image processing, the aerosol-release time (Tr) was carefully measured and fully discussed, including the switch-on time (Ts), the mechatronics-hysteresis (Tm) and the intentional-delay (Ti). Under slow-deep inhalation condition which is suitable for <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler medicine delivery, the switch-on flow-rate could reach as low as 10 [*]L/min, and the corresponding switch-on time was approximately 0. 20 [*]s.

40|$|To {{provide better}} {{data on the}} {{production}} of secondary particles as input for treatment planning systems for carbon ion therapy, experimental studies on 12 C fragmentation in water phantoms were performed at GSI. This included also measurements on the dose contribution of secondary neutrons. Systematic data on the neutron dose behind a water target were obtained in previous measurements[1], using a WENDI-II neutron dose meter[2]. Recent studies on carbon fragmentation[3, 4] have shown that more charged particels than neutrons emerge from the target at small forward angles. At 0 ◦, the ratio of He- to H-fragments to neutrons is about 2. 6 : 1. 2 : 1. This means that a neutron <b>dose</b> <b>meter</b> placed at 0 ◦ is exposed to a mixed radiation field of charged particles and neutrons. The response of the neutron <b>dose</b> <b>meter</b> to charged particles is therefore an important question. Response functions of WENDI-II for n, p, and 4 He were calculated using the PHITS code[5]. The response {{was assumed to be}} proportional to the energy deposition in the 3 He proportional counter in the core of WENDI-II.

Internal fluxes of either O 3 or SO 2 were reduced by up to 50 % during exposure to combined versus individual pollutants; the greatest reduction occurred with simultaneous versus sequential combinations of the pollutants. Stomatal conductance to H 2 O was substantially altered by the pollutant exposures, with O 3 molecules twice as effective as SO 2 molecules in inducing stomatal closure.
