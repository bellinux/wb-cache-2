50|$|Unlike a high {{fidelity}} speaker, the Vibratone was {{specifically designed to}} alter or modify the sound. It consisted of a single <b>driver</b> <b>unit,</b> particularly a 10-inch guitar speaker, with a 15-inch Styrofoam cylindrical rotor in front of it. The cylinder was electrically rotated to create various effects, like chorus and vibrato, based on the Doppler effect. The effect could be changed, via a two-button footswitch, between slow and fast speeds, or switched off altogether.|$|E

The {{microphone}} had a metal reflector which concentrated the sound waves, allowing the speaker {{to stand back}} so it wouldn't obscure his face. The early vacuum tubes couldn't produce much gain, and even with six tubes the amplifier had low power. To produce enough volume, the system used a horn loudspeaker. The cylindrical <b>driver</b> <b>unit</b> under the horn contained the diaphragm which was vibrated by the voice coil and sent to a flaring horn, which produced far more sound power from a given amplifier than a cone speaker. Horns were used in virtually all early PA systems, and are still used in most systems today.|$|E

The article postulated that energy {{from the rear of}} a <b>driver</b> <b>unit</b> could be essentially absorbed, without damping the cone's motion or superimposing internal reflections and resonance, so Bailey and Radford reasoned that the rear wave could be channeled down a long pipe.

A pipe of sufficient length could be tapered, and stuffed so that the energy loss was almost complete, minimizing output from the open end.
