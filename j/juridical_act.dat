60|$|Carry the {{principle}} on by which you expelled Mr. Wilkes, {{there is not}} a man in the House, hardly a man in the nation, who may not be disqualified. That this House should have no power of expulsion is a hard saying. That this House should have a general discretionary power of disqualification is a dangerous saying. That the people should not choose their own representative, is a saying that shakes the Constitution. That this House should name the representative, is a saying which, followed by practice, subverts the constitution. They have the right of electing, you have a right of expelling; they of choosing, you of judging, and only of judging, of the choice. What bounds shall be set to the freedom of that choice? Their right is prior to ours, we all originate there. They are the mortal enemies of the House of Commons, who would persuade them to think or to act as if they were a self-originated magistracy, independent of the people and unconnected with their opinions and feelings. Under a pretence of exalting the dignity, they undermine the very foundations of this House. When the question is asked here, what disturbs the people, whence all this clamour, we apply to the treasury-bench, and they tell us it is from the efforts of libellers and the wickedness of the people, a worn-out ministerial pretence. If abroad the people are deceived by popular, within we are deluded by ministerial, cant. The question amounts to this, whether you mean to be a legal tribunal, or an arbitrary and despotic assembly. I see and I feel the delicacy and difficulty of the ground upon which we stand in this question. I could wish, indeed, that they who advised the Crown had not left Parliament in this very ungraceful distress, in which they can neither retract with dignity nor persist with justice. Another parliament might have satisfied the people without lowering themselves. But our situation is not in our own choice: our conduct in that situation is all that is in our own option. The substance of the question is, to put bounds to your own power by the rules and principles of law. This is, I am sensible, a difficult thing to the corrupt, grasping, and ambitious part of human nature. But the very difficulty argues and enforces the necessity of it. First, because the greater the power, the more dangerous the abuse. Since the Revolution, at least, the power of the nation has all flowed with a full tide into the House of Commons. Secondly, because the House of Commons, as it is the most powerful, is the most corruptible part of the whole Constitution. Our public wounds cannot be concealed; to be cured, they must be laid open. The public does think we are a corrupt body. In our legislative capacity we are, in most instances, esteemed a very wise body. In our judicial, we have no credit, no character at, all. Our judgments stink in the nostrils of the people. They think us to be not only without virtue, but without shame. Therefore, the greatness of our power, and the great and just opinion of our corruptibility and our corruption, render it necessary to fix some bound, to plant some landmark, which we are never to exceed. That is what the bill proposes. First, on this head, I lay it down as a fundamental rule in the law and constitution of this country, that this House has not by itself alone a legislative authority in any case whatsoever. I know that the contrary was the doctrine of the usurping House of Commons which threw down the fences and bulwarks of law, which annihilated first the lords, then the Crown, then its constituents. But the first thing that was done on the restoration of the Constitution was to settle this point. Secondly, I lay it down as a rule, that the power of occasional incapacitation, on discretionary grounds, is a legislative power. In order to establish this principle, if it should not be sufficiently proved by being stated, tell me what are the criteria, the characteristics, by which you distinguish between a legislative and a <b>juridical</b> <b>act.</b> It will be necessary to state, shortly, the difference between a legislative and a <b>juridical</b> <b>act.</b> A legislative act has no reference to any rule but these two: original justice, and discretionary application. Therefore, it can give rights; rights where no rights existed before; and it can take away rights where they were before established. For the law, which binds all others, does not and cannot bind the law-maker; he, and he alone, is above the law. But a judge, a person exercising a judicial capacity, is neither to apply to original justice, nor to a discretionary application of it. He goes to justice and discretion only at second hand, and through the medium of some superiors. He is to work neither upon his opinion of the one nor of the other; but upon a fixed rule, of which he has not the making, but singly and solely the application to the case.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea about}} the {{foundation}} of a veterinary medical faculty in Bulgaria emerges because of the need of veterinary certification of livestock production and export combined with the impossibility to ensure the needed number of veterinary professionals by tuition in foreign veterinary medicine universities. The proposal was first brought up in 1897, and, after several unsuccessful attempts, was resurrected again after the First World War. The moving force of this process is the Association of Veterinary Professionals in Bulgaria. The government of Alexander Stambolijski has made the first decisive steps in this respect, by submitting a bill in the 19th Ordinary National Assembly. The bill was presented by Stoyan Omarchevski, Minister of Public Education. Thus, in 1921, the amendment to the Public Education Act reglamented {{the foundation of a}} Faculty of Veterinary Medicine with 9 departments, as the 7th faculty of the Sofia University. The Act was approved with a Decree 145 from July 11, 1921 signed by His Majesty Boris III.

40|$|Juridical acts {{certainly}} {{play a very}} fundamental role in {{the organizational}} and functional aspects of the Church. They affect the juridical condition and status of persons, whether physical or juridical. Aware of their importance, the Church has attempted to provide some guidelines or general principles concerning them. The focus of this dissertation is a comprehensive and systematic analysis {{of the nature and}} application of juridical acts according to canon 124 of the Code of Canon Law. This canon has determined that for a <b>juridical</b> <b>act</b> to be valid, it must be placed by a person who is capable, and also it must contain those elements which essentially constitute the act itself, as well as the formalities and requisites imposed by the law for the validity of the act. It has further established that a <b>juridical</b> <b>act</b> properly placed, as far as its external elements are concerned, is presumed to be valid. In chapter one, an analysis of the concepts and principles on juridical acts as provided by the 1917 Code is presented. This analysis concentrates on four areas: (1) the notion of a <b>juridical</b> <b>act,</b> (2) its essential elements, (3) impediments to, and (4) efficacy of juridical acts. The Second Vatican Council and the revision of the Code of Canon Law introduced certain theologico-juridical principles which were to have significant impact on the entire juridical system of the Church, including the very notion and applicability of juridical acts. This is the focus of chapter two. As a consequence of their importance in the Church's life, the principles and norms governing juridical acts enjoy special consideration in the 1983 Code. They are presented in a systematic manner in the context of General Norms which have universal application. A comprehensive analysis of the elements mentioned in canon 124 is contained in chapter three. This analysis of the canon identifies some important conclusions on the nature of a <b>juridical</b> <b>act</b> and its applicability. There are certain factors which may impede a person from validly placing a <b>juridical</b> <b>act.</b> The Code has identified these in canons 125 [...] 126. They are: force, fear, deceit, error, and ignorance. In chapter four, these factors are subjected to a brief examination in order to demonstrate how they may affect juridical acts. The method employed in this study is historical and analytical. The historical perspective traces the origin and development of canon 124, while the analytical method is directed more toward a systematic analysis of canon 124 {{within the context of the}} general norms and its applicability to all canons of the 1983 Code of Canon Law...|$|E
40|$|Unlike the French Civil code, the German Civil code {{belongs to}} the group of {{so-called}} anti-causalistic codifications, since it explicitly does not govern the issue of purpose (cause) of contract. Due to this very reason, the delineation between abstract and causal <b>juridical</b> <b>acts</b> gains special importance in German law. The German Civil Code governs a number of <b>juridical</b> <b>acts</b> and other acts of legal importance that are abstract in their nature. Among them the abstract nature of the promise to fulfill an obligation (Schuldversprechung) and the acknowledgement of a debt (Schuldannerkennung) is traditionally considered the most prominent. However, the relation to the purpose for which they are concluded is not entirely interrupted, since in the case of frustration of their purpose, any asset given to the other party is subject to restitution under the rules of unjustified enrichment. The fact that the issue of purpose of contract is not explicitly governed in the German Civil Code, does not lead to the conclusion, though, that it is legally irrelevant. It gains legal relevance in two different aspects: as a licit and as an illicit purpose. On the one hand, <b>juridical</b> <b>acts</b> concluded with the aim to achieve illicit purposes are considered void, for which the Code's sections on the general confines of the principle of freedom of contract serve the statutory basis - such <b>juridical</b> <b>acts</b> infringe the institution of 'good customs' (gute Sitten), usually referred to as public policy, while the performance of other factual or legal acts in order to achieve illicit purposes are sanctioned under the rules of unjustified enrichment. On the other hand, lawful purposes of the parties gain legal relevance in relation to a range of various institutions. Concerning some of them the Code itself contains formulations implying the necessity to ascertain the purpose of contract, while in other cases the case law and the doctrine have come to such conclusion. The determination of the purpose of contract in the context of these institutions either secures the fulfilment of the purpose of assumption of contractual obligation of one of the parties or rectifies the consequences of the frustration of the fulfilment of that purpose. In this range surely the most important institutions are the collapse of the basis of transac tion or frustration of purpose (Störung der Geschäftsgrundlage), a special case of discharge of contract due to impossibility, whereby the purpose of contract is realized without the performance of debtor's obligation, a special case of unjustified enrichment due to frustration of the result aimed by the purpose of the transaction and the invalidity of standard business terms that jeopardize the fulfillment of the purpose of contract...|$|R

40|$|Once having {{defined the}} causa of an {{agreement}} (and, in general, of a <b>juridical</b> <b>act,</b> i. e. “negozio giuridico”) as its effective and objective purpose – the latter being the attitude of an act to realize a specific balance of interests (“causa concreta”) – the thesis is aimed at showing that the causa can be grounded (also) upon objective external referents, i. e. elements or circumstances which are able to constitute and influence the specific purpose of an act from an objective point of view, although they cannot per se be deduced from the subject matter (“oggetto”) {{and structure of the}} <b>juridical</b> <b>act</b> at hand. Such referents may consist in effects of different acts, or in facts and circumstances, including {{the context in which the}} act is concluded and will be performed. Through an analysis of different juridical figures – with particular regard to links between agreements, atypical gratuitous acts and “pagamento traslativo”, guarantees and unilateral obligations to keep harmless, and acts of waiver – the attention is focused on the relevance of concurrence of interests (also based on external referents) in order to assess the real and effective causa, even in absence of any exchange of counterperformances (“sinallagma”) or of any purpose of liberality. In light of the above, the thesis concludes dealing with some applicative consequences of the above-mentioned principles, with particular regard, on one side, to the assessment of validity and protectability of juridical acts and, on the other side, to the possibility to apply the remedies related to the termination of agreements when an external objective referent fails, even if the involved <b>juridical</b> <b>act</b> does not provide mutual counterperformances...|$|E

40|$|Juridical {{acts are}} drafted {{in order to}} create legal effects. Giving effect is, however, not always as easy as it might seem at first sight. During the {{execution}} of the <b>juridical</b> <b>act,</b> it frequently is unclear which obligations it actually entails. This lack of clarity results from the fact that juridical acts are concluded using a code, which is language. Because of the vagueness of expression or {{as a result of the}} indistinctness of language, the uttered intention is not always in agreement with the real one. Sometimes an expression has more than one meaning. Besides, words are never clear. They derive their meaning from a context. Therefore all communication, including every <b>juridical</b> <b>act,</b> needs to be interpreted. This PhD investigates the interpretation of juridical acts. All juridical acts volitional acts. Therefore, the governing interpretation criterion has to be the intention. When it comes to unilateral acts, the intention is the will of the party who undertakes a performance. When it comes to reciprocal acts, the intention is the common will of the contracting parties. Two different approaches can govern the search for the intention. One the one hand, one can argue that the real intention has to be decisive. A contract comes into being as a result of a consensus, and intention is also the base of every unilateral <b>juridical</b> <b>act.</b> On the other hand, one can reason that the written word is of overriding importance. It is the outward reflection of the intention, which the other party and third parties have become acquainted with. In some jurisdictions, the essential rule of interpretation is subjective, while other jurisdictions start from the premise that interpretation has to be fundamentally objective. In practice, however, all interpretative systems use subjective as well as objective components. This finding of course triggers the question: which interpretative system is the best one? This PhD investigates what a coherent and practicable system of interpretation of jurdical acts should look like, taking into account the autonomy of the parties on the one hand and legal certainty on the other hand. nrpages: 803 P. status: publishe...|$|E

First, it is {{explained that the}} reason for asking this question follows from the candidate’s background in a civil law jurisdiction, in which unilateral <b>juridical</b> <b>acts</b> are regarded a category of legally relevant behaviour. After observing the obstacles in English law to the recognition of the civil law concept of unilateral <b>juridical</b> <b>acts,</b> a number of examples of unilateral conduct are identified that create legal effect. The focus of the thesis is on examples of unilateral conduct that create, vary or discharge obligations. English law allows the creation of obligations by unilateral conduct only in very specific instances. It is observed that unilateral conduct can create or transfer property rights. The different approach is explained primarily by deeply rooted distinction in English law between words and acts. Subsequently, the thesis discusses how unilateral conduct is regulated. For some issues, notably interpretation, revocability and the intention to create legal effect, similar rules apply to the different examples of unilateral conduct. For other issues, especially mistake and form requirements, the rules diverge. It is concluded that unilateral conduct forms a category of legally relevant behaviour in English law. This category is divided in unilateral conduct that creates obligations, quasi-contractual unilateral conduct that varies or discharges obligations and unilateral voluntary property transactions. Whereas quasi-contractual unilateral conduct is closely related to contracts and should thus generally be regulated {{in a manner similar to}} contracts, the unilateral voluntary property transaction is a distinct concept, to which specific rules apply.

These relationships are prone to be punished by royal legislation. The charters of forgiveness are part of the royal centralization process and of the acting of power throughout the ability of acting upon, governing and transforming a specific geographical area. It’s possible to infer that the chancery serves the power considering that writing is an essential element to prove and verify rights, properties, privileges {{and a great deal of}} <b>juridical</b> <b>acts,</b> such as the charters of forgiveness in which it is determined that only the king himself is able to grant benefits and forgiveness...|$|R
