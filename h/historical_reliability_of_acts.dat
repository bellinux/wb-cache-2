50|$|The New Testament, {{especially}} the Gospel of John (c. 90-100 AD), {{has traditionally been}} interpreted as relating Christian accounts of the Pharisee rejection of Jesus and accusations of the Pharisee responsibility for his crucifixion. The <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles depicts instances of early Christian persecution by the Sanhedrin, the Jewish religious court at the time. However, the <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles is disputed.|$|R
25|$|The Apostolic Decree {{recorded}} in Acts 15 is commonly {{seen as a}} parallel to Noahide Law; however, some modern scholars dispute the connection between Acts 15 and Noahide Law, the content of Noahide Law, the <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles, {{and the nature of}} Biblical law in Christianity. The Apostolic Decree is still observed by Eastern Orthodoxy and includes some food restrictions.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{majority}} viewpoint the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, collectively {{referred to as the}} Synoptic Gospels, are the primary sources of historical information about Jesus and of the religious movement he founded. The fourth gospel, the Gospel of John, differs greatly from the first three gospels. Historians often study the <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles when studying the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the gospels, as Acts was seemingly written by the same author as the Gospel of Luke.|$|R
50|$|The <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles, {{the primary}} source for the Apostolic Age, is a major issue for biblical {{scholars}} and historians of early Christianity. While some biblical scholars and historians view the book <b>of</b> <b>Acts</b> as being extremely accurate and corroborated by archaeology, others view the work as being inaccurate and {{in conflict with the}} Pauline epistles. Acts portrays Paul as more inline with Jewish Christianity, while the Pauline epistles record more conflict, such as the Incident at Antioch.|$|R
5000|$|The Apostolic Church was the {{community}} {{led by the}} apostles, and to some degree, Jesus' relatives. In his [...] "Great Commission", the resurrected Jesus commanded that his teachings be spread to all the world. While the <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles is disputed by critics, the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles is the major primary source of information for this period. Acts gives {{a history of the}} Church from this commission in [...] to the spread of the religion among the Gentiles and the eastern Mediterranean by Paul and others.|$|R
2500|$|An {{apparent}} {{contradiction in}} the details of the account of Paul's revelatory vision given in Acts {{has been the subject of}} much debate. Specifically, the experience of Paul's traveling companions as told in [...] and [...] has raised questions about the <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles, and generated debate about the best translations of the relevant passages. The two passages each describe the experience of Paul's traveling companions during the revelation, with Acts 9:7 (the author's description of the event) stating that Paul's traveling companions heard the voice that spoke to him; and Acts 22:9 (the author's quotation of Paul's own words) traditionally stating they did not.|$|R
50|$|The <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles, {{the primary}} source for the Apostolic Age, has been debated by biblical {{scholars}} and historians of Early Christianity. A key contested issue however is the historicity of the depiction <b>of</b> Paul in <b>Acts.</b> According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Acts describes Paul differently from how Paul describes himself, both factually and theologically. Acts differs with Paul's letters on important issues, such as the Law, Paul's own apostleship, and his relation to the Jerusalem church. Scholars generally prefer Paul's account over that in Acts. However, some prominent scholars and historians view the book <b>of</b> <b>Acts</b> as being fairly accurate and corroborated by archaeology, and in general agreement with the Pauline epistles.|$|R
50|$|The Synoptic Gospels are {{the primary}} sources of {{historical}} information about Jesus and of the religious movement he founded. These religious gospels - the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of Mark, and the Gospel of Luke - recount the life, ministry, crucifixion and resurrection of a Jew named Jesus who spoke Aramaic. There are different hypotheses regarding {{the origin of the}} texts because the gospels of the New Testament were written in Greek for Greek-speaking communities, and were later translated into Syriac, Latin, and Coptic. The fourth gospel, the Gospel of John, differs greatly from the Synoptic Gospels. Historians often study the <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles when studying the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the gospels, as the Book <b>of</b> <b>Acts</b> was seemingly written by the same author as the Gospel of Luke.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} argued that this Jewish Christian sect (3,000 +) was in danger of being wiped out as they were being persecuted. The <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles depicts {{instances}} of early Christian persecution by the Sanhedrin, the Jewish religious court at the time, however the <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles is disputed. Peter and John were imprisoned by a [...] "Jewish leadership" [...] ("the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees") who were [...] "much annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming that in Jesus there is the resurrection of the dead". The Sadducees in particular rejected the Pharisaic doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. Saint Stephen was tried by a Sanhedrin (Jewish Supreme Court) for blasphemy against Moses and God and was stoned to death, under the watch of Paul of Tarsus, before his conversion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} information for this earliest period is the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles. However, there are scholars who dispute the <b>Historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles. Soon after the earthly ministry of Jesus, the Jerusalem church began at Pentecost with apostles and others totalling some 120 Jews and Jewish proselytes, in an [...] "upper room," [...] believed {{by some to be}} the Cenacle, and thus [...] "the first Christian church." [...] The <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> the Apostles goes on to record the stoning of Stephen and the subsequent dispersal of the church, which led to the baptism of Simon Magus in Samaria; and also an Ethiopian eunuch. Paul's [...] "Road to Damascus" [...] conversion to the [...] "Apostle to the Gentiles" [...] is first recorded in [...] Peter baptized the Roman Centurion Cornelius, traditionally considered the first Gentile convert to Christianity, in [...] Based on this, the Antioch church was founded. It is also believed that it was there that the term Christian was coined.|$|R

50|$|When {{judging the}} <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the gospels, {{scholars}} {{ask if the}} accounts in the gospels are, when judged using normal standards that historians use on other ancient writings, reliable or not. The main issues are what are the 'original' gospels, whether the original gospel works were accurate eyewitness accounts, and whether those original versions have been transmitted accurately through the ages to us. In evaluating the <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the Gospels, scholars consider a number of factors. These include authorship and date of composition, intention and genre, gospel sources and oral tradition, textual criticism, and historical authenticity of specific sayings and narrative events.|$|R
40|$|The {{historical}} {{study of}} Islam aims at reconstructing Islamic history and culture. Scholars need sources {{from the past}} for this task.

50|$|Bultmann carried form-criticism {{so far as}} to {{call the}} {{historical}} value of the gospels into serious question. Some scholars, such as Craig L.

2500|$|Some modern {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the Gospel of Thomas was written independently of the canonical gospels, and therefore is a useful guide to historical Jesus research. Scholars may utilize one of several critical tools in biblical scholarship, the criterion of multiple attestation, to help build cases for <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the sayings of Jesus. By finding those sayings in the Gospel of Thomas that overlap with the Gospel of the Hebrews, Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and Paul, scholars feel such sayings represent [...] "multiple attestations" [...] and therefore {{are more likely to}} come from a historical Jesus than sayings that are only singly attested.|$|R
50|$|K√§semann {{developed}} {{what became}} known as the double criterion of difference in evaluating the <b>historical</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the synoptic gospels. Put simply, what is historically reliable about Jesus can be deduced from material about Jesus which is neither plausible in a first-century Jewish nor an early Christian context. In addition to this, he proposed additional criteria, such as multiple attestation (does a particular story or saying of Jesus appear in independent traditions?) and coherence with other material already found to be reliable historical traditions about Jesus. Only the recent 'third quest' for the historical Jesus, which began in the later 1980s, began to question the absolute validity of these criteria.|$|R
