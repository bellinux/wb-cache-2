Over the years, many of Israel's interior ministers have examined {{the issue of the}} Law of Return and wavered as to how to apply it. The judiciary has also been called upon to express an opinion on matters relating to the Law. This burning and recurrent question in the country's political dialogue not only reveals but also exacerbates differences of opinion between Israelis.|$|E
25|$|Stories tend to {{be based}} on experiential {{learning}}, but learning from an experience is not automatic. Often a person needs to attempt {{to tell the story of}} that experience before realizing its value. In this case, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> listener who learns, but the teller who also becomes aware of his or her own unique experiences and background. This process of storytelling is empowering as the teller effectively conveys ideas and, with practice, is able to demonstrate the potential of human accomplishment. Storytelling taps into existing knowledge and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a solution.|$|E
25|$|People need to {{be educated}} on {{interpreting}} their results and {{what they should be}} rationally taking from the experience. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> average person who needs to be educated in the dimensions of their own genomic sequence but also professionals, including physicians and science journalists, who must be provided with the knowledge required to inform and educate their patients and the public. Examples of such efforts include the Personal Genetics Education Project (pgEd), the Smithsonian collaboration with NHGRI, and the MedSeq, BabySeq and MilSeq projects of Genomes to People, an initiative of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.|$|E

25|$|Broadway District {{contains}} the major commercial thoroughfare of Broadway and houses the Broadway District commuter stop for NJ Transit's Bergen County Line train. Roughly located around the Warren Point and Lyncrest areas, the district also extends {{as far as}} Morlot Avenue along the tracks, roughly around or a little after Glen Rock Lumber, housing many industries on Banta Place. The Broadway District is mainly a shopping district as it contains many stores, eateries, hobby centers, salons, and other businesses. Not only is it the largest stretch of stores within Fair Lawn, it also houses {{one of the highest}} densities of nail and beauty salons in the United States. The Broadway District stretches from the Route 4 split with Route 208 and continues all through Fair Lawn and includes a few blocks of Elmwood Park before continuing to Downtown Paterson via the Broadway Bus Terminal. Broadway also hosts the route of local Paterson-New York Spanish Company mini buses, known locally as guaguas, as a cheaper alternative for commuters to and from New York. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> sole district within the Borough that gives access to the guaguas but is {{one of only a handful}} of Bergen-Passaic-Hudson districts that even offers this service.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Big Little Jesus," [...] the December 24, 1953 {{episode of}} the {{television}} series Dragnet, Sgts. Friday and Smith {{are called upon to}} investigate the theft of a Baby Jesus from a church nativity display on Christmas Eve. Unable to solve the crime, the officers tell the priest that Mass must be celebrated without the Baby Jesus. The figurine is restored when a boy arrives with it in a wagon. [...] He tells the officers that he had vowed that if he got a wagon for Christmas, Baby Jesus would have the first ride. [...] This episode was remade when Dragnet went to color; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> only episode made twice, but the only story not based on an actual police case. [...] The episode was originally broadcast on radio on December 22, 1953, making it the only episode to appear on all three Jack Webb versions of the series.|$|E
500|$|A simple form of {{directional}} coupler is two parallel transmission lines coupled together over a λ/4 length. [...] This design is limited because the electrical {{length of the}} coupler will only be λ/4 at one specific frequency. [...] Coupling will be a maximum at this frequency and fall away on either side. [...] Similar to the impedance matching case, this can be improved by using multiple elements, resulting in a filter-like structure. [...] A waveguide analogue of this coupled lines approach is the Bethe-hole {{directional coupler}} in which two parallel waveguides are stacked {{on top of each}} other and a hole provided for coupling. [...] To produce a wideband design, multiple holes are used along the guides [...] as shown in figure 14 and a filter design applied. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> coupled-line design that suffers from being narrow band, all simple designs of waveguide coupler depend on frequency in some way. [...] For instance the rat-race coupler (which can be implemented directly in waveguide) works on a completely different principle but still relies on certain lengths being exact in terms of λ.|$|E

2500|$|Conceptual {{clustering}} {{is obviously}} {{closely related to}} data clustering; however, in conceptual clustering <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> inherent structure of the data that drives cluster formation, but also the Description language which is available to the learner. [...] Thus, a statistically strong grouping in the data may fail to be extracted by the learner if the prevailing concept description language is incapable of describing that particular regularity. [...] In most implementations, the description language has been limited to feature conjunction, although in COBWEB (see [...] "" [...] below), the feature language is probabilistic.|$|E
2500|$|In this connection, {{another thing}} {{also should be}} kept in mind: evil {{suggestion}} is not whispered into the heart of man only from outside by the satans from among men and jinn, but also by the self of man from within.

This has been expressed in the Quran: [...] "and We know the evil suggestions arising from his self." [...] (Qaf : 16).
