5|$|Educational {{attainment}} varied greatly {{depending on}} occupational field with 68% {{of those in}} the professional and professional support fields having a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to only 31.6% of those employed in sales and 11.6% of those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> sector. Considering the fact that the average American does not have a bachelor's degree, he or she is most likely employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> sales, and office support fields with many working in the professional support and business fields as well. All together the American economy and labor force have changed greatly since the middle of the 20th. century with most workers today being employed in office and service occupations.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} the war, the Swiss {{troops were}} no longer bound along the Rhine and in the Grisons. The cantons {{concluded}} new mercenary contracts, so called capitulations, with the Duchy of Milan and soon got deeply involved in the Italian Wars, where Swiss mercenaries ended up fighting on both sides. The involvement of the Old Swiss Confederacy, acting in its own interests in these wars, was brought to an end by the defeat against French forces in the battle of Marignano in 1515 and a subsequent peace treaty with the French king in 1516, the so-called Eternal Peace. However, Swiss mercenaries from individual cantons of the federation continued to participate in the Italian Wars well beyond (until the middle of the 16th century) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of various parties and, following that peace with France, in particular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of the French king.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{estimates}} the local multiplier of manufacturing for Brazil (2000 - 2010). The method {{is based on}} (Moretti, 2010) and on (Moretti and Thulin, 2012), who estimated these multipliers for the U. S. and Sweden. The local multiplier of manufacturing {{estimates the}} impacts of employment changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industrial sectors on employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> sectors, and <b>the</b> impact of changes <b>in</b> employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-tech and low-tech tradable sectors on employment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> sectors. These estimates help to assess the importance of industrial employment changes over local economies. We created instrumental variables, based on the shift-share method. The employment data cover 21 economic subsectors and 123 regions in 2000, 2005 and 2010. We have estimated that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian mesorregions, for each new job <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tradable sectors, almost four jobs were created locally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> sectors. Additionally, each job <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-tech industrial sectors was estimated to create approximately seven jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>services</b> sectors over <b>the</b> long term...|$|R
5|$|After a brief stay in Europe, Atangana {{returned}} to his homeland in Cameroon, which by then was a League of Nations mandate territory under {{the administration of the}} French Third Republic. The French doubted his loyalties at first, but Atangana served them with the same ardour he had shown the Germans and regained his post as paramount chief. During the remainder of his life, he oversaw the Westernisation of his subjects and the improvement of his domains despite the erosion of his powers due to French policies and unrest among his people. He never advocated resistance to the European powers, preferring to embrace the European as a means of personal enrichment and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of African interests. After his death in 1943, Atangana was largely forgotten. However, since Cameroon's independence in 1960, Cameroonian scholars have rediscovered his story.|$|E

Honour rolls in Canada were very popular, particularly immediately {{after the end of the}} war, although the decision on which names to include on them proved contentious: should accidental deaths, for example, be included? Where it was impractical to inscribe names in churches, usually due to the number of casualties and available space, books of names were often recorded instead.|$|E

De Lacy also led an army in an attack against Bath <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of the Empress, along with Geoffrey Talbot, which also occurred in 1138 and which some historians have seen as the opening act of the civil war.|$|E

5|$|Aqil's father, Musa Agha al-Hasi, {{himself a}} {{commander}} of Hawwara irregulars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of Acre's Ottoman governors, had left Egypt for Gaza in 1814. He was {{not directly related}} to the Ainawiyeh or Hawwara tribes, but claimed descent from the Hawwara as a matter of convenience and prestige. Musa originally hailed from the al-Bara'asa tribe of Cyrenaica (modern-day eastern Libya). Likewise, James Finn, the British consul in Jerusalem (1846–1863), claims Aqil's family was of Algerian or North African origin. Musa Agha resided in the Galilee around 1820 and married a Turkmen woman. Aqil was born to the couple in the Nazareth area. According to historian Adel Manna, Aqil was born in Gaza. Musa had two other sons, Ali and Salih. Musa died in Gaza in 1830.|$|E
