40|$|The {{operation}} of a helicopter with an externally slung load is highly demanding for the flight crew. Without having a direct view on the load, the pilot needs assistance by a crew member for load handling, e. g. load positioning. During <b>Helicopter</b> <b>Hoist</b> <b>Operations</b> (HHO), the <b>hoist</b> operator gives instructions to the pilot and stabilizes the load motion. An automatic load positioning system for HHO is designed with the aim to reduce the workload of the flight crew and to improve the load handling performance. The control system consists of a multi-loop architecture that is designed using multi-objective optimization. The system was designed to achieve best performance in load positioning for the entire cable length range of the rescue hoist. Load positioning performance {{is a function of}} the cable length; faster automatic load positioning can be achieved with shorter cable lengths. This paper describes the overall design process covering the tools, control law architecture, optimization, and the validation using DLR’s simulator...|$|R

The recovery took place on 15 November when the space capsule splashdown occurred within 3 mi (5 km) of Wasp. Captain James A. Lovell and Major Edwin E. Aldrin were lifted by <b>helicopter</b> <b>hoist</b> to the deck of Wasp and there enjoyed two days of celebration. Wasp arrived at Boston on 18 November with the Gemini XII spacecraft on board. After off-loading the special Gemini support equipment, Wasp spent 10 days making ready for her next period at sea.|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} to enhance safety and control features for mine shaft hoists {{is being investigated}} {{by researchers at the}} U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM). The objective of the research is to prevent injuries and fatalities related to <b>hoist</b> and elevator <b>operations.</b> Monitoring and controlling mine <b>hoisting</b> <b>operations</b> will allow <b>hoist</b> operators, inspectors, and maintenance personnel to increase their awareness of potentially dangerous situations and provide controls for safer operations. Process simulation and visualization software, real-time data sensing, and advanced programming techniques are being applied to this problem. Development of reliable and cost-effective sensors and data acquisition interfaces to monitor hoist loads and detect slack rope conditions is underway. Three-dimensional design software was used to visualize mine hoisting to enhance understanding of <b>hoist</b> <b>operations.</b> Quick Basic and Visual Basic (an object-oriented Windows interface) are being used for acquiring and processing hoisting data. Testing and evaluation of components are underway at USBM testing facilities. The resulting system will allow hoist personnel to assess critical operating parameters, such as hoist position, speed, acceleration, conveyance load, and rope tension...|$|R
