5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum {{closely resembles}} the other {{species in the}} A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> difficult. Paris and Windham, {{in their study of}} the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished from the others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E

5|$|Reflecting Archaeoastronomy's {{development}} as an interdisciplinary subject, research <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> conducted by investigators trained {{in a wide}} range of disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.|$|E

5|$|There is no official, {{canonical}} list of dinosaur genera. The closest is the Dinosaur Genera List, {{compiled by}} biological nomenclature expert George Olshevsky, which {{was first published}} online in 1995 and is regularly updated. The most authoritative general source <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> the second (2004) edition of The Dinosauria. The vast majority of citations are based on Olshevsky's list, and all subjective determinations (such as junior synonymy or non-dinosaurian status) are based on The Dinosauria, except where they conflict with primary literature. These exceptions are noted.|$|E
5|$|Species {{identification}} using scales {{requires a}} fair {{degree of knowledge}} about snakes, their taxonomy, snake-scale nomenclature as well as familiarity with and access to scientific literature. Distinguishing by using scale diagrams whether a snake is venomous or not in the field cannot {{be done in the}} case of uncaught specimens. It is not advisable to catch a snake to check whether it is venomous or not using scale diagrams. Most books or websites provide an array of traits of the local herpetofauna, other than scale diagrams, which help to distinguish whether a snake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> venomous or not.|$|E

25|$|The general {{consensus}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> {{that there is}} a derivational relationship between verbs undergoing the causative alternation that share the same lexical entry. From this it follows that there is uncertainty surrounding which form, the intransitive or the intransitive, is the base from which the other is derived. Another matter of debate is whether the derivation takes place at the syntactic or lexical level.|$|E
25|$|A {{field is}} a {{setting in which}} agents and their social {{positions}} are located.

Fields interact with each other, and are hierarchical: Most are subordinate to the larger field of power and class relations.|$|E

25|$|The Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field in}} south-eastern British Columbia consists of several small basaltic volcanoes and extensive lava flows {{that have been}} active for the past 3 million years. It is within the Wells Gray Provincial Park, which also includes the -high Helmcken Falls. The origin of the volcanism is unknown, but is probably related to crustal thinning. Some of <b>the</b> lava flows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to those that}} erupted at Volcano Mountain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yukon, where olivine nephelinite occurs. <b>The</b> last eruption <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>was</b> about 400 years ago at Kostal Cone.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the number}} of {{variables}} involved, chemically induced patinas are prone to problems such as a lack of adhesion, excessive staining of adjacent materials, and inability to achieve reasonable color uniformity over large surface areas. Chemical patination applied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> not recommended due to variations in temperature, humidity, and chemical requirements. Warranties are prudent when purchasing pre-patinated copper for architectural projects.|$|E

25|$|A problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> that {{detailed}} neuron descriptions are computationally {{expensive and}} this can handicap the pursuit of realistic network investigations, where many neurons need to be simulated. So, researchers that study large neural circuits typically represent each neuron and synapse simply, ignoring much of the biological detail. This is unfortunate as {{there is evidence that}} the richness of biophysical properties on the single neuron scale can supply mechanisms that serve as the building blocks for network dynamics. Hence there is a drive to produce simplified neuron models that can retain significant biological fidelity at a low computational overhead. Algorithms have been developed to produce faithful, faster running, simplified surrogate neuron models from computationally expensive, detailed neuron models.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, Ciprian had also {{established}} himself as a leading modernist dramatist and director, with plays such as The Man and His Mule. Although his work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> described as the product of 1920s Expressionist theater, he was sometimes branded a plagiarist of his dead friend's writings. This claim was traced back to Arghezi, and was probably a publicity stunt meant to increase Urmuz's exposure, but taken with seriousness by another opinion maker, journalist Constantin Beldie. The ensuing scandal was amplified by the young Dadaists and Surrealists, who took the rumor to be true: Avramescu-Uranus, himself accused of plagiarizing Urmuz, made an ironic reference to this fact in a 1929 contribution to Bilete de Papagal. Unwittingly, Arghezi's allegations cast a shadow of doubt on Ciprian's overall work for the stage.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} prominent {{criticism of}} strong reciprocity {{theory is that}} it does not correspond to behavior found in the actual environment. In particular, the existence of third party punishment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> called into question. Some have responded to this criticism by pointing out that if effective, third party punishment will rarely be used, and will therefore be difficult to observe. Others have suggested that there is evidence of third party costly punishment in the field. Critics have responded to these claims by arguing that it is unfair for proponents to argue that both a demonstration of costly third party punishment as well as a lack of costly third party punishment are both evidence of its existence. They also question whether the ethnographic evidence presented is costly third party punishment, and call for additional analysis of the costs and benefits of the punishment. Other research has shown that different types of strong reciprocity do not predict other types of strong reciprocity within individuals.|$|E
25|$|The economy rate is more {{important}} in one-day cricket and Twenty20 matches than in Test match cricket. The shorter forms of the game (ODI and T20) demand that bowlers (and fielders) restrict the flow of runs from the opposition to give their team {{a better chance of}} finishing the game with more runs on the board. In Tests, however, the priority when <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> to bowl the opposition out and take all ten wickets in both the innings. A bowler's economy rate is normally calculated from their career record, but one might also calculate it for a specific period of time, such as a calendar year or the duration of a World Cup tournament. In one day matches, a career economy rate of less than five runs per over is good. Conceding too many quick runs in a Test match is sure to get you taken off by your captain and replaced with another bowler, while taking a wicket in limited overs matches invariably slows the run rate. Like many aspects of cricket, economy rate vs bowling average vs bowling strike rate is a matter of finding a good balance. In Twenty20 matches, anything under seven runs per over is considered to be good.|$|E
