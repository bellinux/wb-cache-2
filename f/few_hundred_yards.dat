5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> to the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|Most tornadoes {{take on the}} {{appearance}} of a narrow funnel, a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> (meters) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.|$|E
5|$|Protesters {{began to}} gather outside Tottenham police station, a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> from Broadwater Farm, around 1:30am on Sunday morning, 6 October. Four of the station's windows were smashed, but the Jarrett family asked {{the crowd to}} disperse. Later that day, two police {{officers}} were attacked with bricks and paving stones at the Farm, and a police inspector was attacked in his car.|$|E
50|$|British Railways {{closed the}} station pre-Beeching in 1962 {{and plans for}} a freight use were {{abandoned}} at the same time. Goods trains continue to pass the site for a <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>yards</b> northwards, to Round Oak Steel Terminal.|$|R
50|$|Tarbolton (Tarbowton) is {{a village}} in South Ayrshire, Scotland. It is near Failford, Mauchline and the same {{distance}} bar a <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>yards</b> to Ayr and Kilmarnock. The old Fail Monastery was nearby and Robert Burns connections are strong, including the Bachelors' Club museum.|$|R
50|$|The {{stadium is}} located in Pontificio Oratorio San Pietro, the Vatican's sport complex, in Rome only a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yard</b> from Vatican City as Vatican City is not large enough to house sports fields. It has a {{capacity}} of 500 spectators and is equipped with artificial turf and floodlights. The field is known for having {{a clear view of}} Saint Peter's Basilica.|$|R
5|$|The {{sheer number}} of guns fired {{broadside}} meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was {{as little as a}} <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards,</b> so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} three {{different}} stations {{in the area of}} Filton Abbey Wood. The first, Filton, opened in 1863 just north the site of the current Filton Abbey Wood, and was closed in 1903. A second station was opened a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> to the north, and was known as Filton Junction. This station closed in 1996, replaced by Filton Abbey Wood.|$|E
5|$|A <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> {{from the}} airfield, his plane crashed nose {{first into the}} ground. He was quickly freed from the {{aircraft}} by his men, but died in an ambulance minutes later; his orders to return home were found in his jacket pocket. Baker was buried in a small military cemetery near Toul; in 1921, his mother had his remains moved to her family plot in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|The pier {{was built}} in the 19th century; it {{replaced}} a smaller, earlier pier built a <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>yards</b> to the north. A diesel cable winch is situated {{at the top of the}} pier for the purpose of hauling boats from the slipway to the shore and vice versa. The harbour has a total capacity of 18 boats, although only about half of those berths are used each year.|$|R
50|$|Aosta {{railway station}} is {{situated}} {{in the southern part}} of the city, a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> metres (<b>yards)</b> from the central Émile Chanoux square (town hall square), to which it is linked by Avenue Conseil des Commis.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 1980s, the other {{facilities}} at the station were similarly comprehensively rebuilt. As part of the renovations, the pedestrian bridge in Kufstein's locality of Zell was moved a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> metres (<b>yards)</b> to the south.|$|R
5|$|Behind the Wells Fargo {{office is}} a powder house which, as of 2011, {{contains}} models of the town, the town's major mills, and its Catholic church. The Catholic and Protestant cemeteries were restored by the Leeds Lion's Club in 1998 and can be visited. Several other original buildings remain, including the Clancy Market, McCormick Store, the two-story Harrison House Hotel, {{and some of the}} mining buildings. Main Street, once a mile long, is now only a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> long and is surrounded by private homes.|$|E
5|$|Goodensnake's body is cremated in a {{traditional}} ceremony, while the agents watch from a distance. Mulder shares with Scully his belief that both the culprits in both the current case and Hoover's investigation are werewolves. Scully dismisses this theory and instead credits the belief to clinical lycanthropy. The elder Parker is subsequently ripped apart by an unseen animal outside his home, and Lyle is found naked and unconscious a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> away.|$|E
5|$|The scenery {{of rocky}} headlands, ravines, waterfalls and towering cliffs gained the Exmoor coast {{recognition}} as a Heritage Coast in 1991. The Exmoor Coastal Heaths have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the diversity of species present. The path passes the smallest parish church in England, Culbone Church, in Culbone. The path crosses the county boundary into Devon, a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> north of the National Park Centre at County Gate.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{historical}} {{interest has}} centered on Waldheim's role in Operation Kozara in 1942. According to one post-war investigator, prisoners were routinely shot within only a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> meters (<b>yards)</b> of Waldheim's office, and just [...] away at the Jasenovac concentration camp. Waldheim later stated that [...] "he {{did not know about}} the murder of civilians there".|$|R
60|$|They hurried {{along the}} rocks, {{and were able}} to make their way to within fifty yards of the point; then, {{throwing}} their mail shirts into the sea, they plunged in. All knew the importance of getting round before any of the pirates, who would be searching the valley, came down on the shore, and they swam their hardest until they rounded the corner. The wood rang with the shouts of their pursuers, but no yell had risen from the water's edge. A <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> farther, {{and they were able to}} land, and were in a short time in the shelter of the trees that fringed the water to the point where they had left the boat. There was no longer any occasion for speed, and they made their way through the thick bushes and undergrowth quietly, until they recovered breath after their exertions. They had gone a <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>yards</b> when from the bushes the slaves suddenly rose up.|$|R
50|$|The Luapula flows {{south from}} Lake Bangweulu as a broad, swampy river a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> meters (<b>yards)</b> wide. It then turns west and {{runs along the}} border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. After the Mambatuta falls the river narrows and meanders north, then descends through the Mambilima falls, {{following}} which it broadens into a wetland region 150 km that feeds the south end of Lake Mweru.|$|R
5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly of rolling low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground and scattered bushes, reduced visibility down to just a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards.</b> From the start, large groups of Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. So instead of sending out his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine guns. At 10:30, the Fur troops were observed in a strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E
5|$|From 2005 to 2009 a Thomas Heatherwick sculpture, B of the Bang, was {{situated}} {{to the southeast}} of the stadium at the junction of Ashton New Road and Alan Turing Way. Built after the Commonwealth Games to commemorate them, it was the tallest sculpture in the United Kingdom. However, numerous structural problems led to the 184ft. sculpture being dismantled in 2009 for safety reasons. In 2014, money recovered by the Manchester City Council {{as a result of}} lengthy legal battles consequent to this debacle was used to fund a new £341,000 public sculpture a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> further south.|$|E
5|$|On the 16th RCT front, at {{the eastern}} end of Easy Red, was another area between strongpoints. This allowed G/16 and the support {{battalion}} to escape complete destruction in their advance up the beach. Nevertheless, most of G/16's 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle. The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave; H/16 came in a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> to the left, opposite the E-3 draw, and suffered for it – they were put out of action for several hours.|$|E
50|$|Matters {{came to a}} head on 22 August, when Amaral and his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Jerónimo Pereira Leite, {{left the}} town through the Portas do Cerco (barrier-gate) to give alms to an elderly Chinese woman whom Amaral was supporting. The two were only a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yard</b> within the gate when a Chinese coolie frightened Amaral's horse with a bamboo pole and signalled to his comrades in hiding. The {{one-armed}} governor held the reins with his teeth in order to draw his pistol. Before he could do so, he was set upon by seven Chinese, armed only with edged weapons, and dragged from his horse. Leite, also armed, was dismounted and fled on foot. Intending to collect the reward in Guangzhou, the assassins cut off Amaral's head and remaining hand as proof. The Portuguese authorities later retrieved the rest of his corpse and traced a trail of blood out of the gate.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} located a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> metres (or <b>yards)</b> from Piazzale Fratelli Kennedy, {{which has a}} bus station for urban bus lines, and from the {{suburban}} bus stops at Varese Nord railway station, with which, according to a municipal project, it should be unified.|$|R
50|$|On December 2, 1899, American forces, {{who slept}} and rested {{during the night}} on newly {{harvested}} rice fields just below the Tirad Pass, got up and prepared for an assault of the Filipino forces fortification under the Command of General Gregorio del Pilar. On the narrow trail of Tirad Pass, the Filipino soldiers watched as their enemies began {{to move up the}} trail. On around a <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>yards</b> above the pass, General Gregorio del Pilar with his staff and accompanied by two civilians from Sitio Mabatano, stood up and took his spy glass and scan it the surroundings area. He spotted the American forces as they were starting to move. But as he watched, he noticed that the American forces broke formations and instead sent a messenger on horse back with a white banner on his band. As the messenger was coming near the fortification of Filipino forces, the sound of gun was heard and the messenger fell. The American forces divided themselves into three separate groups. One group followed the trail towards the pass.|$|R
5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an approach march {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into open order within a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> of the objective and a frontal attack with the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following the barrage, the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope {{was to make a}} night march that would position them to launch a frontal attack on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had argued for a flanking attack along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E
5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> away at Kersal Vale.|$|E
5|$|Lurgan Park, a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> {{from the}} main street, is the largest urban park in Northern Ireland and the second-largest in Ireland after Phoenix Park, Dublin. It used {{to be part of}} the estate of Brownlow House, a 19th-century Elizabethan-style manor house. In 1893, the land was {{purchased}} by Lurgan Borough Council and opened as a public park in 1909 by Earl Aberdeen, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It includes a sizeable artificial lake and an original Coalbrookdale fountain. Today the park is home to annual summer events such as the Lurgan Agricultural Show, and the Lurgan Park Rally, noted as the largest annual motor sport event in Northern Ireland and a stage in the Circuit of Ireland rally.|$|E
5000|$|The {{attack on}} the right flank of the Sixth Army, which faced north between Oulches and Missy, took place from Oulches to Soupir and had less success than the Fifth Army; the II Colonial Corps {{advanced}} for 0.5 mi in the first thirty minutes and was then stopped. The XX Corps attack from Vendresse to the Oise-Aisne Canal had more success, the 153rd Division on the right flank reached the Chemin des Dames south of Courtecon after a second attack, managing an advance of 1.25 mi. The VI Corps advanced on its right flank west of the Oise-Aisne Canal but was held up on the left. On the northern flank which faced east near Laffaux, I Colonial Corps was able to penetrate only a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yard</b> into the defences of the [...] (Condé Switch). To the east of Vauxaillon {{at the north end}} of the Sixth Army, [...] was captured with the help of British heavy artillery but then lost to a German counter-attack.

50|$|Near {{the station}} are the termini of several {{lines of the}} local {{suburban}} public transport network, AMT (Genoa). These join together to head into the city centre: lines 18 and 18/ (direct to Ospedale San Martino), and 20 (trolley-bus line towards the neighborhood of Foce, where the last stop is a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> meters (or <b>yards)</b> from Fiera di Genova).|$|R

5|$|During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the {{garrison}} espoused {{the cause of}} James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence {{of the presence of}} Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is still to be seen on that side a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> from town along the Crank Road.|$|E
5|$|L/16 {{eventually}} landed, 30 minutes late, to {{the left}} of Fox Green, taking casualties as the boats ran in and more as they crossed the 200 yards (180m) of beach. The terrain at the very eastern end of Omaha gave them enough protection to allow the 125 survivors to organize and begin an assault of the bluffs. They were the only company in the first wave able to operate as a unit. All the other companies were, at best, disorganized, mostly leaderless and pinned down behind the shingle with no hope of carrying out their assault missions. At worst, they had ceased to exist as fighting units. Nearly all had landed at least a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> off target, and in an intricately planned operation where each section on each boat had been assigned a specific task, this was enough to throw the whole plan off.|$|E
5|$|McPherson's corps was {{assigned}} to attack the center along the Jackson Road. On their right flank, the brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas E. G. Ransom advanced to within 100 yards of the Confederate line, but halted to avoid dangerous flanking fire from Green's Redan. On McPherson's left flank, the division of Maj. Gen. John A. Logan {{was assigned}} to assault the 3rd Louisiana Redan and the Great Redoubt. The brigade of Brig. Gen. John E. Smith made {{it as far as}} the slope of the redan, but huddled there, dodging grenades until dark before they were recalled. Brig. Gen. John D. Stevenson's brigade advanced well in two columns against the redoubt, but their attack also failed when they found their ladders were too short to scale the fortification. Brig. Gen. Isaac F. Quinby's division advanced a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards,</b> but halted for hours while its generals engaged in confused discussions.|$|E
25|$|The M6 {{motorway}} {{runs from}} junction 19 of the M1 {{and from the}} beginning of A14 in Catthorpe near Rugby in central England, passes between Coventry and Nuneaton, through Birmingham, Walsall and Stafford and near the major cities of Wolverhampton and Stoke-on-Trent. The motorway has major junctions with the M56 and M62 at Warrington, giving access to Chester, Manchester and Liverpool. The M6 then heads north past Wigan, Preston and Lancaster. After the latter two cities it passes through Cumbria with some parts very close {{to the edge of the}} Lake District with a short stretch within the national park boundaries and then passes Carlisle on its way to Gretna, before the motorway becomes the A74(M) a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> metres (<b>yards)</b> short of the Scottish border.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} {{work on this}} section involved the renewal of the tracks, the creation of artificial tunnels close to built-up areas to avoid noise pollution, the radical restructuring of existing stations, and the inauguration of new stations (Serenissima, Palmiro Togliatti and La Rustica Città). Tor Sapienza railway station was rebuilt and moved a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> metres (<b>yards)</b> closer to Rome than the original station, while at Roma Prenestina, FR2 trains were routed over the two secondary tracks, as the two main ones were reserved for high-speed services. Restructuring work at Lunghezza was completed {{in the course of}} 2008; FR2 trains now stop there a little further along with respect to the axis of the passenger building, and the station entrance has been moved to face the new parking lot.|$|R
5|$|The only track {{left after}} the {{demolishing}} {{was a short}} section at Lier Station, which remained until the station closed in 1973. The old Lier Station has been preserved. The section between Reenskaug, located a <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> meters (<b>yards)</b> from Lier Station, to Landfald has become the suburban street Lijevegen. From Landfall to Egge, the right-of-way is an overgrown path. From Egge to Muggerud, the right-of-way is used as the street Banevegen. In 1993, the right-of-way from Muggerud to Rønningen was rebuilt as a hiking and riding path. The branch towards Tronstad Bruk has been converted to a street, {{although most of the}} right-of-way north of Rønning has disappeared, as it has been reclaimed as agricultural land, particularly north of Sylling. The station area at Svangstand in intact, with the station building looking just like it did in 1904. Other station buildings have been converted to homes or commercial buildings.|$|R
