40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{hybridization}} of complementary DNA <b>hairpin</b> <b>loops,</b> with particular reference to their use as fuel for autonomous DNA devices. The rate of spontaneous hybridization between complementary hairpins can be reduced by increasing the neck length or decreasing the <b>loop</b> length. <b>Hairpins</b> with larger <b>loops</b> rapidly form long-lived kissed complexes. <b>Hairpin</b> <b>loops</b> may be opened by strand displacement using an opening strand that contains the same sequence as half of the neck and a "toehold" complementary to a single-stranded domain adjacent to the neck. We find loop opening via an external toehold to be 10 - 100 times faster than via an internal toehold. We measure rates of loop opening by opening strands that are at least 1000 times faster than the spontaneous interaction between hairpins. We discuss suitable choices for loop, neck, and toehold length for <b>hairpin</b> <b>loops</b> to be used as fuel for autonomous DNA devices...|$|R

25|$|Two common motifs {{involving}} coaxial stacking are kissing {{loops and}} pseudoknots. In kissing loop interactions, the single-stranded loop regions of two hairpins interact through base pairing, forming a composite, coaxially stacked helix. Notably, this structure allows {{all of the}} nucleotides in each loop to participate in base-pairing and stacking interactions. This motif was visualized and studied using NMR analysis by Lee and Crothers. The pseudoknot motif occurs when a single stranded region of a <b>hairpin</b> <b>loop</b> basepairs with an upstream or downstream sequence within the same RNA strand. The two resulting duplex regions often stack upon one another, forming a stable coaxially stacked composite helix. One example of a pseudoknot motif is the highly stable Hepatitis Delta virus ribozyme, in which the backbone shows an overall double pseudoknot topology.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteria use two {{different}} strategies for transcription termination – Rho-independent termination and Rho-dependent termination. In Rho-independent transcription termination, RNA transcription stops when the newly synthesized RNA molecule forms a G-C-rich <b>hairpin</b> <b>loop</b> {{followed by a}} run of Us. When the hairpin forms, the mechanical stress breaks the weak rU-dA bonds, now filling the DNA–RNA hybrid. [...] This pulls the poly-U transcript out of the active site of the RNA polymerase, terminating transcription. In the [...] "Rho-dependent" [...] type of termination, a protein factor called [...] "Rho" [...] destabilizes {{the interaction between the}} template and the mRNA, thus releasing the newly synthesized mRNA from the elongation complex.|$|E
2500|$|... miRNA {{genes are}} usually {{transcribed}} by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The polymerase often binds to a promoter found near the DNA sequence, encoding {{what will become}} the <b>hairpin</b> <b>loop</b> of the pre-miRNA. The resulting transcript is capped with a specially modified nucleotide at the 5' end, polyadenylated with multiple adenosines (a poly(A) tail), and spliced. Animal miRNAs are initially transcribed as part of one arm of an ∼80 nucleotide RNA stem-loop that in turn forms part of a several hundred nucleotide-long miRNA precursor termed a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA). When a stem-loop precursor {{is found in the}} 3' UTR, a transcript may serve as a pri-miRNA and a mRNA. RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes some miRNAs, especially those with upstream Alu sequences, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and mammalian wide interspersed repeat (MWIR) promoter units.|$|E

50|$|RNA kissing interactions, {{also called}} loop-loop pseudoknots, {{occur when the}} {{unpaired}} nucleotides in one <b>hairpin</b> <b>loop,</b> base pair with the unpaired nucleotides in another <b>hairpin</b> <b>loop.</b> When the hairpin loops are located on separate RNA molecules, their intermolecular interaction is called a kissing complex.
