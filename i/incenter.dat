25|$|In 1996, Vaynshtejn was {{probably}} the first to prove another beautiful characterization of tangential quadrilaterals, that has later appeared in several magazines and websites. It states that when a convex quadrilateral is divided into four nonoverlapping triangles by its two diagonals, then the <b>incenters</b> of the four triangles are concyclic {{if and only if}} the quadrilateral is tangential. In fact, the <b>incenters</b> form an orthodiagonal cyclic quadrilateral. A related result is that the incircles can be exchanged for the excircles to the same triangles (tangent to the sides of the quadrilateral and the extensions of its diagonals). Thus a convex quadrilateral is tangential if and only if the excenters in these four excircles are the vertices of a cyclic quadrilateral.|$|R

25|$|In Euclidean geometry, a {{tangential}} quadrilateral (sometimes just tangent quadrilateral) or circumscribed quadrilateral is a convex quadrilateral whose sides are all tangent {{to a single}} circle within the quadrilateral. This circle is called the incircle of the quadrilateral or its inscribed circle, its center is the <b>incenter</b> and its radius is called the inradius. Since these quadrilaterals can be drawn surrounding or circumscribing their incircles, they have also been called circumscribable quadrilaterals, circumscribing quadrilaterals, and circumscriptible quadrilaterals.

25|$|There are an infinitude {{of lines}} that bisect {{the area of}} a {{triangle}}. Three of them are the medians of the triangle (which connect the sides' midpoints with the opposite vertices), and these are concurrent at the triangle's centroid; indeed, {{they are the only}} area bisectors that go through the centroid. Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle's <b>incenter</b> (the center of its incircle).

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{consider}} 3 -periodic orbits in an elliptic billiard. Numerical experiments {{conducted by}} Dan Reznik {{have shown that}} the locus of the centers of inscribed circles of the corresponding triangles is an ellipse. We prove this fact by the complexification of the problem coupled with the complex law of reflection. 1. THE STATEMENT OF THE THEOREM AND THE IDEA OF THE PROOF Elliptic billiards are at the same time classical and popular subject (see, for example [1], [2], [3] and [4]) since they continue to deliver interesting problems. We will consider an ellipse and a billiard in it with the standard reflection law: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Let the trajectory from a point on the boundary repeat itself after two reflections: this means that we obtained a triangle which presents a 3 -periodic trajectory of the ball in the elliptic billiard. Poncelet’s famous theorem [5] states that the sides of these triangles are tangent to some smaller ellipse confocal to the initial one. We prove the following fact which was observed experimentally by Dan Reznik [10]: THEOREM 1. 1. For every elliptic billiard the set of <b>incenters</b> (the centers of the inscribed circles) of its triangular orbits is an ellipse. ∗) Supported in part by RFBR grants 12 − 01 − 31241 mol-a and 12 − 01 − 33020 mol-a-ved. a...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} iterations of two classical geometric constructions, the evolutes and involutes of plane curves, {{and their}} discretizations: evolutes and involutes of plane polygons. In the continuous case, our main {{result is that}} the iterated involutes of closed locally convex curves with rotation number one (possibly, with cusps) converge to their curvature centers (Steiner points), and their limit shapes are hypocycloids, generically, astroids. As a consequence, among such curves only the hypocycloids are homothetic to their evolutes. The bulk of the paper concerns two kinds of discretizations of these constructions: the curves are replaced by polygons, and the evolutes are formed by the circumcenters of the triples of consecutive vertices (PP - evolutes), or by the <b>incenters</b> of the triples of consecutive sides (AA -evolutes). For equiangular polygons, the theory is parallel to the continuous case: we define discrete hypocycloids (equiangular polygons whose sides are tangent to hypocycloids) and a discrete Steiner point. The space of polygons is a vector bundle over the space of the side directions; our main result here is that both kinds of evolutes define vector bundle morphisms. In the case of PP -evolutes, the induced map of the base is 4 -periodic, and the dynamics reduces to the linear maps on the fibers. We prove that the spectra of these linear maps are symmetric with respect to the origin. The asymptotic dynamics of linear maps is determined by their eigenvalues with the maximum modulus, and we show that all types of behavior can occur: in particular, hyperbolic, when this eigenvalue is real, and elliptic, when it is complex. We also study PP - and AA -involutes and prove that the side directions of iterated AA -involutes of polygons with odd number of sides behave ergodically; this generalizes well-known results concerning iterations of the construction of the pedal triangle. In addition to the theoretical study, we performed numerous computer experiments; some of the observations remain unexplained...|$|R
