The section requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which {{are also part of}} the Human Rights Act 1998. This interpretation <b>goes</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> normal statutory interpretation, and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E

25|$|Through {{the process}} of {{developing}} his art, Al-Zahawi tried various methods of sculpting, yet he vastly preferred the coiling method. The coiling method allows the artists to create irregular forms with superimposed volume and with angles as sharp as 45°, collectively allowing for the construction of very large forms that can reach up to 7 feet high with a diameter as wide as 4 feet. As each inch is built, coil by coil, similar to how one builds a house, the final product becomes a one of a kind form that is rarely repeated, and oftentimes <b>goes</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> traditional ceramics.|$|E
25|$|An {{increasing}} number of economists and international commerce theorists have suggested that economic discrimination <b>goes</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> the bounds of individuals or businesses. The largest scale forms of economic discrimination, and the widest ranging, affect entire nations or global regions. Many consider that an open world economic system (globalization), which includes world bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), places countries at risk by practicing explicitly discriminatory techniques such as bilateral and regional bargaining, as well as asymmetrical trade balances and the maintaining of cheap force labor. Trade policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are often regarded as financial measures serving to economically oppress third world nations.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Barth, liberalism, and fundamentalism <b>goes</b> <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> {{the issue of}} inerrancy, however. From Barth's perspective, liberalism, as understood {{in the sense of}} the 19th century with Friedrich Schleiermacher and Hegel as its leading exponents and not necessarily expressed in any particular political ideology, is the divinization of human thinking. This, to him, inevitably leads one or more philosophical concepts to become the false God, thus attempting to block the true voice of the living God. This, in turn, leads to the captivity of theology by human ideology. In Barth's theology, he emphasizes again and again that human concepts of any kind, breadth or narrowness quite beside the point, can never be considered as identical to God's revelation. In this aspect, Scripture is also written human language, which bears witness to the self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ. Scripture cannot be considered as identical to God's self-revelation, which is properly only Jesus Christ. However, in his freedom and love, God truly reveals himself through human language and concepts, with a view toward their necessity in reaching fallen humanity. Thus Barth claims that Christ is truly presented in Scripture and the preaching of the church, echoing a stand expressed in his native Swiss Reformed Church's Helvetic Confession of the 16th century.|$|E

[...] Their connection is so strong, so powerful they even share the same narcotic induced hallucinations. Soul mates indeed". Kessenich later named the episode one of the [...] "Top 25 Episodes of All Time" [...] of The X-Files, ranking it at number 25. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting that the episode [...] "doesn't do much with is [...] reality/hallucination premise", Vitaris praised Duchovny and Anderson's acting, noting that their performances were [...] "the prime pleasures" [...] of the episode.|$|E

According to Bradley Stern, reporting from MuuMuse, he believed the recordings were her only entries that gained a global fanbase because of its influence through the video game phenomenon, which was rare of Asian markets to capture outside of their native countries. Similarly, Emily Goodman from Axs.com published an article on January 4, 2015, with the headline exclaiming that Utada was [...] "best known for her work on Kingdom Hearts.

Later she revealed that [...] " [...] does not condone unsafe sexual practices". Nicholas Callaway from Callaway Arts & Entertainment said that the book [...] was [...] "inevitably going to be controversial. The book explores every aspect of sexual fantasy. It's hard to calculate the effect, , Sex should be considered 'art'". Originally it was rumored that Time Warner was nervous about {{the release of the}} book; however, in an interview with Vanity Fair, William Sarnoff, president of Warner Books, said he felt that Madonna [...] "should pursue all avenues of creativity as she defines it". The Warner company had also previously assured that they would make sure Sex reached its main target audience and also reminded that the book was safely wrapped in a Mylar bag to prevent in-store peeping and contained a warning label. Michael Kilian of the Chicago Tribune published an article on October 7, 1992, regarding the then upcoming release of Sex: [...] "Prepare thyself, , The mega-event of the millennium is to occur in precisely two weeks. It's an event far more mega than the November election, the collapse of communism or even the crowning of Leanza Cornett as the new Miss America."
