Analysis {{was made on}} main factors affecting water consumption. Results showed that heat release of desulfurization reaction and water evaporation went up with sulfur content increasing; Free water and bound water in gypsum increased rapidly with calcium improved; When sulfur content enhanced from 0. 5 % to 3. 5 %, water evaporation of reactor increased by 28. 9 % and waste water increased by 7. 8 %; With inlet flue temperature of WFGD raised from 120 ℃ to 200 ℃, waste water increased by 25. 3 % and evaporation of water increased by 102. 35 %; Once <b>gas-gas</b> <b>heater</b> (GGH) was installed, heat release of original flue gas decreased by 43. 72 % and the total water consumption decreased by 39. 06 %. Therefore, with sulfur content and temperature of inlet flue increasing, water consumption raises. Installation of gas-gas heater(GGH) can effectively reduce water consumption of WFGD system. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Material balance {{calculation}} {{was adopted}} to a wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) system for exploring impacts of <b>gas-gas</b> <b>heater</b> (GGH). Effects of GGH on flue and water consumption were analyzed. Results showed that inlet flue temperature of desulfurization tower reduced by 3. 4 ℃ at 100 % load after installation of GGH. Exhausted gas temperature of system increased by 34. 9 ℃. The heat release of original flue in desulfurization tower reduced by 43. 72 %. Plume rise height was significantly improved. Water evaporation in desulfurization tower declined by 42. 07 %. Amount of addendum water reduced by 39. 06 %, and water vapor carried by flue decreased by 19. 78 % at the outlet of WFGD. Therefore, operation condition of flue emission is improved and water consumption decreases with GGH. 1. Background Wet flue gas desulfurization was widely applied in {{thermal power plant}} due to mature technology and high desulfurization efficiency. Gas-gas heater(GGH) was the key equipment of WFGD system. The original and net flue gas desulfurized exchanged heat at GGH, original flue gas temperature reduced and net flue gas temperature increased. Since the operation was not standardized and the purge process was unreasonable, heat storage components of GGH was pron...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} to our {{knowledge}} the first to describe {{the effect of a}} <b>Gas-Gas</b> <b>Heater</b> (GGH) of a coal fired power plant's has on (i) the H 2 SO 4 concentration and (ii) the particle/aerosol number concentration and particle size distribution present in the flue gas. In the absence of a GGH, homogenous nucleation takes places inside the Wet Flue Gas Desulphurisation (WFGD) converting the gaseous H 2 SO 4 into aerosol H 2 SO 4. This leads to a high aerosol number concentration behind the WFGD with 80 % of the aerosols being smaller than 0. 02 μm. This implies that an amine based carbon capture (CC) installation treating this flue gas can suffer from amine mist formation due to the high amount of available nuclei (i. e., H 2 SO 4 aerosols) resulting in high amine emissions. In contrast, {{in the presence of a}} GGH not only 70 % of the H 2 SO 4 is removed from the flue gas (measured at the Nijmegen powerplant), but also homogenous nucleation in the WFGD is prevented resulting in low particle number concentrations. The flue gas leaving the GGH will not create any mist formation issues in an amine based CC installation due to the low amount of nuclei present in the flue gas. It is not the reduction in H 2 SO 4 concentration by 70 % inside the GGH as such that prevents mist formation but absence of H 2 SO 4 in its aerosol form. These results are most likely quite widely transformable to other power plants that burn low sulfur coal i. e., around 0. 7 weight%. This information will serve future pilot and demo CC installation around the world; in particular when retrofitted on power plants that have a GGH...|$|E

40|$|<b>Gas-gas</b> <b>heaters</b> (GGHs) {{are used}} to reheat gases through {{desulfurization}} in coal-fired power plants to reduce low-temperature corrosion and white smoke. Wrinkled heating elements are installed inside the GGH to perform effective heat exchange. An optimization study of the heating element shape was conducted to reduce the differential pressure effectively and improve performance. An integrated analysis model was applied. Based on actual operational data, a computational fluid dynamic analysis {{was conducted on the}} L-type heating element and GGH system. The experiments applied the optimal latin hypercube sampling method, and numerical analysis was performed for each sample. Based on the response surface, the result of the sample was optimized through the pointer algorithm. For the integrated analysis model, validation was performed by comparison with the actual operational data, and the thermal-fluid characteristics of the heating element and GGH system were analyzed to set three parameters: plate angle, undulated angle, and pitch 1. From the optimization result, increases in the undulated angle and pitch 1 reduce the pressure drop by widening the heating element cross section. By increasing the plate angle, the heat transfer area is secured and the reduced heat transfer coefficient is compensated, improving the GGH performance...|$|R
