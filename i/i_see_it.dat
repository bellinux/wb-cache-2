5|$|The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> is the 2008 third studio album by American R singer, songwriter, and {{producer}} Raphael Saadiq. After independently releasing his 2004 album Ray Ray, Saadiq continued working on other artists' projects {{and developed a}} partnership with audio engineer Charles Brungardt, who shared the singer's fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. In 2008, he returned from a vacation that inspired him to pursue classic soul music and recorded The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> primarily at his North Hollywood studio with the engineer.|$|E
5|$|The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> was {{released}} by Columbia Records on September 16, 2008, and was initially overlooked by consumers. It sold steadily and spent 41 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart, reaching sales of 282,000 copies in the United States by May 2011. It also performed well in European countries such as France, where it charted for 51 weeks. The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> received generally positive reviews from critics and {{was seen as an}} exemplary release of the classic soul revival at the time. It also garnered Saadiq a newer, more diverse audience as he toured extensively in support of the album, performing concerts in the US, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
5|$|Saadiq and Brungardt disregarded their {{previous}} experience in recording production while making The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It.</b> Instead, they experimented with older recording techniques {{in an attempt}} to recreate the Motown music aesthetic of the 1960s, producing a traditional soul album draws on the Motown Sound and Philadelphia soul styles. Saadiq, whose lyrics mostly deal with romantic subject matter, described it as a series of love songs about music and remaining faithful to it despite trends.|$|E

5|$|Saadiq {{promoted}} Stone Rollin with a North American spring tour, {{performing a}} series of concerts during March to June 2011. It began on March 15 at the House of Blues in Dallas and concluded on June 8 at Stubb's in Austin, Texas. Some concert dates featured electronic music duo Quadron as an opening act. The tour included performances at music festivals such as South by Southwest and Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, for which Saadiq played songs from The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> and Stone Rollin, as well as unreleased material.|$|E
5|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} Stone Rollin at Blakeslee Recording Company, his {{recording studio}} complex in Los Angeles, California. He spent approximately one year {{working on the}} album, including writing its music and lyrics. He worked on the album's production with recording engineer and long-time collaborator Charles Brungardt. The two shared an interest in collecting vintage musical gear and studying historic recording techniques, which they had applied in recording The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It.</b> However, for Stone Rollin, they sought to eschew its predecessor's Motown aesthetic for a more eclectic style, in keeping with Saadiq's other musical projects.|$|E
5|$|Stone Rollin expands on the {{traditional}} soul music style of his 2008 album The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> with exploring rhythm and blues, rock, funk, and blues styles. A widespread critical success and deemed by some reviewers as Saadiq's best work, the record was noted for its stylistic breadth, groove-based compositions, varied subject matter, and incorporation of the Mellotron keyboard. It also became Saadiq's highest-charting album in the United States, reaching number 14 on the Billboard 200. He supported the album with a concert tour spanning from March to August 2011.|$|E

5|$|In {{reproducing}} the album's {{recorded music}} onstage, he performed with his eight-piece band, which included bass player Calvin Turner, drummers Lemar Carter and Charles Jones, guitarists Rob Bacon and Josh Smith, and backing singers Erika Jerry and BJ Kemp. In {{contrast to his}} touring for The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> Saadiq {{did not include a}} horn section for certain shows and played on guitar for a more rock-oriented sound. While travelling between concert dates, Saadiq and his bandmates watched music documentaries for inspiration, including a documentary on Bob Marley & The Wailers and the 1973 film Wattstax. He expanded his touring in promotion of the album into August 2011, with concerts alternating between North American headlining dates and European music festivals.|$|E

25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” For me, a man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common {{sense of right and wrong}} that does a city good—a decent guy.

500|$|According to Brungardt, the {{recording}} of the project's earlier songs, [...] "Heart Attack", was critical in their decision for the album. The song was recorded during Saadiq's break from touring for The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> and had originally featured that album's sound, {{with which they were}} not satisfied. When they revisited the song, Saadiq reconstructed the original recording after stripping track's individually recorded instrument parts, {{with the exception of the}} vocals and some of its drums. In an interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt said of their approach, [...] "We wanted to evolve the songs, and I wanted to evolve the engineering, as well. On The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> everything was pretty much tube pre's and tube compressors. On this one, I wanted to play around with some of the more solid-state gear".|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> was {{included}} {{in a number of}} critics' best albums lists. It was named one of the year's 10-best records by the Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, and the Houston Chronicle, which cited it as ninth best. It was also ranked at number five by Exclaim!, number seven by The Irish Times, number one by NPR, number five by The Observer, number three by Time Out, and number two by USA Today. The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> was voted the 18th best album of 2008 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published in The Village Voice; the poll's singles list had six of the album's songs voted in, including [...] "100 Yard Dash" [...] at number 114 and both [...] "Love That Girl" [...] and [...] "Big Easy" [...] at number 250. Nate Chinen of The New York Times included [...] "100 Yard Dash" [...] in his top-five singles list for 2008. The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> also nominated for the 2009 Grammy Award for Best R Album. [...] "Love That Girl" [...] was nominated for Best Traditional R Vocal Performance, while [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] was nominated for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.|$|E
500|$|Saadiq called The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> [...] "the {{culmination}} of a lifetime of experiences informed by the music I grew up on." [...] Kristal Hawkins of The Village Voice said that he [...] "hit his artistic maturity" [...] with the album. Robert Christgau remarked on its place in his solo career, [...] "In 1996, Saadiq turned the climactic Tony! Toni! Toné! album into a virtuoso history lesson. Six years later, he tried to dazzle Maxwell in his own reflected glory. Six years later yet again, he outd himself with a fearless return to retro." [...] Elton John, a fan of Saadiq's music since his beginnings with Tony! Toni! Toné!, {{said that he was}} [...] "blown away" [...] by The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> citing it as [...] "my album of the year – a soul record of the highest quality." [...] He subsequently called Saadiq to congratulate him for the album and ask him to play at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2009. In an interview for Blues & Soul, Saadiq elaborated on the album's impact on his career: [...] "before that record – after I'd been in Tony Toni Tone! and Lucy Pearl – most people had thought 'Oh well, he's a producer now. He’s never gonna be an artist, he's not gonna put the time in' ... The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> showed them that yes, I could put the time in still and be an artist!" ...|$|E
500|$|The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> {{also earned}} Saadiq the highest {{international}} profile of his career. In promoting the album, he broadened his audience demographic and expanded his repertoire as a touring artist. His extensive touring in the US and Europe garnered {{the attention of}} younger, white audiences who were not exposed to his previous solo albums and work with Tony! Toni! Toné!. The Press of Atlantic City wrote that the album [...] "brought {{in a whole new}} generation of Saadiq fans, with songs such as '100 Yard Dash' striking a chord with even ironic teenagers." [...] According to Gail Mitchell of Billboard, The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> helped Saadiq reach [...] "the major-market hipster crowd, music supervisors and festival bookers." [...] He also attained a following among Japanese audiences. Saadiq's touring for the album influenced his approach for recording his next album, Stone Rollin', in 2011, as he noted the louder, raw sound and general feeling of performing live. It also continued his partnership with Charles Brungart, who assisted Saadiq in recording Stone Rollin.|$|E

500|$|Morello {{elaborated}} {{that the}} Nightwatchman is now [...] "my principal musical focus, as <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> {{for the remainder}} of my life. From the earliest days of playing open mic nights at coffee houses, it was apparent to me that this music was as important to me as any music I've ever been involved in.

Doggett interprets this statement as reflecting Harrison's [...] "decaying relationship" [...] with McCartney at the time.

Lie remained active in Norwegian public life, even after his 100th birthday, and in 2008 he celebrated his 103rd birthday with the release of a new biography, [...] "Slik jeg ser det nå" [...] (As <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> now).|$|E
