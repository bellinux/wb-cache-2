40|$|The {{natural history}} of {{follicular}} lymphoma (FL) is frequently characterized by transformation to a more aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We compared the gene-expression profiles between transformed DLBCL and their antecedent <b>FL.</b> <b>No</b> genes were observed to increase or decrease their expression {{in all of the}} cases of histological transformation. However, two different gene-expression profiles associated with the transformation process were defined, one in which c-myc and genes regulated by c-myc showed increased expression and one in which these same genes showed decreased expression. Further, there was a striking difference in gene-expression profiles between transformed DLBCL and de novo DLBCL, because the gene-expression profile of transformed DLBCL was more similar to their antecedent FL than to de novo DLBCL. This study demonstrates that transformation from FL to DLBCL can occur by alternative pathways and that transformed DLBCL and de novo DLBCL have very different gene-expression profiles that may underlie the different clinical behaviors of these two types of morphologically similar lymphomas...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{evaluated}} plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), factor VII activity (FVII), and fibrinogen in {{a sample}} of octo-nonagenarians. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship of these fibrinolytic and coagulation parameters with lipoprotein profile and anthropometric variables in the absence or presence of disability. METHODS: We enrolled a population of 162 octo-nonagenarians, divided in two groups on the basis of presence or absence of disability in the activity of daily living (ADL). All the anthropometric determinations were carried out according to standardized methods. Blood samples for hemostatic and lipid determinations were collected after overnight fasting and resting. RESULTS: PAI- 1 activity and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in disabled (DIS) compared to free-living (FL) adults, whereas FVII did not show differences in the two groups. PAI- 1 activity and FVII positively correlated to anthropometric parameters (body mass index, subscapular and tricipital skinfold thickness) in both DIS and <b>FL.</b> <b>No</b> correlations were found between fibrinogen and other variables in FL, whereas a negative relation with high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels emerged in DIS. FVII was positively related with total cholesterol low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B in both FL and DIS. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of octo-nonagenarians, PAI- 1 activity and FVII show a significant correlation with several anthropometric and lipoprotein parameters, suggesting that these variables are strongly associated with body composition and lipid metabolism independent from age and disability. DIS presented higher PAI- 1 and fibrinogen levels; this observation may take in account the high prevalence of vascular diseases and also occult inflammation, which are known to affect these parameters...|$|E

The phases that emerge include a Fermi liquid (<b>FL),</b> with <b>no</b> lattice distortions, an insulating polaron liquid (PL) at strong coupling, and a charge ordered insulating (COI) phase around half- filling. The COI phase is separated from the Fermi liquid by a regime of phase coexistence whose width grows with increasing electron-phonon coupling.

40|$|Abstract Purpose R-CHOP (rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, {{vincristine}} and prednisone) and R-CVP (rituximab with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone) {{have both}} been used successfully {{in the treatment of}} patients with symptomatic follicular lymphoma (<b>FL).</b> <b>No</b> study has compared the efficacy of the two treatment modalities and attempted to evaluate the role of anthracyclines in the management of patients with FL. We conducted a meta-analysis of relevant literature comparing the two treatment arms for FL with response being the final endpoint. Patients and Methods Two analyses were conducted: The first analysis compared R-CHOP to R-CVP as frontline agents for the treatment of FL, and the second analysis included both untreated and relapsed patients. Results For both studies, R-CVP was superior to R-CHOP when evaluating for complete response (CR). Odds ratios were 2. 86 (95 % CI, 1. 81 – 4. 51) in the first analysis and 1. 48 (95 % CI, 0. 991 – 2. 22) in the second analysis. However for overall response (CR+Partial response, PR), R-CHOP was superior, with odds ratios of 5. 45 (95 % CI: 2. 51 – 11. 83) and 5. 54 (95 % CI: 2. 69 – 11. 40), for the first and second analyses, respectively. Conclusion R-CHOP and R-CVP protocols achieve excellent overall response. In patients with known cardiac history, omission of anthracyclines is reasonable and R-CVP provides a competitive CR rate. In younger patients with FL where cumulative cardio-toxicity may be of importance in the long term and in whom future stem cell transplantation is an option, again R-CVP may be a more appealing option. </p...|$|E
40|$|Absence {{epilepsy}} is characterised by a paroxysmal loss of consciousness, of abrupt onset and termination, and {{is associated}} with a bilateral synchronous spike and wave discharge (SWD) on the electroencephalogram. Absence seizures involve an interplay between thalamic and cortical structures, although most research has so far focussed on sensory thalamic nuclei and the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN). Thus, microinfusion of ethosuximide (ETX), a first choice anti-absence drug, into either the ventrobasal thalamus or RTN of the genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg (GAERS), a validated rat model of absence epilepsy, does not produce immediate cessation of seizure activity, as is seen following systemic administration. As recent evidence indicates a seizure initiation site within the peri-oral region of the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1 po), we have now applied ETX into S 1 po as well as the somatosensory cortex forelimb region (S 1 FL) and the motor cortex (M 1) of freely moving GAERS. Microinfusion of 10 or 20 nmol/side of ETX into S 1 po produced an immediate cessation of seizure activity. A less marked response was produced when even a higher dose (200 nmol/side) was infused into S 1 <b>FL.</b> <b>No</b> reduction of SWD was seen when ETX was infused into M 1. Microinfusion of CGP 36742 (5 nmol/side), a GABA(B) antagonist, produced immediate cessation of seizure activity in both S 1 po and M 1 and a delayed effect in S 1 FL. These data suggest that the ability of ETX to abolish genetically determined absence seizures is cortical-area specific and support the involvement of S 1 po in the initiation of SWDs...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} (AP) is {{a common}} disease {{in the department of}} gastroenterology with variable severity, from being mild and self-limited to severe and fatal. The early diagnosis and accurate prediction of AP severity are of great importance. Our primary observation showed that fatty liver (FL) was frequently detected in patients with AP. In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate the relation between FL and the severity and outcomes of AP. The medical records of 2671 patients with AP were reviewed retrospectively, and characteristics of AP patients were recorded. FL was assessed by abdominal CT scan, and AP patients were categorized by the occurrence of FL for the analysis. The variation of mortality, clinical severity and the appearance of CT were analyzed between the non-FL group and FL groups. Compared with patients without FL, an obviously higher rate of death and higher frequency of severe AP (SAP) and necrotizing AP (ANP) were observed in patients with FL, as well as the incidence of local complications and systemic complications. Taking obesity into consideration, a higher rate of death and more severe AP were found in patients with <b>FL,</b> <b>no</b> matter whether they were obese or not. Alcoholic fatty liver (AFL) and non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) were also separated for comparison in this study; the incidence of ANP and the clinical severity had {{no significant difference between the}} AFL and NAFL groups.

In particular, {{they are used}} in the Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS 3) project during 2012, 2013, and 2014 to take measurements from the environment around tropical cyclones, and from directly above tropical cyclones. There is concern that strict adherence to the weather avoidance rules used in 2012 may sacrifice the ability to observe important science targets. We have proposed modifications to these weather avoidance rules that we believe will improve the ability to observe science targets without compromising aircraft safety. The previous guidelines, used in 2012, specified: Do not approach thunderstorms within 25 nm during flight at FL 500 or below. When flying above FL 500 : Do not approach reported lightning within 25 NM in areas where cloud tops are reported at FL 500 or higher. Aircraft should maintain at least 10000 ft vertical separation from reported lightning if cloud tops are below <b>FL</b> 500. <b>No</b> over-flight of cumulus tops higher than <b>FL</b> 500. <b>No</b> flight into forecast or reported icing conditions. No flight into forecast or reported moderate or severe turbulence Based on past experience with high-altitude flights over tropical cyclones, we have recommended changing this guidance to: Do not approach thunderstorms within 25 nm during flight at FL 500 or below. Aircraft should maintain at least 5000 ft vertical separation from significant convective cloud tops except: a) When cloud tops above FL 500 : In the event of reported significant lightning activity or indicators of significant overshooting tops, do not approach within 10 - 25 nm, depending on pilot discretion and advice from Mission Scientist. b) When cloud tops are below FL 500, maintain 10000 ft separation from reported significant lightning or indicators of significant overshooting tops. No flight into forecasted or reported icing conditions. No flight into forecasted or reported moderate or severe turbulence The key changes have to do with overflight of high convective cloud tops and those producing lightning. Experience shows that most tropical oceanic convection (including that in tropical cyclones) is relatively gentle even if the cloud tops are quite high, and can be safely overflown. Exceptions are convective elements producing elevated lightning flash rates (more than just the occasional flash, which would trigger avoidance under the previous rules) and significant overshooting cloud tops...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to identify, for given {{technology}} levels (TRL) and mission requirements, those parameters that are critical for preliminary sizing of a hypersonic airbreathing airliner. Mission requirements will dictate a solution space of possible vehicle architecture capable of meeting cruise conditions as well as of taking-off (TO) and landing. In practice, once defined a range of cruise vehicle architectures, constraints are imposed (as to all passenger airliners), such as: 1. take off (=TO) and landing distance (so-called field length, FL) : <b>FL</b> <b>no</b> longer than for the B- 747 - 400, or 10000 ft; 2. completing TO with one engine off; 3. max acceleration at TO and climb-out (CO) = 0. 4 g; 4. Hydrogen fuel (Meeting NOx emission limits (EINOx) is a further constraint not discussed in this paper). These constraints enable focusing on a realistic design out of the broad range of vehicles capable of performing the given mission. Thus a realistic vehicle must not only integrate aerodynamics and propulsion system; in fact, it is the result of many iterations in the design space, until performance and constraints are successfully achieved and met. The Gross Weight at Take Off (TOGW) was deliberately discarded as a constraint, based on Previous studies by Czysz. Typically, limiting from the beginning the TOGW leads to a vicious spiral where weight and propulsion system requirements keep growing, eventually denying convergence. In designing passenger airliners, in fact, it is the payload that is assumed fixed from the start, not the total weight. A parametric analysis of the hypersonic vehicle architecture is presented: in particular, optimal size, weight and geometrical shape are defined for different mission requirements. This analysis has shown that, it is possible to define a range of possible successful solutions for the European LAPCAT II project...|$|E
40|$|Com o objetivo de analisar as complicações do tubo gástrico isoperistáltico na reconstrução de faringe os autores analisaram retrospectivamente 16 pacientes submetidos a faringolaringectomia total (<b>FL)</b> <b>no</b> período de julho de 1997 a dezembro de 2000. Todos os pacientes eram dos sexo masculino, idades entre os 38 - 74 anos (média 54), sendo nove eutróficos e sete desnutridos. Onze pacientes apresentavam lesão primária no seio piriforme, dois na área retrocricóideia, um na epiglote e duas recidivas (base da língua e faringe). Todos eram estadio IV. Quatro pacientes apresentavam tratamento prévio, três com cirurgia e um com radioterapia. Em dez pacientes foram {{realizadas}} faringolaringectomia total + esofagectomia cervical com esvaziamento linfonodal bilateral, em três faringolaringectomia total + esofagectomia cervical + esvaziamento cervical unilateral; em um faringectomia total e esofagectomia cervical; glossectomia total com faringectomia total + esofagectomia cervical em um paciente e a rotação do tubo gástrico em um paciente. O tempo cirúrgico variou de duas horas e trinta minutos a oito horas (média cinco horas). Somente um paciente não apresentou complicações. A complicação cirúrgica mais freqüente foi a fístula em doze pacientes (75 %), seguida da deiscência em cinco (31, 2 %). As complicações clínicas ocorreram em 37, 5 % dos pacientes, sendo a mais freqüente a broncopneumonia em quatro casos (25 %). O tempo de internação variou de cinco a 20 dias com média de oito dias. Dois pacientes faleceram, um de sepsis abdominal e outro por acidente vascular cerebral. Os dados foram submetidos a análise estatística. Concluímos que o tempo cirúrgico é um fator determinante de complicações, existe uma tendência dos pacientes com idades acima de 74 anos de apresentar complicações. As demais variáveis estudadas: idade, estado nutricional, confecção de retalhos, esplenectomias e tratamento prévio (radioterapia) não implicam necessariamente em complicações. Assim, não constituem fatores limitantes para utilização do tubo gástrico isoperistáltico com vistas à reconstrução da faringe e esôfago cervicalThe {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze complications when the isoperistaltic gastric tube is used in pharyngeal reconstruction. Therefore, the authors retrospectively analyzed 16 patients who had undergone total pharyngolaryngectomy during the period, July 1997 to December 2000. The study population consisted of male patients, whose ages ranged from 38 years to 74 years (mean 54 years). There were nine healthy patients and seven malnourished patients, who presented: primary lesions in the piriform sinus ? 11 patients, lesions in the retrocricoid area ? 02 patients, lesions in the epiglottis ? 01 patient and 2 recurrences (base of tongue and pharynx). All were stage IV lesions and four patients had previously undergone treatment - three surgical and one radiotherapeutic. Ten patients underwent total pharyngolaryngectomy and cervical esophagectomy with bilateral lymphonodal emptying; three patients - total pharyngolaryngectomy and cervical esophagectomy with unilateral cervical emptying; one patient underwent total pharyngectomy and cervical esophagectomy; one patient underwent total glossectomy with total pharyngectomy and cervical esophagectomy; gastric tube rotation was performed in one patient. The duration of the surgery varied between two and a half hours and eight hours (mean 05 hours). Only one patient did not present complications. The most common complication was a fistula in twelve patients (75 %), followed by dehiscence in five patients (31. 2 %). Clinical complications occurred in 37. 5 % of the patients, the most common was bronchopneumonia in 4 cases (25 %). The hospitalization period varied between 05 days and 20 days (mean 08 days). Two patients died, one with abdominal sepsis and the other due to cerebrovascular accident. The data were statistically analyzed. We concluded that the duration of surgery was a determining factor for complications and patients above the age of 74 demonstrated a tendency to present complications. The other variables in this study such as age, nutritional status, creation of flaps, splenectomies as well as previous radiotherapy do not necessarily imply complications and, therefore, are not limiting factors when the isoperistaltic gastric tube is used in pharyngeal and cervical esophageal reconstructio...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} whether {{the analysis of}} immunoglobulin (Ig) /T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements is useful in the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders. METHODS: In a series of 107 consecutive cases with initial suspicion of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Southern blot (SB) analysis of Ig/TCR rearrangements was performed. RESULTS: In 98 of 100 histopathologically conclusive cases, Ig/TCR gene results were concordant. In one presumed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLCL) and one follicular lymphoma (<b>FL)</b> case <b>no</b> clonality could be detected by SB analysis, or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at second stage. In the DLCL, sampling error might have occurred; the FL was revised after an initial diagnosis of reactivity. In many of the histopathologically inconclusive cases Ig/TCR gene SB analysis was helpful, giving support for the histopathological suspicion. However, {{because of a lack}} of (clinical) follow up data this could not be confirmed in a few cases. CONCLUSIONS: Experienced haematopathologists or a pathologist panel can diagnose malignant versus reactive lesions in most cases without the need for Ig/TCR gene analysis and can select the 5 - 10 % of cases that might benefit from molecular clonality studies...|$|R
40|$|Underpricing is a {{phenomenon}} which the current share price the Initial Public Offering lower than the price of shares traded on the secondary market. Companies that do Initial Public Offering avoid underpricing, because companies do not get maximum funds {{from the sale of}} shares premiere. This study aims to examine the factors - factors that affect the level of Underpricing period 2010 - 2014. The population used in this study are all companies that conduct an Initial Public Offering on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) in 2010 - 2014. The research sample was determined by purposive sampling method. The samples used were 72 companies. Hypothesis testing using multiple regression analysis. The model results of this study show that (1) Reputation Underwriter has no effect on underpricing; (2) Age Company has no effect on underpricing; (3) The Company size has no effect on underpricing; (4) Financial Leverage (<b>FL)</b> has <b>no</b> effect on underpricing; (5) The auditor's reputation has a significant effect on underpricing; and (6) Return on Assets (ROA) has a significant effect on underpricing. This means that the level variables and ROA Auditor Reputation can affect the level of underpricing...|$|R
40|$|The fl int from Schipluiden {{consists}} of {{a small amount of}} high-quality imported material, including some typical Michelsberg tool types, and a large component of rolled pebbles. The source of these pebbles is unknown, but must have been relatively well accessible. The tools formed part of various tool kits geared to such activities as hide scraping, the manufacture of ornaments, cereal harvesting and fi re making. The range of activities suggests that complete households once occupied the dune. Flint artefacts constitute one of the largest fi nd categories at Schipluiden. <b>No</b> <b>fl</b> int {{is to be found in}} the dune’s surroundings, which means that all the material had to be imported. Identifying the fl int sources was therefore an importan...|$|R
40|$|Background: Increased {{understanding}} of the relationship between lymphomas and co-morbidities is likely to provide valuable insights into the natural history of these disorders. Methods: 761 cases with lymphoma (310 diffuse large B-cell [DLBCL]; 226 follicular [FL]; and 225 Hodgkin [HL]) and 761 unaffected age and sex matched controls were recruited and their histories of infection and non-infection diagnoses in primary care records were compared using negative binomial regression. Results: No differences were observed between the infectious illness patterns of DLBCL and FL cases and their matched controls over the 15 years preceding lymphoma diagnosis. A marked excess of infectious illness episodes was recorded for HL cases compared to their controls; evident at least a decade prior to HL diagnosis. For non-infectious consultations an excess of case over control visits emerged 4 - 6 years before DLBCL and <b>FL</b> diagnosis; <b>no</b> specific co-morbidity associations were found. No case-control differences for non-infectious conditions were apparent for HL. Conclusion: There are substantial variations in patterns of illness prior to diagnosis of the three lymphoma subtypes examined. The excess of infectious diagnoses prior to HL may point to underlying immune abnormality, but there was no suggestion of this for DLBCL and FL where a generalized excess of non-infectious conditions was evident.
