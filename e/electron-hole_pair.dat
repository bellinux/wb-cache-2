5|$|Semiconducting single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} emit near-infrared light upon photoexcitation, described interchangeably as fluorescence or photoluminescence (PL). The excitation of PL usually {{occurs as}} follows: an electron in a nanotube absorbs excitation light via S22 transition, creating an <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pair</b> (exciton). Both electron and hole rapidly relax (via phonon-assisted processes) from c2 to c1 and from v2 to v1 states, respectively. Then they recombine through a c1−v1 transition resulting in light emission.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, when a photon {{is absorbed}} by a solar cell it can produce an <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pair.</b> One of the carriers may reach the p-n junction {{and contribute to}} the current produced by the solar cell; such a carrier is said to be collected. Or, the carriers recombine with no net contribution to cell current.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{band gap}} (see below) determines what {{portion of the}} solar {{spectrum}} a photovoltaic cell absorbs. A semiconductor will not absorb photons of energy less than the band gap; and {{the energy of the}} <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pair</b> produced by a photon is equal to the bandgap energy. A luminescent solar converter uses a luminescent medium to downconvert photons with energies above the band gap to photon energies closer to the band gap of the semiconductor comprising the solar cell.|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} the <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pairing</b> reveals {{itself in the}} {{response}} of a double layer graphene system to the vector and scalar potentials. <b>Electron-hole</b> <b>pairing</b> results in a rigid (London) relation between the current and the difference of vector potentials in two adjacent layers. The diamagnetic effect {{can be observed in}} multiple connected systems in the magnetic field parallel to the graphene layers. Such an effect would be considered as a hallmark of the <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pairing,</b> but the value of the effect is extremely small. <b>Electron-hole</b> <b>pairing</b> significantly changes the response to the scalar potential, as well. It results in a complete (at zero temperature) or partial (at finite temperature) suppression of screening of the electric field of a test charge situated at some distance to the double layer system. A strong increase of the electric field induced by the test charge under decrease in temperature can be considered as a spectacular hallmark of the <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pairing.</b> Comment: refs. are added, published versio...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to obtain a simplified dielectric function for thin films, incorporating quantum-size effects for <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pairs</b> excitations. By a proper generalisation to spheres, we analyse the photoabsorption of these systems. Our results show interesting quantum-size effects associated with resonances of <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pairs...</b>|$|R
50|$|In some states, the {{generation}} and recombination of <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pairs</b> are in equipoise. The number of <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pairs</b> in the steady state {{at a given}} temperature is determined by quantum statistical mechanics. The precise quantum mechanical mechanisms of generation and recombination are governed by conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.|$|R
25|$|A {{photodiode}} is a p–n junction or PIN structure. When a photon {{of sufficient}} energy strikes the diode, it creates an <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pair.</b> This mechanism {{is also known}} as the inner photoelectric effect. If the absorption occurs in the junction's depletion region, or one diffusion length away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in electric field of the depletion region. Thus holes move toward the anode, and electrons toward the cathode, and a photocurrent is produced. The total current through the photodiode is the sum of the dark current (current that is generated in the absence of light) and the photocurrent, so the dark current must be minimized to maximize the sensitivity of the device.|$|E
2500|$|In {{materials}} {{with a large}} exciton binding energy, {{it is possible for}} a photon to have just barely enough energy to create an exciton (bound <b>electron–hole</b> <b>pair),</b> but not enough energy to separate the electron and hole (which are electrically attracted to each other). In this situation, there is a distinction between [...] "optical bandgap" [...] and [...] "electrical band gap" [...] (or [...] "transport gap"). The optical bandgap is the threshold for photons to be absorbed, while the transport gap is the threshold for creating an <b>electron–hole</b> <b>pair</b> that is not bound together. The optical bandgap is at a lower energy than the transport gap.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the width}} of the {{depletion}} region (called the depletion width) cannot grow without limit. For each <b>electron–hole</b> <b>pair</b> recombination made, a positively charged dopant ion is left behind in the N-doped region, and a negatively charged dopant ion is created in the P-doped region. As recombination proceeds and more ions are created, an increasing electric field develops through the depletion zone that acts to slow and then finally stop recombination. At this point, there is a [...] "built-in" [...] potential across the depletion zone.|$|E

30|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} was firstly {{demonstrated}} by Gratzel in 1991 [12], which exhibited plenty of advantages {{such as its}} transparency, flexibility, low cost and easy fabrication process. DSSC is composed of three parts; photoanode, electrolyte and counter electrode, among which, the dyes adsorbed within a semiconducting photoanode layer absorb photons and generate <b>electron–hole</b> <b>pairs.</b> The efficiency of DSSC increases {{with the formation of}} more <b>electron–hole</b> <b>pairs.</b> It is well known that the TiO 2 nanoparticulate layer mixed with metallic nanoparticles showed a higher light absorbance due to the localized surface plasmon resonance around the surface of metal nanoparticles, and more <b>electron–hole</b> <b>pairs</b> were generated [13].|$|R
2500|$|Normal {{photovoltaic}} systems however {{have only one}} p-n junction and are therefore subject to a lower efficiency limit, called the [...] "ultimate efficiency" [...] by Shockley and Queisser. Photons with an energy below the band gap of the absorber material cannot generate an <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pair,</b> so their energy is not converted to useful output, and only generates heat if absorbed. For photons with an energy above the band gap energy, {{only a fraction of}} the energy above the band gap can be converted to useful output. When a photon of greater energy is absorbed, the excess energy above the band gap is converted to kinetic energy of the carrier combination. The excess kinetic energy is converted to heat through phonon interactions as the kinetic energy of the carriers slows to equilibrium velocity. Traditional single-junction cells have a maximum theoretical efficiency of 33.16%.|$|E
2500|$|One {{upconversion}} {{technique is}} to incorporate lanthanide-doped materials ( [...] , , [...] or a combination), {{taking advantage of}} their luminescence to convert infrared radiation to visible light. Upconversion process occurs when two infrared photons are absorbed by rare-earth ions to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. [...] ions {{have been the most}} used. [...] ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54µm. Two [...] ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional <b>electron–hole</b> <b>pair</b> that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small. In addition, fluoroindate glasses have low phonon energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with [...] ions.|$|E
2500|$|Response time: A photon {{absorbed by}} the {{semiconducting}} material will generate an <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pair</b> which will in turn start moving in the material under {{the effect of the}} electric field and thus generate a current. The finite duration of this current is known as the transit-time spread and can be evaluated by using Ramo's theorem. One can also show with this theorem that the total charge generated in the external circuit is well e and not 2e as might seem by the presence of the two carriers. Indeed, the integral of the current due to both electron and hole over time must be equal to e. The resistance and capacitance of the photodiode and the external circuitry give rise to another response time known as RC time constant [...] This combination of R and C integrates the photoresponse over time and thus lengthens the impulse response of the photodiode. When used in an optical communication system, the response time determines the bandwidth available for signal modulation and thus data transmission.|$|E
30|$|The {{electronic}} structure of TiO 2 {{plays a key}} role in TiO 2 photocatalysis. The increasing number of <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pairs</b> and the separation of <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pairs</b> at the surface of TiO 2 are the key factors to improve the photocatalytic abilities of TiO 2.

These resonances are directly transferred to excitonic {{peaks in the}} luminescence itself. This yields an unexpected consequence; the excitonic resonance can equally well originate from an electron-hole plasma or the presence of excitons. At first, this consequence of SLEs seems counterintuitive because in few-particle picture an unbound <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pair</b> cannot recombine and release energy corresponding to the exciton resonance because that energy is well below the energy an unbound <b>electron-hole</b> <b>pair</b> possesses.|$|E
