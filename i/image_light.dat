40|$|This paper puts {{forward a}} simple {{algorithm}} to make color <b>images</b> <b>lighter</b> based on Wavelet transformation and histogram smoothing. This algorithm uses HIS space {{which is based}} on human visual features. Without changing hue, it can conduct histogram smoothing in low brightness frequency domain through wavelet decomposition and make the <b>images</b> <b>lighter,</b> which at the same time avoids vagueness of details and increase of noises. According to experiment results, this algorithm can make low brightness color <b>images</b> <b>lighter</b> effectively with low time complexity...|$|R

50|$|Light {{direction}} {{is very important}} to the quality of a photoclinometric <b>image.</b> <b>Light</b> that comes from directly over the surface (behind the camera) makes it hard to distinguish the shadows. Multiple light sources are also a problem, since they destroy important shadows required for the algorithms to work properly.|$|E

5000|$|Her work, 'Winged Pilgrims: A Chronicle' was {{hosted by}} Bose Pacia gallery, New York City in 2007. A {{multi-part}} installation including sculptures, lightboxes, and a recorded soundtrack that present various iconographies like birds, landscapes, and robed figures articulates {{the language of}} migration and a response to globalization. With a series of imaginary landscapes and digital props interspersed with references from Indian sculpture, Persian/ Mughal miniature, Chinese brush painting and documentary photography shown through a moving <b>image</b> <b>light</b> box, the work went on to be exhibited in many other galleries elsewhere." [...] The moving <b>image</b> <b>light</b> box(which she uses in her later works as well), that Chhachhi developed as a new artistic medium, uses a series of still and moving layers of photographic images to almost cinematic effect. She expounds on the work, [...] "This work configures a spatial, temporal and conceptual field within which the movement of ideas, objects, forms across Asia - with China and India as significant nodes - is articulated through three key elements that are simultaneously material and metaphoric: Birds, the robes of Buddhist Pilgrims and the 'Plasma Action' Electronic T.V. toy.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, {{the artist}} was invited by the Tate Britain to create a work. Inspired by a {{photograph}} by Barbara Hepworth, One Form (Single Form), 1937, she created an archival display to interrogate the way images are choreographed. Using ten vitrines, Moth presented images from the Tate's archives from the years of 1930 to 1960 {{in order to create}} 'thought constellations'. Each vitrine treats a different element necessary to stage images of artworks: <b>Image,</b> <b>Light,</b> Book, Nature, Studio, Film, Imagination, Magic and Play.|$|E
50|$|Photographic optics {{generally}} {{project a}} circular image behind the lens. On smaller format cameras the image circle generally covers only the intended film size with little room to spare.

For large format use the circular patch of <b>image</b> <b>light</b> usually {{extends beyond the}} minimum size circle needed to fully cover the rectangle of the film. The extra image offers room to spare {{to make use of}} camera movements that re-align the lens away from dead center on the film.|$|E

50|$|Resolution and {{localization}} True resolution {{involves the}} distinction of whether a target, e.g. a star or a spectral line, is single or double, ordinarily requiring separable peaks in the image. When a target {{is known to be}} single, its location can be determined with higher precision than the image width by finding the centroid (center of gravity) of its <b>image</b> <b>light</b> distribution. The word ultra-resolution had been proposed for this process but it did not catch on, and the high-precision localization procedure is typically referred to as superresolution.|$|E
5000|$|Shirley {{cards are}} color {{reference}} cards {{that are used}} to perform skin-color balance in still photography printing.

Very few of these color reference cards showed an adult male as the reference <b>image.</b> <b>Light</b> skin tones therefore served as the recognized skin ideal standard.

50|$|Once the SOM {{is trained}} using the input data, the final map is not {{expected}} to have any twists. If the map is twist-free, the distance between the codebook vectors of neighboring neurons gives an approximation of the distance between different parts of the underlying data. When such distances are depicted in a grayscale <b>image,</b> <b>light</b> colors depict closely spaced node codebook vectors and darker colors indicate more widely separated node codebook vectors. Thus, groups of light colors can be considered as clusters, and the dark parts as the boundaries between the clusters. This representation can help to visualize the clusters in the high-dimensional spaces, or to automatically recognize them using relatively simple image processing techniques.|$|E

50|$|Melanin is {{important}} in mammalian pigmentation. The black feathers of birds owe their color to melanin; they are less readily degraded by bacteria than white feathers, or those containing other pigments such as carotenes. In a bird's eye, a specialized organ, rich in blood vessels, the pecten oculi, is also extremely rich in melanin, which has been considered to have role in absorption of light falling on optic disc and using it to warm up the eye. This, in turn may stimulate release of nutrients from pecten oculi to retina, via vitreous humor; it is plausible as bird retina is devoid of its own blood vessels. In pigment epithelium of retina, presence of high amounts of melanin granules may also minimize back-scatter of <b>image</b> <b>light</b> on the retina.|$|E
5000|$|Retinal {{eccentricity}} is when objects projected {{directly onto}} the fovea are the sharpest, while those further out in {{the periphery of the}} retina become steadily less focused. This is due to the distribution of cones and rods throughout the retina. When we view an <b>image,</b> <b>light</b> passes through the cornea, and through the pupil, which is controlled by the iris. It then passes through the lens and is projected onto the retina {{at the back of the}} eye. In the middle of the retina is the fovea, which contains a high concentration of cones. Cones are responsible for colour vision and have high spatial acuity, whereas rods are not. Rods are instead responsible for vision at lower light. Cones are much more sparsely located in the periphery of the retina, where there is instead a greater concentration of rods. When a central image is projected {{directly onto the}} fovea it is sharper and processed with greater speed and accuracy due to these cones, whereas images further in the periphery (greater eccentricity) are processed more slowly and less accurately.|$|E
5000|$|Making {{altitude}} (elevation) {{measurements of}} the Sun being simple and direct, requiring the user to aligning {{the image of the}} Sun through the front pinhole (aperture), centered onto the rear back plate which operates more like a mask and not a viewing pass hole for sighting the Sun with the naked eye. Much {{in the same manner as}} performing eyepiece projection with a telescope, one fashioned with a front and rear aperture (font lens and rear eyepiece) along with a projection screen behind the eyepiece, or more rudimentary, the projecting of the Sun’s image upon a small screen plate such as that done with a mariner’s back staff. The rear, or second aperture (pass hole) having the function of working as a blacken attenuator so that any reflecting, annulus shaped sunlight off the metal aperture is not too bright, the Sun’s <b>image</b> (<b>light)</b> passing through the second hole and similar in task though void of a fixed image plane, to that of an iris (diaphragm) in a camera lens to reduce the light intensity. For relative to human physiology, focusing on a bright spot of light such as a pin point image of the Sun for any extended period or repetitively over a short duration of time adversely effects momentarily, a person’s visual acuity, thus making it more challenging to focus one’s eyes to read the angular scale. It being typical to orientate the instrument such that the operator faces looking slightly down upon the scale, the Sun at the users left, with right hand placed in such a way that the rays of sunlight pass through the two, perforated sighting plates, forming a bright illuminated spot on the observer’s finger (see photo), the finger functioning as a projection screen. At the moment an optical alignment with the Sun is established, the angular value of the device is read by the operator at the point where the graduated scale is bisected by the hanging plumb line.|$|E
