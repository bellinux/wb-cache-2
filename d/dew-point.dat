The process model consists of the three main gas conditioning processes which exist in most upstream oil and gas processing plants; these are gas sweetening, gas dehydration, and hydrocarbon <b>dew-pointing.</b> The function of such a model is to provide a realistic process representation to test and verify different process control approaches, specifically those which deal with highly interactive control loops. ...|$|R

This raw gas needs gas {{conditioning}} to get it ready for pipeline transport and processing in a gas processing plant to separate it into its components.Some of the common processing steps are CO2 removal, dehydration, LPG extraction, <b>dew-pointing.</b> Technologies used to achieve these steps are adsorption, absorption, membranes and low temperature systems achieved by refrigeration or expansion through a Joule Thomson Valve or a Turboexpander.If such expansion is done through the Supersonic Gas Separator instead, frequently mechanical, economical and operational advantages can be gained as detailed below.|$|R

60|$|From 4 to 5 p.m. the {{temperature}} was 24 degrees, with a very cold wind; the elevation by the barometer was 15,260 feet, and the <b>dew-point</b> 10.5 degrees, giving the humidity 0.610, {{and the amount of}} vapour 1.09 grains in a cubic foot of air; the same elements at Calcutta, at the same hour, being thermometer 66.5 degrees, <b>dew-point</b> 60.5 degrees, humidity 0.840, and weight of vapour 5.9 grains.|$|E

At seven the following morning it was the same. One, sunk two feet six inches in mould and clay, stood constantly at 50.75.

60|$|I append a {{meteorological}} {{register of}} the separate months, {{but at the}} same time must remind the reader that it does not pretend to strict accuracy. It is founded upon observations made at Dorjiling by Dr. Chapman in the year 1837, for pressure temperature and wet-bulb only; the other data and some modifications of the above are supplied from observations of my own. Those for terrestrial and nocturnal radiation are accurate as far as they go, that is to say, they are absolute temperatures taken by myself, which may, I believe, be recorded in any year, but much higher are no doubt often to be obtained. The <b>dew-points</b> and saturations are generally calculated from the mean of two day observations (10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) of the wet-bulb thermometer, together with the minimum, or are taken from observations of Daniell's hygrometer; and as I find the mean of the temperature of 10 a.m., 4 p.m., and the minimum, to coincide within a few tenths with the mean temperature of the whole day, I assume that the mean of the wet-bulb observations of the same hours will give a near approach to that of the twenty-four hours. The climate of Dorjiling station has been in some degree altered by extensive clearances of forest, which render it more variable, more exposed to night frosts and strong sun-heat, and to drought, the drying up of small streams being one direct consequence. My own observations were taken at Mr. Hodgson's house, elevated 7,430 feet, the position of which I have indicated at the commencement of this section, where the differences of climate due to local causes are sufficiently indicated to show that in no two spots could similar meteorological results be obtained. At Mr. Hodgson's, for instance, the uniformity of temperature and humidity is infinitely more remarkable than at Dr. Chapman's, possibly from my guarding more effectually against radiation, and from the greater forests about Mr. Hodgson's house. I have not, however, ventured to interfere with the temperature columns on this account.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} {{disagreement}} among existing methods of determining atmospheric water vapor concentration at <b>dew-points</b> below - 40 C. A {{major source of}} error is wall effects which result from the necessity of bringing samples into the instruments. All of these instruments also have response times {{on the order of}} seconds. NASA Langley is developing a water vapor sensor which utilizes the absorption of the infrared radiation produced by a diode laser to estimate water vapor concentration. The laser beam is directed through an aircraft window to a retroreflector located on an engine. The reflected beam is detected by an infrared detector located near the laser. To maximize signal to noise, derivative signals are analyzed. By measuring the 2 f/DC signal and correcting for ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure and air speed (which results in a Doppler shifting of the laser beam), the water vapor concentration can be retrieved. Since this is an in situ measurement there are no wall effects and measurements can be made at a rate of more than 20 per second. This allows small spatial variations of water vapor to be studied. In order to study the sensitivity of the instrument to variations in temperature and air speed, a computer program which generated the 2 f, 3 f, 4 f, DC and 2 f/DC signals of the instrument as a function of temperature, pressure and air speed was written. This model was used to determine the effect of errors in measurement of the temperature and air speed on the measured water vapor concentration. Future studies will quantify the effect of pressure measurement errors, which are expected to be very small. As a result of these studied, a retrieval algorithm has been formulated, and will be applied to data taken during the PEM-West atmospheric science field mission. Spectroscopic studies of the water vapor line used by the instrument will be used to refine this algorithm. To prepare for these studies, several lasers have been studied to determine their output frequency range and power...|$|R

60|$|Both {{the climate}} and natural history of this flat on which Sulkun stands, {{are similar to those}} of the banks of the Soane; the crops are wretched. At this season the dryness of the {{atmosphere}} is excessive: our nails cracked, and skins peeled, whilst all articles of wood, tortoiseshell, etc., broke on the slightest blow. The air, too, was always highly electrical, and the <b>dew-point</b> was frequently 40 degrees below the temperature of the air.|$|E
60|$|The {{temperature}} at this elevation, between 1 and 3 p.m., varied from 38 degrees to 59 degrees; the mean being 46.5 degrees, with the <b>dew-point</b> 34.6 degrees. The height I made 17,585 feet by barometer, and 17,517 by boiling-point. I tried the pulses of eight, persons after two hours' rest; they varied from 80 to 112, my own being 104. As usual at these heights, all the party were suffering from giddiness and headaches.|$|E
60|$|The few plants about were {{generally}} small tufted Arenarias and woolly Compositae, with a thick-rooted Umbellifer that spread its short, fleshy leaves and branches {{flat on the}} ground; the root was very aromatic, but wedged close in the rock. The temperature at 4 p.m. was 23 degrees, and bitterly cold; the elevation, 15,770 feet; <b>dew-point,</b> 16 degrees. The air was not very dry; saturation-point, 0.670 degrees, whereas at Calcutta it was 0.498 degrees at the same hour.|$|E
60|$|During the {{few days}} spent at Mirzapore, I was {{surprised}} to find the temperature of the day cooler by nearly 4 degrees than that of the hills above, or of {{the upper part of the}} Soane valley, while the nights on the other hand were decidedly warmer. The <b>dew-point</b> was even lower in proportion, 7.6 degrees, and the climate consequently drier. The following is an abstract of the observations taken at Mr. Hamilton's house on the banks of the Ganges (below).|$|E
6000|$|The {{barometer}} on {{the summit}} of Bhomtso stood at 15.548 inches;* [The elevation of Bhomtso, worked by Bessel's tables, and using corrected observations of the Calcutta barometer for the lower station, is 18,590 feet. The corresponding <b>dew-point</b> 4.4 degrees (49.6 degrees below that of the air {{at the time of}} observation). By Oltmann's tables the elevation is 18,540 feet. The elevation by boiling water is 18,305.] the temperature between 11.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. fluctuated between 44 degrees and 56 degrees: this was very high for so great an elevation, and no doubt due {{to the power of the}} sun on the sterile soil, and consequent radiated heat. The tension of vapour was [...] .0763, and the <b>dew-point</b> was 5.8 degrees, or 43.5 degrees below the temperature of the air. Such extraordinary dryness* [The weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air was no more than [...] .087 of a grain, and the saturation-point [...] .208.] and consequent evaporation, increased by the violent wind, sufficiently accounts for the height of the snow line; in further evidence of which, I may add that a piece of ice or snow laid on the ground here, does not melt, but disappears by evaporation.|$|E
60|$|The {{difference}} between sunrise, forenoon and afternoon dew-points at Calcutta {{and on the}} hills, is 13.6 degrees at each observation; but the atmosphere at Calcutta is relatively drier in the afternoon {{than that of the}} hills; the {{difference between}} the Calcutta sunrise and afternoon saturation-point being 0.449, and that between the hill sunrise and afternoon, 0.190. The march of the <b>dew-point</b> is thus the same in both instances, but owing to the much higher temperature of Calcutta, and the greatly increased tension of the vapour there, the relative humidity varies greatly during the day.|$|E
60|$|The hygrometric {{state of}} the {{atmosphere}} of the valley differs most decidedly from that of the hills. In the valley dew is constantly formed, which is owing to the amount of moisture in the air, for nocturnal radiation is more powerful on the hills. The sunrise and 9 p.m. observations in the valley, give a mean depression of the <b>dew-point</b> below the air of 12.3 degrees, and those at the upper level of 21.2 degrees, with no dew on the hills and a copious deposit in the valley. The corresponding {{state of the}} atmosphere as to saturation is 0.480 on the hills and 0.626 in the valley.|$|E
60|$|On one occasion, {{and that}} at night, the <b>dew-point</b> was as low as 11.5 degrees, with a {{temperature}} of 66 degrees, a depression rarely equalled at so low a temperature: this phenomenon was transient, and caused by {{the passage of a}} current of air loaded with dust, whose particles possibly absorbed the atmospheric humidity. From a comparison of the night and morning observations of thermometers laid on grass, the earth, and freely exposed, it appears that the grass parts with its heat much more rapidly than the earth, but that still the effect of radiation is slight, lowering its temperature but 2 degrees below that of the freely exposed thermometer.|$|E
60|$|It {{is evident}} from these observations, that {{compared}} with Calcutta, the dryness of the atmosphere is the most remarkable feature of this table-land, the temperature not being high; and to this, combined with the sterility of the soil over {{a great part of}} the surface, must be attributed the want of a vigorous vegetation. Though so favourably exposed to the influence of nocturnal radiation, the amount of the latter is small. The maximum depression of a thermometer laid on grass never exceeded 10 degrees, and averaged 7 degrees; whereas the average depression of the <b>dew-point</b> at the same hour amounted to 25 degrees in the morning. Of course no dew was deposited even in the clearest star-light night.|$|E
6000|$|The {{difference}} between the dry cold air of this elevation {{and that of the}} heated plains of India, is very great. During the driest winds of the Terai, in spring, the temperature is 80 degrees to 90 degrees, the tension of vapour is [...] .400 to [...] .500, with a <b>dew-point</b> 22 degrees below the temperature, and upwards of six grains of vapour are suspended in the cubic foot of air; a thick haze obscures the heavens, and clouds of dust rise high in the air; here on the other hand (probably owing to the rarity of the atmosphere and the low tension of its vapours), the drought is accompanied by perfect transparency, and the atmosphere is too attenuated to support the dust raised by the wind.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the end of}} May 1834 {{we entered}} {{for a second time}} the eastern mouth of the Strait of Magellan. The country {{on both sides of this}} part of the Strait {{consists}} of nearly level plains, like those of Patagonia. Cape Negro, a little within the second Narrows, may be considered as the point where the land begins to assume the marked features of Tierra del Fuego. On the east coast, south of the Strait, broken park-like scenery in a like manner connects these two countries, which are opposed to each other in almost every feature. It is truly surprising to find in a space of twenty miles such a change in the landscape. If we take a rather greater distance, as between Port Famine and Gregory Bay, that is about sixty miles, the difference is still more wonderful. At the former place we have rounded mountains concealed by impervious forests, which are drenched with the rain brought by an endless succession of gales; while at Cape Gregory there is a clear and bright blue sky over the dry and sterile plains. The atmospheric currents, although rapid, turbulent, and unconfined by any apparent limits, yet seem to follow, like a river in its bed, a regularly determined course. (11/1. The south-westerly breezes are generally very dry. January 29th, being at anchor under Cape Gregory: a very hard gale from west by south, clear sky with few cumuli; temperature 57 degrees, <b>dew-point</b> 36 degrees,--difference 21 degrees.

We halted in the snow from 3 to 4 p.m., during which time I again took angles and observations; the height of this spot, called Pabuk, is 16,038 feet, whence the pass is probably considerably over 17,000 feet, for there was a steep ascent beyond our position. The sun sank at 3 p.m., and the thermometer immediately fell from 35 degrees to 30.75 degrees.* [At 4 o'clock, to 29.5 degrees, the average <b>dew-point</b> was 16.3 degrees, and dryness 0.55; weight of vapour in a cubic foot, 1.33 grains.] ...|$|E
