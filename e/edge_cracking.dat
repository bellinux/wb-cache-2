50|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>cracking</b> is the {{formation}} of crescent-shaped cracks {{near the edge of}} a road. It is caused by lack of support of the road edge, sometimes due to poorly drained or weak shoulders. If left untreated, additional cracks will form until it resembles fatigue cracking. Like wheel-path fatigue cracking, poor drainage is a main cause of <b>edge</b> <b>cracking,</b> as it weakens the base, which hastens the deterioration of the pavement. Water ponding (a buildup of water which can also be called puddling) happens more frequently near the edge than {{in the center of the}} road path, as roads are usually sloped to prevent in-lane ponding. This leads to excess moisture in the shoulders and subbase at the road edge. <b>Edge</b> <b>cracking</b> differs from fatigue cracking in that the cracks form from the top down, where fatigue cracks usually start at the bottom and propagate to the surface.|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} of asbestos fibres with cellulose fibres in producing corrugated fibre reinforced cement sheets by the Hatschek process resulted in <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> for stacked sheets. This {{was due to}} the hydrophilic nature of cellulose, which increases its tendency for exchanging water with the surroundings. The drying process of corrugated sheets, in a stack, resulted in shrinkage hence <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> along the sheet. To reduce the magnitude of drying shrinkage and <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> potential, several mitigation strategies were proposed including the surface treatment of cellulose fibres, incorporation of wollastonite microfibres, addition of admixtures and superplasticizers, kaolin inclusion as partial {{replacement of}} cement and different exposure conditions. A fundamental understanding in mechanisms behind volume changes and how cracks form was crucial for optimization of the mitigation strategies. This thesis initially used a review approach to understand the mechanisms involved in different types of shrinkage and the role of different mitigation techniques. The ultimate goal was to achieve lower drying shrinkage and cracking risks in corrugated sheets along with reducing its economic impact. As a result, surface treatment of cellulose fibres, based on transforming the hydrophilic nature of cellulose to hydrophobic state, was investigated. Furthermore, inclusion of wollastonite/ kaolin as partial replacement of cement, were evaluated. Also, the potential of adding admixtures/ superplasticizers was explored. Finally, investigation on development of edge cracks in stacked corrugated fibrecement sheets was conducted under different exposure conditions. The results and findings of this research showed no significant improvement in permeability with cellulose surface treatment. Wollastonite microfibres promoted pore discontinuity hence significant reduction in permeability thus lower drying shrinkage. However, the resultant sheets were brittle. By reducing water content with addition of superplasticizers, density was enhanced thus reducing volume change from drying and wetting. Kaolin acted as internal restraint for shrinkage, refining the microstructure at the interfacial transition zone thus increasing density and its pozzolanic reaction enhanced mechanical properties. The inclusion of kaolin in the fibrecement mix in conjunction with controlling exposure conditions managed to eliminate <b>edge</b> <b>cracking...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of Aluminum alloys in {{the automotive industry}} due to their high strength-to-weight ratio has brought with it a number of technical hurdles which require overcoming in order that their full potential may be realized. One {{of the issues that}} require addressing is that of <b>edge</b> <b>cracking,</b> a phenomenon which is particularly difficult to predict. This is often observed during the initial drawing operation in a traditional automotive stamping plant. A useful measure of a materials susceptibility to <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> is the Hole Expansion Ratio. Currently there is a standard (ISO 16630) which provides for holes to be expanded by a conical punch, where the original hole is introduced via punching. This reflects the traditional processing route within the automotive industry. Investigations have been conducted using both conical and flat-topped punches, as well as using drilling and reaming, and CNC machining to introduce the initial hole for comparison with the standard punched route {{in order to understand the}} effect of different processes on the susceptibility to <b>edge</b> <b>cracking.</b> The hole expansion ratio for a number of aluminum alloys, both 5 xxx and 6 xxx series, has been determined.

40|$|AbstractCrack {{bifurcation}} {{is observed}} in laminar ceramics that contain large residual compressive stress. In such composites, alternating material layers have tensile and compressive residual stress, due to thermal expansion mismatch or other sources. The compressive stress ensures that crack growth leading to {{failure in the}} laminar system is mediated by threshold strength, but, in some cases, it also leads to bifurcation of the propagating flaw. The phenomenon of bifurcation takes place when the crack tip is propagating in the compressive layer, and occurs typically at a distance equal to a few laminate thicknesses below the free surface and beyond. The observation of this phenomenon is usually associated {{with the presence of}} <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> in the compressive layers of the laminar ceramic, although it can also occur in the absence of such edge cracks. In the few cases where bifurcation occurs without edge cracks, the residual stresses and layer thicknesses are close to the condition in which edge cracks will occur. In addition, in this case the bifurcation is confined to near the specimen free surface, and below the bifurcation plane, the cracks are straight. The energy release rates for the straight and bifurcated cracks are calculated from the results of finite element computations and compared. When <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> is ignored, the crack is simulated as a through-thickness crack in an infinite body, and the energy release rate is used to predict crack deviation and bifurcation. Based on this, the finite element model successfully predicts bifurcation in only one material combination that was investigated in experiments. However, the experimental bifurcation takes place in two additional material combinations. When the effect of <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> is incorporated into the finite element simulations, the energy release rate calculations successfully predict the phenomenon of bifurcation in three material combinations, as observed in the experiments. Since no edge cracks are present in the fourth material combination tested experimentally, its lack of bifurcations is automatically predicted by the model. The presence of <b>edge</b> <b>cracking,</b> or its incipience, is thus concluded to be critical to the occurrence of crack bifurcation in laminar ceramic composites...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The damage {{process of}} {{transverse}} cracks in cross-ply and quasi-isotropic toughened CFRP laminates under static loading is studied. To investigate specimen configuration effect on width-direction propagation of transverse cracks, coupon specimens with ranges of specimen width and transverse ply thickness are tested. Detailed observations of transverse cracks {{indicate that there}} are consecutive three-stage processes of edge crack initiation, edge crack increase without inward propagation, and crack propagation across the width in quasi-isotropic laminates, whereas simultaneous transverse crack propagation takes place across the width in conjunction with new edge crack formation in cross-ply laminates. The detailed process of transverse cracking is investigated using three-dimensional FEA in order to clarify the difference of damage process between quasi-isotropic and cross-ply laminates. It is shown that damage mode transition from <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> to widthwise propagation can be characterized with energy release rates near free-edges and inner regions.

In this study, an experimental and mechanical investigation on microstructures {{has been carried}} out to study the <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> formation during cold rolling of the thin strip. The effects of the feed material microstructures on the <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> evolution were studied employing optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Experimental observation indicates that fine grain occurs in hot-rolled microstructure and coarse grain is produced in ferritic rolled microstructure. Different grain sizes affect significantly the formation mechanics of the microcrack, crack initiation, and orientation of crack extension. The grain size and grain boundaries effects on crack retardation are discussed also during <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> initiation. During the crack growth in coarse grain, most <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> tips will blunt, which improves the crack toughness by causing less stress concentration.

40|$|AbstractThis {{contribution}} {{gives an}} overview of different fracture-mechanics issues occurring in layered ceramics designed with internal compressive residual stresses (such as the <b>edge</b> <b>cracking,</b> crack arrest by the compressive layer or crack deflection/bifurcation) and proposes an effective approach to describe the initiation and/or propagation of cracks in such materials. The finite fracture mechanics (FFM) theory and the coupled stress-energy criterion (CC) are discussed and applied to understand their fracture behavior. The stress-energy coupled criterion {{is based on the}} tensile strength and toughness data of investigated material and it does not contain any adjustable parameter, which is its indisputable advantage. It could thus (in the considered brittle materials) predict both crack initiation and crack propagation under consideration of both thermal and external mechanical loading. A case study is investigated, where <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> in compressive layers can be predicted {{as a function of the}} thickness of the compressive layer and the magnitude of residual stresses. Another case study concerns the onset of a crack in a notched sample of a layered ceramic submitted to bending. The propagation of the crack through the ceramic laminate is studied as a function of the volume ratio of particular material components and corresponding magnitude of residual stresses in both compressive and tensile layers. Under certain combination of residual stress and layered architecture, the CC predicts crack arrest in the internal compressive layer of the laminate in accordance with experimental observations under similar loading conditions...|$|E
40|$|During {{planetary}} {{hot rolling}} of 304 austenitic stainless steel, cracks are formed along the plate edges. In order {{to explain the}} mechanism of <b>edge</b> <b>cracking,</b> the metallographical quantitative analysis of microstructural inhomogeneity of steel plates containing edge cracks of different intensities is performed. The austenitic matrix of the steel contained small amounts of delta ferrite inhomogeneously distributed across the width and {{the thickness of the}} plate. A correlation was found between ferrite content and edge cracking: the higher the ferrite content the longer the edge cracks. Among the chemical elements present in the steel, the most critical effect on delta ferrite content was exerted by carbon and nitrogen are a powerful gamma phase stabilizers at high temperature. To understand the effects of reheating parameters on the morphology and content of delta ferrite, the specimens selected from different locations of as-cast 304 stainless steel slab, were reheated according to the temperature profiles, which simulated the industrial reheating process before hot rolling. In general, reheating reduced the delta ferrite content, increased the size of the individual ferrite island and changed its shape to a more spherical. An increase of reheating time to 92 minutes caused drastic reduction in delta ferrite content and its further spherodization. Moreover, the size of the individual ferrite islands decreased. A possible, contribution of steel chemistry and reheating parameters to changes in the steel microstructure and the possibility of <b>edge</b> <b>cracking,</b> is discussed...|$|E

The most common processes that are used to cut the steel are the thermal processes oxyfuel, laser and plasma as well as the non-thermal process abrasive water jet. Cutting HARDOX using one of the thermal processes can result in <b>edge</b> <b>cracking.</b> In addition, if a thermal process is used to cut small parts, the hardness of the steel is affected.

It was found that the main features that users wanted in this application were to be able calculate the cost of a cutting job, to be able to compare the costs of oxyfuel cutting with and without preheating and to see when abrasive water jet cutting is a viable option. It was also found that it is possible to calculate the costs involved in the different cutting processes quite accurately. However, to calculate the costs involved in preheating before cutting with oxyfuel it is recommended to develop a more complex calculation model.
