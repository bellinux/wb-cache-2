40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> <b>acid,</b> a metabolite of hexahydrophthalic anhydride, in human urine has been developed. The urine was worked-up by liquid-solid extraction, esterified with boron trifluoride-methanol, and analysed by capillary gas chromatography and selected-ion monitoring. Hexadeuterium-labelled <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> <b>acid</b> {{was used as the}} internal standard. The precision was 4 % at 0. 7 microgram/ml and 5 % at 0. 07 microgram/ml. The recovery of the acid for the overall method was 101 % at 0. 07 micrograms/ml of urine (with a coefficient of variation of 4 %) and 95 % at 0. 7 microgram/ml (coefficient of variation 2 %). The limit of detection was 20 ng/ml urine...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{producing}} electrically insulating, low stress, permanent bonds between components involves (a) adjusting {{the properties of}} an organically modified silicic acid (hetero) polycondensate by introduction of additives; (b) applying the (hetero) polycondensate {{onto one of the}} components; (c) placing the other component(s) onto the (hetero) polycondensate; and (d) curing the (hetero) polycondensate. Pref additives include N-methyl diethanolamine, <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> <b>acid</b> anhydride or isopropylthioxanthone USE - Esp. for bonding microelectronic, micromechanical and microoptical materials, devices and components, esp. active and passive semiconductors, conductors and insulators. ADVANTAGE - The method allows simple and inexpensive bonding of any combination of semiconductive, metallic or insulating surfaces with a thin bonding layer at down to 80 deg. C without the use of expensive materials (e. g. polyimide) or processes (e. g. sputtering) ...|$|E
40|$|Post-shift and next-morning urine was sampled from workers {{exposed to}} hexahydrophtalic {{anhydride}} (HHPA), an epoxy hardener, sensitising at low exposure levels. Exposure levels of HHPA in air (gas chromatography, GC) {{in the range}} of 30 - 270 micrograms/m 3 corresponded to urinary concentrations of 0. 9 - 2. 8 mumol <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> <b>acid</b> (HHP acid; GC-mass spectrometry) /mmol creatinine. In the morning samples the concentrations were less than 0. 04 - 0. 3 mumol HHP acid/mmol creatinine. In unexposed controls, the level was less than 0. 1 mumol/mmol creatinine. A correlation was found between the time-weighted levels of HHPA in air and HHP acid in the post-shift urine (rs = 0. 93; P less than 0. 023), indicating that the determination of HHP acid in urine is suitable for biologic monitoring of HHPA exposure...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> (HHP <b>acid)</b> and methylhexahydrophthalic acids (MHHP acid) from human urine was developed. These acids are metabolites {{of the highly}} sensitising hexahydrophthalic anhydride and methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride. The acids were purified from urine by liquid-solid extraction and derivatised with pentafluorobenzyl bromide to the corresponding esters. These were analysed by GC-MS in the negative-ion chemical-ionisation mode with ammonia moderating gas. Deuterium labelled HHP acid and MHHP acid were internal standards. The precision for HHP acid was 3 – 6 % in the range 70 – 620 ng mL– 1 and that for MHHP acid was 2 – 8 % in the range 60 – 680 ng mL– 1. Overall recovery of HHP acid from urine was 74 – 88 % and that for MHHP acid 98 – 101 %. Detection limits were 11 ng HHP acid mL– 1 urine and 17 ng MHHP acid mL– 1 urine. There {{were no significant differences}} between determinations of HHP acid by a previous method and the present method. Some instability of the acids in urine were found after extended storage at – 20 °C. The method was applicable for determination of HHP acid and MHHP acid from exposed workers...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} determination of <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> <b>acid</b> (HHP acid) and methylhexahydrophthalic acid (MHHP acid) in human plasma was developed. The procedure was a rapid, single step extractive derivatisation with pentafluorobenzyl bromide as the derivatisation agent. The formed pentafluorobenzyl esters were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in negative ion chemical ionisation mode with ammonia as the moderating gas. Deuterium-labeled HHP acid and MHHP acid {{were used as}} internal standards. The detection limit was 0. 4 ng/ml for HHP acid (m/z 153) and 0. 3 ng/ml for MHHP acid (m/z 365). The within-day precision of the method was between 2 and 3 % and the between-day precision was between 3 and 12 %. The overall recovery was between 65 and 83 %. A comparison between HHP acid determinations with a previous and this method showed that the methods gave similar results. The method was applicable for analysis of plasma from occupationally exposed workers...|$|E
40|$|Six healthy {{volunteers were}} exposed to gaseous hexahydrophthalic {{anhydride}} (HHPA) concentrations of 10, 40, or 80 micrograms. m- 3 (65, 260 or 520 nmol. m- 3, respectively) for 8 h. The respiratory uptake of the inhaled HHPA was almost complete. Rapid increases in plasma and urinary levels of <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> <b>acid</b> (HHP acid) were seen. During the first 4 h {{after the end of}} exposure, the half-time of HHP acid in plasma was about 2 h. A corresponding decay was seen in urine. The correlations (r > 0. 90) between the air concentrations of HHPA and the levels of HHP acid in plasma and urine were close. They were even closer (r > 0. 96) when the total respiratory uptake of HHPA was used. Urinary pH adjustment by intake of ammonium chloride or sodium hydrogen carbonate did not significantly alter the excretion of HHP acid. The results show that the analysis of HHP acid in plasma or urine is useful as a biological monitor for exposure to HHPA...|$|E
40|$|Urinary <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> <b>acid</b> (HHP acid) {{levels were}} {{determined}} in 20 workers occupationally exposed to hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA) air levels of 11 - 220 micrograms/m 3. The levels of HHP acid in urine increased rapidly during exposure and the decreases were also rapid {{after the end}} of exposure. The elimination half-time of HHP acid was 5 h, which was significantly longer than in experimentally exposed volunteers, possibly indicating distribution to more than one compartment. There was a close correlation between time-weighted average levels of HHPA in air and creatinine-adjusted levels of HHP acid in urine collected during the last 4 h of exposure (r = 0. 90), indicating that determination of urinary HHP acid levels is suitable as a method for biological monitoring of HHPA exposure. An air level of 100 micrograms/m 3 corresponded to a postshift urinary HHP acid level of ca. 900 nmol/mmol creatinine in subjects performing light work for 8 h. Percutaneous absorption of HHPA was studied by application of HHPA in petrolatum to the back skin of three volunteers. The excreted amounts of HHP acid in urine, as a fraction of the totally applied amount of HHPA, were within intervals of 1. 4 %- 4. 5 %, 0. 2 %- 1. 3 %, and 0 %- 0. 4 % respectively, indicating that the contribution from percutaneous absorption is of minor importance in a method for biological monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Hexahydrophthalic {{anhydride}} (HHPA) and methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) are two highly allergenic compounds used in {{the chemical}} industry. A method was developed for quantification of protein adducts of HHPA and MHHPA in human plasma. The plasma was dialysed and the anhydrides were hydrolysed from the proteins at mild acidic conditions. The released <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> <b>acid</b> (HHP acid) and methylhexahydrophthalic acid (MHHP acid) were purified by reversed solid phase extraction followed by derivatisation with pentafluorobenzyl bromide. The derivatives were analysed using GC-MS in negative ion chemical ionisation mode with ammonia as moderating gas. As internal standards, deuterium labelled HHP and MHHP acids were used. The detection limits were 0. 06 pmol mL(- 1) plasma for HHP acid and 0. 03 pmol mL(- 1) plasma for MHHP acid. The between-day precisions for HHP acid were 18 % at 0. 3 pmol mL(- 1) and 8 % at 4 pmol mL(- 1). For MHHP acid, the precisions were 13 % at 0. 3 pmol mL(- 1) and 9 % at 4 pmol mL(- 1). There were strong correlations (r= 0. 94 for HHPA and 0. 99 for MHHPA) between total plasma protein adduct concentrations and serum albumin adduct levels. Workers exposed to time-weighted average air levels of HHPA between < 1 and 340 microg m(- 3) and between 2 and 160 microg m(- 3) for MHHPA had plasma adduct levels between the detection limits of the methods and 8. 40 and 19. 0 pmol mL(- 1), respectively...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Organic acid {{anhydrides}} {{are potential}} sensitisers and cause occupational airway diseases. In an intervention study {{the efficacy of}} measures of hygiene at the workplace and possible selection bias were investigated. METHODS: A first investigation with 110 workers exposed to <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> <b>acid</b> anhydride (HHPA) and methyltetrahydrophthalic acid anhydride (MTHPA) {{was carried out in}} July 1991. The results (skin prick test, specific serum IgE) showed that 20 people were sensitised, and in a challenge test the clinical relevance of the sensitisation was confirmed in six subjects. In December 1991, the hygiene conditions at the plant were improved. In November 1995 a second investigation of 84 people was performed (anamnesis, skin prick test, specific IgE, spirometry, and ambient and biological monitoring). The 27 people who had left the plant in the meantime were asked their reasons for leaving. RESULTS: The relative risk of people sensitised in 1991 of leaving the plant between 1991 and 1995 was 2. 6 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 4 to 4. 9) compared with people without any sign of sensitisation. The percentage of people identified as sensitised in 1991, who were still working at the plant and came to the second investigation, was higher than for people without evidence of sensitisation (10 / 10 v 47 / 73; p < 0. 05). In all the 10 sensitised people in 1991 the findings of the first investigation were confirmed in 1995. The rate of sensitisation in 1995 was 21 %. None of the six people employed after 1991 showed evidence of sensitisation. Of the six people with clinically relevant sensitisation confirmed by a challenge test in 1991, five were still at their workplace. From 1991 they were only exposed to MTHPA at a reduced concentration (< 0. 5 - 36 micrograms/m 3 in 1995). All of them reported fewer symptoms than in 1991. No signs of bronchial obstruction were detected by spirometry at the workplace. CONCLUSIONS: In cross sectional studies there is a selection bias with a risk of underestimating the incidence of allergic diseases. The results further suggest that the improved hygiene conditions probably had a positive effect on the symptoms in sensitised people...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA) in air were developed. In a solid sorbent method, HHPA was sampled in Amberlite XAD- 2 tubes, eluted in toluene and analysed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. The sampling rates were 0. 2 and 1. 0 l/min. At 15 micrograms/m 3 (relative humidity less than 2 %) and 27 micrograms/m 3 (relative humidity 70 %) no breakthrough was observed. However, at 160 micrograms/m 3 (relative humidity less than 2 %), 6 % breakthrough was found. The sampling efficiency of the sampling rates 0. 2 and 1. 0 l/min did not differ. In a bubbler method, HHPA was sampled in bubblers filled with 0. 1 M sodium hydroxide solution. The sodium salt of <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> <b>acid</b> was formed. No breakthrough was observed using a sampling rate of 1. 0 l/min. The samples were stable during storage for eight weeks in a refrigerator. The HHP acid was esterified with methanol-boron trifluoride and analysed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. Apparatus for the generation of standard atmospheres of HHPA, {{in the range of}} 10 - 3000 micrograms/m 3, was developed using the diffusion principle. For the solid sorbent method the precision (coefficient of variation) of the overall method was 2 - 7 %, and for the bubbler method 3 - 19 % (range 15 - 160 micrograms HHPA/m 3; relative humidity = less than 2 - 70 %). A comparison between the two methods was performed using the standard atmosphere. The concentrations found by the solid sorbent method were 86 - 98 % of those found by the bubbler method (range 15 - 160 micrograms HHPA per m 3; relative humidity = less than 2 - 70 %). In work environment air, 93 % was found using the solid sorbent method relative to the bubbler method at a mean concentration of 330 micrograms/m 3 (coefficient of variation = 39 %; range 200 - 540 micrograms/m 3). For both methods, concentrations greater than 3 micrograms/m 3 could be quantified at 60 min sampling with a sampling rate of 1. 0 l/min...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{describe}} the metabolism and to develope methods for biological monitoring for two organic acid anhydrides (OAAs), namely hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA) and methylhexa-hydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA). The OAAs are reactive, low molecular weight chemicals used in vast quantities in the industry. Many OAAs, including HHPA and MHHPA, are potent IgE sensitisers inducing asthma, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis. Analytical methods for analyses of <b>hexahydrophthalic</b> <b>acid</b> (HHP acid) and methylhexahydrophthalic (MHHP acid; metabolites of HHPA and MHHPA) in plasma and urine and the hemoglobin (Hb) adducts of HHPA and MHHPA in erythrocytes were developed using pentaflourobenzyl bromide derivatisation and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The kinetics of MHHP acid and protein adducts were investigated and the Hb adducts briefly characterised by means of gel filtration, reversed-phase liquid chromatography, and GC-MS. The levels of the acids in plasma and urine and of the Hb adducts from workers were correlated to their exposure of HHPA and MHHPA. Further, the distribution of tritium-labelled HHPA was investigated in an animals study using autoradiography and gel filtration/ scintillation. The analyses of HHP and MHHP acid in urine and plasma had high precision and accuracy. The analysis of HHPA and MHHPA adducts had a good precision. All methods had a detection limit sufficiently low for application in exposed workers. The major adduct-forming protein in human erythrocytes seemed to be Hb and the major HHPA-binding amino acid was lysine. Strong correlations were found between MHHP acid levels in plasma and urine and MHHPA in air and between levels of Hb-adducts of HHPA and MHHPA and long term or short term exposure, as determined by biomonitoring using HHP or MHHP acid in urine or plasma. Thus, the methods are applicable for biological monitoring of exposure. A fast elimination of MHHP acid in urine show that MHHP acid in plasma and urine reflect one day of exposure. The Hb adducts seemed to be stable in vivo and thus reflecting the exposure during months. In the animal study, tissue-bound HHPA/metabolites mainly occurred in the upper respiratory airways, alimentary tract, whereas no bound radioactivity was observed in the lung. A low selective binding was also observed in kidney of rats. The presented methods and results {{can be used for}} exposure assessment of OAAs and for studies of mechanisms behind allegies...|$|E
