5|$|Social {{tensions}} were {{exacerbated by}} {{the revival of the}} <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> <b>Klan</b> after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> <b>Klan</b> had declined to negligible influence within the state.|$|E

50|$|The seventh {{article was}} titled “Christian Baptism Ceremony Parodied in <b>Klux</b> <b>Klan</b> Ritual” - “Initiation Made Imposing to Impress Credulous Candidates Who Join Imperial Wizard Simmons’ Hordes.” The article {{describes}} the similarities of Christian Baptism that was performed in initiation ceremonies for the Klan. Initiates were interrogated about their allegiances and asked some hypothetical questions regarding their allegiance, then doused in water similar to a Baptism. During {{this part of the}} ritual, the initiators proclaimed, “With this transparent, life-giving, powerful, God-given fluid, more precious and far more significant than all the sacred oils of the ancients, I set you apparent from the men of your daily association in the great and honorable task you have voluntarily allotted yourselves as citizens of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> Klan.” The article also gives excerpts from dedication rituals involved in the initiation process.|$|R

Ohio, which held that only speech which advocated imminent violence could be outlawed.|$|E

5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> <b>Klan,</b> which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s.

Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E

5|$|Leslie was a Confederate sympathizer {{during the}} Civil War, but began {{to adopt a}} more {{progressive}} position during his gubernatorial campaign against Harlan. Though he opposed ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, he used his influence as governor to effect passage of laws admitting the testimony of blacks in court and providing for an educational system for recently freed slaves. He also helped quell violence perpetrated by the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> <b>Klan</b> {{in many areas of}} the state.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} the full Senate {{considered}} Black's nomination. Rumors relating to Black's involvement in the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> <b>Klan</b> surfaced among the senators, and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63–16 to confirm Black. Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black. Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black's vacated seat.|$|E
5|$|Tupper's role as {{the founder}} of the first {{university}} dedicated to educating freedmen attracted opposition. During the Reconstruction era, his home was burned to the ground by the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> <b>Klan.</b> He and his wife fled and hid in a nearby cornfield. In 1870 the trustees of the local Second Baptist Church of Raleigh sued Tupper on charges of defrauding its members in relation to his fundraising for Shaw College. The suit was settled in his favor in 1875.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{thousands}} of African Americans were {{moving from the}} South to Chicago, as a major destination in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern cities, fleeing lynchings, segregation and disenfranchisement in the Deep South. The revived <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> <b>Klan</b> committed 64 lynchings in 1918 and 83 in 1919 in southern states. With industrial jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking industry opening as European immigration was cut off by World War I, from 1916 to 1919 the African-American population in Chicago increased from 44,000 to 109,000, a 148 percent increase during the decade.|$|E

5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> <b>Klan.</b> Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi Burning is a 1988 American crime thriller film {{directed}} by Alan Parker, and written by Chris Gerolmo. It is {{loosely based on}} the FBI's investigation into the 1964 Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner murder case in Mississippi. The film stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as two FBI agents assigned to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi. The investigation is met with hostility and backlash by the town's residents, local police and the <b>Ku</b> <b>Klux</b> <b>Klan</b> (KKK).|$|E
