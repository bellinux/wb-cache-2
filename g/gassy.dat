25|$|Despite an {{accident}} {{caused by a}} candle igniting gas at the Clifton Hall Colliery on 18 June 1885, in which 178 miners lost their lives, the Fletcher family, owners of Ladyshore refused to introduce safety lamps into the pits {{even though they were}} working the same mine (coal seam) which was known to be a <b>gassy</b> coal. This stubborn streak resulted in one of the largest court cases involving coal mines in England which brought {{about the end of the}} use of candles and other open lights in coal mines. The case also had implications for the use of other equipment, such as electrical lighting and tools, which may have endangered the lives of miners.|$|E
500|$|Further {{criticism}} was {{directed toward the}} emergency procedures. The lack of respirators at the mine was deemed to have cost lives. The lack of an adequate water supply for fire fighting was criticised, and Redmayne wrote: [...] "I should have thought, {{in view of the}} fact that the colliery was such a <b>gassy</b> one, and it had already been devastated by an explosion, that the management would have made arrangements for a supply of water adequate to meet an emergency of the kind that actually occurred." ...|$|E

[...] Ebert stated the film may have been {{educational}} for the test audience participants who wrote, [...] "Why does she have to die at the end?" [...] on their evaluation cards. In a review entitled Vivid Action Can't Save Miscast 'Joan, Todd McCarthy praised the film's action scenes and technical aspects, including Thierry Arbogast's cinematography, though overall gave a negative review. He criticised the casting of Jovovich, stating {{the only thing she}} brought to the film was [...] "her strikingly tall and skinny physicality, which is not exactly how one has been led to picture [...] ". Ron Wells from Film Threat, however, gave the film four out of five stars. Also praising the action scenes, Wells stated that the film's main strength was its [...] "adult ambiguities and relationships"; its decision not to portray Joan as a [...] "super-hero", but rather to let the audience decide whether she was a prophet or merely bipolar, concluding, [...] "This film, as most things that involve religion, is better understood if you learn not to take everything so literally." ...|$|E

2500|$|A former river pilot, John (Jack) Deighton, {{set up a}} small (24' x 12') saloon on {{the beach}} about a mile west of the sawmill in 1867 where mill {{property}} and its [...] "dry" [...] policies ended. His place was popular and a well-worn trail between the mill and saloon was soon established – this is today's Alexander Street. [...] Deighton's nickname, <b>Gassy</b> Jack, came about because {{he was known as}} quite the talker, or [...] "gassy". A number of men began living near the saloon and the [...] "settlement" [...] quickly became known as Gassy's Town, which was quickly shortened to [...] "Gastown". In 1870, the colonial government of British Columbia took notice of the growing settlement and sent a surveyor to lay out an official townsite named Granville, in honour of the British Colonial Secretary, Lord Granville, though it was still popularly known as Gastown (which is the name still current for that part of the city).|$|E

From that first enterprise, other stores and some hotels quickly appeared along the waterfront to the west. Gastown became formally laid out as a registered townsite dubbed Granville, B.I.

As part of the land and political deal whereby the area of the townsite was made the railhead of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), it was renamed [...] "Vancouver" [...] and incorporated shortly thereafter as a city, in 1886.

6000|$|The {{excellent}} Burble {{was a great}} {{shock to}} me. It seemed clear from his answers to the sceptic that the case for doctrinal orthodoxy and all that faded and by no means awful hereafter, which I had hitherto accepted as I accepted the sun, was an extremely poor one, and to hammer home that idea the first book I got from the Institute happened to be an American edition of the collected works of Shelley, his <b>gassy</b> prose {{as well as his}} atmospheric verse.

[...] He lent me several copies of a periodical with the clamant title of The Clarion, which was just taking up a crusade against the accepted religion. The adolescent years of any fairly intelligent youth lie open, and will always lie healthily open, to the contagion of philosophical doubts, of scorns and new ideas, and I will confess I had the fever of that phase badly.

As I looked at him I could not help thinking what a curious contrast my little dried-up self presented to his grand face and form.

6000|$|The flaring, <b>gassy</b> {{entrance}} of the café speedily set his mind at rest; he was cheered besides to recognise his favourite waiter; his orders appeared to be coherent; the dinner, when it came, was quite a sensible meal, and he ate it with enjoyment. [...] "Upon my word," [...] he reflected, [...] "I am about tempted to indulge a hope. Have I been hasty? Have I done what Robert Skill would have done?" [...] Robert Skill (I need scarcely mention) {{was the name of}} the principal character in [...] "Who Put Back the Clock?" [...] It had occurred to the author as a brilliant and probable invention; to readers of a critical turn, Robert appeared scarce upon a level with his surname; but it is the difficulty of the police romance, that the reader is always a man of such vastly greater ingenuity than the writer. In the eyes of his creator, however, Robert Skill was a word to conjure with; the thought braced and spurred him; what that brilliant creature would have done Gideon would do also. This frame of mind is not uncommon; the distressed general, the baited divine, the hesitating author, decide severally to do what Napoleon, what St. Paul, what Shakespeare would have done; and there remains only the minor question, What is that? In Gideon's case one thing was clear: Skill was a man of singular decision, he would have taken some step (whatever it was) at once; and the only step that Gideon could think of was to return to his chambers.|$|E
