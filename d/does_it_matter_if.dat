500|$|Booker {{has never}} been married, and in 2013 he was named one of Town & Country’’s [...] "Top 40 Bachelors". Although he has {{generally}} tried to keep his personal life private, Booker {{has in the past}} described himself as a [...] "straight male" [...] and has said that he is trying to date more in hopes of finding someone to settle down with. [...] In a 1990 column in the Stanford Daily, Booker admitted that as a teenager he had [...] "hated gays". [...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> I am? So be it. I hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I'm straight." ...|$|E
6000|$|BARTHWICK. [Sitting on the sofa.] Who cares {{where you}} slept; what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> he {{mentions}} the--the--a perfect disgrace? ...|$|E
6000|$|CONFUCIUS. The English {{people always}} did elect parliaments of lunatics. What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> your {{permanent}} officials are honest and competent? ...|$|E
6000|$|How paltry {{it seemed}} all at once! What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> France was ruled by that vapid King or by that brainless, overdressed woman beside him? What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> {{that young man}} with the shifty blue eyes and the fair, curly hair succeeded in ousting another man from the English throne? ...|$|R
6000|$|Once Alison {{would have}} been {{critical}} of the words She was beyond that, now. What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>if</b> the essential Thing were present? ...|$|R
60|$|What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> {{the message}} were not {{intended}} for him? It {{was an expression}} of her thoughts, and that was sufficient for Tarzan of the Apes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{worry about}} the garden," [...] I said. [...] "It is not very important. What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> the 'pussley' does cover the ground?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't that so much, {{but they}} are so {{perfectly}} unimportant. They have no use in the world. What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> they die, or don't?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> they do? I am {{the only}} person whom you have {{kept out of the}} secret. You all of you know it here." ...|$|E
60|$|Gyp {{could feel}} his wicked old smile even before she raised herself. But what <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> he <b>did</b> guess? She knew he would keep a stable secret.|$|R
6000|$|The mask {{had rolled}} {{back from the}} wall. He {{wondered}} if it had rolled back far {{enough for him to}} see it. No, he would n't look. What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had rolled out? That was n't history. He wondered-- ...|$|R
60|$|What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> he put <b>it</b> off a month, a year, ten years, even fifty? Time was nothing. He had sipped {{chocolate}} {{with a girl}} born {{a hundred}} and fifty years before his time. Escape? For a little while, perhaps.|$|R
6000|$|... "People {{ask you for}} criticism, {{but they}} only want praise. Besides, what's the good of criticism? What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> your picture is good or bad?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> he is?" [...] said Archie, boldly, {{thinking}} {{of himself and}} of the danger predicted for him. [...] "A man can only die once." ...|$|E
6000|$|SPINTHO. What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> <b>If</b> you {{die in the}} arena, you'll be a martyr; and all martyrs go to heaven, {{no matter}} what they have done. That's so, isn't it, Ferrovius? ...|$|E
6000|$|Dickinson smiled. He, too, had {{an exaggerated}} respect for Ralph. We all thought the {{proposal}} daring, {{but in no}} way amazing; the public existed to be sold things to, and what <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> the Maplewood residents, as Ralph said; and the City Improvement League protested? ...|$|R
60|$|Now at last, {{after years}} of struggle, he seemed {{suddenly}} to have dropped his mask on the floor, and broken it. His authentic self-describing passport, his complete and satisfactory idea of himself suddenly became a rag of paper, ridiculous. What on earth <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> he was nice or not, if his chin was normal or abnormal.|$|R
60|$|But what <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> {{was written}} in the book that she should become Madame Lacordaire, of course the world would know that there must have been some preparatory love-making. Let them have their laugh; a good husband would not be dearly {{purchased}} at so trifling an expense. And so they sallied forth with already half the ceremony of a wedding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they really}} are. And besides, what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> we all believe {{the same and}} try to do right; and {{sometimes}} that's hard, when you're poor, and it seems like--like--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{long as a}} man can pay twenty shillings in {{the pound}} and a trifle over, what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> all the judges in the land was to call him stupid?" [...] said Snengkeld.|$|E
6000|$|I'll {{mount the}} white cockade if they invite me! [...] What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> I do or don't? [...] In Europe all is past and over with me.... Yes--all {{is lost in}} Europe for me now! ...|$|E
6000|$|Why {{should she}} give her {{allegiance}} to this world, {{and let it}} so dominate her, that her own world of warm sun and growing, sap-filled life was turned into nothing? She {{was not going to}} <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> She {{was not going to be}} a prisoner in the dry, tyrannical man-world. She was not going to care about <b>it.</b> What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> her class <b>did</b> ever so badly in the quarterly examination. Let it--what <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|A new {{degree of}} anger came over him. What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> all <b>matter?</b> What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> the mother talked Polish and cried in labour, if this child were stiff with resistance, and crying? Why {{take it to}} heart? Let the mother cry in labour, let the child cry in resistance, since they would do so. Why should he fight against it, why resist? Let it be, if it were so. Let them be as they were, if they insisted.|$|R
6000|$|Besides, {{when his}} father and sisters, and, least of all, herself, did not find him a plague, <b>did</b> <b>it</b> much <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> other people did? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> she was fifty-nine? Think of {{what her}} {{bringing}} up has been. Think {{what it would}} be to have all the Crawleys in our house for ever, and all their debts, and all their disgrace!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take a vacation. You know I don't care {{anything}} about the business. It can't go very wrong, anyhow. What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> my income isn't invested properly, or the bond coupons cut when they're due? Drat the money!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't ask him," [...] {{snapped the}} goaded Derek. [...] "And, {{in the name}} of heaven, what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> <b>If</b> you are {{worrying}} about Major Selby's social standing, I may as well tell you that he used to know father." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, and {{sometimes}} {{she felt as if}} she would go mad. What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter,</b> what <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> their books were dirty and they did not obey? She would rather, in reality, that they disobeyed the whole rules of the school, than that they should be beaten, broken, reduced to this crying, hopeless state. She would rather bear all their insults and insolences a thousand times than reduce herself and them to this. Bitterly she repented having got beside herself, and having tackled the boy she had beaten.|$|R
6000|$|It was the point-blank {{question}} she had dreaded. She {{looked straight at}} him, and answered: [...] "No." [...] She had burnt her boats; but what <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>if</b> she got him? He would forgive her. And throwing her arms round his neck, she {{kissed him on the}} lips. She was winning! She felt it in the beating of his heart against her, in the closing of his eyes. [...] "I want to make sure! I want to make sure!" [...] she whispered. [...] "Promise!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> matter?" [...] he said, {{stamping}} his foot. [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> /not/ <b>matter?</b> <b>If</b> {{you have}} no care for your good name, do you suppose that I am indifferent to mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don’t—want {{to look at}} ’em," [...] said Brother Burge in an {{exhausted}} voice. [...] "What’s—the good of—looking at ’em? It’s like you, you know diamonds are my weakness. What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> he is asleep? What’s my knife {{got to do with}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my poor dear, you're {{thinking}} of that day he came here {{to look at my}} pictures. What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> he didn't think them any good? It was stupid of me to show them to him. I dare say they're not very good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> it has? What are my feelings? A bunch o' fal-de-rol flowers as a {{gardener}} clips off wi' never a thought is preferred before mine as I've fettled after this three-week. I can sit {{at home to}} keep my flowers company—nobody wants 'em." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{she left}} him, his thought {{was just a}} tired: 'Well, so it's begun again!' What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter,</b> since common loyalty and {{compassion}} cut him off from what his heart desired; and that desire was absurd, as little likely of attainment as the moon. What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> gave her any pleasure to love him, let it go on! Yet, {{all the time that}} he was walking across under the plane trees, Noel seemed to walk in front of him, just out of reach, so that he ached with the thought that he would never catch her up, and walk beside her.|$|R
6000|$|His work? What {{work had}} he now? It {{seemed to be}} done; for {{attending}} scientific meetings, receiving dividends, playing the country squire's only son and the wealthy host whilst awaiting the title which Mary wished for--these things are not work, and somehow his days were so arranged that he was never allowed to go beyond them. All further researches and experiments were discouraged. What <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> he were unfitted for that which {{he could no longer}} do? His work was finished. There it stood before him in that box, stamped [...] "Monk's aerophone. The Twin. No. 3412." ...|$|R
60|$|Martin {{inquired about}} yaws, for {{here was a}} man who ought to know. He {{certainly}} did know, if we could judge by his scarred arms and legs and by the live ulcers that corroded {{in the midst of the}} scars. Oh, one got used to yaws, quoth Tom Butler. They were never really serious until they had eaten deep into the flesh. Then they attacked the walls of the arteries, the arteries burst, and there was a funeral. Several of the natives had recently died that way ashore. But what <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> wasn't yaws, it was something else in the Solomons.|$|R
