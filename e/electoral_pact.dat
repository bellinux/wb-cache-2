5|$|Later in that year, the {{collaboration}} between monarch and premier, {{coupled with the}} fact that Tătărescu had successfully attracted nationalist votes from the Iron Guard, led to the signing of an electoral agreement between the latter, the National Peasants' Party (the main democratic opposition group), and the National Liberal Party-Brătianu — the pact was meant to prevent all attempt by Carol to manipulate the votes in elections. (A secondary and unexpected development was that the illegal PCR, which had decided to back the National Peasants' Party prior to the elections, eventually supported the <b>electoral</b> <b>pact.)</b> Tătărescu's own alliance policy rose the anger of his opponents inside the PNL, as he signed collaboration agreements with the fascist Romanian Front and German Party.|$|E
25|$|At the 2015 general election, the UUP {{returned}} to Westminster, gaining the South Antrim seat from the DUP and Fermanagh & South Tyrone (where {{they had an}} <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> with the DUP not standing) from Sinn Féin.|$|E
25|$|In Ulster (nine-counties), Unionists won 23 {{out of the}} 38 {{seats with}} Sinn Féin gaining ten and the Irish Parliamentary Party five. There was a limited <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> {{brokered}} by Roman Catholic Cardinal Michael Logue between Sinn Féin and the Nationalist IPP in eight seats, after nominations closed.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} researching {{the lack of}} <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> in the {{parliamentary}} elections in the Danish Democracy. The research is conducted using the analytical framework of power and democratic theory devised by Bachrach & Baratz and Dahl. It examines how the absence of <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> {{can be described as}} execution of power with undemocratic consequences. The research is based on interviews, electoral methods and debates in the Danish Parliament. The project ends up with concluding that the lack can be described as execution of power with undemocratic consequences...|$|R

25|$|The LRC {{affiliated}} to the Socialist International and in 1906 changed it's name to The Labour Party. It {{formed an}} <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> with the Liberals, intending to cause maximum {{damage to the}} Unionist government at the forthcoming election. This was successful, and in the process, 29 Labour MPs were elected to the House of Commons.|$|E
25|$|Democratic Unionist Party (DUP): the DUP {{won eight}} seats in 2010, {{making it the}} largest Northern Ireland {{political}} party, and the fourth biggest in the UK as a whole. The party also won the 2011 Northern Ireland Assembly election, but was second in the 2014 European election. It contested 16 Northern Irish constituencies, having entered into an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> with the Ulster Unionist Party in the remaining two.|$|E
25|$|During the 1937 elections, the Communists backed Iuliu Maniu and the National Peasants' Party against King Carol II and the Gheorghe Tătărescu {{government}} (who had intensified {{repression of}} Communist groups), finding themselves {{placed in an}} unusual position after the Iron Guard, a fascist movement, signed an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> with Maniu; participation in the move was explained by Communist historiography as provoked by the Social-Democrats' refusal to collaborate with the PCdR.|$|E
50|$|Singaravelu won the Valparai {{constituency}} in the 1996 elections as a DMK candidate. The constituency {{was reserved}} for candidates from the Scheduled Castes. <b>Electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> for the 2001 election saw the DMK to prefer that the Puthiya Tamizhagam party contest it rather than Singaravelu.|$|R
5000|$|... "Unity" [...] was the {{political}} label {{for a series}} of <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> by Irish nationalist, Irish Republican and socialist candidates in Northern Ireland elections in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It also contested elections as a party in its own right, electing six councillors in the 1973 local council elections in the Fermanagh and Dungannon areas, although this was reduced to two members of Fermanagh council in the next election in 1977.|$|R
50|$|The British Socialist Party {{had been}} formed in 1911 from {{the merger of}} a few socialist groups with the Social Democratic Federation. As with the SDF, the BSP was opposed to socialists having <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> with Liberals and they were {{critical}} of Labour Party branches for working with the Progressives in London. The BSP put forward dual candidates in three constituencies, all constituencies where both the Progressives and Municipal Reform parties were running dual candidates. Nowhere did they run against a Labour candidate.|$|R
25|$|In the {{elections}} of 1937, when it signed an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> with the National Peasants' Party {{with the goal of}} preventing the government from making use of electoral fraud, the Guard received 15.5% of the vote (occasionally rounded up at 16%). Despite the failure to win the majority bonus, Codreanu's movement was, at the time, the third political option in Romanian politics, the only one whose appeal was shown to be growing in 1937–1938, and by far the most popular fascist group.|$|E
25|$|Ulster Unionist Party (UUP): in 2010 the UUP {{shared an}} electoral {{alliance}} with the Conservative Party, and finished fourth in terms of votes in Northern Ireland, but won no seats. The party has one MEP, having placed third in the 2014 European elections. It was fourth in the 2011 Assembly elections. The UUP contested 15 seats; the party did not run in two seats because of its <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> with the DUP, and also did not nominate a candidate against former UUP member and incumbent independent MP Sylvia Hermon.|$|E
25|$|The country moved {{towards an}} authoritarian regime formed around Carol and {{prompted}} by {{the rapid growth of}} the fascist Iron Guard. In 1937, Maniu agreed to sign an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> with the Iron Guard's Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, in the hope that this would block the monarch's maneuvers. The king instead sought an agreement {{with other members of the}} political class, including the National Liberal Ion Duca and the former PNȚ politician Armand Călinescu, while clamping down on the Iron Guard—leading to a wave of similar actions in reprisal.|$|E
5000|$|Respect {{initially}} {{tried to}} form <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> with the Green Party of England and Wales but these proved unsuccessful. The Greens {{stated that they}} had selected their candidates months previously by postal ballot for the 2004 European Parliamentary elections and were sceptical of the SWP's influence on Respect.Monbiot left in February 2004 because the party now intended to stand candidates against the Greens, stating that to do so might threaten the positions of [...] "two of the best elected representatives in Britain", Caroline Lucas and Jean Lambert.|$|R
50|$|The British Socialist Party, and its forerunner the Social Democratic Federation {{were opposed}} to Socialists making <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> with Liberals. At the 1913 County Council {{elections}} they responded to Labour allowing the Progressives a free run in Bow & Bromley by fielding two of their own candidates instead. Though they polled well, the result of their intervention was to hand the seats to the Municipal Reform Party. The BSP adopted the same strategy for this by-election and chose Jack Jones to stand as their candidate. In the 1906 general election, Jones unsuccessfully stood for Camborne. In 1911, he became a trade union organiser, for the National Union of General Workers.|$|R
50|$|To do so, {{they took}} {{advantage}} of the opinion of the Electoral Court of June 6, 1972, which allowed the creation of electoral coalitions (or federated or confederate parties according to the legislation) in the elections of the National Congress of March of 1973. This sentence repealed that of 1962 which prohibited general <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> (only {{in the case of the}} election of senators since 1960 were allowed pacts, but these were also prohibited with another reform in 1962). In this way, the coalition was officially constituted on 6 July 1972, and its first board was composed of Eric Campaña Barrios (president), Diego Portales Frías (secretary) and Enrique Rodríguez Ballesteros (treasurer).|$|R
25|$|In Northern Ireland, the Conservatives {{suspended}} the parliament in 1973 {{in the wake}} of the growing Troubles, and made unsuccessful attempts to re-establish it in the same year, and in 1982. They supported the Belfast Agreement negotiated by the Blair government in 1998, and in 2009, negotiated an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> with the declining Ulster Unionist Party, whom it had previously been allied to before 1973 and informally during the John Major's tenure as Prime Minister. The pact was abandoned for the 2015 general election, where the Northern Ireland Conservatives ran their own candidates.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1944, Beveridge, who had {{recently}} joined the Liberal Party, {{was elected to the}} House of Commons in a by-election to succeed George Charles Grey, who had died on the battlefield in Normandy, France, {{on the first day of}} Operation Bluecoat on 30 July 1944. Beveridge briefly served as Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed, during which time he was prominent in the Radical Action group, which called for the party to withdraw from the war-time <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> and adopt more radical policies. However, he lost his seat at the 1945 general election, when he was defeated by the Conservative candidate, Robert Thorp, by a majority of 1,962 votes.|$|E
25|$|After Kilroy-Silk's defection, UKIP's {{membership}} {{declined by}} a third and donations dropped by over a half. UKIP continued to be widely seen as a single-issue party and in the 2005 general election—when it fielded 496 candidates—it secured only 2.2% of the vote, and 40 candidates had their deposits returned. Electoral support for the BNP grew during this period, with academics and political commentators suggesting that the parties were largely competing for the same voter base, a section of about 20% of the UK population. Given that the BNP had outperformed UKIP {{in most of the}} seats that they both contested, many UKIP members, including several figures on the NEC, favoured an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> with them, a proposal that Farage strongly condemned.|$|E
5000|$|But in {{fact the}} Radicals failed either to take over an {{existing}} party, or to create a new, third force. There were three main reasons. The first was the continuing strength of Whig electoral power in the half-century following the 1832 Act. The latter had expressly been designed to preserve Whig landlord influence in the counties and the remaining small borough - one reason a radical like Henry Hetherington condemned the bill as [...] "an invitation to the shopocrats of the enfranchised towns to join the Whiggocrats of the country". [...] Whigs were also able to profit in two-member constituencies from <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> made with a more reforming candidate.|$|R
5000|$|The National Electoral Jury {{admitted}} {{the failure of}} an <b>Electoral</b> Ethical <b>Pact</b> between the parties, given the widespread personal attacks between the candidates.

25|$|Rajagopalachari's {{efforts to}} build an anti-Congress front led to a patch up with his former adversary C. N. Annadurai of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Annadurai grew close to Rajagopalachari and sought an {{alliance}} with the Swatantra Party for the 1962 Madras legislative assembly elections. Although there were occasional <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> between the Swatantra Party and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rajagopalachari remained non-committal on a formal tie-up with the DMK due to its existing alliance with Communists whom he dreaded. The Swatantra Party contested 94 seats in the Madras state assembly elections and won six as well as won 18 parliamentary seats in the 1962 Lok Sabha elections.|$|R
25|$|There were 18 seats contested in Northern Ireland. Both Irish {{nationalist}} parties, Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), {{held their}} seats. The unionist Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) (the latter in an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> with the Conservatives), lost one seat each. This left the nationalist parties unchanged with eight seats, the main unionist parties with eight seats (all DUP), the Alliance with one seat {{and an independent}} unionist with one seat. It {{is the first time}} since the partition of Ireland that unionist parties failed to secure a majority of Northern Ireland's Westminster seats in a general election, and also the first time Sinn Féin obtained the largest share of the vote in Northern Ireland at a general election.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1985, Sinn Féin had won its first representation on local councils, owing to three by-election wins in Omagh (Seamus Kerr, May 1983) and Belfast (Alex Maskey in June 1983 and Sean McKnight in March 1984). Three sitting councillors also defected to Sinn Féin in Dungannon, Fermanagh and Derry (the last defecting from the SDLP). Sinn Féin succeeded in winning 59 seats in the 1985 local government elections, after it had predicted winning only 40 seats. However, the results continued to show a decline from the peak of 1983, as the party won 75,686 votes (11.8%). The party failed to gain any seats in the 1986 by-elections caused by the resignation of unionist MPs in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement. While this was partly due to an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> between unionist candidates, the SF vote fell in the four constituencies they contested.|$|E
25|$|The {{close of}} the twentieth century {{produced}} more favourable conditions for the extreme-right in Britain as a result of increased public concerns about immigration and established Muslim communities coupled with growing dissatisfaction with the established mainstream parties. In turn, the BNP gained rapidly growing levels of support over the coming years. In July 2000, it came second in the council elections for the North End of the London Borough of Bexley, its best result since 1993. At the 2001 general election it gained 16% of the vote in one constituency and over 10% in two others. In the 2002 local elections the BNP gained four councillors, three of whom were in Burnley, where it had capitalised on white anger surrounding the disproportionately high levels of funding being directed to the Asian-dominated Daneshouse ward. This breakthrough generated public anxieties about the party, with a poll finding that six in ten supported a ban on it. In the 2003 local elections the BNP gained 13 additional councillors, including seven more in Burnley, having attained over 100,000 votes. Concerned that much of their potential vote was going to the UK Independence Party (UKIP), in 2003 the BNP offered UKIP an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> but was rebuffed. Griffin then accused UKIP of being a Labour Party scheme to steal the BNP's votes. They invested much in the campaign for the 2004 European Parliament election, at which they gained 800,000 votes but failed to secure a parliamentary seat. In the 2004 local elections, they secured four more seats, including three in Epping.|$|E
50|$|With three Parties in {{the field}} in the 1890s, {{informal}} <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> were adopted to cope with first past the post voting. In the period where Labor supported Reid’s Free Trade Government, the two Parties avoided contesting seats held by the other. The demise of the Progressives after 1904 reduced politics to a two-party system, though many former Progressive MLAs remained in the Assembly as independent liberals. Other organisations such as the Temperance Alliance and the Farmers’ and Settlers’ Association chose to issue lists of preferred candidates in this period. The problem of competing conservative candidates dividing the non-Labor vote was dealt with by several experiments with the electoral system between 1910 and 1930.|$|R
2500|$|In Parliament, Wilson {{impressed}} as {{an effective}} speaker. [...] However, he followed a different political path to many of his mining colleagues. [...] The Liberal–Labour movement had consisted of local <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> between trades unions and the Liberal Party, whereby trade union-sponsored MPs (who received no salary) were politically allied to the Liberal Party, but the movement declined after 1885. The formation in 1893 of the socialist Independent Labour Party was followed in 1900 by the Labour Representation Committee, which in 1906 {{changed its name to}} the Labour Party. The Labour movement no longer depended on the Liberal Party, and the alliance was formerley broken when the MPs sponsored by the Miners' Federation of Great Britain joined the Labour Party before the January 1910 general election.|$|R
5000|$|Thanks to a {{combination}} of patronage and bribes paid by the HM Treasury, many small pocket boroughs returned Pitt-supporting MPs as widely expected. Additionally, in the constituencies decided by large electorates there was massive support for candidates who backed Pitt. Many of Fox's supporters were forced either to withdraw or to make deals with their opponents to avoid electoral defeat. In the county constituencies only one Fox supporter was elected in a contest, although others returned due to local <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts.</b> Those Members who had remained in opposition, refusing to go over to support Pitt, who failed to return to the House of Commons as a consequence, became known as [...] "Fox's Martyrs" [...] in reference to John Foxe's Book of Martyrs (although the majority were supporters of North).|$|R
500|$|In 1937, {{despite his}} ongoing feud with Carol, Averescu was {{appointed}} {{a member of}} the Crown Council. Argetoianu recalled that he and the Marshal had reconciled [...] at a time when Argetoianu pondered rallying all opposition forces, including the National Peasants' Party, the National Liberal Party-Brătianu, and the Iron Guard, in a single electoral bloc (before the general election of December, the various groups successfully negotiated an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> against the government of Gheorghe Tătărescu). Averescu, who, according to Argetoianu, declared was more interested in convincing Carol to allow his estranged wife Elena of Greece to return to Romania, remained opposed to the deal.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] general {{election}} of January 1906 Lansbury stood {{as an independent}} socialist candidate in Middlesbrough, on a strong [...] "votes for women" [...] platform. This was his first campaign based on women's rights since the LCC election of 1889. He had been recommended to the constituency by Joseph Fels, who agreed to meet his expenses. The local ILP leadership was committed by an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> to support the [...] Liberal candidate, and could not endorse Lansbury, who secured less than 9 per cent of the vote. The campaign had been managed by Marion Coates Hansen, a prominent local suffragist. Under Hansen's influence Lansbury took up the cause of [...] "votes for women"; he allied himself with the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the more militant of the main suffragist organisations, and became a close associate of Emmeline Pankhurst and her family.|$|E
500|$|... 40 {{seats were}} contested in Wales, where the Conservative share rose from three seats to eight, taking {{one from the}} Liberal Democrats and four from Labour. Welsh {{nationalist}} party Plaid Cymru gained one extra seat, Arfon, from Labour. Overall, Labour lost four seats but remained the biggest party in Wales with 26 seats. 18 seats were contested in Northern Ireland, where both Irish nationalist parties, Sinn Féin and the SDLP, held their seats, the unionist UUP (in an <b>electoral</b> <b>pact</b> with the Conservatives) lost their only seat and the DUP lost a seat. This left the nationalist parties with eight seats, the unionist parties with eight seats (all DUP), the Alliance Party with one seat and an independent unionist with one seat. It {{was the first time}} since the Partition of Ireland that unionist parties had failed to secure a majority of Northern Ireland's Westminster seats in a general election.|$|E
5000|$|Under Fiji's {{so-called}} alternative ballot system, {{votes cast}} for low-polling candidates may {{be transferred to}} higher-polling candidates, as specified by the candidates. These transferred votes are known as [...] "preferences." [...] Rae said on 20 August that in pursuing negotiations with other parties for exchanges of preferences, the NFP would aim to hold the centre ground in Fijian politics and would forge alliances with parties that shared its philosophy. NFP Treasurer Ashok Bal Govind said on 21 October that neither the FLP nor the SDL had [...] "good policies," [...] and that the NFP would wait to see whether parties with [...] "better policies" [...] emerged before deciding on any <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts.</b> In the end, the NFP made arrangements with FLP candidates in some constituencies, and with SDL candidates in others.|$|R
5000|$|Since its implementation, {{the voting}} system has proved controversial, with some {{politicians}} claiming {{that it allows}} political parties to [...] "fix" [...] election results by making <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> for the transfer of votes. Some have alleged, for example, that many indigenous Fijians cast votes for the Christian Democratic Alliance (VLV) or the Party of National Unity (PANU) in the 1999 election, unaware that those parties had signed agreements with the Indo-Fijian-dominated Fiji Labour Party to transfer votes from low-polling VLV and PANU candidates to the FLP, thereby allowing the FLP to win more seats. Conversely, many Indo-Fijian supporters of the National Federation Party (NFP) in the 2001 poll {{may not have been}} aware that votes for NFP candidates, all of whom lost, were to be transferred to the indigenous-dominated Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL). Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase of the SDL has admitted that his party won a number of seats on NFP [...] "preferences," [...] as transferred votes are known.|$|R

He continued to be active in what became the Nationalist Party and advocated greater cooperation with the new Country Party; his strident support for <b>electoral</b> <b>pacts</b> led to his resignation as president of the Western Australian Nationalist Party in 1926. He was re-elected mayor of East Fremantle in 1931 but died suddenly in 1933; his body was found in the Swan River, but the coroner ruled no suspicious circumstances. Allen is buried at Fremantle Cemetery.|$|R
