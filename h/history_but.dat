5|$|According to Cassius Dio, {{the conspirators}} {{approached}} Nerva {{as a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, which indicates {{that he was at}} least aware of the plot. Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva, but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian, it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder. On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by <b>history,</b> <b>but</b> modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.|$|E
5|$|After Cochrane, no manager won {{a trophy}} until Bob Stokoe {{led the team}} to their second FA Cup with a 1–0 win over Leeds United in the 1973 FA Cup Final.

Len Ashurst led Sunderland to their first League Cup final, which they lost 1–0 to Norwich City, but relegation brought him the sack at the end of the season. Under Lawrie McMenemy, Sunderland were relegated to the Third Division for the only time in their history. Following this, Denis Smith was named as manager, and saw the club back into the Second Division.|$|E
40|$|Dividing oral {{histories}} into topically coherent segments {{can make them}} more accessible online. People regularly make judgments about where coherent segments can be extracted from oral <b>histories.</b> <b>But</b> making these judgments can be taxing, so automated assistance is potentially attractive to speed the task of extracting segments from open-ended interviews. When different people are asked to extract coherent segments from the same {{oral histories}}, they often do not agree about precisely where such segments begin and end. This low agreement makes the evaluation of algorithmic segmenters challenging, but {{there is reason to}} believe that for segmenting oral history transcripts, some approaches are more promising than others. The BayesSeg algorithm performs slightly better than TextTiling, while TextTiling does not perform significantly better than a uniform segmentation. BayesSeg might be used to suggest boundaries to someone segmenting oral <b>histories,</b> <b>but</b> this segmentation task needs to be better defined. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Selvo's rule, he took over responsibility for the third construction of St. Mark's Basilica. This final and most famous version of the church, whose construction was begun by Domenico Contarini and finished by Vitale Faliero in 1094, remains an important symbol of the long periods of medieval Venetian wealth and power. The church is also {{a monument to the}} great Byzantine influence on Venetian art and culture throughout its <b>history,</b> <b>but</b> particularly in the 11th century. Though Selvo did not oversee {{the beginning}} or completion of St Mark's Basilica, his rule covered a longer period of its construction than the other two Doges who oversaw the project.|$|E

Until that time, players had been forced to accept whatever NHL management paid in salaries. It was the start of the player's agent era in professional hockey.

5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, {{to the dismay}} of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American <b>history,</b> <b>but</b> it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.|$|E

He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century onwards Alfred's {{reputation}} became dominant and Æthelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness.

Charles Dickens had only one paragraph on Æthelstan in his Child's History of England, and although Anglo-Saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth-century artists, and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1904, there was not one picture of Æthelstan.|$|E
