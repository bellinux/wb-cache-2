25|$|Poundland offer a {{range of}} {{approximately}} 3500 products, of which 1000 are branded products with the majority being food and drink. Stock typically is categorised as either ongoing core lines (products bought direct from the manufacturer), seasonal ranges or clearance stock, with 10,000 new products featured each year. Initially, unbranded products stocked by Poundland (accounting for roughly 70% of total stock) would carry the Poundland branding and logo; the retailer determined that they could increase sales by removing the Poundland branding and creating around 50 sub-brands, such as Beauty Nation, Kitchen Corner and Toolbox for its value line of DIY products. Some of the products sold under the in-house brand are supplied by manufacturers who are worried about their brand being sold in <b>discount</b> <b>stores</b> and would rather allow their products to sell without their own branding attached.|$|E

25|$|Barrow {{has been}} {{described}} as the Lake District's premier shopping town, with 'big name shops mingling with small local ones'. The town centre is home to a large indoor market and Portland Walk Shopping Centre. Barrow has many retail and leisure parks for a town of its size, including Cornmill Crossing, Cornerhouse Retail Park, Hollywood Park, Hindpool Retail Park and Walney Road Retail Park. Between them they host a number of supermarkets, electrical, home furnishing, clothing and <b>discount</b> <b>stores,</b> gyms, restaurants and Cumbria's largest cinema. Other modern visitor attractions in Barrow include the growing leisure destination at James Freel Close (consisting of an indoor kart racing complex, bowling alley, indoor skate park, trampoline centre and gym), as well as 'Lazer Zone' in Hindpool Road's former Custom House and a similar lazer quest, 'escape room' and play centre in the former Hitchens Building on Buccleuch Street.|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the graph}} to the right, the {{retailer}} has seen rapid growth since the end of 2008, doubling the number of their stores from 61 in November 2008 to 123 in December 2009. Company owner Lalani said that finding sites was getting easier because of the new empty rate tax on commercial property. Whereas, previously, landlords would decline to have a discount shop filling their empty stores, they are now less reluctant to fill them with <b>discount</b> <b>stores,</b> as they are now being charged for stores which lie empty. Stuart Donnelly, head of property at 99p Stores, notes that landlords are now being much more proactive, inviting potential retailers to come and have a look at their locations with the hope of them taking up a lease, as the property market has been badly affected by the recession, allowing the company to drive competitive deals to further expand their portfolio of stores with less expenditure, something that wouldn't have been possible just a few years ago. Landlords are now regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores can bring to a location.|$|E
25|$|Discount brands {{are often}} smaller, {{regional}} chains or independent stations, offering lower prices on gasoline. Most purchase wholesale commodity gasoline from independent suppliers {{or from the}} major petroleum companies. Lower-priced gas stations are also found at some supermarkets (Albertsons, Kroger, Ingles, Lowes Foods, Giant, Weis Markets, Safeway, Vons, Meijer, Loblaws/Real Canadian Superstore, and Giant Eagle), convenience stores (7-Eleven, Circle K, Cumberland Farms, Quick Chek, Road Ranger, Sheetz and Wawa), <b>discount</b> <b>stores</b> (Walmart, Canadian Tire) and warehouse clubs (Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's Wholesale Club). At some stations (such as Vons, Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club, or Sam's Club), consumers are required to hold a special membership card {{in order to be}} eligible for the discounted price, or pay only with the chain's cash card, debt card or a credit card issuer exclusive to that chain. In some areas, such as Oregon and New Jersey, this practice is illegal, and stations are required to sell to all at the same price. Some convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Circle K, have co-branded their stations with one of the premium brands. After the Gulf Oil company was sold to Chevron, northeastern retail units were sold off as a chain, with Cumberland Farms controlling the remaining Gulf Oil outlets in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{acceptance}} and attractiveness of discount retailing, no comprehensive patronage model for discount retailing has been developed. The {{primary purpose of}} this research was to develop a general model of retail patronage and to empirically test the relationships proposed in the model {{in the context of the}} discount retail market. More specifically, the study was guided by the objectives including: (1) to review existing retail patronage models and related literature, (2) to develop a general framework of retail patronage behavior based on the knowledge, and (3) to test the model in the <b>discount</b> <b>store</b> shopping patterns. ^ Based on a review of extant literature, the sequential effects of household/buyer characteristics (e. g., socioeconomic status, materialistic values, and need for uniqueness), shopping orientations (price perceptions and desire for unique consumer products), and attitude toward <b>discount</b> <b>store</b> type on <b>discount</b> <b>store</b> patronage behavior were proposed in the model. Data were collected via mail surveys and a structural equation model was used to specify the underlying relations among the variables that characterize consumers 2 ̆ 7 <b>discount</b> <b>store</b> shopping behavior. ^ Findings of the study supported the hierarchical structure of variables proposed in the <b>discount</b> <b>store</b> patronage model. The results of the structural equation model indicated that consumers 2 ̆ 7 socioeconomic class has strong effect on price perceptions (price consciousness and prestige sensitivity), which are significantly and directly related to attitudes toward <b>discount</b> <b>store</b> shopping, and consequently <b>discount</b> <b>store</b> patronage patterns. Materialistic values and uniqueness desire were found to be positively associated with prestige sensitivity and preference for unique consumer products respectively, which again have influences on store attitude and patronage behavior. The intervening roles of shopping orientation and store attitude confirmed the validity of the proposed model. ^ By investigating the sequential structure of the constructs, this study generates benefits associated with developing an integrative theory of retail patronage. Clearer associations among the determinant variables provide an explicit idea to better understand the process of <b>discount</b> <b>store</b> patronage behavior. As appreciation of patronage behavior is essential to improve retail planning strategies for holding loyal segment and attracting new customers in the market, the study produces practical implications to retail practitioners in the discount retailing industry. ...|$|R
25|$|Commodore {{sold the}} C64 {{not only through}} its network of {{authorized}} dealers, but also through department stores, <b>discount</b> <b>stores,</b> toy stores and college bookstores. The C64 had a built-in RF modulator and thus could be plugged into any television set. This allowed it (like its predecessor, the VIC-20) to compete directly against video game consoles such as the Atari 2600. Like the Apple IIe, the C64 can also output a composite video signal (avoiding the RF modulator) that can be plugged into a specialized monitor for a sharper picture. Unlike the IIe, the C64's NTSC output capability also includes separate luminance/chroma signal output equivalent to (and electrically compatible with) S-Video, for connection to the Commodore 1702 monitor, providing even better video quality than a composite signal. Aggressive pricing of the C64 is considered {{to have been a}} major catalyst in the North American video game crash of 1983. In January 1983, Commodore offered a $100 rebate in the United States on the purchase of a C64 to anyone that traded in another video game console or computer. To take advantage of this rebate, some mail-order dealers and retailers offered a Timex Sinclair 1000 for as little as $10 with purchase of a C64, so the consumer could send the TS1000 to Commodore, collect the rebate, and pocket the difference; Timex Corporation departed the computer market within a year. Commodore's tactics soon led to a price war with the major home computer manufacturers. The success of the VIC-20 and C64 contributed significantly to the exit from the field of Texas Instruments and other smaller competitors.|$|E
