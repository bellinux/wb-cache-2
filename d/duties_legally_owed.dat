5000|$|By contrast, {{the term}} [...] "tax avoidance" [...] {{describes}} lawful conduct, {{the purpose of}} which is to avoid the creation of a tax liability in the first place.

40|$|Firms are, for {{the most}} part, absent from the modern theory of optimal taxation. Their {{disappearance}} dates from the foundational models developed by Peter A. Diamond and James A. Mirrlees (1971) in which firms are simply mechanical vehicles for combining productive inputs into output in cost-minimizing proportions. i In contrast, firms {{play a central role}} in all modern tax systems, mostly for a reason eloquently stated by Richard M. Bird (1996) : “The key to effective taxation is information, and the key to information in the modern economy is the corporation. ” In most countries, firms remit the majority of tax revenues to the government, either with regard to taxes <b>legally</b> <b>owed</b> by businesses or through withholding of taxes <b>legally</b> <b>owed</b> by employees or other businesses. ii Even when businesses are not required to remit taxes, they are often required to file information reports that can facilitate monitoring of tax liabilities. The lack of a theoretical framework that features firms handcuffs rigorous welfare analysis of a number of important policy issues. One such example is the comparative evaluation of a uniform retail sales tax (RST) versus a value-added tax (VAT). In the standard model, these two taxes—both remitted entirely by businesses—are equivalent consumptio...|$|R

But in the new amendments, the responsibility of disproving a claim to bagadari rights was squarely put on the landowners. Self-Cultivation was defined as cultivation on the basis of physical participation by members of the landowner's family and resumption of land under self-cultivation were made under many stringent conditions.|$|R
50|$|The Internal Revenue Service {{estimated}} that in 2001, the tax gap was $345 billion. The tax gap {{is the difference}} between the amount of tax <b>legally</b> <b>owed</b> and the amount actually collected by the government. The tax gap in 2006 was estimated to be $450 billion. The tax gap two years later in 2008 was estimated to be in the range of $450-$500 billion and unreported income was estimated to be approximately $2 trillion. Therefore, 18-19 percent of total reportable income was not properly reported to the IRS.|$|R

50|$|Geffen was displeased {{to learn}} that Summer <b>legally</b> <b>owed</b> her {{previous}} label Casablanca another album. Polygram Records had already owned 50% of Casablanca and it had previously purchased the other 50%, owning the company outright. Polygram notified Geffen Records and Summer that she still owed them another album per her contract with Casablanca. The Michael Omartian produced She Works Hard for the Money album was given to Polygram to satisfy the agreement and Polygram released it on its Mercury Records label in 1983. Ironically, Summer's return to the Polygram fold netted what would become her biggest album of the entire 1980s. The title song garnered her a Grammy nomination.|$|R

2500|$|In December 1996, a {{legal case}} against Morrissey and Marr brought by Smiths' drummer Joyce {{arrived at the}} High Court. Joyce alleged {{that he had not}} {{received}} his fair share of recording and performance royalties from his time with the band, calling for at least £1 million in damages and 25% of all future Smiths album sales. After a seven day hearing, the judge ruled in favour of Joyce. In summing up the case, Judge Justice Weeks referred to Morrissey as [...] "devious, truculent and unreliable when his own interests were at stake", with the words [...] "devious" [...] and [...] "truculent" [...] being widely used in press coverage of the ruling. Marr paid the money <b>legally</b> <b>owed</b> to Joyce but Morrissey launched an appeal against the ruling.

Morrissey lost his appeal in July 1998, although launched another soon after; this too was unsuccessful.

50|$|During 2008, {{three of}} the largest U.S. {{investment}} banks either went bankrupt (Lehman Brothers) or were sold at fire sale prices to other banks (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch). The investment banks were {{not subject to the}} more stringent regulations applied to depository banks. These failures exacerbated the instability in the global financial system. The remaining two investment banks, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, potentially facing failure, opted to become commercial banks, thereby subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation but receiving access to credit via the Federal Reserve. Further, American International Group (AIG) had insured mortgage-backed and other securities but was not required to maintain sufficient reserves to pay its obligations when debtors defaulted on these securities. AIG was contractually required to post additional collateral with many creditors and counter-parties, touching off controversy when over $100 billion of U.S. taxpayer money was paid out to major global financial institutions on behalf of AIG. While this money was <b>legally</b> <b>owed</b> to the banks by AIG (under agreements made via credit default swaps purchased from AIG by the institutions), a number of Congressmen and media members expressed outrage that taxpayer money was used to bail out banks.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} calls for tourism rights. An {{influential}} {{example is the}} UNWTO Global Code of Ethics for Tourism (WTO, 1999) which explicitly declares 'The Right to Tourism' in its Article 7. But are such calls legitimate? And if they are, {{what are the implications}} for governments and the tourism industry? What duties correlate with this alleged right? Are these <b>duties</b> <b>legally</b> obligatory, or are they merely moral duties? And who are the duties imposed upon? Such questions interweave with the more fundamental philosophical question: is the right to tourism ethically justified? This review article critically engages with this question. It considers the presence of the right to tourism in the major international human rights treaties, before turning to enlightenment political theorists Locke, Jefferson and Mill to develop philosophical arguments for the right. In making this case for the right to tourism, we overview what we see as its five key layers, and describe what we argue is its fundamental nature: the human right to pursue tourism.

IWF’s Fair and Adequate series of reports examines how the current tax system works and what changes are needed to create a fair system that adequately funds the services needed for the common good. Wisconsin’s Tax Gap Executive Summary In 2010, recovery from the recession requires better schools, better roads, better infrastructure and aid for the unemployed. However, Wisconsin faces a multi-billion dollar revenue shortfall. Almost half of that deficit would disappear if the state was not losing over one billion dollars annually to the “tax gap, ” the difference between what is <b>legally</b> <b>owed</b> by taxpayers and what is actually paid. The majority of Wisconsin citizens are conscientious, paying responsibly to keep our state, county, municipal and education systems running. Unfortunately, a substantial number of taxpayers don’t. The tax gap is defined as the difference between {{the amount of money that}} taxpayers should pay and the amount that is actually paid voluntarily and on time.

50|$|The Patent was {{enforced}} differently amongst all of {{the various}} Habsburg lands. The nobility in Bohemia refused to enact its provisions, while the Transylvanian nobles simply refused to notify the peasants in their region about this emancipation document. The Hungarian estates claimed that their peasants were not serfs, but “tenants in fee simple, who were fully informed as to their rights and duties by precise contracts” and continued to restrict these “tenants”. In contrast, the peasants of the German-speaking provinces were actually aided by the Patent. The 1781 Serfdom Patent allowed the serfs legal rights in the Habsburg monarchy, but the document {{did not affect the}} financial dues and the physical corvée (unpaid labor) that the serfs <b>legally</b> <b>owed</b> to their landlords. Joseph II recognized the importance of these further reforms, continually attempting to destroy the economic subjugation through related laws, such as his Tax Decree of 1789. This new law would have finally realized Emperor Joseph II’s ambition to modernize Habsburg society, allowing for the end of corvée and the beginning of lesser tax obligations. Joseph’s latter reforms were withdrawn upon his death, but the personal freedom of serfs remained guaranteed through {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century due to the consequences of the 1781 Serfdom Patent.|$|R

In this scam, the victim clicks on a link presented to them, only to be informed that they just entered a binding contract and are required to pay a registration fee for a service. Even though no money is <b>legally</b> <b>owed,</b> a large number of users prefer to pay up, because of potential embarrassment due to the type of service “requested ” (e. g., pornographic goods). Using public reports of fraudulent websites as a source of data, we analyze over 2, 000 reported One Click Frauds incidents. By correlating several attributes (WHOIS data, bank accounts, phone numbers, malware installed [...] .), we discover that a few fraudsters are seemingly responsible for a majority of the scams, and evidence a number of loopholes these miscreants exploit.

50|$|A court bailiff is an {{individual}} who is appointed to act as such by the minister of justice on application of the person concerned, filed via the intermediary {{of the president of}} the court of appeal, within whose area the candidate intends to perform acts in enforcement proceedings. Before appointing, the minister of justice shall request the council of the chamber of the court bailiffs to give the opinion of the candidate. The bailiffs are not employed by the regional courts (they act at the regional courts) but they are self-employed, which means that they have their own registered offices (named Bailiff’s Office in……) and are remunerated by percentage on money recovered and the other fees specified in The Court Bailiffs and Enforcement Act of 20 August 1997. The bailiff also incurs expenses including costs of correspondence, operating costs per kilometer when visiting debtors residing out of the place of bailiff’s office; and the other expenses specified in above mentioned act. All those expenses incurred in the course of proceedings are to be covered by the debtor or by the creditor if the enforcement proceedings are ineffective. The regional courts supervise only the work of the bailiffs, especially with reference to the fastness, proficiency and accuracy of their activities; the correctness of office management and accounting. When enforcing the bailiffs are subordinate to the judicial decisions and president of the regional court. The bailiff acts on behalf of a creditor who is <b>legally</b> <b>owed</b> money. The creditor files an application for commencing enforcement proceedings and an original writ of execution with an enforcement clause inserted herein.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to study the right of the {{taxpayer}} to elicit information from the federal government in a dispute over the amount of tax that is due. The article is limited to: (1) taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s discovery, hence, it does not cover the ability of the government to elicit information about the taxpayer (by administrative summons or otherwise); (2) civil controversies, hence, it does not cover the right of the taxpayer to get information from the government when a criminal tax dispute arises; (3) federal controversies, hence, it does not cover the rights a taxpayer may have in gaining information from state taxing authorities; (4) tax controversies, hence, it does not cover the ability of the taxpayer to get information from the government regarding other types of disputes. Nontax cases are discussed to the extent that the author feels they would be applicable to federal tax controversies. It is probably disputable whether tax controversies with the government differ materially from other types of controversies with the government, however, it is the opinion of the author that they do since taxes are the source of financial life for the government. Therefore, the author believes that discovery is looked on with less favor in tax disputes. In a self assessment taxing system, it would seem that the opposite should be the case. The government derives its case from the information kept by taxpayers. It would seem only fair that the government should share that information with those from whom it is derived. The Internal Revenue Service has a duty only to collect those taxes <b>legally</b> <b>owing</b> to the government.
