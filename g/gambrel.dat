5|$|Framed by Judah Wright in 1752 for Joseph Webb, the three-and-a-half story {{house was}} {{designed}} {{with a large}} <b>gambrel</b> roof that provides extra storage space. Webb was a successful merchant who had ships trading in the West Indies and ran a local store; he married Mehitabel Nott and had six children before his death {{at the age of}} 34. The executor of the estate was Silas Deane who assisted Mrs. Webb financially and emotionally. Deane later married Mrs. Webb and built a house next door. The eldest child, Joseph Webb Jr., then 12 {{at the time of his}} father's death, inherited the house.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who built}} new homes used the vernacular {{traditions of the}} New England ports they had come from, {{building}} center-chimney frame houses such as 116 Union Street. They generally eschewed the Dutch traditions of the Hudson Valley. The <b>gambrel</b> roof on 126 Union Street is not inspired by the many ones on Dutch buildings in the area but by older New England models.|$|E
25|$|A {{driveway}} {{from the}} intersection provides parking {{between the house}} and a former barn to the south, now used as a garage. The house itself is a one-and-a-half-story, five-by-three-bay wood frame structure on a fieldstone foundation. It is sided in clapboard on all but the north (rear) elevation and topped with a <b>gambrel</b> roof shingled in wood. Brick chimneys pierce it at either end.|$|E
25|$|It is sided in {{clapboard}} to the roofline, then in shingles {{within the}} <b>gambrels,</b> {{except in the}} rear where the clapboard continues to the top. All the <b>gambrels</b> contain one window, with the west facade's Palladian-style one being the most elaborate.|$|R
50|$|The George Fontaine Three-Decker is a {{historic}} triple decker at 141 Vernon Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was built c. 1918, and is a well-preserved example of the Colonial Revival styling. Its three-level porch projects significantly from the front, and is differently styled on each level. Its first tier has multiple Tuscan columns, the second has supports enclosed in siding, and the third level has a semicircular opening under a <b>gambreled</b> roof. The main roof is also <b>gambreled,</b> with a circular window near the apex.|$|R
5000|$|The Gustov C. Lerch House was {{designed}} in {{a combination of}} the Shingle and Colonial Revival styles. The house is distinguished by its cross <b>gambrels</b> and the variety of surface textures that were employed in its construction. The foundation is composed of quarryfaced stone, the main level is composed of tan brick with segmented widow arches and corners in dark, rockfaced brick. [...] The upper level is composed of <b>gambrels</b> that are covered in narrow clapboard. There is a pentroof across each gable on the attic level. An Adamesque oval window is located {{at the top of the}} main gable. There is an identical house in Davenport's Oak Lane Historic District.|$|R
25|$|Originally {{built in}} the Georgian-influenced American Colonial style, it later {{acquired}} some Federal style decoration, particularly on the interior. The lunette windows on the second story may have been added later, after their use on a now-demolished local hotel. Despite later modifications, {{it is the only}} house from that era remaining in the town that has a <b>gambrel</b> roof. It remains a private residence.|$|E
25|$|The Wynkoop House is a well-preserved {{example of}} a stone house {{that is not only}} Dutch but has stylistic touches {{distinctive}} to Ulster County as well, most notably in the gabled roof ends (elsewhere, <b>gambrel</b> roofs were preferred). On the outside, locally quarried limestone was used as the facing, as opposed to the cut sandstone seen in houses further south in the region. Inside, the crown molding and exposed floorboards are another regional hallmark.|$|E
25|$|Its design {{reflects}} the architectural influences that prevailed {{from the middle}} of the century through American independence. Migrants from New England had begun settling in the Hudson Valley, bringing with them a preferred vernacular building form of a rectangular one-and-a-half-story house of local material with <b>gambrel</b> roof. Inside the prevalent Georgian influences were more marked: a center-hall, four-over-four floor plan and balanced facade. Many houses like the Williams house, which may originally also have included a rear porch, were built through the 1820s.|$|E
5000|$|In France and Germany, no {{distinction}} is made between <b>gambrels</b> and mansards - {{they are both}} called [...] "mansards". In the French language, mansarde can be a term for the style of roof, or for the garret living space, or attic, directly within it.|$|R
50|$|On {{the upper}} level, {{both of the}} front <b>gambrels</b> have two more nine-over-nine sash windows. A Palladian window {{is set in the}} center of the west apex. The eastern side has a former {{entrance}} for loading hay on the south, with two more nine-over-nine double-hung sash to its north. In the center of the roof is an octagonal wooden cupola with louvered vents topped by a conical metal roof.|$|R
50|$|The Mitchell House is a {{historic}} house at 1183 Main Street in Batesville, Arkansas. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with weatherboard siding, and a cross-gable roof configuration. The front facade is dominated by a <b>gambreled</b> gable projecting over the front porch, which is fashioned out of locally sourced limestone, including the facing on the supporting piers. The house was built in 1917 to a design by noted Arkansas architect Charles L. Thompson.|$|R
25|$|Nathaniel Gilman House {{was built}} in 1740. The Gilman House is a large colonial white {{clapboard}} home with a <b>gambrel</b> roof hipped at one end, a leaded fanlight over {{the front door and}} a wide panelled entry hall. This home, as well as the Benjamin Clark Gilman House which is also owned by the Academy, were built for members of Exeter's Gilman family, who donated the Nathaniel Gilman House to the academy in 1905. The home now houses the academy's Alumni and Alumnae Affairs and Development Office.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} has a skillion roof clad with later metal sheeting, supported by early steel girders (both uprights and trusses) and {{is lined with}} sheets of ripple iron. The original <b>gambrel</b> roof has been removed and the present roof follows {{the slope of the}} former upper seating tier, which has been removed. Along the ringside front of the roof are six mock dormers and a central pediment with the lettering: RNA EXHIBITION GROUNDS. Beneath this, at fascia level, is the lettering: ERNEST BAYNES STAND. Timber batten valances along the front and side of the roof are not original.|$|E
25|$|The house {{represents}} {{a mix of}} styles, waxing and waning, in a fashion popular during {{the last years of}} the 19th century. The irregular, yet compact, massing of the main forms and mixture of materials are characteristic of the Queen Anne style, then reaching its final stages. In contrast, the <b>gambrel</b> roof and Palladian window show the emergence of the Colonial Revival, a style that would become widespread in {{the first decades of the}} new century. Its overall generic style demonstrates architectural trends moving out of their original contexts and the integration of Chelsea with the larger economy.|$|E
40|$|South {{and west}} facades. Facing northeast.; This two- story Dutch Colonial Revival house has its ridge line facing {{the street with}} <b>gambrels</b> on the sides. The first level is clapboard, and the second shingle, reminisant of the earlier Shingle style. Two shed dormers front the {{overhang}} roof. There is a pedimented entry porch on the front, and door with entry porch on the west facade. The south facade has a one story enclosed porch with ribbon windows...|$|R
50|$|An {{architectural}} {{hybrid of}} Colonial Revival and the Shingle Style featuring Palladian windows, <b>gambrels,</b> peaked dormers and a balconied front porch with Ionic columns, the ARU {{house was built}} between 1894 and 1900 as the residence of George Taylor and Edith Davis Files. An 1889 Bowdoin graduate, George Files was a German professor at the college {{until his death in}} 1919 upon returning from France, where he had helped the YMCA with the war effort. In 1921, Mrs. Files endowed the George Taylor Files Professorship in Modern Languages at Bowdoin and sold their house to Sigma Nu, who in turn sold it to ARU in 1951 upon relocating to the college's present Hartley Cone Baxter House.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{decoration}} includes corbel-styled wood supports on {{the northeast}} gabled projection and a flared course of shingles separating {{the first and second}} stories below it. Another decorative course runs {{along the top of the}} other second-story windows and between the two on the south side. Between those windows and the sills of the two in the <b>gambreled</b> dormer is a decorative geometric woodwork pattern, with another decorative pattern on either side of the dormer's windows upper pane. Another pattern is located in the upper field of the front portico gable, above a large wooden oval [...] "36". Smooth square wooden columns with flared capitals support the porch roof, interrupting an iron guardrail. Below the porch floor is wooden latticework.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the more}} {{prominent}} families to live there was the Harris family. The circa 1906 home of Isaac Harris still stands at 444 Bloomingdale Road. He {{was the son of}} Silas Harris, one of two brothers who settled in Sandy Ground with their families early in its history. The Isaac Harris house was designed by architect Stanford White of the firm of McKim, Meade and White, who drew up the plans as a gift after Harris' years of service on his household staff. The house boasts a <b>gambrel</b> roof and front bay. Harris' home is one of only about 12 of the original old homes still standing in the community.|$|E
25|$|This is the {{earliest}} {{of the surviving}} ringside stands, located on the northwest side of the Main Arena. It is a substantial brick structure with a <b>gambrel</b> roof. In {{the centre of the}} roof is a large fleche with cupola and four-faced clock which can be seen from much of the showgrounds. The roof of the stand, which has been re-clad with a recent corrugated metal sheeting, is supported on early light steel trusses and round cast metal columns with cast-iron brackets and valances along the front and sides. Between the arc of the central bay is a large sign with the lettering: JOHN MACDONALD STAND. The sides and front of the stand have a decorative cast-iron balustrading.|$|E
25|$|The book, purportedly {{based on}} a true story, {{describes}} the house at 112 Ocean Avenue as remaining empty for 13 months after the DeFeo murders. In December 1975, George and Kathleen Lutz bought the house for what was considered to be a bargain price of $80,000. The five-bedroom house was built in Dutch Colonial style and had a distinctive <b>gambrel</b> roof. It also had a swimming pool and a boathouse, as it was located on a canal. George and Kathy married in July 1975 and each had their own homes, but they wanted to start fresh with a new property. Kathy had three children from a previous marriage: Daniel, 9, Christopher, 7, and Melissa (Missy), 5. They also owned a crossbreed Malamute/Labrador dog named Harry. During their first inspection of the house, the real estate broker told them about the DeFeo murders and asked if this would affect their decision. After discussing the matter, they decided {{that it was not a}} problem.|$|E
50|$|Fenestration is {{irregular}} due to {{the many}} asymmetrical elements of the house form. On the west (front) facade many of the windows are set with nine-over-one double-hung sash windows; the exception is a wide one-over-one south of the main entrance, looking out onto the porch, and one-over-ones in the gabled projection {{at the north end}} of the attic and the shed dormer window that pierces the center of that section of roof between the gabled projection and a <b>gambreled</b> dormer. An oriel window projects from the center of the second story. It has an arched window surrounded by classical detailing, a wide frieze with garlands and swag on top and brackets on the bottom. Scroll brackets support the roof on the north and south ends.|$|R
50|$|The barn is set {{close to}} (within about 20 ft) the roadway, and is {{oriented}} with its <b>gambreled</b> gable roof {{perpendicular to the}} road. It measures about 30.5 x 50.5 ft, and is set on a foundation of piled fieldstones. Its walls are clad in wooden shingles, {{and most of its}} roof is corrugated metal; one steep side has wooden shingles. It is topped by a small louvered cupola with a metal roof, weathervane, and spire. The front facade has a main opening, which has a pair of vertical-board sliding doors, large enough to admit a laden wagon. There are small square windows on either side, and a pedestrian entrance at the far right. At the second level there are two sash windows, with a single sash at the third level near the gable peak.|$|R
50|$|The Charles E. Beach House {{is located}} in a {{residential}} area on West Hartford's south side. It is located {{on the north side of}} Brightwood Lane, which is now filled with residential development on the former grounds of the house's once-larger estate. It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with busy asymmetrical massing, including projecting sections and gables. The main roof is pierced by two large dormers, one gabled and the other <b>gambreled,</b> on what is now its primary southeast-facing facade. A single-story porch extends across part of that facade and around to the west. At the western end of the attic level is a polygonal screened porch. The exterior is finished entirely in natural-finish wooden shingles, with trim painted green. A fieldstone porte-cochere is located on the northwest facade, which was the building's original front. The interior, in a marked contrast to the simple finishes of the exterior, is richly decorated.|$|R
25|$|The {{buildings}} {{on the south side}} of Castle Square are all of a similar age but show a great variety of sizes and styles. The Royal Pavilion Tavern is one of the taller buildings at four storeys in height. The slate-tiled <b>gambrel</b> roof has dormer windows and is partly hidden behind a balustrade which sits on top of a parapet and cornice. The façade is stuccoed and projects as a segmental-arched bow front. The stucco is rusticated at ground-floor level. The entrance is in the rightmost of the three bays and is flanked by granite pilasters topped by brackets with foliage decoration. Above this, an iron balcony runs across the full width of the building at first-floor level; this dates from the late 19th century and has finials in the form of interlinked dolphins and crowns, recalling the Borough of Brighton's emblem. Each storey has three windows, but they are treated in various ways; those at first-floor level have architraves, the second-storey windows have a small individual iron balcony with anthemion decoration; and those on the top floor have prominent sills.|$|E
25|$|Roofs were {{typically}} covered with wood shingles until sheet metal roofing became available. Thatch roofing {{had fallen out}} of use by this time period. The wall sheathing was usually vertically boarded but may be studded with the wall boards installed horizontally. Barns may be left unpainted or painted, most commonly an inexpensive red color. Ventilation was desired in barns so the walls were sometimes left without siding or covered with wood shingles or clapboards and then asphalt shingles. The New England barn may have been ornamented in an architectural style to match the farmhouse. Ventilators and cupolas were added to some barns in the 19th century to improve ventilation. Lightning protection systems were often strung along the roof ridge in intercept lightning strikes and prevent fire. New England barns are usually a type of bank barn, built into the side of a hill giving ground level access to one side, but a ramp or rarely a bridge were used to access the doors. The roof form is typically a gable roof but some New England barns were built with a <b>gambrel</b> roof.|$|E
500|$|Facing {{southeast}} on the Norwichtown green, the Joseph Carpenter Silversmith Shop is a [...] by [...] -story clapboarded {{building with}} a <b>gambrel</b> roof. Constructed between 1772 and 1774, the building was built on a stone foundation and has a stone stoop leading to the front entrance. The <b>gambrel</b> roof is framed without a ridge pole. It overhangs {{the front and back}} facades by , but does not project the sides. At the time of the National Historic Register of Places nomination, the roof used wooden shingles. The interior has a single brick chimney that was used for the forge. The main floor was originally open, with only a single supporting post in the center, but this was later partitioned into several rooms. Modern additions to the shop include modern doors, electric lighting and heat, and a disappearing overhead stairway that leads to the attic. The shop's cellar was not described in the survey. In 1915, the house passed out of the Carpenter family, and it was restored by Norman Isham in 1916. In 1956, the building came into the ownership of the [...] "Society of the Founders of Norwich, Connecticut, Inc.". According to the 1966 edition of Fodor's Modern Guides, the Joseph Carpenter Silversmith Shop was [...] "still furnished as it was when Mr. Carpenter plied his trade." [...] The National Historic Register of Places noted that the partitioning was [...] "recent" [...] {{at the time of its}} 1970 nomination. In 1997, a $5000 grant was used to replace the roof.|$|E
50|$|The former Franklin School {{is set on}} {{the east}} side of Stedman Road, a short road in a {{residential}} area of southern Lexington. The school stands at the front of a complex that includes five modern apartment buildings. It is a 2-1/2 story Georgian Revival structure, built out of load-bearing red brick, with a central section flanked on each side by matching 1-1/2 story wings. The roof of the main section is <b>gambreled,</b> with a center gable section that has an octagonal louvered opening at its center. Windows on both levels are groups of sash, organized 5-4-5, separated by the piers that support the gable. The projecting wing sections have groups of three windows facing to the front. The basic layout of the school's interior has been retained despite its conversion into apartments, which have been carefully fitted into classroom, office, and other spaces, retaining the brick-walled hallways. In the basement the utility areas of the building retain their original function.|$|R
500|$|The {{building}} {{currently has}} two dormers {{on opposite sides}} of the roof, but neither seems to be part of the original structure. Older photos as late as 1918 show the roof without any windows implying they were added at some later date. [...] Being the building's most prominent design feature, the <b>Gambrel</b> roof would later influence Louis Warren Ross, architect and an alumnus of the college, in his design of the Butterfield dormitory which, for a time, was the only other building on the hill. Since the Apiary and Butterfield Hall are the only two buildings on campus to exhibit this architectural motif, it seems likely that this was incorporated in the latter's design to compliment the former.|$|E
500|$|The Joseph Carpenter Silversmith Shop is a {{historic}} building that was built between 1772 and 1774 on the green in Norwichtown, now a section of Norwich, Connecticut. It is a [...] by [...] -story clapboarded building with a <b>gambrel</b> roof. The interior has a single brick chimney that {{was used for the}} forge, but it has been modified and adapted for modern use with modern doors, electric lighting and heat, and a disappearing overhead stairway that leads to the attic. Joseph Carpenter (1747–1804) was a successful of silversmith, clockmaker, and pewterer, and shared the building with his brother, a merchant. The shop was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 6, 1970, and was listed as a contributory property for the Norwichtown Historic District on January 17, 1973.|$|E
500|$|The Carpenter House, [...] {{also known}} as the Gardiner (Gardner) Carpenter House and the Red [...] House, is a Georgian style house in Norwichtown area of Norwich, Connecticut. A house was {{previously}} on the site, but it was removed by Gardner Carpenter to construct the house in 1793. The three-story Flemish bond Georgian house's front facade consists of five bays with a gabled porch over the main entrance and supported by round columns. The <b>gambrel</b> roof and third story addition were added around 1816 by Joseph Huntington. In 1958, a modern one-story rear wing was added {{to the back of the}} house. The interior of the house is a center hall plan with [...] high ceilings and has been renovated, but retains much of its original molding, paneling and wrought iron hardware. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and added to the Norwichtown Historic District in 1973.|$|E
500|$|The Georgian {{house is}} built on {{the north end of}} the Norwichtown green and faces East Town Street. The walls of the three-story house are made of brick laid in Flemish bond and painted a {{cranberry}} red. The front facade consist of five bays with a gabled porch over the main entrance and supported by round columns. The doorway is not original, but has a transom of six lights on top. The windows of the house are double hung six-over-six sash with the windows on the first floor have flat splayed lintels mimicking the gabled porch. The third story is also the attack and has an oversized <b>gambrel</b> roof that over hangs the two stories, the roof was covered with asphalt shingles at the time of its nomination in 1970. This addition of the third story was done about 1816 when the house was owned by Joseph Huntington. A modern one-story rear wing is at the back of the house, the last addition dating to 1958. Four chimneys arise from the roof of the house, with two interior chimneys and a rear chimney on the main house with a smaller fourth chimney on the one-story rear addition. The interior of the house is a typical center hall plan which retains much of its original moldings, paneling and wrought iron hardware. The 1958 addition added a [...] by [...] family room.|$|E
2500|$|The house {{overlooks the}} Hudson River across River Road and the {{railroad}} tracks today used by Metro-North's Hudson Line. It is a two-story frame home on a brick foundation topped by a <b>gambrel</b> roof. On the south side, in the brick, is a datestone reading [...] "M.W. COLLYER/1899". The west (front) facade has four bays {{on the first floor}} behind a wraparound veranda and three on the second. Projecting bays at the rear of either side have smaller <b>gambrel</b> roofs.|$|E
2500|$|The wealthy built {{extraordinarily}} large longhouses. [...] The Suquamish Oleman House (Old Man House) at {{what became}} the Port Madison Reservation was 152 x 1218 m (500 x 4060ft), c. 1850. [...] The <b>gambrel</b> roof was unique to Puget Sound Coast Salish.|$|E
