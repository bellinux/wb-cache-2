Among these events the most worrying is an electrical upset, so called Single Event Upset (SEU) evidenced in latches. We present here the circuit architecture {{of a new}} SEU hardened latch. The hardening {{is based on an}} <b>integrated</b> <b>redundancy</b> of the information and a high impedance state switching. The design prevents perturbation to propagate inside the latch and saves an uncorrupted information source for recovery mechanisms.

We take a holistic approach of integrating multisource and multipath routing for intrusion tolerance with majority voting for intrusion detection in our redundancy management protocol design. By dynamically controlling the redundancy level for both multisource multipath routing and voting-based intrusion detection with energy consideration, we identify the optimal redundancy level {{to be applied to}} maximize the WSN lifetime in response to changing environment conditions including node density, radio range, and node capture rate.

The PSOM {{can be viewed as}} the continous generalization of the discrete topology preserving map build by Kohonen’s SOM algorithm.

This allows to represent several related mappings – coexisting in a single and coherent framework.

40|$|Integration of {{multiple}} real-time control modules has gained increased acceptance {{as a new}} trend in the industry {{during the past few}} years. For example, the avionics industry is embracing a new design approach referred to as Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA). The IMA approach encourages the use of general-purpose basic components and sharing of common resources to minimize the development and maintenance costs of avionics. However, the integration complicates the design and validation of these systems since sharing resources makes the behavior of the integrated application hard to predict and guarantee and therefore ensuring the fulfillment of timing constraints and maintaining fault-tolerance becomes a challenge. In this paper, we describe our experience with <b>integrating</b> <b>redundancy</b> management and real-time services in an IMA setup. The redundancy management system (RMS) masks faults through voting on the computation results from multiple redundant computing nodes and ensures synchronization among replicas. RMS is set to share the same CPU with real-time applications managed by a real-time operating system (RTOS). We discuss the issues related to that integration and our approach for addressing them.

40|$|The {{long time}} wish of endowing {{agricultural}} vehicles with an increasing {{degree of autonomy}} is becoming a reality thanks to two crucial facts: the broad diffusion of global positioning satellite systems and the inexorable progress of computers and electronics. Agricultural vehicles are currently the only self-propelled ground machines commonly integrating commercial automatic navigation systems. Farm equipment manufacturers and satellite-based navigation system providers, in a joint effort, have pushed this technology to unprecedented heights; yet there are many unresolved issues and an unlimited potential still to uncover. The complexity inherent to intelligent vehicles {{is rooted in the}} selection and coordination of the optimum sensors, the computer reasoning techniques to process the acquired data, and the resulting control strategies for automatic actuators. The advantageous design of the network of onboard sensors is necessary for the future deployment of advanced agricultural vehicles. This article analyzes a variety of typical environments and situations encountered in agricultural fields, and proposes a sensor architecture especially adapted to cope with them. The strategy proposed groups sensors into four specific subsystems: global localization, feedback control and vehicle pose, non-visual monitoring, and local perception. The designed architecture responds to vital vehicle tasks classified within three layers devoted to safety, operative information, and automatic actuation. The success of this architecture, implemented and tested in various agricultural vehicles over the last decade, rests on its capacity to <b>integrate</b> <b>redundancy</b> and incorporate new technologies in a practical way...|$|R

This paper begins with {{a brief review of}} the literature on reliable transport protocols in UWSNs. Then, in Section 3, we define in more details the characteristics of acoustic channels and give its mathematical model. Applying BCH and/or Reed-Solomon codes, three reliable transport schemes are proposed and analyzed in two different scenarios: with and without cooperation (Sections 4 and 5) between nodes. Based on these analyses, Section 6 presents an <b>integrated</b> adaptive <b>redundancy</b> reliable transport protocol (ARRTP) and its implementation framework. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of our proposed protocol in Section 7. We also propose an initial idea about how to apply ARRTP to topology management in Section 8.

40|$|A {{framework}} for global instruction scheduling is developed that progressively improves a given instruction schedule by eliminating delay slots in the schedule {{one at a}} time through the application of global code motions. The elimination of a delay slot is carried out in two steps: a goal oriented search which identifies a global code motion or a cascade of code motions that eliminate the delay without introducing additional delay slots in critical areas of the program; and a transformation step in which the code motion is performed along with compensation code placement and application of code optimizations enabled by code motion. The framework is powerful in that it incorporates code hoisting, including speculative hoisting, code sinking, and <b>integrates</b> partial <b>redundancy</b> elimination and partial dead code elimination optimizations with the code motion transformations.

40|$|International audienceThe {{behaviour}} of Integrated Circuits (IC), in Space, {{the high}} atmosphere {{or even in}} earth environment, are adversely affected by radiation. One of the most concerning effect is stochastic, caused by heavy ions of high energy which cannot be shielded. Striking the circuits, the invasive particles induce transient current upsets, being the cause of unpredictable soft errors in combinatorial logic and memory cells. After a brief survey of the phenomenon and its consequences, we report a strategy to improve the hardening capabilities of a standard commercial technology only using a design methodology. We present a new inverter architecture for which robustness is naturally attained during upset. The hardening is carried out {{through the use of}} an <b>integrated</b> information <b>redundancy</b> and a double tri-state output.

In this paper we study which knowledge is required to guide the matching process and more particularly, how to manage uncertain knowledge. Firstly, we analyse how interactive matching is performed and we identify basic knowledge used in this process: objects with similar location, shapes and attributes are matched. Knowledge used is imperfect and manipulated data hold a certain degree of errors and vagueness. We classify the various kinds of imperfection information used and we distinguish imprecision uncertainty and incompleteness. For each class of imperfection, we choose the appropriate theory to model it. Finally, we illustrate imperfection in spatial data through the results of experiments of data matching through the comparison of toponyms in the context of ethnographical data...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{discovery}} of biologically interpretable knowledge from gene expression data {{is a crucial}} issue. Current gene data analysis is often based on global approaches such as clustering. An alternative way is to utilize local pattern mining techniques for global modeling and knowledge discovery. Nevertheless, moving from local patterns to models and knowledge is still a challenge due to the overwhelming number of local patterns and their summarization remains an open issue. This chapter {{is an attempt to}} fulfill this need: thanks to recent progress in constraint-based paradigm, it proposes three data mining methods to deal with the use of local patterns by highlighting the most promising ones or summarizing them. Ideas at the core of these processes are removing <b>redundancy,</b> <b>integrating</b> background knowledge, and recursive mining. This approach is effective and useful in large and real-world data: from the case study of the SAGE gene expression data, we demonstrate that it allows generating new biological hypotheses with clinical application...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of packet {{forwarding}} in multi-hop wireless networks of nodes equipped with multiple antennas. Through the use of MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) technology, the physical layer is able to superimpose multiple concurrent information flows, thereby increasing the communications parallelism in the network. We propose a cooperative cross-layer scheme that <b>integrates</b> distributed incremental <b>redundancy</b> hybrid automatic retransmission request (HARQ) error control with routing in order to increase the efficiency of the transmissions and decrease the interference load in the network. In the proposed scheme, next hop relays are opportunistically selected during the HARQ process in order to avoid overloaded receivers and guarantee the geographical advancement of the packets. Thus, cooperation is used to both strengthen weak links and select the path to the destination. Numerical results are presented for a specific instantiation where a layered space-time multiuser detection (LASTMUD) transmitter-receiver architecture with spread-spectrum signals is implemented at the physical layer and packets are encoded with a linear erasure code (LEC) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a surveillance system {{made up of}} a fixed camera and a binocular active vision system.

40|$|Close {{interaction}} can {{be observed}} between an exoskeleton robot and its wearer. Therefore, appropriate physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) should be considered when designing an exoskeleton robot to provide safe and comfortable motion assistance. Different features {{have been used in}} recent studies to enhance the pHRI in upper-limb exoskeleton robots. However, less attention has been given to <b>integrating</b> kinematic <b>redundancy</b> into upper-limb exoskeleton robots to improve the pHRI. In this context, this paper proposes a six-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) upper-limb exoskeleton robot (6 -REXOS) for the motion assistance of physically weak individuals. The 6 -REXOS uses a kinematically different structure to that of the human lower arm, where the exoskeleton robot is worn. The 6 -REXOS has four active DoFs to generate the motion of the human lower arm. Furthermore, two flexible bellow couplings are attached to the wrist and elbow joints to generate two passive DoFs. These couplings not only allow translational motion in wrist and elbow joints but also a redundancy in the robot. Furthermore, the compliance of the flexible coupling contributes to avoiding misalignments between human and robot joint axes. The redundancy in the 6 -REXOS is verified based on manipulability index, minimum singular value, condition number and manipulability ellipsoids. The 6 -REXOS and a four-DoF exoskeleton robot are compared to verify the manipulation advantage due to the redundancy. The four-DoF exoskeleton robot is designed by excluding the two passive DoFs of the 6 -REXOS. In addition, a kinematic model is proposed for the human lower arm to validate the performance of the 6 -REXOS. Kinematic analysis and simulations are carried out to validate the 6 -REXOS and human-lower-arm model...|$|R
40|$|Information {{redundancy}} {{affects the}} accuracy of inference strategies. A simulation study illustrates that under high-information redundancy simple heuristics that rely on only the most important information are as accurate as strategies that integrate all available information, whereas under low <b>redundancy</b> <b>integrating</b> information becomes advantageous. Assuming that people exercise adaptive strategy selection, it is predicted that their inferences will more often be captured by simple heuristics that focus on part of the available information in situations of high-information redundancy, especially when information search is costly. This prediction is confirmed in two experiments. The participants' task was to repeatedly infer which of two alternatives, described by several cues, had a higher criterion value. In the first experiment, simple heuristics predicted the inference process better under high-information redundancy than under low-information redundancy. In the second experiment, this result could be generalized to an inference situation in which participants had no prior opportunity {{to learn about the}} strategies' accuracies through outcome feedback. The results demonstrate that people are able to respond adaptively to different decision environments under various learning opportunities...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{number of}} {{clinical}} applications usedin the medical field to reinforce and support physiciansin the applicationof their medical knowledge keeps growing tremendously. But {{some of the}} problems that occur at the same time are the efficiency of those applications and the ability of the practitioners to make the right choices regarding the feedback they received from their utilization. Clinical Decision Support Systems(CDSS), also called Medical Decision Support Systems(MDSS), belong to the wide category of those clinical applications. They must be used only for secondary care purpose, and if not, the risks of malpractice due to CDSS medical based diagnoses are greater. The main concern here is the reliability of CDSS which use is supported by both hardware and software components. The reliability of CDSS can be improved by <b>integrating</b> fault-tolerance and <b>redundancy</b> in their design features so as to increase their efficiency and reduce medical errors. This helps to prevent or reduce the number of accidental cases due to malpractice and also, to mitigate potential health care risks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—With {{the fast}} {{development}} pace of deep submicron technology, {{the size and}} density of semiconductor memory grows rapidly. However, keeping {{a high level of}} yield and reliability for memory products is more and more difficult. Both the redundancy repair and ECC techniques have been widely used for enhancing the yield and reliability of memory chips. Specifically, the redundancy repair and ECC techniques are conventionally used to repair or correct the hard faults and soft errors, respectively. In this paper, we propose an <b>integrated</b> ECC and <b>redundancy</b> repair scheme for memory reliability enhancement. Our approach can identify the hard faults and soft errors during the memory normal operation mode, and repair the hard faults during the memory idle time {{as long as there are}} unused redundant elements. We also develop a method for evaluating the memory reliability. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective, e. g., the MTTF of an 32 N × 64 memory is improved by 1, 412 hours (7. 1 %) with our integrated ECC and repair scheme. ...|$|R
40|$|In November 2002, {{the tanker}} 'Prestige' {{released}} about 19, 000 tonnes {{of a heavy}} fuel oil (no. 6) before sinking with about 58, 000 tonnes of its cargo, 135 miles from Cabo Finisterra (Spain). A considerable part of the released fuel oil reached the Galician coast, causing a heavy black tide and an ecological disaster. Although the black tide did not reach the NW coast of Portugal, {{it is possible that}} some of the fuel oil or its components also arrived to this area directly through the sea water and/or indirectly through the food chain. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate possible changes in two widely used biomarkers, the activity of the enzymes cholinesterases (ChE) and glutathione S-transferases (GST), of three molluscs (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Nucella lapillus and Monodonta lineata) from wild populations of the NW Portuguese coast in relation to the 'Prestige' oil spill. Molluscs were collected seasonally before (autumn 2002) and after (winter 2002 / 2003), spring and summer 2003) the oil spill at several sites along the Portuguese NW coast. Enzymatic activities determined before the accident were compared with those determined at different times after the oil spill taking into consideration abiotic factors. Information from different parameters was <b>integrated</b> by <b>Redundancy</b> Analysis and Principal Response Curves (PRC). Results show that GST and ChE activities were influenced by abiotic factors. Despite this influence, the results of PRC analysis also suggest that some of the fuel oil reached the NW Portuguese coast changing the patterns of ChE and GST activities of local populations of rocky shore species. Furthermore, the present study highlights the need of long-term monitoring with wild populations to assess both historical and punctual effects of pollution in the marine environment.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor’s {{thesis is}} to discuss the {{problems}} related to communication in the Arctic and to present solutions that are used on board the vessels and offshore installations operating in the area today. We also investigate the future activity in the Arctic {{and what kind of}} communication solutions could be used in the near future. Traffic in the Arctic is increasing as ice is retracting, new technologies are developing and natural resources are becoming more available. The demand for connectivity is increasing and the communication services provided today are not sufficient. The oil and gas sector represent {{only a fraction of the}} vessel traffic in the area, but is at the same time regarded as the main driver for future infrastructure and opportunities. There are potential future solutions solving the communication issues in the Arctic, such as using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and High Earth Orbit satellites, but these require large initial investments. Satellite communication is the optimal solution for fisheries, cargo- and cruise ships. Satellite coverage will be sufficient for fishing- and cargo vessels sailing below the latitude 74 ° north, when the new Thor 7 satellite and the Inmarsat 5 satellites become fully operational. The basic operational needs of a cruise ship are also met, but the bandwidth demand from passenger use cannot be met now or even in the near future. Vessels operating in the arctic will have a better SAR connectivity solution with the new Iridium Next satellites, which also cover the extreme Polar Regions. For all vessels, connectivity beyond 74 ° north is uncertain and the capacity inadequate for any other use than SAR operations and low data communication. Offshore installations require high bandwidth and thus a fibre optic solution is optimal. Microwave technology could be used, meanwhile satellite communication is regarded by the industry as too slow for <b>Integrated</b> Operations. <b>Redundancy</b> is a must for oil & gas operations, therefore having different technologies available is highly recommended. Offshore vessels and shuttle tankers can use satellites while in transit and then log on to wireless networks provided by the offshore installations.

With multiple <b>integrated</b> solutions like <b>redundancies</b> and intelligent control mechanisms this technology is characterized with reliability estimated {{at the level of}} 99. 99999 percent. These features make the standard perfect for use in projects like the Free Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) and the X-ray Free Electron Laser (X-FEL) in order to help them meet the requirements of high availability and reliability. The ATCA standard incorporates advanced control systems defined in the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) specification as one of the key elements. The entire ATCA implementation retains its functionality as long as the IPMI remains operational. The complexity level of the application increases, which results in preparing it to run and debugging being more difficult to perform. At the same time, only scrupulous elimination of any kind of possible deficiencies can enable the ATCA implementation to offer the desired level of reliability. Thus, diagnostics become crucial, which creates a need for additional tools performing these tasks during the preparations of both hardware and software for the ATCA application.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{sensor network}} {{has been developed}} that allows the monitoring of hypervelocity impacts from space debris or meteoroids, the detection of low-velocity collisions with satellites, and {{the determination of the}} impact location on the satellite surface. The sensors are wideband ultrasonic piezoelectric transducers that detect the acoustic waves that are generated in the satellite structure during an encounter. The sensors are connected through cables to a sampling and data-processing unit that transmits any detected event through a transceiver via a standardized wireless interface to a processing unit of the satellite system. In order to perform localization of the event, at least three sensors are required; in the developed unit, four sensors have been <b>integrated</b> to provide <b>redundancy</b> and the possibility to increase the localization accuracy. Monitoring of encounters is performed on each critical outer surface of the satellite. The most critical is the surface pointing in the ram direction of the satellite, because statistically most of the impacts occur on this surface. In this paper, a description of the sensor network and the data recording-, processing- and wireless transmission technology is given. The location of the impact site is performed by multilateration i. e., through computing the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of the signals propagated from the impact site to three or more of the ultrasonic transducers. The results of a hypervelocity impact test using the wireless sensor network on a typical satellite structure are presented: Two major waveforms propagating in the structure with different wave velocities can be distinguished.

5000|$|The use of checklists before, {{during and}} after flights has {{established}} a strong presence in all types of aviation {{as a means of}} managing error and reducing the possibility of risk. Checklists are highly regulated and consist of protocols and procedures {{for the majority of the}} actions required during a flight. The objectives of checklists include [...] "memory recall, standardization and regulation of processes or methodologies." [...] The use of checklists in aviation has become an industry standard practice, and the completion of checklists from memory is considered a violation of protocol and pilot error. Studies have shown that increased errors in judgement and cognitive function of the brain, along with changes in memory function are a few of the effects of stress and fatigue. Both of these are inevitable human factors encountered in the commercial aviation industry. The use of checklists in emergency situations also contributes to troubleshooting and reverse examining the chain of events which may have led to the particular incident or crash. Apart from checklists issued by regulatory bodies such as the FAA or ICAO, or checklists made by aircraft manufacturers, pilots also have personal qualitative checklists aimed to ensure their fitness and ability to fly the aircraft. An example is the IM SAFE checklist (illness, medication, stress, alcohol, fatigue/food, emotion) and a number of other qualitative assessments which pilots may perform before or during a flight to ensure the safety of the aircraft and passengers. These checklists, along with a number of other <b>redundancies</b> <b>integrated</b> into most modern aircraft operation systems, ensure the pilot remains vigilant, and in turn, aims to reduce the risk of pilot error.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture as controlled by the environment on a farmed catchment in a typical dry-hot valley (DHV) by <b>integrating</b> geostatistical and <b>redundancy</b> analysis (RDA). We monitored soil moisture in topsoil (0 – 20 cm) and subsoil (20 – 40 cm) layers at 51 points on eight occasions from July 2012 to March 2014, and determined the environmental factors of soil particle-size distribution, soil organic matter, slope aspect, slope gradient, elevation, and a topographic wetness index (WI) modified for semiarid conditions at each point. The results showed that, under the influence of high evaporation, soil moisture in the topsoil was significantly lower than that of subsoil in the DHV. In this study, we observed a strong temporal variation of soil moisture, which was influenced by the seasonal variation of crop cover and lagged behind that of rainfall. Relatively high soil moisture levels were found on the watershed divide and hillside sites of the catchment, and lower on the valleyside sites. Different from other studies, RDA analysis indicated that the WI was not correlated with soil moisture in the DHV; instead, clay and sand levels were the dominant control factor of soil moisture in the farmed DHV. We proposed that soil erosion in the DHV could lead to such increases of sand and decreases of clay content, thus influencing soil moisture content. Soil and water conservation measures will be especially important for valleyside sites with steep slopes...|$|R

Organic farming {{had a positive}} effect on microbial biomass, total phospho-lipid fatty acids (PLFA), Gram (+) bacteria, Gram (-) bacteria and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) indicator PLFA 16 : 1 v 5 and amino sugars. The increase in presence of Gram (+) bacteria when compared to integrated farming was also reflected by increased content of bacterial muramic acid (MurN), i. e. an increased formation of bacterial residues. Minimum tillage significantly increased microbial biomass N and the fungal PLFA 18 : 2 v 6, 9, averaging the values of upper (0 – 8 cm) and deeper (12 – 25 cm) soil, but had no effects on PLFA 16 : 1 v 5. Minimum tillage generally resulted in a negative depth gradient of almost all microbial properties analyzed. The only important exception was fungal galactosamine (GlcN), which led to increases in the fungal C/bacterial C ratio and in the contribution of microbial residue C to SOC in the deeper soil. Significant second order tillage management interactions indicated that minimum tillage effects on microbial biomass and PLFA indices (Gram (+) and (i 15 : 0 + i 17 : 0) /(a 15 : 0 + a 17 : 0)) were much stronger in the organic farming system than in the <b>integrated</b> farming system. <b>Redundancy</b> analysis (RDA) showed SOC and H 2 O content predominantly affected the microbial community structure in the present study. Minimum tillage in combination with organic farming appears to be an effective agricultural strategy that enhances soil microbial biomass, microbial residues and bacterial and fungal abundances. The results indicate that the positive effects of minimum tillage on microbial community can be enhanced by organic farming. Microbial residues as a fraction of SOC respond faster to farming management than to tillage...|$|R
