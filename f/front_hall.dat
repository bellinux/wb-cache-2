The tomb of King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE) in Hebei province not only had a <b>front</b> <b>hall</b> with window drapes and grave goods, carriages and horses in the southern separate side chamber, and storage goods in the northern side chamber, but also the remains of real timber houses with tiled roofs erected within (along with a house made of stone slabs and two stone doors in the rear chamber). Doors made completely out of stone were found in many Han tombs as well as tombs in later dynasties.|$|E

25|$|The mosque {{was built}} in {{traditional}} Javanese architecture. It consists {{of a pair of}} buildings: the main prayer hall and a <b>front</b> <b>hall</b> commonly called serambi. The prayer hall is a building of thick plain walls, while the serambi is a porch-like semi-attached building. Surrounding the porch is a moat to enable one to dip his or her feet before reaching the serambi, symbolically purifying anything that enters the mosque.|$|E
25|$|As the {{original}} house became crowded Mrs. Hubbard concocted her own plans and layout {{for an additional}} section {{to be added to}} the house. Her plan, according to the writings of her daughter Mary, was for a two-story addition at the front elevation of the building, much as the building appears today. She envisioned a central <b>front</b> <b>hall</b> with a stairway flanked by walnut balustrades and an open parlor with folding doors opening into the living room. Mrs. Hubbard's vision for the second floor included two new children's bedrooms and a spare bedroom.|$|E

25|$|Inside this residence, {{the house}} {{originally}} {{had a very}} simple interior, with a large living room {{to the right of}} the front door, a simple dining room straight ahead, a long hallway to the left of the front door, a simple spiral staircase in the <b>front</b> <b>hall,</b> and a small kitchen and servants' quarters in the back (now a bigger kitchen). In the interior of the house, the forms of the rooms were simple but combined to make a more complex structure like Breuer and Gropius advocated. The house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.|$|E

It is the only such tomb that has been found in Hong Kong and is exhibited as part of the Hong Kong Museum of History.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} commenced {{around the}} courtyard with the East Wing (The King's Library) in 1823–1828, {{followed by the}} North Wing in 1833–1838, which originally housed among other galleries a reading room, now the Wellcome Gallery. Work was also progressing on the northern half of the West Wing (The Egyptian Sculpture Gallery) 1826–1831, with Montagu House demolished in 1842 {{to make room for}} the final part of the West Wing, completed in 1846, and the South Wing with its great colonnade, initiated in 1843 and completed in 1847, when the <b>Front</b> <b>Hall</b> and Great Staircase were opened to the public. The Museum is faced with Portland stone, but the perimeter walls and other parts of the building were built using Haytor granite from Dartmoor in South Devon, transported via the unique Haytor Granite Tramway.|$|E

25|$|The old City Hall {{was built}} in 1906–1907 after the {{construction}} plans of Komor Marcell and Jakab Dezső. The entrance area, including the corridor and the staircase leading {{to the first floor}}, is the most representative in this regard. The ribbed stellar vaults that cover this area were inspired by Gothic architecture. The vaults are supported by columns with composite caps, and the keystone is a large floral shape which includes the lighting appliance. The vaults are painted with spiraling vegetal motifs. Elements of the <b>front</b> <b>hall</b> include the stone bench with its legs shaped as those of an animal and with wing-shaped handles. Its shell-shaped, golden back has a shield flanked by two volutes on its upper side. Features of the monumental staircase leading to the first floor include the upper side of the banister resembling a slithering animal or a wave. The exterior decoration is simpler and is based on Hungarian-Székely folk motives made of polychromatic ceramics. The ground floor is marked by a solid, embossed pedestal. Windows with large openings tend to be predominant in the façade. The three semicircular windows in the middle area of the façade are those of the honor hall that has a double elevation with respect to the other rooms. The glass paintings which illustrated Gábor Bethlen, Francis II Rákóczi, Lajos Kossuth, Ferenc Deák and Franz Joseph I of Austria are missing from the halls.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Charlie Russell {{and his new}} wife, Nancy, {{were living}} in a shack in back of a house in Cascade, Montana. In 1897, the couple moved into a rented four-room home on Seventh Avenue North in Great Falls. In December 1899, Russell's father Charles Silas Russell gave the couple $500. The estate of Mary Mead Russell, Russell's mother who died in 1895, was finally probated shortly thereafter, and in the spring of 1900 the Russells began {{building}} a new home on the corner of 13th Street and 4th Avenue North. A friend and neighbor, George Calvert, was the likely architect and constructed the house for them. The two-story wood frame building had clapboard siding, gable roof, and wooden shake roofing shingles. It had little exterior ornamentation. The house faced south, with gable fronted dormers on the east and west and another project slightly from the southwest corner of the house. The front door led to a small <b>front</b> <b>hall,</b> and a parlor ran across the south face of the home. Also on the first floor were dining room, bathroom, kitchen, and a small maid's room off the kitchen. Some of the furniture on first floor (such as two seats, a china closet, a bookcase) were built into the home. A steep stairway led to three small bedrooms (under the gables) and a small bathroom on the second floor. The interior was paneled in dark wood. A small exterior porch ran around the southeast corner of the home. The architectural style was in the Arts and Crafts genre. The Russells occupied the home in the summer of 1900.|$|E

Large crowds mobbed Heston, {{where he was}} met by the Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of Clarendon, who gave him a letter from King George VI assuring him of the Empire's lasting gratitude and urging him to come straight to Buckingham Palace to report. The streets were so packed with cheering people that it took Chamberlain {{an hour and a}} half to journey the nine miles (14km) from Heston to the Palace. After reporting to the King, Chamberlain and his wife appeared on the Palace balcony with the King and Queen. He then went to Downing Street; both the street and the <b>front</b> <b>hall</b> of Number 10 were packed. As he headed upstairs to address the crowd from a first-floor window, someone called to him, [...] "Neville, go up to the window and say 'peace for our time'." [...] Chamberlain turned around and responded, [...] "No, I don't do that sort of thing." [...] Nevertheless, Chamberlain recalled the words of his predecessor, Benjamin Disraeli and his return from the Congress of Berlin in his statement to the crowd: ...|$|E

500|$|Finds {{especially}} in Pompeii show the so-called Roman goddess Venus wearing a bikini. A {{statue of the}} so-called Venus in a bikini {{was found in a}} cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere, others were found in the <b>front</b> <b>hall.</b> A statue of the so-called Venus was recovered from the tablinum of the house of Julia Felix, and another from an atrium in the garden at Via Dell'Abbondanza. Naples National Archaeological Museum, which opened its limited viewing gallery of more explicit exhibits in 2000, also exhibits a [...] "Venus in Bikini". However, the Naples National Archaeological Museum is keen to stress that this statue actually depicts her Greek counterpart Aphrodite as she is about to untie her sandal, a common theme among other works depicting Aphrodite. The museum's exhibits include female statues wearing see-through gold lamé brassiere, basque and knickers. The Kings of Naples discovered these Pompeii artifacts, including the one meter tall, almost unclothed statue of Venus painted in gold leaf with something like a modern bikini. They found them so shocking that for long periods the secret chamber was opened only to [...] "mature persons of secure morals". Even after the doors were opened, only 20 visitors were to be admitted at a time, and children under 12 were not allowed into the new part of the museum without their parents' or a teacher's permission.|$|E

2500|$|Endless Palace (未央宮; Wèiyāng Gōng) Also {{known as}} the West Palace. [...] The {{official}} center of government from Emperor Huidi onwards. [...] The palace was a walled rectangle 2250×2150m enclosing a 5km2 building complex of 40 halls. [...] There were four gates in the wall facing a cardinal direction. [...] The east gate was used only by nobility and the north one only by commoners. [...] The palace was sited along the highest portion of the ridgeline on which Changan was built. [...] In, fact the <b>Front</b> <b>Hall</b> {{at the center of}} the palace was built atop the exact highest point of the ridge. [...] The foundation terrace of this massive building is 350×200×15m.

[...] Used by seven dynasties this palace has become the most famous in Chinese history.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} entrance {{was formerly}} through the porch {{on the south}} front, but its large doors caused too many draughts. In 1862 an entrance {{was created in the}} west front, leading to the West Hall, which contains panelling from the old house. [...] The West Hall in turn leads into the Library, which has one of Latham's most elaborate ceilings. The windows contain French stained glass, designed and made in Paris by M. Lusson. [...] The Library leads to the former <b>Front</b> <b>Hall,</b> which was transformed into the Dining Room when the original dining room was demolished in 1968. [...] In the Dining Room is a portrait of a noblemen, attributed to Cornelis Jonson. [...] The Gallery was the family's principal sitting-room during the 19th century. The overmantel of the fireplace contains sculptures depicting St George slaying the dragon and, on each side, personifications of Hope and Patience, with appropriate inscriptions. [...] The Drawing Room is in a different style from the other rooms on the ground floor, being plastered rather than panelled, and it contains much gilding. [...] The room is devoted to the memory of Rowland Egerton-Warburton and contains a number of family portraits. [...] Its coved ceiling, also designed by Latham, has a frieze depicting birds eating grapes. [...] The final room on the ground floor open to the public is the Small Dining Room. [...] It has a barrel-shaped ceiling, again designed by Latham. [...] In the room is a virginal dated 1675 by Stephen Keene, {{and is one of the}} oldest surviving English keyboard instruments. Its front is decorated with portraits of Charles II and Queen Catherine. [...] The Grand Staircase is considered to be Latham's finest work in the house. The staircase itself and the doorways are made of oak, and the decoration is in plasterwork and strapwork. Above the staircase is a glass-walled domed ceiling.|$|E
