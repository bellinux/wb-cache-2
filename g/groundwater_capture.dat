An analysis of the groundwater flow regime resulting from the installation of a PRB can lead to an effective design that significantly reduces the escape of untreated water through associated slurry walls and/ or around the ends of the PRB system. A three-dimensional groundwater flow model using Modflow was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of <b>groundwater</b> <b>capture</b> and treatment resulting from the installation of a funnel-and-gate PRB.

The length of the gates were also optimized to provide sufficient resident time of groundwater in the PRB to accomplish treatment. The model results were also used to locate optimum sites for downgradient monitor wells to assess performance of the system. Key words: barrier, reactive, modeling, PR...|$|E

The area of interest is shown on Figure 1. We assess the hydrologic system and characterize the extent of <b>groundwater</b> <b>captured</b> by the Town wells. This technical memorandum describes our analysis, which is based on a water accounting model that integrates MODFLOW- 2000 (Harbaugh and others, 2000) and Geographic Information System (ArcGIS, 2009) techniques with data and results from previous studies. The objectives of the assessment are to (1) characterize the region of <b>groundwater</b> <b>captured</b> by the Town wells, (2) assess hydrologic effects in terms of water levels and flow rates from managed groundwater recharge operations, and (3) propose preliminary sites and estimated costs for development of a groundwater recharge program. Technical Approach In coordination with the Town, BGW developed a model of the aquifer system in the region of the Mangas Trench (Trauger, 1972, p. 22) that accounts for the water in the area influenced by Town wellfields and for regional water use of others. The boundary of the model is the area of interest shown on Figure 1. The New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (OSE) has developed two earlier versions of groundwater flow models in generally the same area; Hathaway (1986) and Johnson (2000) each developed two-dimensional models to assess hydrologic effects from proposed transfers of groundwater rights. The new model builds on the previous work. We developed a three-dimensional model to account for both shallow and deep recharge operations within the aquifer system. The model provides a mathematical simulation method for examining the change in aquifer conditions resulting from historical groundwater development and for calculating the projected effects of proposed future water-management actions in the basin. The model is based on the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) MODFLOW 2000 program (Harbaugh and others, 2000). Wellfield capture areas are estimated with an advective particle tracking approach (Pollock, 1994).

40|$|Drinking {{water in}} Kinshasa, {{the capital of}} the Democratic Republic of Congo, is {{provided}} by extracting groundwater from the local aquifer, particularly in peripheral areas. The exploited groundwater body is mainly unconfined and located within a continuous detrital aquifer, primarily composed of sedimentary formations. However, the aquifer is subjected to an increasing threat of anthropogenic pollution pressure. Understanding the detailed origin of this pollution pressure is important for sustainable drinking water management in Kinshasa. The present study aims to explain the observed nitrate pollution problem, nitrate being considered as a good tracer for other pollution threats. The analysis is made in terms of physical attributes that are readily available using a statistical modelling approach. For the nitrate data, use was made of a historical groundwater quality assessment study, for which the data were re-analysed. The physical attributes are related to the topography, land use, geology and hydrogeology of the region. Prior to the statistical modelling, intrinsic and specific vulnerability for nitrate pollution was assessed. This vulnerability assessment showed that the alluvium area {{in the northern part of}} the region is the most vulnerable area. This area consists of urban land use with poor sanitation. Re-analysis of the nitrate pollution data demonstrated that the spatial variability of nitrate concentrations in the groundwater body is high, and coherent with the fragmented land use of the region and the intrinsic and specific vulnerability maps. For the statistical modeling use was made of multiple regression and regression tree analysis. The results demonstrated the significant impact of land use variables on the Kinshasa groundwater nitrate pollution and the need for a detailed delineation of <b>groundwater</b> <b>capture</b> zones around the monitoring stations...|$|E

40|$|Groundwater at Camp Ripley, Minnesota, is {{recharged}} both on {{post and}} off site and discharged to rivers, wetlands, and pumping wells. The subsurface geologic materials {{have a wide}} range of permeabilities and are arranged in a complex fashion {{as a result of the}} region's multiple glacial advances. Correlation of individual glacial geologic units is difficult, even between nearby boreholes, because of the heterogeneities in the subsurface. This report documents the creation of a numerical model of groundwater flow for Camp Ripley and hydrologically related areas to the west and southwest. The model relies on a hydrogeological conceptual model built on the findings of a University of Minnesota-Duluth drilling and sampling program conducted in 2001. Because of the site's stratigraphic complexity, a geostatistical approach was taken to handle the uncertainty of the subsurface correlation. The U. S. Geological Survey's MODFLOW code was used to create the steady-state model, which includes input data from a variety of sources and is calibrated to water levels in monitoring wells across much of the site. This model was used for several applications. Wellhead protection zones were delineated for on-site production wells H, L, and N. The zones were determined on the basis of a probabilistic assessment of the <b>groundwater</b> <b>captured</b> by these wells; the assessment, in turn, had been based on multiple realizations of the study area's stratigraphy and groundwater flowfield.

40|$|Gaining streams {{can provide}} an {{integrated}} signal of relatively large <b>groundwater</b> <b>capture</b> areas. In contrast to the point-specific nature of monitoring wells, gaining streams coalesce multiple flow paths. Impacts on groundwater quality from unconventional gas development may be evaluated at the watershed scale by the sampling of dissolved methane (CH 4) along such streams. This paper describes a method for using stream CH 4 concentrations, along with measurements of groundwater inflow and gas transfer velocity interpreted by 1 -D stream transport modeling, to determine groundwater methane fluxes. While dissolved ionic tracers remain in the stream for long distances, the persistence of methane is not well documented. To test this method and evaluate CH 4 persistence in a stream, a combined bromide (Br) and CH 4 tracer injection was conducted on Nine-Mile Creek, a gaining stream in a gas development area in central Utah. A 35 % gain in streamflow was determined from dilution of the Br tracer. The injected CH 4 resulted in a fivefold increase in stream CH 4 immediately below the injection site. CH 4 and δ 13 CCH 4 sampling showed it was not immediately lost to the atmosphere, but remained in the stream for more than 2000 m. A 1 -D stream transport model simulating the decline in CH 4 yielded an apparent gas transfer velocity of 4. 5 m/d, describing the rate of loss to the atmosphere (possibly including some microbial consumption). The transport model was then calibrated to background stream CH 4 in Nine-Mile Creek (prior to CH 4 injection) in order to evaluate groundwater CH 4 contributions. The total estimated CH 4 load discharging to the stream along the study reach was 190 g/d, although using geochemical fingerprinting to determine its source was {{beyond the scope of}} the current study. This demonstrates the utility of stream-gas sampling as a reconnaissance tool for evaluating both natural and anthropogenic CH 4 leakage from gas reservoirs into groundwater and surface water...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{activities}} are frequently associated with water contamination. The spreading and storage of fertilizers, for instance, {{may result in}} groundwater contamination due to pollutants leaching into an aquifer. Nitrates and fecal bacteria are two important contaminants associated with agriculture. Thus, the development of efficient strategies for groundwater protection in agricultural areas requires an assessment of these two contaminants. Given this perspective, groundwater quality monitoring was carried out over the whole capture zone of a municipal well located in an agricultural area in the St. -Lawrence Lowlands in Québec. Thirty-eight piezometers were installed within the roughly 2 km 2 capture area of the well to measure physico-chemical parameters such as major ions, field measured parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, water level, temperature), and isotopic ratios, bacteriological parameters (Heterotrophic Plate Count [...] HPC, enterococci, total coliforms, Escherichia coli) and their variations in space and time. Groundwater was sampled from the pumping well and the piezometers during 25 field campaigns in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The results demonstrate the impact of agricultural activities on nitrate contamination. They indicate high spatial and temporal variations in nitrate concentrations, from 6 to 125 mgNO 3 -/L within the capture area, with 40 % of the samples exceeding the Québec drinking water limit of 45 mgNO 3 -/L. Nitrate pollution in the municipal well exceeded 45 mgNO 3 -/L during 2005, but no bacteriological contamination was observed. The results also show a high variability of nitrate concentration with depth within the capture zone. Electrical conductivity appears as a good indicator {{of the presence of}} nitrate and calcium ions in this capture zone. Correlations between nitrate, calcium and chloride suggest that these ions come from the same source of fertilizer. Nitrate isotopic composition suggests that nitrate in groundwater originates from both chemical and organic fertilizers. The bacteriological results show that the extracted volume of water during sampling of a piezometer has {{a significant impact on the}} bacteria count. The variability of bacteriological pollution is important in space and time, showing a higher contamination during summer. Only 2 % of the raw water samples exhibit contamination exceeding the drinking water standard for treated water. Total coliforms seem to be a good precursor of E. coli or enterococci contamination.

Although conceptually similar, the two methods differ in their underlying assumptions and their limitations: their use together identifies areas where containment may be reliable (i. e., where the methods are in agreement) and where containment is uncertain (typically, where the methods disagree).

However, other constraints or considerations related to changes in groundwater level due to pumping are observed as well and in many cases they even may dominate the decisions on pumping. This paper reviews such constraints or considerations, examines how they are or may be incorporated in the decision-making process, and evaluates to what extent the resulting pumping rates and patterns create conditions that comply with principles of sustainability. groundwater development; groundwater storage depletion; socio-economic impacts; environmental impacts; groundwater resources management; sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Connected {{zones of}} high {{hydraulic}} conductivity in subsurface environments can constitute preferential pathways for contaminant transport and fluid flow. The identification of such pathways {{is important for}} well head protection, <b>groundwater</b> monitoring and <b>capture</b> system design for groundwater remediation. Since it is not practical to exhaustively sample the subsurface, the existence and probable extent and location of such paths must be inferred from available data. Drill or bore hole logs are {{the primary source of}} subsurface data considered. A stochastic simulator is used to generate realizations of subsurface soil attributes on a lattice. Measures of connectivity between any two locations in the aquifer are introduced. These measures consider travel time between lattice locations under an assumption of unit hydraulic gradient along each candidate connected path. A preferential pathway between any two points in the aquifer is then one with the highest degree of connectivity (lowest [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{natural factors}} can {{interfere}} with the vulnerability to groundwater contamination. GIS tools and statistical contribute to the management and planning, applied {{in all areas of}} Geosciences and Environment, allowing, in this case, spatialize the vulnerability of the aquifer to contamination. It was chosen as the objects of analysis the municipality of Rosario do Sul/RS, located in southern Brazil, domain area of the Parana Sedimentary Basin in the area of outcrop of the Guarani Aquifer System / SAG. The city is supplied via surface (water capture in the Santa Maria River) and <b>groundwater</b> (private <b>capture,</b> mostly tubular wells) is intended for human supply, agriculture, cattle raising and leisure. It is noticeable that this region has in its use and occupation, the cultivation of rice, soybean, extensive farming and forestation of eucalyptus. The index of vulnerability to contamination of the aquifer was obtained by Method GOD (G - groundwater occurrence, O - overall litology of aquifer and D - deph of water), which assesses the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination. They used well data available on registered and Information System for Groundwater, Research Company for Mineral. Through this method it is possible spatialize conditions of vulnerability, allowing them to differentiate into five classes, ranging from negligible to extreme. It follows then, {{that it is necessary to}} monitor the variation of groundwater level, its physical and chemical composition as well as the use and occupation of land through the planning and management of groundwater.

Solution of {{difficult}} groundwater flow and transport problems is made easier when the groundwater equipotentials are coupled with streamlines. This approach, {{embedded in a}} new formulation of the Complex Variable Boundary Element Method (CVBEM), is shown to readily solve groundwater flow and transport problems. Examples of this method are presented for recalcitrant problems related to flow under a dam, dipole transport, and regional groundwater flow. The presented technique solves the two-dimensional Laplace equation using Ordinary Least Squares (CVBEMlOLS). This strategy is used to determine unknown boundary values at nodes along the exterior boundary. Once all boundaly values are known, the problem is reformulated in the complex potential plane to solve for the complex position of specified potential-streamline pairs so that the flownet can be constructed. This strategy greatly simplifies the determination of <b>groundwater</b> flownets, <b>capture</b> zones, solute-front migration, and travel times. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

40|$|The Colorado River Delta (CRD) {{is a large}} {{sedimentary}} complex within a tectonically active structurally controlled basin. The CRD lies across the U. S. -Mexico international boundary and is traversed by the Colorado River on is way to the Gulf of California. Multidisciplinary research addressing {{the impact of the}} hydrologic change in the CRD has been increasing since the 1980 's. To help expand the base of this knowledge, a groundwater model for the CRD within Mexico was developed. A conceptual model was constructed and transformed within the Department of Defense Groundwater Modeling Software (GMS) into a numerical model using the MODFLOW 2005 code made available by the U. S. Geological Survey. Model results indicates that large scale flood events on the Colorado River act as a recharge to the aquifer and show that the relationship between <b>groundwater</b> withdrawals and <b>capture</b> are evident on an seasonal scale. The model will form the parent basis for further Delta studies using the Local Grid Refinement (LRG), a methodology inherent to MODFLOW 2005...|$|R
40|$|A program, MR 2 K, {{used for}} calculating drawdown, velocity, storage loss, and capture {{response}} functions for multi -aquifer groundwater flow systems was developed. Capture {{is defined as}} the sum of the increase in aquifer recharge and decrease in aquifer discharge {{as a result of an}} applied stress from <b>groundwater</b> pumping. The <b>capture</b> phenomena treated are stream-aquifer leakance, reduction of evapotranspiration losses, reduction of drain flows, flows to and from prescribed head boundaries, and increases or decreases in natural recharge or discharge from head-dependent boundaries. The response functions are independent of the magnitude of the pumping stresses, and are dependent on the type of partial differential equation, boundary and initial conditions and the parameters thereof, and the spatial and temporal locations of stresses. The aquifers modeled may have irregular- shaped boundaries and nonhomogeneous transmissive and storage qualities. The stresses are groundwater withdrawals from wells. The utility of response functions arises from their capacity to be embedded in management models such as decision support systems. The response functions are incorporated into the objective function or constraints that couple the hydrologic system with the management system. Three response -function examples are presented for a hypothetic basin...|$|R
