50|$|Gaskets are {{mechanical}} seals, usually ring-shaped, which {{seal flange}} joints. Gaskets vary by construction, materials and features. Commonly used gaskets are non-metallic (ASME B 16.21), spiral-wound (ASME B 16.20) and ring-joint (ASME B 16.20). Non-metallic gaskets are used with flat- or raised-face flanges. Spiral-wound gaskets are used with raised-face flanges, and ring-joint gaskets are used with ring-type joint (RTJ) flanges. Stress develops between an RTJ gasket and the <b>flange</b> <b>groove</b> when the gasket is bolted to a flange, leading to plastic deformation of the gasket.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Steel moment {{frames are}} common systems in {{multi-storey}} buildings. Even {{the relatively low}} stiffness of the system limits the applicability, they remain popular in seismic applications due to the good dissipation capacity. Considered deemed-to-comply in seismic applications, welded beam to column connections experienced serious damages and even failures during strong seismic earthquakes. These failures included fractures of the beam flange-to-column <b>flange</b> <b>groove</b> welds, cracks in beam flanges, and cracks through the column section. To {{reduce the risk of}} brittle failure of welded connections, beam weakening near the ends became popular. To assure the desired behavior, i. e. the development of plastic deformations in the reduced beam section zones rather than at the face of the column, proper detailing and sizing is necessary. Today design provisions are limited to long beams, where the effect of shear stresses may be neglected. The application of the same rules for short beams might be non-conservative, and therefore qualification testing is necessary. The study presents the qualification testing of reduced beam sections welded connections of short beams. Both monotonic and cyclic tests were performed and numerical models were validated based on the test data...|$|E

50|$|The first {{cartridges}} in Bergmann pistols were grooveless, {{with the}} bullets having a sharp nose to avoid jams. Later pistols, however, have mechanical extractors and cartridges with <b>grooved</b> <b>flanges.</b> The M96 had an internal box-magazine holding five cartridges.|$|R
50|$|They found a {{wheel flange}} {{mark on the}} inside of the western rail at a point almost 73 ft north of the control point where the CSX train had slowed almost to a stop when it saw the red. This they {{identified}} as the point of derailment (POD). They noticed immediately that the insulators on the Pandrol clips holding the rails to the concrete ties had slipped out of place slightly, with a noticeable gap between them and the rails in some areas. At the POD the rail was bowed slightly outward, resulting in a 5/16 in variance from gauge.At and near the POD the ballast and track were notably paler. This was because they were covered with dust, indicating that soil infiltration had occurred. The pale dust was not the soil itself, but residue from the tie ends, which had suffered serious abrasion. Wheel <b>flange</b> <b>grooves</b> were also evident in some of the ties taken back to Highbridge, suggesting the track had been bending outward under load due to decreased structural support from the fouled ballast. This evidence was noted in 2010 satellite photos of the area on Google Earth and more recent photos taken by Metro-North itself.|$|R
50|$|What {{retains the}} cubies when a face is rotated is {{the set of}} four curved flanges on the four {{neighboring}} square-hole pieces. Grooves inside the cubies fit over those <b>flanges.</b> Edge cubie <b>grooves</b> engage <b>flanges</b> on neighboring square pieces, thus keeping them together.|$|R
5000|$|In North America {{the groove}} {{would have to}} be a minimum of 2+1/8 in wide and by extension, the maximum {{distance}} between the inside faces of the guard <b>flanges</b> of the <b>grooved</b> rails can be no more than 52+1/4 in, see below.|$|R
50|$|Seen from a more-typical oblique position, however, {{each side}} of a square piece is {{somewhat}} akin to a low arch that joins neighboring corners. The low part of that arch engages mostly-hidden internal sliding pieces that (among other functions) support the edge cubies. The high surface of the arch includes convex curved circular <b>flanges</b> that engage <b>grooves</b> inside the cubies, to hold the structure together.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSteel moment {{resisting}} {{frames are}} widely employed in regions of high seismic risk to resist seismic forces. Comparisons among different analytical investigations show that geometric characteristics of connection parts have great influences on connection's behavior. In order to evaluate this issue, a special connection is detailed {{that consists of}} a top and a bottom flange plate which is fillet welded to beam <b>flange</b> and <b>groove</b> welded to column flange. This connection is considered as an exterior connection. Beam {{is the most important}} part of connection, so we focused on varying the depth of the beam. Considering that, this parameter isnâ€™t independent in rolled shape profiles, i. e. when beam depth increases, the thickness of flange and web will increase at the same time, we cannot examine the effect of beam depth alone. Therefore, we have used the plate girder instead to consider beam depth separately. All of models are designed according to AISC 360 - 05 provisions. Three-dimensional nonlinear finite element analyses of the connections were carried out. The results show, when beam depth increases, strength increases too, but stiffness and ductility decrease significantly. On the other hand, fracture potential of connection changes significantly...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} numerical {{studies on}} the cyclic behavior of connection between I-beam and a built-up box column. The connection utilized the flange plates to connect the beam flanges to the column flange. The <b>flange</b> plates were <b>groove</b> welded to column flange and fillet welded to the beam top and bottom flanges. In order to upgrade the connection, vertical top and bottom rib plates were groove welded to the column flange and fillet welded to the beam flange plates. The effect of the vertical rib plate's geometry and position {{on the behavior of}} moment connections was investigated. Nonlinear finite element analyses using ABAQUS program were performed to investigate the cyclic behavior of welded flange plate connections. The results showed that vertical rib plate's reinforcement can significantly improve the behavior of the connection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a new seal system between flange joints without using gasket. This gasketless <b>flange</b> {{includes}} a <b>groove</b> and an annular lip that is machined {{in one of the}} flange being in contact with the other flange to form a seal line when the flanges are assembled. In this study, first, fundamental dimensions are examined for PVC-U to obtain the best sealing performance. Then, the effects of material difference and flange nominal size on the sealing performance of new gasketless flange are investigated for two types of materials, 0. 25 % carbon steel (S 25 C JIS) and unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC-U JIS). It is found that the critical internal pressure where leakage appears is mainly controlled by the maximum normal stress at the annular lip for each material even if the flange nominal sizes are different. The gasketless flange made by PVC-U shows the higher critical internal pressure compared with the case of S 25 C if the same clamping forces are applied. The effect of stress relaxation for PVC-U on the sealing performance is also considered. Then, it may be concluded that this PVC-U gasketless flange also has good sealing performance...|$|R
40|$|Downloaded Fsolid {{ferritic}} flanges have cracked purely due to overload; and {{stainless steel}} overlay ferritic flanges have cracked possibly due {{to a combination of}} mechanisms. The stainless steel overlay flanges may be more prone to cracking than solid ferritic flanges due to crack initiation by Cl SCC of the overlay and differential thermal expansion and residual stresses between the stainless steel overlay and the ferritic base metal. Nonetheless, a major factor in crack initiation for all of these cases is the high localized stress at the corners of the ring groove. It has been well documented that the configuration of standard RTJ flanges does not include sufficient radii {{at the base of the}} ring groove to effectively reduce the local-ized peak stresses. Note that the ASME B 16. 5 standard permitted a very sharp corner of essentially zero radius until a recent ad-denda which includes the requirement for larger radii, which should help mitigate cracking, but probably not eliminate it. During routine inspection of a 2 - 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo hydrogen process-ing reactor vessel in a petroleum refinery, cracking was identified in the ring joint flange of the inlet nozzle. The cracking was de-tected while the flange connection was in the assembled condition using a new angle beam UT technique. The cracks encompassed approximately 180 deg of circumference and were located at both the inner and outer radius of the <b>flange</b> ring joint <b>groove.</b> The crack depth was 1. 0 in. ~ 25. 4 mm! on the innermost radius of the depths located at the base of the ring joint groove to evaluate the change in the crack tip driving force. Both elastic and elastic-plastic analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of crack tip plasticity in the resulting J-integral calculation. Metallurgical Testing. A small sliver was removed from the cracked flange. A chemistry analysis was performed to assess the potential for temper embrittlement and a microstructural specimen was prepared to examine the microstructure and to perform a mi-crohardness test to assess the potential for hydrogen-assisted crack growth. The material had a J factor of 139, which is unusually low for 2 - 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo steel produced in 1966, where J 5 (percentSi 1 percentMn!*~percentP 1 percentSn) * 10...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of snakes (Squamata: Serpentes) represents a major transition in squamate reptiles and involves extensive modifications {{in the body}} plan. Functional morphology and phylogeny are integrated to discuss adaptive morphological traits in the origin of snakes and in the {{evolution of}} the venom-injecting apparatus among lizards, which is convergent with that in snakes. The focus of these analyses is to determine how to best optimize morphological traits on the phylogeny and to use character distribution in terminal taxa to estimate ecological adaptation in ancestral nodes. To study the locomotion transition from lizards to snakes, 45 virtual models of the squamate bony labyrinth in the inner ear were reconstructed. The results show morphological diversifications of the vestibular region among burrowers, generalists and marine swimmers. The vestibule is enlarged in fossorial species, and reduced in marine snakes and the marine lizard Platecarpus coryphaeus. To quantify the morphological differences and provide tractable methods to reconstruct locomotion in ancestral snakes, I performed three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis of the 45 samples, using six landmarks and 22 semilandmarks. ANOVA tests on the Procrustes coordinates supported differences among fossorial, generalist, and aquatic locomotion categories. Phylogenetic signal was insignificant in the Procrustes coordinates. Using a phylogeny with the 44 extant samples as terminal taxa, I reconstructed shape coordinates of all internal nodes. Reconstructed shape of the vestibular region of key ancestral nodes in snakes preferred a terrestrial origin for crown-group snakes. Morphological proxies used in this study can be applied to stem snakes to estimate locomotion. Methodologically, this study provides a novel approach to resolve the question whether snakes become limbless on land or in the oceans. Evolution of the venom-injection apparatus in lizards is discussed, based on new material of Estesia mongoliensis. A total-evidence phylogenetic analysis of anguimorph lizards is performed with 86 anguimorph taxa coded to 435 morphological characters and four genes. The matrix includes eight new morphological characters. The total-evidence phylogeny suggests that Estesia Mongoliensis is a basal monstersaur whose crown groups are Heloderma, the only living venomous lizards. Presence of tooth <b>flanges</b> with venom <b>grooves</b> is recognized as a new monstersaurian synapomorphy in this study. Estesia mongoliensis has venom grooves comparable to extant Heloderma, but has a deeper root-to-tip groove in the caudal tooth carina, revealing morphological variations of lizard venom delivery apparatus that are not recorded in extant species...|$|R
