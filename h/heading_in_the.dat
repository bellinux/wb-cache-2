5|$|McLeod {{started in}} the semi-final game against the United States on August 6, in what many have called a {{controversial}} match. In the 78th minute of the game, Canada was leading, 3–2, when the referee ruled that McLeod had held the ball {{for more than six}} seconds, going by a rule that is rarely enforced, and gave an indirect free kick inside the penalty area to the United States. McLeod faced no challenge with the free kick; however, the referee then called a penalty after the ball struck Canadian player Marie-Eve Nault on the arm. American striker Abby Wambach took the penalty kick, and it went past McLeod. The match went into extra time, with Alex Morgan <b>heading</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ball past McLeod's fingertips in the 123rd minute, resulting in a win for the United States.|$|E

It wasn't until Takuro asked him to play at just one show to fill in for their missing bassist {{that he decided to}} go. Following that show, Jiro continued to receive invitations to play with Glay, and eventually he became Glay's official bass player, finalizing the official four member lineup.|$|E

Clashes {{had also}} {{erupted in the}} town of Tabqa, in the Raqqa Governorate, and fighting spread to the central Hama Governorate, where ISIL killed seven rebel fighters. During the fighting in Manbij, ISIL used car bombs to defend its territory. Meanwhile, ISIL forces retreated from al-Dana and Atme in the Idlib Governorate, and started <b>heading</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of Aleppo. Their positions were overrun by the al-Nusra Front and Ahrar ash-Sham groups, in a possible deal to avoid larger confrontations.

25|$|When Notre Dame {{athletic}} director Kevin White {{announced to the}} media that Davie would not be retained as head coach of Notre Dame, he cited a disappointing season with the Irish <b>heading</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong direction on the field. A week after the firing of Davie, George O'Leary, seven–year head coach of Georgia Tech, was hired by Notre Dame for the head coaching position. Five days after being hired, however, O'Leary resigned from the position, because of discrepancies on his résumé about receiving a varsity letter and a master's degree while in school. While O'Leary was criticized for lying, some said it gave Notre Dame {{a chance to make}} a better decision. Finally, two weeks after O'Leary resigned, Notre Dame signed Tyrone Willingham, the seventh–year coach of Stanford, to a six-year contract, ending the Bob Davie era at Notre Dame.|$|E

25|$|Tambor {{stood out}} of Fremantle {{for the last time}} on 20 July 1943 en route to Lombok Strait. On 27 July the Teiken Maru was sunk by a mine laid by the Tambor On 3 August, she sighted five cargomen and a {{destroyer}} in Palawan Passage. Three shots at a freighter produced two hits, and one fired at another target missed; Japanese records do not indicate any sinking. On 21 August, she sighted an unescorted convoy of three tankers and five freighters. She fired five torpedoes at a pair of freighters, but scored no hits. Two more sped toward a tanker and produced one explosion but no apparent damage. The next day, she sighted another convoy <b>heading</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction. Making a submerged attack, Tambor fired five torpedoes at a large freighter. Three made perfect hits amidships but all failed to explode, and she sank no ships. The submarine set sail for Midway, arriving 7 September. She transited through Pearl Harbor on her way to San Francisco, on 20 November for major overhaul.|$|E
25|$|In {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and the Churel, a priest warns the protagonist to not go near the Peepul trees {{because that is}} where the Churel lives and she might take him away and kill him. He still went to the Peepul tree and she called out to him in a sweet tone and seduced him until he went to her. Blinded by his desire, he did not notice that while he lay with her, his body seemed to get frailer until he died in a state of ecstasy. In The Female Element in Indian Culture, it says, “The Churel runs after and seeks to possess every man whom she meets, for, it is said, her carnal {{appetite}} remains unsatisfied in life”. She also possesses girls during dances, causing a trance. According to Persian legend, when travelers saw the tracks of a Churel in the dirt they would try to flee by <b>heading</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction, but her reversed feet would inevitably lead them right into her grasp. The Patari and Majhwar think that she appears to take her victims to the mountains and {{the only way they can}} be freed is if a goat is sacrificed.|$|E
25|$|Before 2011, a cab's {{availability}} {{was indicated}} by {{the lights on the}} top of the car. When no lights were lit, the cab would be occupied by passengers. When just the center light showing the medallion number was lit, the cab would be empty and available. When the OFF and DUTY inscriptions to either side of the medallion number were lit, with the medallion number off, the cab would be off duty and not accepting passengers. However, when the OFF and DUTY inscriptions were lit and the medallion number was still lit, the cab would be off duty but the driver could choose to pick up passengers <b>heading</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction as the driver. In fall 2011, the TLC announced a plan to replace the three-light system with a simple indicator as to whether the taxi is available. In 2012, the TLC simplified the light system further, with a lit roof light indicating that the taxi is available and an unlit light indicating that the taxi is not available, regardless of whether it has passengers or is simply off duty. It also started fining drivers $100 for picking up passengers without the light on, except for if the driver is picking up their last passenger of their shift.|$|E
