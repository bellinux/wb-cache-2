25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (<b>intermediate</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>containers,</b> such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer milled glass fibres and wollastonite.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{flexible}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>container</b> (FIBC), also called a bulk bag, to ship and store dry bulk materials is Cost-effective, making the container increasingly popular for material suppliers and users, {{as well as}} custom packagers and shippers. This article discusses two industry trends- reusing and recycling FIBCs-as well as some cautions and guidelines you should know about. About FIBCs An FIBC is typically constructed of woven polypropylene and has a square or rectangular base. The inlet at the top is typicall) equipped with a filling spout, although other styles are used foi certain materials (Figure 1). The base can have a discharge out. let of various types (Figure 1) or be plain (requiring the bottom to be slit for discharge, which destroys the FIBC). The mos common FIBC (also called an inledoutlet FIBC) has both a fill ing inlet and a discharge outlet, rather than a plain bottom. T he Flexible <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>Container</b> Association (FIBCA) includes regular members (US FIBC manufacturers and suppliers to these manufacturers) and associate members (foreign FIBC manufacturers who have a US representative). The FIBCA {{has been working with}} other associations and US regulatory agencies to recommend safety standards for handling hazardous and nonhazardous materials in FIBCs. Making this work especially challenging are two FIBC industry trends driven by the industry's desire to remain both competitive and ecologically responsible: reusing and recycling FIBCs that handle nonhazardous materials. If you use FIBCs, you're probably aware that more users are reusing or recycling FIBCs. But are these practices safe? And do they save money or provide other benefits? A look at some FIBC basics will provide useful background information for discussing these issues. Lifting loops are located at the FIBC's top four comers to permi lifting by a forklift truck. The FIBC can be lined to protect thl material or prevent the material from contaminating the envi ronment, workers, or the FIBC. Capacity ranges from 500 t' 8, 000 pounds.

The cleaning schedule for IBCs was modified to reuse IBCs as much as possible. In this paper, we analyze the management of 600 L IBCs. We simulate a two machines finite-buffer line model to estimate the optimum buffer size. We collected equipment downtime data to estimate the parameters for the simulation model. We use the simulation to determine the number of 600 L IBCs needed for each campaign; the number of 600 L IBCs was reduced from 12 to 8.

40|$|For the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, powder segregation {{can occur in}} many processes such as blending and compression solid dose unit operations. Yet {{it is important that}} the high quality standards of drug product manufacture are maintained throughout the whole processes. Powder segregation has been identified by {{the pharmaceutical}} industry as a potential issue, and in some cases it may cause variability in tablet assay and uniformity throughout a compression run. Early studies suggested for certain Direct Compression (DC) products, the separation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) from excipients could arise due to air-induced segregation of the powders discharging from an <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>Container</b> (IBC) to the tablet press via a vertical chute. Segregation tests were carried out on trial powder blend materials supplied by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), using a laboratory-scale air elutriation test facility at The Wolfson Centre. Particle size analysis of the virgin and segregated sub-samples clearly indicated that powder segregation occurred as a result of aerodynamic effects. Subsequent chemical assay results concurred with the particle size results. Flowability testing of the powder blends indicated them to be free-flowing materials; this in addition to the presence of large particle size differentials within the powder blends is the likely cause of the susceptibility to air-induced segregation...|$|R
40|$|Aquaponic food {{systems have}} been gaining {{popularity}} {{over the last decade}} for their ability to simultaneously produce fish and vegetables within the confines of a single standalone system. Throughout the United States and Australia, organizations have implemented aquaponics on a large-scale for community food gardens. Most studies in this field focus on input requirements, productivity, and economic benefit of commercially-sized aquaponic systems. Little has been done on {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, the personal, home-sized system and its potential to supply a family with low-cost food. This thesis investigates the feasibility of implementing a small-scale aquaponic system of 3 ̆c 200 gallons for household consumption. Feasibility was assessed on cost, construction process including tools and materials, productivity, and maintenance requirements. It is hypothesized that small-scale aquaponics systems can be easily constructed and maintained to augment household food supply, and that the use of recycled materials can reduce the startup costs and increase the rate of return for the aquaponics implementer. Research included the construction of two common aquaponic systems, the first with plastic 55 -gallon barrels using a design plan devised by Travis W. Hughey called barrel-ponics. The second, used an <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>Container</b> (IBC) which acts as a grow bed and fish tank. Within both systems, tomatoes, bell peppers, jalapeno peppers, shishito peppers, kale, squash, and eggplant were grown. The fish species used to stock both tanks was Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) with 20 in the IBC system and 5 in the barrel-ponic system. Over a three month grow period data was collected for productivity which included measurements of inputs, plant/fish growth and amount of produce harvested. Other factors that were analyzed included the construction process, cost to build and maintain each system, and the cost benefit of grown produce versus store bought produce. It was found that the IBC system was significantly easier to construct and maintain due it its simple design. The barrel-ponic system was cheaper and materials were somewhat more common although, there were many issues associated with its flood/drain system. At the observed level of productivity, both systems operating year-round would take several years to generate a positive return on investment. However, production trends were observed after the three-month period to continue to increase suggesting that a high output rate could be achieved and thus increase the rate of return. Small-scale aquaponic system such as these can be constructed relatively easily and maintained so long as there is access to informational documents, construction materials, reliable electrical grid, operational equipment, and adequate climate to support a yearlong grow season. Further research must be conducted on long term productivity levels for aquaponic systems at this scale as well as prices of materials to better determine the economic feasibility for household use...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Intermediate</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>containers</b> are {{stackable}} containers {{mounted on}} a pallet designed to be moved using a forklift or a pallet jack. IBCs have a volume range that is situated between drums and tanks, hence the term [...] "intermediate“. The most common sizes are 1040 L and 1250 L (the 1040 liter IBCs are often listed as being 1000 liters). Cube-shaped IBCs give a particularly good utilization of storage capacity compared to palletized drums - one 275 gallon IBC is equivalent to five 55 gal drums, and a 330-gallon IBC is equivalent to six 55 gallon drums.|$|E
