New York magazine wrote: [...] "Ethan Hawke's Hotspur... is a compelling, ardent creation." [...] Ben Brantley of the New York Times reported that Hawke's interpretation of Hotspur might be [...] "too contemporary for some tastes," [...] but allowed [...] "great <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> as he fumes and fulminates." [...] In 2005 Hawke {{starred in the}} Off-Broadway revival of David Rabe's dark comedy Hurlyburly. New York Times critic Brantley praised Hawke's performance as the central character Eddie, reporting that [...] "he captures with merciless precision {{the sense of a}} sharp mind turning flaccid". The performance earned Hawke a Lucille Lortel Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Bahn of The A.V. Club {{was less}} {{positive}} about the episode, grading it as a B-. He praised the early scene where Amy was abandoned for the [...] "zingy dialogue" [...] but found himself [...] "enjoying the cleverness of the explanation without really buying into it". He expressed confusion at how the time-shift worked and thought the problem was too thin {{to carry out the}} whole episode, and that Amy's abandonment and love for Rory which was left [...] " [...] pull it off". He thought that the two Amys seen in the mini episodes [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] were more <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> and the episode did not reveal anything new about Amy and Rory. However, he praised how the decision the Doctor had to make was portrayed.|$|E

Ethan Gilsdorf of the Boston Globe stated that [...] "it’s <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> as Munroe tackles each question and examines every possible complication." [...] According to Gilsdorf, What If? gives a view into [...] "Munroe’s playful yet existentially-tinged worldview" [...] by contrasting cataclysmic scenarios with more heady ideas, such as examining {{the effects of}} a magnitude minus-7 Richter scale earthquake. The Huffington Post remarked that [...] "What makes Munroe's work so fantastic is a combination of two elements: his commitment to trying to answer even the weirdest question with solid science, and his undeniable sense of humor." [...] Rhett Allain of Wired praised What If? because even his 12-year-old son was able to enjoy it, though he found a minor error in one of the sections.|$|E

One preview noted that it should be a <b>fun</b> game <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> as it [...] "promises to be a high-scoring" [...] game. Both teams featured strong offenses, however they juxtaposed one another in that Washington State, as typical of Mike Leach-coached football teams, heavily relied on the passing game, whereas Colorado State relied heavily upon the running game. Though Washington State was only a 3.5 point favorite, college football analysts were nearly unanimous in predicting a Washington State victory by an even larger margin.|$|R

[...] Bob Ezrin, producer of the album, felt that Leto is [...] "one of the most inventive drummers I've worked with. He isn't satisfied with simply adding a beat; his drum parts {{are an integral part of}} the orchestration of the record.

Directed by Judith Ivey, {{the play}} is about her mixed feelings over the success of The Simpsons, her parents, her relationships, and her struggles with bulimia. The New York Times critic Margo Jefferson called it an [...] "appealing if overlong show", adding that [...] "The career narrative needed shortening. This would involve some editing and revising but wouldn't taint {{the best parts of}} More. It is refreshing to hear a celebrity talk cleanly about being fame-driven and about not getting the degree or the kind of fame you craved. It's <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> a skilled actress use her craft to the full." [...] She would later perform the play for three weeks in Los Angeles the following year.|$|E
500|$|Of Miguel's {{performances}} in Los Angeles, The Orange County Register editor Daniel Chang commented that he [...] "delivered a classy show {{that was as}} much <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> {{as it was to}} hear". Chang noted that Miguel [...] "emotes a contagious energy through dramatic facial expressions, fetal-position-like contortions and physical outbursts in time with the music" [...] and complimented his dance moves and the visual sets. [...] Regarding his concert in Houston, Michael D. Clark of the Houston Chronicle said that Miguel [...] "proved, once again, that it isn't necessary to change languages to reach U.S. audiences". He observed that Miguel seemed [...] "determined to balance the upbeat with the overwrought" [...] in contrast to his previous concerts which were dominated by ballads. On the other hand, Clark expressed disappointment that the boleros were sung in medleys which did not allow any of them to stand out.|$|E
5000|$|Lee and Kaluta {{frequently}} told interviewers {{they wanted}} to step away from good-vs.-evil characters to tell stories of flawed people who were too slippery for such boundaries. The writer said, [...] "In our comic book the 'good guys' are not all good, and the 'bad guys' are not totally bad, and the characters do really stupid things. These characters all have faults. they get smarter, just as people learn things in life." [...] The artist said, [...] "There is no ruler of the universe making other people dance. But there's lots {{of people in the}} comic who think they're making other people dance. And that's where the <b>fun</b> is, <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the characters delude themselves." ...|$|R

[...] He continued, [...] "Plus, I figured it'd be <b>fun</b> for people <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> visually." [...] The line [...] "everything is science fiction" [...] was the result of Hawkes mishearing Ocasek's original lyric, [...] "everything you say is fiction"; hence the spacey sound effect after the line. Ocasek changed it to accommodate this. (Liner notes for The Cars Deluxe Edition, Rhino, 1999) ...|$|R
500|$|David Ansen of Newsweek enjoyed Spider-Man as a <b>fun</b> film <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> {{though he}} {{considered}} Spider-Man 2 to be [...] "a little too self-important {{for its own}} good." [...] Ansen saw Spider-Man 3 as a return to form, finding it [...] "the most grandiose chapter and the nuttiest." [...] Tom Charity of CNN appreciated the films' [...] "solidly redemptive moral convictions", also noting the vast improvement of the visual effects from the first film to the third. While he saw the second film's Doc Ock as the [...] "most engaging" [...] villain, he applauded the third film's Sandman as [...] "a triumph of CGI wizardry." [...] Richard Corliss of Time enjoyed {{the action of the}} films and thought that they did better than most action movies by [...] "rethinking the characters, the franchise and the genre." ...|$|R
500|$|Fred Patton of Animation World Magazine {{described}} the anime as [...] "delightfully witty {{and even an}} educational window onto what Japanese high school life is really like." [...] Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD, stated that [...] "There's a lot to laugh with here and a cast of characters that grow quickly on you as you start finding those you favor and those you don't." [...] Andrew Shelton from Anime Meta explains that [...] "The character of the girls is extremely well brought out. The superb observation, and ability to capture expression, makes the anime incredibly <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> in addition to meeting the story requirements. The action, and very rich comedy, are also wonderfully represented. There is just so much meaning, and charm, {{in even the most}} minor of expressions." [...] The reviewers of THEM Anime and Anime News Network felt that fans who had already graduated high school would feel nostalgic at times while watching Azumanga Daioh.|$|E
500|$|Johnson was {{complimentary}} towards Molly Shannon: [...] "Far funnier is a subplot with Molly Shannon of Saturday Night Live back as Will and Grace's (Messing) whacked-out neighbor Val [...] Shannon, always {{funny and}} <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> isn't a mere stunt... Shannon shows a guest actor can shine when paired {{with the right}} character." [...] The Palm Beach Posts Kevin D. Thompson wrote that Shannon's performance [...] "displays why she should have her own sitcom", while Cox wrote {{that she has a}} [...] "quality in which a tightly bound surface normalcy seems to barely contain a bundle of tics and impulses, and the writers make excellent use of it by having Val try to first steal Grace's flair for design, then cop one of her clients." [...] Perigard noted that Grace and Val's storyline made it [...] "clear that the producers just like the sight of the two women flailing their arms in a mock catfight." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics have}} responded {{positively}} to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN {{said of the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "The absolute best part of [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, {{it was nice to}} even see her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls," [...] induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it made me feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: [...] "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> Salling sing, and it’s always <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings." [...] In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes [...] "as endearing as they are unrealistic", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that [...] "the ice around [...] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo." ...|$|E
5000|$|Satire {{is also a}} {{significant}} element of Mamatas's fiction. Ed Park, writing for his online The Los Angeles Times review column, described Mamatas's Under My Roof - a short novel about {{the formation of a}} microstate on Long Island - as an [...] "accurate, fast-moving satire that transcends mere target shooting by virtue of its narrator, Daniel’s 12-year-old son Herbie". A starred review in Publishers Weekly for the same title also highlighted the satirical elements in the work, declaring: [...] "A big-bang ending caps the fast-paced novel, and there's much <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> be had <b>watching</b> Mamatas...merrily skewer his targets." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ryan Thompson of Watch Play Read {{awarded the}} episode a 90%, calling it [...] "the episode {{that has been}} looking forward to this season." [...] He {{concluded}} that it was a <b>fun</b> episode <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> but that he wished that the Finn and young-Bubblegum relationship could have been developed over the span of a few more episodes. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk argued that the episode was an example of the season [...] "fleshing out the characters viewers have come to know and love" [...] by elaborating on the relationship between Finn and Bubblegum. Foster praised the introduction of Lemongrab, writing that the episode [...] "reveals a number of weird and sometimes paralyzingly funny quirks about the truly bizarre Earl of Lemongrab". Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club named the episode one of the ten additional installments of the series that illustrates that [...] "emotional complexity" [...] lies [...] "beneath Adventure Times weirdness".|$|R

500|$|The {{video is}} similar to the director's cut, but has a few differences. The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers, and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out. The clip's ending is also {{different}} from the original: instead of emerging from the manhole Spears just looks into the camera, apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which the world does end. On April 9, 2011, Spears tweeted that she had seen the final cut of the dance version, and was not sure which one she liked best. Ray Kay tweeted on April 14, 2011, that the original version of the video was better, [...] "but it's <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the choreography too." [...] The video, titled [...] "DANCE Till the World Ends" [...] premiered on April 15, 2011. Leah Collins of Dose commented, [...] "sorry, Team Britney, but if any of you were hoping to pass off Spears’ anemic performance in the original as the result of unfortunate editing, this clip isn’t exactly going to bring anyone back on side." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was critical of}} the episode's intricacy, writing, [...] "'The Amazing Maleeni' is a convoluted episode that ultimately lacks verve and excitement. Even if one can {{figure out what is}} going on, there remains the question of how much, or even whether, to care." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated it two stars out of five. The two noted that, had the episode used real magic tricks instead of [...] "resort to CGI, the episode would have been much more than a simple [...] "cheat". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the fact that the explanation behind Maleeni turning his head around 360 degrees was never satisfactorily explained. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris compared the episode's plot to the 1999 movie Arlington Road, noting that while [...] "the scheme is <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> while it unfolds, [...] in the end, it's not credible; too much is left open to chance for it really to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sun Herald {{thought of}} the {{character}} as [...] "a thoroughly charming intergalactic thief famed for using her allure to get what she wants", and Matt Roush of TV Guide called Claudia Black [...] "great <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> in [...] ". TV Zones Stephen Graves believed that Browder and Black's first post-Farscape encounter in Stargate SG-1s [...] "Avalon" [...] was [...] "somewhat underplayed [...] but Black makes up for this with her sparky, snarky characterization of Vala." [...] He welcomed the producers' decision to not cast a carbon copy of Samantha Carter, and thought that Claudia Black's Vala in her six-episode arc remained [...] "the best thing in the series". By season 10's [...] "Memento Mori", TV Zones Anthony Brown felt that [...] "Ben Browder and Claudia Black have...reached {{a point where they}} can play out an amusing take on Misery without you feeling that [...] have somehow starbursted onto SG-1s Earth". Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune called Browder and Black's interaction in season 10 [...] "great fun; the rapport they developed on the stellar Farscape was still much in evidence, even though they played radically different characters on SG-1." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Movie Critic {{next door}} awarded the film {{four out of}} five stars citing My Pet Dinosaur is a film that hearkens back to the beloved Spielberg {{classics}} of the 80's -- yes, like E.T., but also The Goonies or even the Spielberg-produced Super 8 ...but the kids' efforts are outrageously <b>fun</b> and heartwarming <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b> Magnus is amazingly real, the villains perfectly villainous, and the young actors manage to carry the movie, though it's often Mike who steals the show. And it's a show worth stealing, {{four out of five}} stars' worth. The editing is a bit off, with some of the scene changes a bit confusing, but overall it's a nostalgic and wonderful romp." ...|$|R

500|$|Josh Mapes of The Biography Channel listed {{her in the}} {{category}} [...] "10 Primetime Stars We Love to Hate". He said, [...] "Any great soap opera needs a great villain. While viewers may identify more with the protagonist, the villains in a serial drama always spice things up, cause trouble, {{and make it more}} <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b> From tongue lashings to catfights, underhanded tricks to boldface lies, the characters we love to hate have each brought a fair share of great moments to primetime soaps. While Larry Hagman played the bad guy on Dallas, Donna Mills played bad girl on its spin-off, Knots Landing. Unapologetically going after what she wanted, Mills' character engaged in affairs with two of the husbands on the Knots Landing cul-de-sac. But, like most vixens on primetime soaps, she was only out for money, not love." [...] Steve Eighinger of the Quincy Newspapers listed Abby as the third-most memorable TV character in an article he wrote for the Quincy Herald-Whig. He said, [...] "No one, absolutely no one, rocked eye shadow and the messy-hair look like Abby Ewing, who was this marvelous combination of vixen and corporate sleuth. As her character developed, life on the cul-de-sac made Knots Landing destination TV every Thursday night for more than a decade." ...|$|E
500|$|Lost Luggage {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release. [...] Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz {{wrote in a}} 1982 issue of the magazine Electronic Games that Lost Luggage did not have [...] "the spark of greatness". While they praised the game for shifting away from [...] "the typical SF shoot-out" [...] and {{said that it was}} [...] "solid" [...] and [...] "playable", they remarked on its plain-looking graphics and said that [...] "even the greatest concept cannot make a great game when it isn't blended with an outstanding type of play action." [...] Writing for Video, Kunkel and Katz commented on the game's [...] "incredibly cute touches", but suggested that Apollo may have better [...] "scrimp on the frills" [...] in favor of additional gameplay challenges. Danny Goodman of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games wrote that [...] "graphics are <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch,</b> but the game play for experienced players gets old fast". A reviewer for the magazine TV Gamer recommended the game for children, but felt that seasoned video game players would enjoy Kaboom! more. More positive opinions were from Videogaming Illustrated, which described the game as the most charming of Apollo's releases, and Texas Monthly, which described it as a [...] "fiendish little amusement." ...|$|E

So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me."

Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?'

[...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of tough love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|R
