5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} {{nitrogen fixation}} by making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes.

5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book Darwinism, which {{explained}} and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might {{contribute to the development}} of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{evaluated}} the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> measures using cohorting rooms and antimicrobial use {{in reducing the}} <b>isolation</b> rate <b>of</b> methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB). Methods: Four cohorting rooms (16 beds) for patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) have been created in the general wards of our 894 -bed hospital since October 2003. We prospectively {{evaluated the}} <b>isolation</b> rates <b>of</b> MRSA and MDR-AB, and amount of antimicrobial use during the 8 -year study period. We also investigated the relationship between antimicrobial use density (AUD) and the <b>isolation</b> rates <b>of</b> MRSA and MDR-AB. Results: After creating cohorting rooms, the <b>isolation</b> rates <b>of</b> MRSA decreased from 1. 56 cases per 1, 000 patient-days from 2004 - 2005 to 1. 24 from 2006 - 2007 (P= 0. 57). The <b>isolation</b> rates <b>of</b> MDR-AB also decreased from 0. 72 from 2004 - 2005 to 0. 36 from 2010 - 2011 (P＜ 0. 01). The mean quarterly AUDs of glycopeptides and carbapenems were 30. 17 ± 6. 80 and 19. 5 ± 7. 10, respectively. There were no significant correlations between AUD values and the <b>isolation</b> rate <b>of</b> MRSA or MDR-AB.
