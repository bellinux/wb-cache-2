25|$|Prior to the EuroBasket 2003, Alvertis was {{a player}} whose {{leadership}} and experience with Panathinaikos and the Greek national team were priceless. Consequently, although his role within the Greek national team had become secondary on the court, {{it was still a}} leading one off the court. He was in charge of transmitting values such as commitment, partnership, and ambition to the new generation of Greek stars. After Greece finished in fifth place at both the EuroBasket 2003 and the 2004 Summer Olympics, the veteran star announced his retirement from the Greek National Team. Alvertis kept his word, even though Coach Giannakis thought about including him on the Greek team that would eventually win the gold medal at the EuroBasket 2005. Alvertis had already known that the future of the Greek national team was in <b>good</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
25|$|Himani Singh {{is played}} by Gurdeep Punj. She is Avatar's wife {{and the mother of}} Rohan, Dolly, Sunny, Nikki, and Bobby. She works as a {{hospital}} nurse and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective, and comedic. She loves her family and does everything to care for and protect them. She appears out of her element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Nikki, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest children are in <b>good</b> <b>hands</b> and trusts that her husband and three elder children can look after Nikki and Bobby. She is notoriously conceited and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Himani used to work on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the show is that she was involved in virtually every extracurricular activity at Arya College of Arts and Science, but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities go to her head, such as being on TV or singing in front of a group. She has a habit of taking any chance at publicity that may shine on her family to focus on her, but this never works out well; usually she ends up being cut from the project or tossed out of certain groups. Himani seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the third special that she is pregnant again with her fifth child. In the middle of the third season, Himani quit her nursing job to be a stay-at-home mother to Nikki and Bobby. Himani is the equivalent of Amy Duncan in Good Luck Charlie, who {{is played by}} Leigh-Allyn Baker.|$|E

Knocking on the first round is prohibited, forcing anyone dealt a <b>good</b> <b>hand</b> to break it up, knocking isn't allowed directly after an exchange, rather instead of an exchange, i.e. {{you have to make}} a <b>good</b> <b>hand,</b> and then wait for your next turn to stick.

500|$|The final {{episode of}} Temperatures Rising aired on August 29, 1974. The attempt to {{resuscitate}} {{the series was}} unsuccessful, and ABC finally cancelled it permanently. Andy Siegel, a comedy development executive for ABC at the time, felt the series failed because audiences {{did not want to}} watch a show displaying inadequate medical care, even though it was done in a humorous fashion. In reminiscing about the series he stated: [...] "When people see doctors on television they really want to feel that they're in <b>good</b> <b>hands.</b> That no matter what happens it is a reassuring experience." [...] William Asher, in a 2000 interview, summed up the demise of the series by saying: [...] "It didn't get on. It's too late. You can't do that to an audience. They won't accept it." ...|$|E

500|$|Amid the {{continuing}} uproar, Playford decided to grant clemency. He gave {{no reason for}} his decision. The Royal Commission continued its work {{and concluded that the}} guilty verdict was sound. Although a majority of those who spoke out against the handling of the matter thought that Stuart was probably guilty, the events provoked heated and bitter debate in South Australian society and destabilised Playford's administration. According to Ken Inglis, [...] "most of the responsibility for letting the ... general controversy ... Sir Thomas Playford and his ministers ... was the response of men who were convinced that the affairs of the society were in <b>good</b> <b>hands,</b> and that only the naive and the mischievous would either doubt this general truth or challenge any particular application of it." [...] Blewett and Jaensch said that the [...] "clumsy handling" [...] of the case was a manifestation of [...] "the inevitable hubris of men too long in power".|$|E
500|$|Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Ross (David Schwimmer) {{arrive at}} the {{hospital}}, where Phoebe tells the nurse at the desk that she is in labor. In Phoebe’s hospital room, Ross and Rachel enter with bad news: her doctor fell and hit {{her head in the}} shower, meaning she's unable {{to make it to the}} birth. The replacement doctor, Dr. Harad assures Phoebe that she's in <b>good</b> <b>hands,</b> until he spontaneously declares his admiration for Fonzie, from Happy Days several times. Phoebe demands that Ross goes and find her another doctor, but when the replacement is too young for her liking, Dr. Harad returns. She moreover begs Rachel to talk to her brother Frank, and convince him to let her keep one of the triplets, after having second thoughts over the surrogate process. In the delivery room, Phoebe gives birth to two girls and a boy. Rachel breaks the news to Phoebe that she won’t be able to keep one of the babies. She asks her friends to leave, in order to have a moment alone with the triplets.|$|E
500|$|During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans {{from the}} low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone {{to that of a}} [...] "child whisperer" [...] due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it [...] "a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an {{identity}} crisis". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including [...] "When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing [...] "Shine!" [...] and Williams screaming [...] "Hey!". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, [...] "So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in <b>good</b> <b>hands</b> in the fancy British nation" [...] and [...] "that bear with the red hat", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include [...] "Pharrell's 'Happy"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge" [...] that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents [...] "without sounding overly patronizing". [...] "Shine" [...] ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, Sickels {{augmented}} his scouting {{report on}} Kinsler by reporting that he was: a good athlete, not super-toolsy, but strong for his size with speed a notch above average. His swing looked short, quick, and sharp. Although I'm told that some people worry that his swing is too long, it looked fine to me. [...] "Long swings" [...] usually show up in the stat line as excessive strikeout totals, but Kinsler is not a whiff king. He works the count well, controlling the strike zone without trouble and not swinging at pitches outside the plate area. His bat has some pop in it, particularly to the gaps, where he rifles frequent extra-base shots. He already has above-average power for a player his size, and I think he has enough bat speed to keep hitting home runs at higher levels. Defensively, he shows slightly above-average range and <b>good</b> <b>hands.</b> His arm strength is average, but he's accurate with his throws and seems fundamentally sound, although his error rate is higher than ideal (20 in 71 games at Frisco). He might end up at second base eventually. Kinsler's running speed is a bit better than average, but he's fairly aggressive on the bases and will steal if the opportunity is there. Overall, he is a solid all-around player who makes the most of his natural ability.|$|E
500|$|When Andy Greig was {{released}} by Third Division North club Darlington in June 1924 for financial reasons, Crumley signed as his replacement; his brother had kept goal for the club when they played in the North-Eastern League before the war. Crumley was ever-present as Darlington won the division and consequent promotion to the Second Division. Although the record-breaking goalscoring of Davie Brown attracted most attention, Crumley's contribution to his club's success was generally appreciated. A profile in the Derby Daily Telegraph {{at the start of}} the new season described him as [...] "not as tall as some goalkeepers, but his sense of anticipation is highly developed, while his judgment is <b>good,</b> <b>hands</b> safe, and his clearances pronounced." [...] Performances such as that in a draw with Chelsea in October 1925, when [...] "practically every report of the match, in which two goals were divided, declared Crumley as one of the best on the field", led to speculation about his possible selection for the Scotland national team, yet two weeks after the Chelsea match, after 55 consecutive first-team appearances, he was dropped to the reserves in favour of John Maughan. The two shared goalkeeping duties for the remainder of the season, Crumley making 24 league appearances. He was not included on Darlington's retained list, and signed for Third Division South club Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic.|$|E
500|$|Dave Golder of SFX {{magazine}} gave [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] {{five out}} of five stars, thinking that Moffat captured [...] "the way children perceive the Doctor" [...] and praising the debuts of Smith and Gillan. The A.V. Club reviewer Keith Phipps gave the episode an A-, explaining that he liked Smith [...] "a lot" [...] but was not sure if the Eleventh Doctor was separate enough from the Tenth yet. He called Gillan [...] "instantly winning" [...] and that the story was [...] "no exception" [...] from Moffat's typical [...] "exceptionally strong narratives, keen sense of character, and efficient plotting". Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune stated that the episode [...] "works" [...] as an introduction, though it could be [...] "almost too jokey at times". Though she felt the series was in <b>good</b> <b>hands</b> with Smith and Gillan, she derided the Atraxi for being [...] "alarmingly static and ultimately uninteresting" [...] and the story's [...] "little substance". IGN's Matt Wales rated the episode 8 out of 10, praising it for easily fitting into the show's continuity, especially with Smith's portrayal of the Doctor. However, he thought the [...] "calamity plot" [...] was the [...] "weakest link in an otherwise superb opening episode" [...] and the [...] "whole bunch of disparate elements ... never [...] into a satisfying whole". Though {{he said it was}} not perfect with [...] "a saggy midsection and slightly naff CGI effects", he thought it was still [...] "wondrous in so many ways". New York Times reviewer Mike Hale wrote that the episode worked like [...] "a well-oiled piece of machinery", but it came across as [...] "routine" [...] with [...] "none of the over-the-top exuberance" [...] of Davies' run. While he noted that Gillan [...] "looks promising", he felt that Smith was too much like Tennant and would [...] " [...] to start shaping his own take on the role".|$|E

50|$|Flockton Grey {{was entered}} into his first race for two-year-olds on March 29, 1982 at Leicester Racecourse. As a debutant from an {{unsuccessful}} yard (Stephen Wiles {{had failed to}} train a winner in two years), the horse was priced at 10-1. The perpetrators of the scam, Richardson and Wiles, saw {{an opportunity to make}} a quick profit and backed their horse with £20,000, spreading their money around several different betting shops to avoid detection. They then arranged for a three-year-old horse, <b>Good</b> <b>Hand,</b> formerly owned by Richardson, to run in place of Flockton Grey. According to the official weight for age scale, a three-year-old at that time of year ought to have carried 47 pounds more than a two-year-old so that <b>Good</b> <b>Hand,</b> meeting his younger opponents at level weights, had a huge advantage. <b>Good</b> <b>Hand</b> was unsurprisingly far too strong for the competition, and romped home unchallenged, to win by 20 lengths.|$|R
