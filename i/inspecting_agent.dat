40|$|We show that, under {{plausible}} hypotheses, an {{enforcement agency}} without commitment power will not undertake any enforcement effort {{at all in}} a static game. Indeed, punishment of noncompliant agents brings no social benefits in itself. In a dynamic framework, however, the enforcement agency might <b>inspect</b> private <b>agents</b> {{in order to develop}} a reputation that it will inspect in the future. However small the private agents' prior beliefs that they will be inspected, the agency can obtain almost perfect compliance if the game lasts long enough. Our model with reputation effects does however not converge to a model with perfect commitment. ...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I study {{mechanism}} design {{problems in}} environments where the information {{necessary to make}} decisions {{is affected by the}} actions of principal or agents. ^ The first chapter considers the problem of a principal who must allocate a good among a finite number of agents, each of whom values the good. Each agent has private information about the principal 2 ̆ 7 s payoff if he receives the good. There are no monetary transfers. The principal can <b>inspect</b> <b>agents</b> 2 ̆ 7 reports at a cost and punish them, but punishments are limited because verification is imperfect or information arrives only after the good has been allocated for a while. I characterize an optimal mechanism featuring two thresholds. Agents whose values are below the lower threshold and above the upper threshold are pooled, respectively. If the number of agents is small, then the pooling area at the top of value distribution disappears. If the number of agents is large, then the two pooling areas meet and the optimal mechanism can be implemented via a shortlisting procedure. The fact that the optimal mechanism depends on the number of agents implies that small and large organizations should behave differently. ^ The second chapter considers the problem of a principal who wishes to distribute an indivisible good to a population of budget-constrained agents. Both valuation and budget are an agent 2 ̆ 7 s private information. The principal can <b>inspect</b> an <b>agent</b> 2 ̆ 7 s budget through a costly verification process and punish an agent who makes a false statement. I characterize the direct surplus-maximizing mechanism. This direct mechanism can be implemented by a two-stage mechanism in which agents only report their budgets. Specifically, all agents report their budgets in the first stage. The principal then provides budget-dependent cash subsidies to agents and assigns the goods randomly (with uniform probability) at budget-dependent prices. In the second stage, a resale market opens, but is regulated with budget-dependent sales taxes. Agents who report low budgets receive more subsidies in their initial purchases (the first stage), face higher taxes in the resale market (the second stage) and are inspected randomly. This implementation exhibits some of the features of some welfare programs, such as Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s housing and development board. ^ The third chapter studies the design of ex-ante efficient mechanisms in situations where a single item is for sale, and agents have positively interdependent values and can covertly acquire information at a cost before participating in a mechanism. I find that when interdependency is low or the number of agents is large, the ex-post efficient mechanism is also ex-ante efficient. In cases of high interdependency or a small number of agents, ex-ante efficient mechanisms discourage agents from acquiring excessive information by introducing randomization to the ex-post efficient allocation rule in areas where the information 2 ̆ 7 s precision increases most rapidly. ...|$|R

40|$|Three {{aspects of}} the {{productivity}} of Kenya Government agricultural extension services in Western Province are examined: (1) {{the degree to which}} farmer contact extension agents are well versed in the technical information they are expected to convey; (2) the extent to which standard national cultural recommendations are being adapted to local ecological conditions; and (3) the amount of effort that junior staff are putting into their basic work of visiting farmers- Personnel policies and organizational strategies which would improve performance in each of these areas are discussed. Along with other lesser reforms, proposals are made {{for the creation of a}} mobile, national junior staff retraining service, for a rigorous system of <b>inspecting</b> extension <b>agent</b> work by an increased reliance on group extension methods, and for the removal of inter-cadre promotion bars so as to provide meaningful work incentives. It is suggested that the various reforms taken together might double the productivity of Kenya's agricultural extension workers...|$|R
40|$|In 1917, after {{scientific}} breakthroughs {{allowed for}} the early detection of bovine tuberculosis, the USDA began a campaign to eradicate the disease. <b>Agents</b> <b>inspected</b> nearly every cattle farm {{in the country and}} condemned roughly 4 million reactors to slaughter without full compensation. This article analyzes how the eradication program functioned, how incentives were aligned to ensure widespread participation without excessive moral hazard problems, and why the United States led most European nations in controlling the disease. The U. S. campaign was a spectacular success, reducing human suffering and death and yielding benefits in the farm sector alone that exceeded ten times the cost. ...|$|R
40|$|Weitzman's search model {{requires}} that, {{conditional on}} stopping, the agent only takes boxes which {{have already been}} inspected. We relax this assumption and allow the agent to take any uninspected box without inspecting its contents when stopping. Thus, each uninspected box is now a potential outside option. This introduces a new trade-off: every time the <b>agent</b> <b>inspects</b> a box, he loses {{the value of the}} option to take it without inspection. Nevertheless, we find that, under conditions common in the search and information acquisition literature, boxes are inspected following the same order as inWeitzman's rule; however, the stopping rule is different, and we characterize it. Moreover, we provide additional results that partially characterize the optimal policy when these conditions fail...|$|R

40|$|In LAN (Local Area Network) of {{universities}} or companies, the damage of viruses and worms from inside End-Hosts is serious problem. It is de-manded that all End-Users keep own End-Hosts secure. However, because some End-Users might {{not recognize the}} importance of security, it is diffi-cult to keep all End-Hosts secure. In this paper, a framework of End-User security management is proposed. In our proposal, firstly, when an End-Host is connected to LAN, a mobile <b>agent</b> <b>inspects</b> a security condition of the End-Host. Secondly, security applications such as Firewall and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) are installed into the End-Host dynamically as mobile agents. Finally, other mobile agents manage those security ap-plications. Network administrators can distribute security functions and security policies to all End-Hosts directly and dynamically by using mo-bile agents...|$|R
50|$|All {{pipelines}} in the United States have {{to adhere}} to the regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA sets regulations pertaining to the operation, construction, expansion of pipelines, which private pipeline companies have {{to adhere to}}, with federal and state inspectors enforcement. Calnev is an interstate pipeline crossing California and Nevada therefore it’s managed by PMHSA and <b>inspected</b> by federal <b>agents.</b> However, portions of pipeline exclusively within California or Nevada could be inspected by respective State agencies. In 2016, there were seven broad system-wide program inspections and two targeted investigations intended to scrutinize certain safety features in regards to the pipeline. According to PMHSA’s Pipeline Safety Stakeholder Communications data, Calnev has had one case {{in the last ten years}} in which PHMSA issued a Corrective Action Order in 2004 against Kinder Morgan in regards to a failure in Calnev Pipeline which released gasoline to its environment, an order that was marked closed in 2007. There was no proposed and collected penalty.|$|R
50|$|For {{international}} arrivals, {{the baggage}} reclaim {{area is a}} restricted area, after immigration control and before clearing customs, so that all baggage can be <b>inspected</b> by customs <b>agents,</b> but the passenger {{does not have to}} handle heavy baggage while moving through the passport booth. In the United States and Canada, and also in some airports in Asia, all arriving international passengers' baggage is claimed here and can be re-surrendered to the airline for connecting flights {{on the other side of}} customs (for connection from international to domestic flights in most countries, all passengers must claim their baggage). In most other countries passengers transferring to an onward flight do not need to collect their bags unless their airline does not offer to check their bags to their final destination. This is required in American and some Canadian airports because international terminals are not enclosed (the only exit being through customs) and often serve domestic flights. The same rule applies in the case of airports that have U.S. border preclearance facilities. This means that passengers continuing onto the U.S. from other cities must retrieve their checked baggage first, then re-check them after clearing U.S. Customs.|$|R
5000|$|While Kurdyukov was {{ambassador}} to Australia, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS) exploited {{an opportunity to}} target Soviet intelligence in a [...] "sting operation". During September 1960, Kay Marshall, an Englishwoman working as a civil servant in New Zealand, had reported approaches from Soviet agents. At the request of NZSIS, Marshall allowed Soviet agents {{to believe that she}} would cooperate, and moved in December 1960 to Australia, where she liaised with ASIO. For two years, Marshall's Soviet controller, Ivan Skripov (First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Canberra) assigned her small tasks, in order to gauge her suitability as an agent. Finally, in December 1962, Skripov instructed Marshall to take a package to a contact in Adelaide. The package, which was <b>inspected</b> by ASIO <b>agents,</b> was said to contain: a device used to compress data into short, high-speed signals, when attached to a radio transmitter and; coded transmission timetables for a Soviet radio station. While Marshall took the reassembled package to the rendezvous as requested, Skripov's contact did not attend. On 7 February 1963, while Kurdyukov was on sick leave in Moscow, the Australian government released photos of meetings between Skripov and Marshall, accused Skripov of being a spy and sent the Soviet embassy a note declaring Skripov persona non grata due to [...] "elaborate preparations for espionage"; he was given seven days to leave the country. The Australian government didn't divulge what secrets Skripov may have been seeking, but it was reported that workers at the Woomera missile range underwent interrogation. The Soviet authorities responded by stating that the material proved nothing and were produced to hinder the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Australia. Kurdyukov did not return to Canberra.|$|R
