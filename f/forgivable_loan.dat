As a condition of the two loans, the Mealhows were required make it a necessity for local farmers to grow popcorn. Fifteen growers had been contracted to grow popcorn for the company, which had expanded into the organic market. By the end of 2003, the company had 18 contracted popcorn farmers.|$|E

50|$|A <b>forgivable</b> <b>loan,</b> {{also called}} a soft second, {{is a form}} of loan in which its entirety, or a portion of it, can be forgiven or {{deferred}} {{for a period of time}} by the lender when certain conditions are met. It is more like a grant with conditions rather than a loan as in most cases the loan is forgiven if all the conditions are met. However if the conditions are not met the loan has to be repaid usually with interest. It can be seen as an incentive for the borrower to perform or achieve a goal set by the lender.|$|E
50|$|In June 2011, the City Council of Napa {{voted to}} grant a $1.5 million <b>forgivable</b> <b>loan</b> to help retire the $3.4 million debt {{remaining}} on the facility. Funds for the grant came from existiing redevelopment funds {{that had not been}} committed to other projects. The terms of the loan included several conditions that would benefit the city and its citizens by allowing the city to use the building for up to 24 days per year at cost and requiring the facility to be rented twice per year to nonprofit organizations at a discounted rate. By 2011, the facility was booking over 100 events per year with a goal of increasing this number to 200 events.|$|E
50|$|The Mealhows began {{growing the}} popcorn through an organic method that {{included}} farming {{the biology of}} the soil. The corn was grown {{without the use of}} pesticides. Shortly after the purchase, the Mealhows secured a $40,000 <b>forgivable</b> <b>loan.</b> The loan was secured with help by the Benton Development Group and the Marion Small Business Development Center, and was made through the Value Added Agricultural Products and Processes Financial Assistance Program (VAPPFAP), offered by the Iowa Department of Economic Development. The loan was used to convert a building on the Mealhow farm into an upgraded popcorn-processing facility. The Mealhows also planned to launch a company web site and increase its marketing efforts. Sales increased each month after the Mealhow purchase due to an expanded marketing effort, which was led by the Mealhows' son, Nate. As a result, the company increased to 320 acre to meet demand.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 2008, Schiff {{and other}} city leaders contended with local ramifications of the 2008-2012 global recession, which {{included}} spate of foreclosures in economically distressed neighborhoods. In April 2008, {{the city council}} approved a pilot mortgage assistance program called Minneapolis Advantage. The program, which passed the council 10-2, offered <b>forgivable</b> <b>loans</b> to homebuyers {{who were interested in}} properties on the same block as foreclosed or city-owned properties within targeted neighborhoods. Schiff argued that the initiative was not targeted enough to have the designed effect and voted against it, along with fellow councilmember Paul Ostrow.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} 2011 {{appointment}} of regent Wallace Hall, Jr., a college friend of Sandefer's, Powers {{became the focus}} of multiple investigations by Hall. Hall's interests as a regent centered largely on Powers's role as leader of its flagship campus in Austin, even though the University of Texas System includes fourteen institutions. Having probed accounting procedures in its capital campaign and a <b>forgivable</b> <b>loan</b> program administered by a private foundation in support of its law school faculty, Hall turned his attention to external influence on admissions at the University. A series of document requests revealed that powerful individuals often sought to obtain favoritism toward various applicants, and sometimes succeeded. In May 2014, a blog post reported that various regents had asked then UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa to fire Powers. Almost immediately, a grassroots campaign arose in his support. A Facebook group named [...] "I Stand With Bill Powers" [...] attracted nearly 10,000 members.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} year, two major policy {{initiatives}} {{have been introduced}} focusing on stimulating antibiotic development for human consumption. The European Investment Bank has announced {{the development of the}} Infectious Disease Financing Facility (IDFF) and the British government commissioned the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, led by Jim O’Neill. Each constitutes a major effort by the European community to address the evolving crisis of antimicrobial resistance. Though both have similar goals, the approaches are unique and worthy of consideration. This manuscript utilizes a previously published framework for evaluation of antibiotic incentive plans to clearly identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each proposal. The merits of each proposal are evaluated in how they satisfy four key objectives: 1) Improve the overall net present value (NPV) for new antibiotic projects; 2) Enable greater participation of Small to Medium Sized Enterprises (SME); 3) Encourage participation by large pharmaceutical companies; 4) Facilitate cooperation and synergy across the antibiotic market. The IDFF seeks to make <b>forgivable</b> <b>loans</b> to corporations with promising compounds, while the O’Neill group proposes a more comprehensive framework of early stage funding, along with the creation of a stable global market. Ultimately, the proposals may prove complementary and if implemented together may form a more comprehensive plan to address an impending global crisis. Substantial progress will only be made on these efforts if action is taken at an international level, therefore we recommend consideration of these efforts at the upcoming G 20 summit...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} comprehensively the three entities involved when state aid is distributed to enterprises in Finland, namely the applicant enterprises, the projects financed and the distributors of funds. It demonstrates how quantitative methods {{can be used}} to monitor and evaluate state aid to enterprises. In the study the distributor is the Ministry of Trade and Industry (KTM). The material is gathered from data found in state aid applications from enterprises located in industrially declining (Objective 2) areas in the prefectures of Varsinais-Suomi and Päijät-Häme during 1995 - 96. The study lists certain characteristics of the applicant enterprises, the projects financed and it measures the performance of different financing operations by KTM. Furthermore, it examines the factors which influence KTM in deciding whether to finance or not a state aid application by building logistic regression models. Results indicate that (a) there are no clear differences between enterprises which receive aid and those that do not and (b) each KTM office applies to some extent its own financing procedures. Recommendations include (1) standardization of selection methods, (2) on-going utilization of the databases, (3) creation of a flexible and targeted system of state aid where final beneficiaries are clearly defined, (4) creation a follow-up system to measure and evaluate the impact of the state aid, (5) imposing restrictions as to how often the same enterprises are to be granted aid, (6) an introduction of an alternative type of aid in the form of <b>forgivable</b> <b>loans.</b> Valuation, monitoring, business aid, EU structural financing, quantitative methods...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{evaluation}} study which examines the financing {{process through which}} Finnish enterprises apply and receive business subsidies from the central government.

40|$|The study {{attempts}} to apply William Niskanen's (1971) theory of budget maximising bureaucrats {{to the business}} subsidies policy implemented in Finland, {{by one of the}} major distributor of subsidies to firms, the ministry of Trade and Industry (KTM). The empirical analysis is based on records of 15 300 firms applying for aid through the KTM regional offices during 1995 - 1999 and on the budgeted appropriations given to the KTM between 1989 and 2000. In testing Niskanen's theory we examine whether its four assumptions are relevant and applicable {{within the context of the}} KTM?s business subsidies policy. First, information asymmetry is found to exist between the KTM and its sponsor (the ministry of Finance VM). Second, bilateral monopoly is also evident between the two parties. Third, the VM does not seem to play a passive role during the budget negotiations with the KTM, as Niskanen assumed. The fourth assumption - the budget maximising bureaucrat - is tested by examining (a) the strategies of the KTM bureaucrats in attempting to maximise their bureau's budget and (b) the success in their budget maximisation efforts. Looking at the budget maximisation strategies, our analysis shows that the bureaucrats? request for funds is not based on the previous year's appropriations, as initially hypothesised. However, we find strong evidence suggesting that bureaucrats attempt to get rid of unallocated funds before year's end in order to avoid receiving less the following years. Finally, our logistic regression analysis indicates that bureaucrats pursue a "creaming" policy where only firms that have better chances of success, receive more subsidies. That way, they can reduce the chances of the policy not achieving its goals, thus avoid the risk of having later deductions in the program's budget. In testing the success of the bureaucrats? budget maximisation efforts, we note that, despite that subsidy appropriations have fluctuated during the examined period, administrative expenses (including salaries) have stayed flat or grown to some degree. Although this is not a causal finding, it suggests that bureaucrats have succeeded in - at least - safeguarding the appropriations which are of major importance to them. Among others, the study recommends that direct subsidies to firms should be reduced further, and be substituted by advanced advisory services, subsidised <b>loans</b> and <b>forgivable</b> <b>loans.</b> Business subsidies, bureaucratic behaviour, budget maximisation...|$|R
