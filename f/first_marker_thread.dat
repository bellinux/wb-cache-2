50|$|The marker's barrel {{directs the}} paintball and {{controls}} {{the release of}} the gas pocket behind it. Several different bore sizes are made, to fit different sizes of paintball, and there are many lengths and styles. Most modern paintball markers have barrels that screw into the front receiver. Older types slide the barrel on and screw it in place. Barrel threading must be matched to that of the <b>marker.</b> Common <b>threads</b> are: Angel, Autococker, Impulse/Ion, Shocker, Spyder, A-5, and 98 Custom.|$|R

40|$|A {{probe system}} for {{monitoring}} chemical activity {{of a target}} chemical in an environment has <b>first</b> and second <b>marker</b> compounds each bonded to a common substrate to keep the respective markers in physical proximity. The <b>first</b> <b>marker</b> is a chemical that has a maximum emission intensity at a first wavelength, and it is chemically shielded from the environment being studied. The second marker is a chemical that, when in a first state, has a maximum emission intensity at a second wavelength different from the first wavelength and which, in a second state, {{does not have a}} maximum emission intensity at the second wavelength. The second marker is convertible between said states through chemical reaction with the target chemical. The common substrate is a carrier particle, the <b>first</b> <b>marker</b> being impregnated within the carrier particle and the second marker being chemically bonded to the exterior surface of the carrier particle. The carrier particle may be a polymeric material, such as polystyrene, especially formed into a microsphere. The second marker may be in the second state prior to chemical reaction with the target chemical and is converted to the first state after chemical reaction with the target chemical, or it may be in the first state prior to chemical reaction with the target chemical, convertible to the second state by the chemical reaction with the target chemical.
