5000|$|The Barcarolle in <b>F</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>major,</b> Op. 60 is a {{piece for}} solo piano by Frédéric Chopin, {{composed}} between autumn of 1845 and summer 1846 and three years before his death. Based on the barcarolle rhythm and mood, it features a sweepingly romantic and slightly wistful tone. Many of the technical figures for the right hand are thirds and sixths, while the left features very long reaches over an octave.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{is noted}} for its {{repeated}} long section which starts in C Major, then goes up a whole tone to D Major, then up a whole tone again in E Major, and in the Coda, finally, to <b>F</b> <b>Sharp</b> <b>Major,</b> before the fade, with the words: [...] "These Eyes/ Are Crying./ These eyes {{have seen a lot}} of love but they're never gonna see another love like I had with you".|$|E
5000|$|A {{programme}} {{note for}} the first performance, unsigned, but thought to be by the composer, reads: Constructed in the classical form of the overture, the piece opens with an introduction, in which the theme of Scheherezade is given first by an oboe, {{and then by the}} horns and trumpets. Then comes {{the main part of the}} overture, consisting of:*Part 1: Initial motif, in B minor. Developments - episodic theme (muted trumpets) bringing in the second motif - in <b>F</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>major</b> - inspired by a Persian melody - conclusion of Part 1.*Part 2: Development of four themes. Pedal based on the original motif, expanded.*Part 3: Return of the first and second motifs heard simultaneously. Return of the introduction, serving as a coda.|$|E

5000|$|The song {{begins in}} the key of C major and that key is also {{prominent}} at the end. [...] The keys of E minor and G major are also emphasized throughout the song. [...] Since these keys are related to C major, they help reinforce the prominence of C major in the song. [...] G major is also emphasized {{through the use of}} these keys and the related key of B minor. [...] Tense lyrics about paying a price to be able to [...] "sing like a bird" [...] and a surprising shift to the unrelated key of <b>F</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>major</b> increase the tension of the bridge, which leads into Garth Hudsons organ solo. Minturn praises Hudsons sixteen bar solo for using rhythm, pace, rest and pitch to [...] "work together to hold back, to balance or to tip forward at just the right time." [...] Helm regarded the song as a [...] "showpiece" [...] for lead singer and bassist Rick Danko particularly in the use of a fretless bass, which according to Helm [...] "gave the rhythm section a different feel." ...|$|E
