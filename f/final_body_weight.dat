In the ad libitum treatment, {{there was no difference}} in initial (p 3 ̆c 0. 49) or <b>final</b> <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 65) but the low residual feed intake line consumed 9...|$|R
40|$|Three- to five-day old hatchery-reared megalops (4. 0 to 6. 4 mg <b>body</b> <b>weight)</b> {{of the mud}} crab, Scylla serrata, were cultured to the {{juvenile}} stage in 20 m 2 net cages installed in brackishwater nursery ponds. To establish a suitable stocking density, megalops were stocked at 10, 20, and 30 indÂ·m - 2 in net cages. Treatments were replicated three times over time. After 30 days of culture, mean survival of juveniles ranged from 48. 3 to 53. 3 % and did not vary significantly (P > 0. 05) among the three stocking densities. Similarly, the mean <b>final</b> <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> of juveniles ranging from 2. 91 to 3. 40 g and mass weights 458. 9 to 1066 g did not significantly differ among stocking densities. These results show that stocking of crab megalops directly in net cages in a brackishwater pond is feasible {{at any of the}} stocking densities tested...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{post-weaning}} management system and calf {{age at weaning}} on growing and finishing performance was evaluated. During the growing phase, cattle in the fast-track system had improved intake, gain, and feed conversion. Although initial finishing weight was similar between systems, slow-track cattle had greater intake, gain, <b>final</b> <b>body</b> <b>weight,</b> and carcass weight. While the impact of age at weaning was negligible, the improvement in finishing performance for slow-track cattle demonstrates the value of different management systems...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} additions {{of dietary}} lysine to restore yield losses from feed restriction to reduce ascites. Feed restriction {{was used to}} limit daily feed intake of the birds to 75 % of the metabolizable energy required for normal growth, based on the ad libitum intake of the birds. Grower and finisher diets contained normal lysine (NL) or high lysine (HL). <b>Final</b> <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> of feed-restricted birds was 96 % of birds fed ad libitum, indicating that “catch-up ” growth was not sufficient to equalize the body weights by 56 d of age between birds on feed restriction and those fed ad libitum. Feed-restricted birds were fatter than those birds fed ad libitum. HL reduced the deficit in the percentage pectoralis minor muscle yield compared with birds fed NL diets, whereas the percentage yield of pectoralis major muscle remained unaffected by dietary lysine. Feed restriction reduced the total ascitic mortality in the cool and control environments. It was concluded that increased lysine {{did not have any}} beneficial effect on the <b>final</b> <b>body</b> <b>weight,</b> percentage carcass yield, or any of the carcass characteristics, with the exception of pectoralis minor muscle yield, which was increased when birds were fed HL...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} fructose consumption on the antioxidant capacity in heart and kidney, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and evaluation of these variables after its removal. Methods: Male Wistar rats (n[*]=[*] 36) were divided into control group (n[*]=[*] 12) : standard chow[*]+[*]water or F group: standard chow[*]+[*]fructose in drinking water (30 %) for 15 [*]weeks. After, F group was divided to continue receiving standard chow[*]+[*]fructose in drinking water (30 %) (n[*]=[*] 12) or standard chow[*]+[*]water (Ex group, n[*]=[*] 12) for 9 [*]weeks. Water, chow and caloric diaries intake, <b>final</b> <b>body</b> <b>weight,</b> adiposity index, plasma glucose and triacylglycerol, systolic blood pressure, and cardiac and renal hydrophilic antioxidant capacity were analyzed. Results: Control and Ex groups consumed less chow and water compared to F group. Caloric intake was higher in control group. There {{was no difference in}} <b>final</b> <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> and adiposity index. Systolic blood pressure and cardiac and renal hydrophilic antioxidant capacity were worst in F group. Conclusion: Prolonged exposure to fructose induces oxidative stress, systolic blood pressure, and increase in triacylglycerol. When stopped fructose consumption, Ex group presented improvement in these variables, suggesting the toxicity effect of fructose when consumed in high amounts and prolonged exposure...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the correlation between performance and feeding behavior of feedlot castrated Santa Inês lambs fed without roughage diet, weighing 20 ± 1, 8 kg and four months of age (± 0, 34). A completely randomized design was adopted. Correlations were obtained by Pearson’s linear correlation analysis and the t test, and processed on SAS software (version 9. 2). The variables number of rumination chews per cud, number of cuds ruminated per day, speed of each chew, and number of rumination cuds per day were positively correlated with the variation in <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> (p < 0. 05). For number of cuds ruminated per day, a positive correlation was found with the variations in <b>body</b> <b>weight.</b> Initial and <b>final</b> <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> were positively correlated with the feed and rumination efficiencies of the lambs feeding behavior and with the time per period spent feeding and performing other activities. Feeding time had a positive correlation with variation in <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> per day and the relative variation in <b>body</b> <b>weight.</b> Rumination {{was positively correlated with}} performance variables. The correlations show that there is influence between eating behavior and performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} of replacing 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % dietary maize with yam peel meal (YPM) on performance characteristics of pullet starter and grower chicks. Consequently, five experimental diets were fed to 150 Anak pullet chicks from day-old to point-of-lay to cover the starter phase (1 to 9 weeks of age) and the grower phase (10 to 20 weeks of age). The results of the pullet starter trial indicated that <b>final</b> <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> (g/bird) were in the order of 479. 2, 404. 8, 469. 2, 442. 5 and 350. 0 for 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % respectively. Feed intake values (g/bird) were in the order of 3184, 3281, 2953, 3235 and 3251. Feed cost per bird (N) resulted in values of 215. 3, 197. 3, 155. 4, 146. 0 and 122. 3. Average daily water intake values (ml/bird/day) were 72. 6, 75. 0, 69. 0, 71. 2 and 71. 9. Similarly, the results of the trial with pullet growers indicated <b>final</b> <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> (g/bird) of 1336, 1260, 1255, 1260 and 883. Total feed intake (g/bird) resulted in values of 4728, 4964, 4334, 4038 and 3936. Feed cost per bird (N) decreased linearly with increasing levels of dietary YPM and resulted in values of 279. 55, 261. 50, 200. 37, 160. 63 and 131. 17. Average daily water intake (ml/bird/day) was in the order of 180. 6, 172. 2, 191. 0, 231. 9 and 218. 0. From the results of the studies it can be concluded that YPM can substitute up to 75 % of maize in the diets of pullet starter and grower chicks without adverse effects on performance and at reduced cost of production...|$|R
