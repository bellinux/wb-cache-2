40|$|The fitness {{of record}} {{bases in the}} patient's mouth affects the {{accuracy}} of jaw relation records and ultimately the occlusion. In this study the effect of three curing methods, polishing, and variation in cast contour on the adaptability of sprinkled on record bases was determined. Further, the results were compared to record bases fabricated by the confined dough technique. Thirty record bases were fabricated using the same aautopolymerizing resin. The samples were divided into six groups. Each group contains five samples. Adaptation was evaluated at six different locations with a measuring microscope equipped with a <b>filar</b> <b>unit</b> measuring eyepiece. The accuracy of adaptation under the various testing conditions was in the following decreasing order; (1) Record bases cured in a monomer atmosphere. (2) Bench cured record bases prepared on casts with shallow vestibule. (3) Record bases cured under water and air pressure. (4) Record bases cured in a denture flask. (5) Bench cured record bases prepared on casts with normal vestibule. (6) Polished bench cured record bases. King Saud Universit...|$|E
