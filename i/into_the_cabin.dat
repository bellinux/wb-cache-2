5|$|Carpender was not inflexible, {{and reached}} a {{compromise}} with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in high speed transports (APDs). Herring was in Dobodura, lunching with Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, {{when he heard}} this news. He decided to fly to Milne Bay {{to discuss the matter}} of resupply in general with Barbey. On 28 September, Herring and two of his staff officers, Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth, boarded a U.S. Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bomber at Dobodura. As the plane was about to take off, the undercarriage collapsed and the plane ploughed into the Marston Mat runway. A propeller shattered, splinters ripped through the fuselage <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> and Sutherland, who was sitting in the navigator's compartment next to Herring, was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly. The crew, Herring and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed. The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled. Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day, with a fly past by B-25s. When next he flew, Herring once again took a B-25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot.|$|E
5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty {{to chop up}} {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves {{to find a way}} back to town. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries {{to figure out what to}} do, both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When he reaches for her necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the snakes}} attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally {{releases}} the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, {{who have made}} their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, the dealer is bitten by one of his snakes and Harris withholds the antivenom if he does not give them details. The dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane. Price injects antivenom to the injured dealer and he commandeers the dealer's supply of antivenom for the plane's victims based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.|$|E
6000|$|Those [...] "green seas" [...] fell at last {{so heavily}} on the {{skylights}} that all the glass was driven in, and the water poured down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins,</b> producing dire consternation {{in the minds of}} those below, who thought that the vessel was sinking.|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{depends upon}} circumstances," [...] said Mr. Loudon. [...] "If {{the boys are}} careful to {{disconnect}} the instruments and the wires when they leave <b>the</b> <b>cabins,</b> {{there is no more}} danger than there would be in a brass clock. But if they leave the wires attached to the instruments, lightning might be attracted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> during a thunder-storm, and Aunt Judy might find the 'merchines' quite as dangerous as a horse-pistol." ...|$|R
25|$|Taking {{suitcases}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> as in trains, was studied, but necessitated a 3m fuselage extension with a 350-seat capacity. To avoid this, {{passengers were}} to deposit their luggage in underfloor compartments {{as they entered}} the airliner.|$|E
25|$|When {{used for}} cabin pressurization, the bleed {{air from the}} engine must first be cooled (as it exits the {{compressor}} stage at temperatures as high as 250°C) by passing it through an air-to-air heat exchanger cooled by cold outside air. It is then fed to an air cycle machine unit that regulates the temperature and flow of air <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> keeping the environment comfortable.|$|E
25|$|During {{the crash}} {{two of the}} {{inflatable}} chutes deployed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> The first chute, which blocked the forward right exit, nearly suffocated a flight attendant and was deflated by a pilot with a fire axe from the cockpit. The second chute expanded {{toward the center of}} the aircraft near the fire. It trapped a second flight attendant until a co-pilot deflated it with a dinner knife.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{following}} the raids, no hand luggage was allowed except for essentials such as travel documents and wallets. Limited hand baggage was reintroduced at some smaller airports on 14 August, {{but was not}} permitted at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports until 15 August. Some restrictions were relaxed in September 2006, and on 6 November 2006 restrictions were again relaxed to allow limited volumes of liquids to be carried <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ALF 502 has {{experienced}} multiple issues. Its internal electronics could overheat, triggering an automatic shutdown of an engine with no option for inflight restart, and certain rare atmospheric conditions {{could cause a}} loss of engine thrust due to internal icing. Additionally, the BAe 146 experienced some issues with its bleed air and cabin pressurization systems, leading {{to a number of}} fume events where irritant fumes were introduced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> via the pressurizing system.|$|E
25|$|On 22 August 1985 – British Airtours Flight 28M – {{an engine}} failed during {{take-off}} from runway 24, the fire spreading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> resulting in 55 fatalities (mostly from smoke inhalation) aboard the Boeing 737–236 Advanced G-BGJL. The uncontained engine failure was later traced to an incorrectly repaired combustor causing the turbine disc to shatter and puncture the wing fuel tanks. As a result, fire resistance and evacuation procedures were improved.|$|E
5000|$|The gondola closed {{following}} the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and was reopened in March 2013 by NZ Prime Minister John Key. In February 2016, the gondola broke down with passengers trapped in <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> {{for two hours}} without communication from the operator. The managing director's comment that the incident was [...] "no big deal" [...] caused upset by those affected. Within days, the company vowed to install a speaker system <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> {{at a cost of}} up to NZ$50,000 so that communication to stuck passengers became possible.|$|R
50|$|It had an {{electrically}} actuated tricycle undercarriage, {{the main}} wheels retracting inwards <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wings. <b>The</b> <b>cabin</b> had seats {{for four or}} five, two at the front and a bench seat behind. In a proposed air ambulance configuration, the Antilope would have carried two stretchers and a medic. Access to <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> was via a large rear hinged door on the starboard side.|$|R

25|$|Recovering {{behind the}} cabin {{for only a}} few moments, Major Wilkinson soon {{returned}} outside after his leg was bandaged and began encouraging the young troopers. He was soon shot again, this time through the abdomen, and was carried back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> where he died an hour later. Another man under his command, Sergeant William Butler, was also killed as he went off to inform General Bacon of Major Wilkinson's mortal wound. Gunfire from the Pillagers became less frequent after this point; however, some would take occasional shots {{throughout the rest of the}} day.|$|E
25|$|There's {{no way he}} didn't see her, {{since she}} was {{practically}} looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> At one stage, he turned around toward the building. The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E
25|$|The other {{settlers}} rushed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> as the raiding warriors {{surrounded the}} house. They {{shut the door}} and aimed their weapons through cracks in the walls. Two of the men stood near the doorway with their weapons, and Hodges' weapon came into contact with Girty's chest causing him, and his group, to retreat into the woods. Young Dimmick, anxious to the point of begging to leave, was then dispatched to Hennepin by horseback for help. The men at the cabin expected Dimmick to be shot as soon as he rode off, but he crossed the open prairie unscathed. Dimmick made the 16 mile (25.7km) journey and arrived in Hennepin to report the attack.|$|E

25|$|The next {{model to}} appear was the Model 200C in 1979; this version {{had a large}} cargo door on the LH side of the rear {{fuselage}} with an airstair door similar to the Model 200's door built into it. The door opening was 4ft 4 in (1.33 m) high and 4ft 4 in (1.33 m) wide, allowing a large range of items to be loaded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> The Model 200C found favour with many operators who fitted them out internally as Air Ambulances. The 200C was built from scratch {{rather than as a}} modification of the Model 200. The Model A200C military version was developed concurrently. In 1981, a Model 200C (c/no. BL-24) was modified as the Model 200CT, fitted with the same wingtip fuel tanks as installed on Model 200Ts; there was only one 200CT, but it led to other aircraft after an updated version of the Model 200 entered production.|$|E
25|$|In a {{passenger}} configuration, the pressurised cabin of the TBM is typically fitted with highly finished interiors, often featuring luxury {{materials such as}} high quality leathers and wood veneers. The seats are certified for their crashworthiness for up to 20 G. From the TBM 850 onwards, a combined air conditioner/environmental control system was integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> being simpler and requiring less adjustment than the prior arrangement. At cruise altitudes, the cabin of the TBM 900 is noticeably quieter that its predecessors; the reduction {{is due to the}} adoption of a new five-bladed propeller and the reduction of vibration levels via greater isolation between the engine and the airframe. Later built models are equipped with winglets, which were developed by SOCATA primarily to reduce drag when flown at high angles of attack, such as during takeoffs, as well as to enhance the aircraft's aesthetics. The TBM 900 saw the adoption of a new five-bladed propeller, specially optimised by Hartzell based upon airflow simulations conducted of the TBM's forward section. According to SOCATA, Hartzell's selection over a similar advanced counterpart from MT-Propeller was made due to the former raising the cruise speed by around 3 to 5 kts.|$|E
25|$|The United States Air Corps {{wanted the}} {{aircraft}} to perform high altitude research and {{to test the}} feasibility of a pressurized cabin. The Corps contracted with Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to produce the aircraft at a total cost of $112,197. The requirements called for an aircraft capable of flying at no less than 25,000ft (7,620m) and having an endurance of ten hours {{with at least two}} hours above 25,000ft (7,620m). Major Carl Greene and John Younger, both structures experts who worked for the Air Corps Engineering Division at Wright Field in Ohio were responsible for the design of the pressurized cabin structure. Greene and Younger worked with Lockheed to modify a Model 10 Electra with a new fuselage consisting of a circular cross-section that was able to withstand up to a 10psi differential. New, smaller windows were used to prevent a possible blowout while operating at high pressure differentials. The cabin pressurization was provided by bleeding air from the engines' turbo supercharger, the compressor outlet fed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> and was controlled by the flight engineer. This system was able to maintain a cabin altitude of 12,000ft (3,658m) while flying at 30,000ft (9,144m). The fuselage was divided into two compartments, a forward pressurized compartment, and an aft unpressurized compartment. The forward compartment housed two pilots, a flight engineer, and up to two passengers. The aft compartment provided accommodation for one passenger and could be used only at low altitudes since it lacked pressurization.|$|E
60|$|Mademoiselle Viefville, with a {{decision}} and intelligence that rendered her of great use in moments of need hastened to offer her services to the wounded man, while Eve, attended by Ann Sidley, ascended the ship {{and made her way}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins,</b> in <b>the</b> best manner the leaning position of the vessel allowed.

500|$|Grissom {{was one of}} {{the smaller}} astronauts, and he worked very closely with the {{engineers}} and technicians from McDonnell Aircraft who built the Gemini spacecraft. The first three spacecraft were built around him and the design was humorously referred to as [...] "the Gusmobile". However, by July 1963 NASA discovered 14 out of the 16 astronauts could not fit themselves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> and later cockpits were modified. During this time Grissom invented the multi-axis translation thruster controller used to push the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft in linear directions for rendezvous and docking.|$|E
500|$|On March 1, {{a second}} relief party arrived at Truckee Lake. [...] These rescuers were mostly {{experienced}} mountaineers who accompanied {{the return of}} Reed and McCutchen. [...] Reed was reunited with his daughter Patty and his weakened son Tommy. An inspection of the Breen cabin found its occupants relatively well, but the Murphy cabin, according to author George Stewart, [...] "passed the limits of description and almost of imagination". Levinah Murphy was caring for her eight-year-old son Simon and the two young children of William Eddy and Foster. She had deteriorated mentally and was nearly blind.
