2500|$|In {{his memoir}} Songs I <b>Heard</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> Sing, Charlton H. Lyons, Jr., of Shreveport recalls his father's {{recollection}} of the tranquil life in Melville: ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{turn the}} pages, {{and she was}} some time silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "What we've been {{speaking}} of--his hair. I've <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> say, {{when she first}} married him--just shake up my pillow a bit, will you, Mat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, doctor, {{not as far}} as I know. I've always <b>'eard</b> that <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> {{uncle was}} very eccentric, but that wouldn't account for this, because we wasn't related before we married.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... --I'm the queerest {{young fellow}} that ever you <b>heard.</b> [...] <b>My</b> <b>mother's</b> a jew, <b>my</b> father's a bird. [...] With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree. [...] So here's to disciples and Calvary.|$|R
6000|$|... "Since I saw you I've heard {{everything}} about the past. I won't tell it you--I think you knew when we met at June's. She says you did. If you did, Fleur, {{you ought to have}} told me. I expect you only heard your father's side of it. I have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's.</b> It's dreadful. Now that she's so sad I can't do anything to hurt her more. Of course, I long for you all day, but I don't believe now that we shall ever come together--there's something too strong pulling us apart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have often}} <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> speak of Marion's good qualities, {{but not much}} of her loveliness. To me her great charm is her voice. She speaks musically." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know there}} isn't, because I <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> asking about it," [...] added Ben. [...] "But I {{think we ought}} to get him down to the bungalows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{speak of}} it far too often to forget it,' said Berenger, glowing again for her who could speak of that {{occasion}} without a blush.|$|E
6000|$|RICHARD. The {{only man}} I have {{any right to}} kill, Mrs. Anderson. Don't be concerned: no woman will lose her lover through my death. (Smiling) Bless you, nobody cares for me. Have you <b>heard</b> that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is dead? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The governor. He has <b>heard</b> from <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{exactly what}} the doctor said, and {{declares}} that he won't allow it. He means to see the doctor himself before you stir. And {{he wants to see}} you also. I am to tell you he'll come to you directly after breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come now, Pax, don't become poetical, it isn't your forte; {{but listen}} while I talk of matters more important. You've {{sometimes}} <b>heard</b> me mention <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> haven't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{less the}} family {{interfered}} the better," [...] said Lord Marney; [...] "and for my part, I {{was very much}} alarmed when I <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had gone down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{beautiful}} Lady Alice," [...] replied Clayton, [...] "of whose many {{virtues and}} remarkable personal charms I often have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and father speak. Poor woman," [...] he murmured sadly.|$|E
60|$|They {{were silent}} for some time. After a while, a rather long while, she came upstairs and found mother—and {{at the end}} of some minutes I <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> go to him.|$|E
6000|$|P.S. I {{dare say}} you have <b>heard</b> that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> has gone to [...] make a long stay with a sister at Torquay, and I have let [...] our Cropstone Wood house at quite a nice profit. I am [...] staying {{for a few weeks}} with Lady Powers, who was at school [...] with me.|$|R
50|$|Elizabeth Danvers, his mother, an Italian, prodigeous {{parts for}} a Woman. I have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> father’s <b>mother</b> {{say that she}} had Chaucer at her fingers' ends. A great Politician; great Witt and spirit, but revengeful: knew how to manage her estate {{as well as any}} man; {{understood}} Jewels as well as any Jeweller. Very Beautiful, but only short-sighted. To obtain Pardons for her Sonnes she maryed Sir Edmund Carey, cosen-german to Queen Elizabeth, but kept him to hard meate.|$|R
6000|$|... "She neither saw nor <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> madness. No, <b>mother,</b> Lenore's {{heart has}} been going from me for months past, and she is glad of this plea for release, believing me unworthy. Oh! that stern face of hers! set like a head of Justice with not a shade of pity--so beautiful-- so terrible! It will never cease to haunt me." ...|$|R
6000|$|The general's face {{shone with}} {{pleasure}} but a wistful cadence {{was in his}} voice. [...] "Your tunes carry {{me back to my}} boyhood," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> sing some of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Every {{summer day}} that dawned held Claremore as a possibility. And such was my {{capacity}} for joy that my appetite would depart completely when I <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> say, questioningly and with proper wifely respect-- ...|$|E
60|$|One {{night as}} I lay buried in deep sleep {{close to the}} garret eaves I <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> call me--and {{something}} in her voice pierced me, roused me. A poignant note of alarm was in it.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR CHARLES, - I {{have got}} one {{delightful}} letter from you, and <b>heard</b> from <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> of your kindness {{in going to}} see her. Thank you for that: you can in no way more touch and serve me. [...] . Ay, ay, it is sad to sell 17; sad and fine were the old days: when I was away in Apemama, I wrote two copies of verse about Edinburgh and the past, so ink black, so golden bright. I will send them, if I can find them, for they will say something to you, and indeed one is more than half addressed to you. This is it - ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'In that case, I've just <b>heard</b> from <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{that she}} would like {{me to take a}} tutorship at Lord Exmoor's,' Ernest answered. 'Lynmouth, their eldest son, was my junior at school by six or seven years, and now he's going to prepare for Christ Church. I don't quite know whether it's a right place for me to accept or not; but I shall ask Max Schurz about it, if I don't get Pembroke. I always take Herr Max's advice in all {{questions}} of conscience, for I'm quite sure whatever he approves of is the thing one ought to do for the greatest good of humanity.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it's tough. You see, Dare, I couldn't keep Reddie here. Heaven knows I tried, but he wouldn't stay.... I'm {{afraid he}} <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> complaining. Say, Dare, suppose I have {{somebody}} drive me {{in town to}} see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Methinks, {{a moment}} gone, [...] I <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> pray! [...] I heard, sir knight, the prayer for me [...] Wherein she passed away; [...] And I know the heavens are leaning down [...] To hear what I shall say." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{played there}} were no deeper seas, [...] Nor any wider plains than these, [...] Nor other kings than me. [...] At last I <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> call [...] Out from the house at evenfall, [...] To call me home to tea.|$|E
6000|$|I often {{saw that}} tray, after I was the innocently smiling cause (or more likely {{screeching}} one) of the doctor's standing {{it up on}} a table against the wall in his consulting-room. Whenever my own father and mother were {{in that part of}} the country, I used to put my head (I have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> own <b>mother</b> say it was flaxen curls at that time, though you wouldn't know an old hearth-broom from it now till you come to the handle, and found it wasn't me) in at the doctor's door, and the doctor was always glad to see me, and said, [...] "Aha, my brother practitioner! Come in, little M.D. How are your inclinations as to sixpence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Prut!" [...] said she, [...] "and is that so! Why, I {{thought that}} thou wert a great tall fellow at least, and here thou art {{a little boy}} no older than Carl Max, the gooseherd." [...] Then, after a little pause--"My name is Pauline, and my father is the Baron. I <b>heard</b> him tell <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> all about thee, and so I wanted {{to come here and}} see thee myself: Art thou sick?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> {{father and}} <b>mother</b> talk about it,' said Agathe, gaining courage. 'He {{said he knew}} nothing of great people, and would give nobody up to the Catholics, but as to Maitre Isaac, he should {{let him know that}} the Catholic army were coming, {{and that it would be}} the better for us if we had no pastor within our walls; and that there was a cry that his daughter's lemon cakes were made by the lady that was lost.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Almayer, vivaciously, [...] "you cannot {{imagine what}} is before you. I myself {{have not been}} to Europe, but I have <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> talk so often that I seem to know all about it. We shall live a--a glorious life. You shall see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Mrs. Light {{is a great}} gossip, Mordaunt, {{and it may be}} {{questioned}} if she know her own meaning half the time. All the Bayards we know are the family at the Hickories; and with them, you have doubtless <b>heard,</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> has long been intimate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Elizabeth-Jane firmly, in her revulsion of feeling. [...] "He {{knew your}} disposition--you always were so trusting, father; I've <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> say so {{hundreds}} of times--and {{he did it}} to wrong you. After weaning me from you these five years by saying he was my father, {{he should not have}} done this." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{supervisor}} {{stood up}} straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson; and {{you should have seen}} how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest. When they <b>heard</b> how <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> went back to the inn, Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried [...] "Bravo!" [...] and broke his long pipe against the grate. Long before it was done, Mr. Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire's name) had got up from his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to hear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll.|$|R
5000|$|The flood it took <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> it took <b>my</b> brother too I thought I <b>heard</b> <b>my</b> father cry as I watched <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> go ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Save {{me from my}} friends, {{if those}} old {{croakers}} were Old Honesty's friends. I call your father so, for every one used to. Why did they let him go in his old age on the town? Why, China Aster, I've often <b>heard</b> from <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> the chronicler, that those two old fellows, with Old Conscience--as the boys called the crabbed old quaker, that's dead now--they three {{used to go to}} the poor-house when your father was there, and get round his bed, and talk to him for all the world as Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar did to poor old pauper Job. Yes, Job's comforters were Old Plain Talk, and Old Prudence, and Old Conscience, to your poor old father. Friends? I should like to know who you call foes? With their everlasting croaking and reproaching they tormented poor Old Honesty, your father, to death.' ...|$|R
