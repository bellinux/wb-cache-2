40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Naval Security Group (NSG) High Frequency Direction Finding (HFDF) sites use large circularly disposed antenna arrays (CDAA) with moderate to high gain beams. Omnidirectional coverage is presently obtained by combing 8 to 120 {{elements of the}} CDAA. Recent measurements of site performance reveal that most HFDF sites suffer from high noise levels. Much of the noise is generated in the RF distribution system. this noise contaminates the CDAA Omni signals, greatly reducing their effectiveness. One proposed {{solution to the problem}} is to use semi-remotely located broadband conical monopole (CM) which does not connect through the noisy RF distribution system. A proof-of-performance comparing the CM and CDAA is commencing at NSG. In this thesis, the performance of the model 2012 AA Conical Monopole Antenna is studied in the presence of finite ground using the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC- 3). <b>Ground</b> <b>constants</b> used in this study were obtained for two locations where the CM are installed: Northwest, VA and Winter Harbor, ME. The performance of the combined antenna/ground system was simulated over a frequency range of 2 to 30 MHz (FM), for various <b>ground</b> <b>constants,</b> with particular emphasis on the elevation plane radiation patterns. The study concludes that the CM operates effectively in the frequency range of interest with some exceptions. These occur at frequencies where there is a probable transitional range where the mode of operation if the antenna is transferred from that of an inverted cone to that of a broad monopole. Finally, this study confirms that in order for an antenna/ground model to provide a representative and effective simulation, the <b>ground</b> <b>constants</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} antenna should be carefully measured and averaged over an adequate number of samples.

A simple method to determine the ground parameters (conductivity and relative dielectric constant) for any radio frequency is outlined here. The method has been verified over the 2 – 30 -MHz frequency range but should be applicable up to several GHz. First, a low cost, commercial soil moisture meter using time domain reflectometry techniques is {{used to determine the}} soil moisture percentage. Then previously published universal soil models implemented on a programmable calculator or a PC are used to calculate the required constants at the frequency of interest according to the measured moisture percentage. The results obtained by this method compare favourably with those obtained by the input impedance of a low horizontal dipole technique. The received signal strength of a ground wave, HF transmission also compares favourably with that predicted by GRWave using <b>ground</b> <b>constants</b> calculated by the soil moisture technique. This method offers significant advantages in terms of simplicity, speed and cost when compared with current techniques. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Propagation in land mobile {{services}} including cellular {{is affected}} {{in varying degrees}} by topography, vegetation, man made structures, <b>ground</b> <b>constants,</b> the troposphere and the ionosphere. Also propagation of energy is strongly influenced by several factors including the natural and artificial relief, propagation frequency, antenna heights and others. The mobile radio signal varies in time and with spatial displacement. Even in the static case where the transmitter and receiver are fixed, the channel can be dynamic, since scatterers and reflectors {{are likely to be}} in motion. Thus multi path arises from the fact that through reflection, diffraction and scattering radio waves can travel from a transmitter to a receiver by many paths. Hence a precise estimation of signal characteristics in this environment constitutes a hard task. The thesis describes exercises in the estimation of the characteristics of cellular mobile signals operating in 900 MHz band through the real measurements obtained in different environments in Sri Lanka and the results of these exercises. Even though similar researches have been conducted in places like Europe, North America and Japan to derive empirical formulae such as Okomura- Hata Model, ITU-Rp. 529, COST 231, no study has been done as yet to check the suitability of these models to the Sri Lankan environmen...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a <b>constant</b> and <b>grounded</b> {{capacitor}} {{model for}} MOS transistor is proposed for circuit simulation and timing simulation. The model, {{based on the}} well known one by Hodges and Jackson, accounts {{for most of the}} physical and processing parameters that influence the transient times. This model takes the advantage of the fully complementary MOS technology which is widely used in today's industry for VLSI circuits. In the model, all the energy storage effects of a MOSFET are first represented by equivalent constant terminal capacitances including constant floating ones. Furthermore, each of these floating capacitances is replaced by two <b>constant</b> <b>grounded</b> ones, replacing the two terminals of the original floating one. The model with floating capacitors is much more accurate but is better suited for circuit simulation than for timing simulation. The largest error in the model with <b>constant</b> <b>grounded</b> capacitances results from the feed-forward effect. The methods to overcome this effect, and the conditions under which it is significant, are discussed. The experiments show that this new <b>constant</b> <b>grounded</b> capacitance model can get much more accurate results than the one by Hodges and Jackson.
