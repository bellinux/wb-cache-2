40|$|Poppet valve is a {{well-known}} valve and used in many industrial applications. To increase {{the efficiency of the}} poppet valve, the project had been carried out to study the flow forces acting on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>poppet</b> valve. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>poppet</b> valve is designed to allow flow in the forward position, and prevent the flow in backward position, with a spring attached to the poppet valve. The experiments is conducted under two vary conditions, which is to examine the flow force due to the increasing of pressure, and also due to the increasing of flow rate. The data is useful to study how the flow force can influence the height of the poppet valve lift, thus influence the efficiency of the poppet valve...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: If bubble nuclei are {{the cause}} of cavitation, how are they {{initially}} produced? According to whatWashio et al. have found out so far, there are two possible ways for cavitation nuclei to be generated in liquid flows: separation of flow and a relative motion between solids contacting in liquid. Thepresent article intends to reinforce that assertionbyobserving the cavitationoccurring in an oil <b>hydraulic</b> <b>poppet</b> valve. At a certain flowrate, a microscopic cavity suddenly emerged on the valve seat where the flow separated. As the flowrate increased, the cavity developed extending circumferentially on the seat and discharged bubbles by splitting. A collision of the poppet with the valve seat also caused the generation of a cavity. As the poppet was away from the seat after the collision, the cavity shrunk leaving behind a bubble. Cavities generated on the seat by flow separation regularly repeated a process of growth and shrinkage accompanied by bubble discharge, which induced flow pulsation and consequently vibration of the poppet supported by a spring as well. Moreover, these cavities brought about so-called ‘choking ’ in the poppet–seat constriction and acted to increase the pressure loss there by narrowing its cross-section...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{cavitation}} plays a fundamental {{role in the}} hydraulic components design and the capability of predicting its causes and characteristics is fundamental for the optimization of fluid systems. In this paper, a multidimensional CFD approach is used to analyze the cavitating phenomena typical of hydraulic components using water as operating fluid. An open source fluid-dynamics code is used and the original cavitation model (based on a barotropic equation of state and homogeneous equilibrium assumption) is extended in order to account also for gases dissolved in the liquid medium. The effect of air dissolution into liquid water is modeled by introducing the Henry law for the equilibrium condition, and the time dependence of solubility is calculated on a Bunsen Coefficient basis. Furthermore, a simplified approach to turbulence modelling for compressible flows is coupled to the cavitation model and implemented into the CFD code. The turbulence effects on cavitating regions are addressed for different operating conditions. In the analysis, both basic geometries and water <b>hydraulic</b> <b>poppet</b> valves are addressed, and the numerical results are compared to experimental measurements available in literature. In particular, the reference test case with abrupt section change geometries, such as the forward-facing step, is investigated. The recirculating regions, the vena contracta position, the reattachment point and the pressure and velocity fields are calculated under conditions where cavitation is expected. Furthermore, the diverging and converging flows in hydraulic valves are simulated and the influence of the seat shape on cavitation onset, pressure distribution and discharge coefficient is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The poppet {{control valve}} {{is one of}} the most {{widespread}} hydraulic components. The paper purpose is the evaluation of flow characteristics of poppet valve by means of a complete numerical analysis. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the valve fluid dynamic performance, exploiting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, in order to give the reliable indications needed to define the valve design criteria and avoid expensive experimental tests. The numerical analysis was performed by using the commercial code of CFD, and the numerical results show the complete flow field inside the valve. Axisymmetric as well as three-dimensional valve model was considered and the simulation results also are verified with experimental results. The results have confirmed the good accuracy of the simplified CFD analysis based on 2 D axisymmetric valve model being more efficient than full 3 D approach and show this method as very useful to forecast flow characteristics of <b>poppet</b> control valves. <b>Hydraulic</b> control <b>poppet</b> valve, distribution of the velocity in layers of the fluid, computational grid in the modelled geometry, pressure distribution for axisymmetric and three-dimensional mode for different flow rate, fluid velocity distribution in valve metering section for axisymmetric and three-dimensional model for different flow rates, the example of streamlines, the comparison of flow characteristics are contained in the publication...|$|R
