5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed on <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> aquatic animals.|$|E
5|$|In <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> wildlife, {{selenium}} {{is necessary}} for life, but toxic in high doses. For salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of whole body weight. Much below that level, young salmon die from deficiency; much above, they die from toxic excess.|$|E

5|$|Local economies near major {{coral reefs}} {{benefit from an}} {{abundance}} of <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> marine creatures as a food source. Reefs also provide recreational scuba diving and snorkeling tourism. These activities can damage coral but international projects such as Green Fins that encourage dive and snorkel centres to follow a Code of Conduct have been proven to mitigate these risks.|$|E
5|$|Trading vegetables, meat, <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> {{perishables}} with visiting ships ceased in the 1870s {{when the}} whaling industry collapsed.

5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, {{an important source}} of food for <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> aquatic life. The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams and found that benthic communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E

5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E
5|$|Copper is {{essential}} to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral {{because it is a}} key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.|$|E
5|$|Even greater {{assistance}} {{came from}} Samoset and Tisquantum (better known as Squanto), a Native American sent by Wampanoag Tribe Chief Massasoit as an ambassador and technical adviser. Squanto had been kidnapped in 1614 by an English slave raider {{and sold in}} MÃ¡laga, Spain. He learned English, escaped slavery, and returned home in 1619. He taught the colonists how to farm corn, where and how to catch <b>fish,</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> helpful skills for the New World.

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that megalodon preyed upon many cetacean species, such as dolphins, small whales, cetotheres, squalodontids, sperm whales, bowhead whales, and rorquals. In addition to this, they also targeted seals, sirenians, and large sea turtles. However, the shark was also an opportunist and piscivorous, {{and it would have}} also gone after smaller <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> sharks. Many whale bones have been found with deep gashes most likely made by their teeth. Various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales, and sometimes in direct association with them.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> cephalopods. Major {{items in the}} diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the network}} of National Wildlife Refuges (NWR), the Tualatin River refuge {{is one of only}} ten urban refuges in the United States. Habitats in the refuge include forested areas, wetlands, oak and pine grassland, and meadows, with mixed {{deciduous}} and coniferous forests common to Western Oregon. The refuge was established as an urban refuge to provide wetland, riparian, and upland habitats for a variety of migratory birds, threatened and endangered species, <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> resident wildlife. The refuge is home to nearly 200 bird species and more than 70 other animal species.|$|E

5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} {{because they were}} framed in perishable softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a warren of hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{traditional}} {{sectors of the}} economy export beef, cheese, whisky, beer, <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> seafood. In recent years there has been growth in other areas including tourism, food and beverage manufacture, jewellery, knitwear, and other crafts production, construction and oil transportation through the Flotta oil terminal. Retailing accounts for 17.5% of total employment, and public services also play a significant role, employing a third of the islands' workforce.|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus fossils {{have been}} {{described}} from 10 US states, including Texas, Montana, and many along the East Coast. Fossils have also been found in northern Mexico. It lived {{on both sides of}} the Western Interior Seaway, and was an opportunistic apex predator in the coastal regions of eastern North America. Deinosuchus reached its largest size in its western habitat, but the eastern populations were far more abundant. Opinion remains divided as to whether these two populations represent separate species. Deinosuchus was probably capable of killing and eating large dinosaurs. It may have also fed upon sea turtles, <b>fish,</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> aquatic and terrestrial prey.|$|E

5|$|Little {{progress}} was made, but in 2005 the Environment Agency and the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust promoted {{the formation of}} the Itchen Navigation Trust. They were committed to conserving the remains, rather than a full restoration to navigable standards. A request was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund in the United Kingdom for funds to restore the watercourse. Known as The Itchen Navigation Heritage Trail Project, funding was granted and a five-year restoration project began. Work has included widening the aperture at College Mead Lock and the construction of a bypass channel around Malm Lock to assist the movement of <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> aquatic fauna. The navigation has been designated a European Special Area of Conservation as well as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, due to the rich diversity of wildlife found along the system, and its historical importance.|$|E
5|$|The {{pelagic zone}} {{contains}} macro- and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents. Most {{of the smallest}} organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously-sized <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> nektonic organisms, which are in turn eaten by larger squids, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and whales. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to {{other regions of the}} ocean on a seasonal basis or up and down its vertical layers, often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day. Ships can introduce or spread invasive species through the discharge of ballast water or through the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the fouling community on the hulls of vessels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> aquatic prey {{taken in}} the water or at the water's edge form the major part of American alligator's diet and may be eaten {{at any time of}} the day or night. Adult American {{alligators}} also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to 50m (170ft) from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs on nights with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, American alligators may also ambush them {{from the edge of the}} water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles. The teeth of the American alligator are designed to grip prey, but can not rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids), and depend on their gizzard instead to masticate their food. The American alligator is capable of biting though a turtle's shell or a moderately sized mammal bone. Additionally, American alligators have recently been filmed and documented killing and eating sharks and rays; four incidents documented indicated that bonnetheads, lemon sharks, Atlantic stingrays and nurse sharks are components of the animal's diet. Sharks are also known to prey on American alligators in turn, indicating encounters between the two predators are more common than thought.|$|E
