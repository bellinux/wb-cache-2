5|$|While the European {{encounter}} with the black swan along Australia's west coast in the late 17th and early 18th centuries led to the shattering of an age-old metaphor, their contact {{on the east coast}} in the late 18th and early 19th centuries merely confirmed the new post-proverbial view, before turning to account for the black swan as <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> curiosity in the South to be utilised in developing the colonies.|$|E
5|$|However, in a {{long term}} war of attrition, the battle was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> source of losses to the French when they were losing two men to one. Both the French and the Russians {{suffered}} terribly but the Russians had reserve troops, and a clear advantage in the logistics war. The French Army supplies came over a long road lined with hostile forces. According to Rhien, so long as the Russian Army existed the French continued to lose.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Kimi Räikkönen was able to compete, after the Ferrari crew was able to change his gearbox in time for the session. Not running was Jenson Button, after his team decided not to go out, since a 55-place grid penalty would have placed him {{at the back of the}} grid at any case. Marcus Ericsson was more than half a second quicker than teammate Felipe Nasr, who failed to proceed into Q2, as did both Manor Marussia drivers. With Button out of the running, <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> driver was eliminated, and that proved to be his McLaren teammate Alonso, who barely missed out on making the cut. At the front, Rosberg set the fastest time ahead of Vettel, while Hamilton was the only driver not to use the soft compound tyre.|$|E

5|$|Sisler {{began the}} 1958spring {{training}} in spectacular form, pitching {{a total of}} nine hitless innings and allowed just one baserunner in 28batters faced; the last 27 in order. However, he finished the spring with two consecutive losses, including one to the Pittsburgh Pirates, with whom {{his father was a}} special assistant to their manager. He opened the regular season with a complete game victory against the Yankees on April16. On May2, he pitched his only career complete game shutout, a 6–0victory against the Detroit Tigers and future Hall of Famer Jim Bunning, improving his record to 3–1for the season. Over the next two months, his average innings pitched declined during his starts, and on several occasions he entered the game in relief. He went winless from June12 to August9, when he defeated the Yankees. He recorded <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> victory in 1958, and completed the season with an 8–9record, a 4.94ERA, and 71strikeouts in a career-high 149⅓innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|While not an {{illustration}} in itself, Christopher Nevinson’s statement against {{the slaughter of}} World War I in his painting Paths of Glory (1917) takes its title from another line in the Elegy, “The paths of glory lead but to the grave”. The title had already been used two years before by Irvin S. Cobb in an account of his journalistic experiences {{at the start of}} that war. It was then taken up in the unrelated Humphrey Cobb's 1935 anti-war novel, although in this case the name was suggested for the untitled manuscript in a competition held by the publisher. His book also served in its turn as the basis for Stanley Kubrick’s film Paths of Glory, released in 1957. This example is <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> among many illustrating the imaginative currency that certain lines of the poem continue to have, over and above their original significance.|$|E
5|$|After several trials, {{he joined}} Stalybridge Celtic in August 2010, making his debut {{for the club}} on 28 of that month in a Conference North match against Nuneaton Town. After <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> appearance, as a substitute, in a 1–0 defeat to Harrogate Town, he left the club to serve four months in prison after being convicted of assault. On his release from prison, he joined Northern Premier League outfit Ashton United. He scored his first goal for the club, in a Manchester Premier Cup game against Irlam Town, which Crowther's side won 7–0. He scored his first league goal for the club on the {{following}} weekend, as his side were beaten 6–3 by Frickley Athletic. He played 25 games in the 2010–11 season in total, scoring four goals. However, Crowther joined Ashton's neighbours Hyde in June 2011. He made his debut on {{the opening day of}} the 2011–12 season as his side beat Worcester City 2–1, Crowther scored the opening goal. He scored one more goal in August as Hyde came out as 4–0 winners over Hinckley United. Crowther played a total of 17 games, in which he scored nine goals, during his short spell with Hyde.|$|E

5|$|It seemed {{certain that}} manager Simon Grayson {{was going to}} {{purchase}} Brandon, but instead Grayson bought Brandon's team-mate Gary Taylor-Fletcher. Brandon returned to Huddersfield and was back in first team. However, after he was substituted on 14 October 2007 against Doncaster Rovers, he did not feature again until the New Year. On 5 January 2008, his second game back in the Huddersfield side, Brandon scored another FA Cup winning goal to knock Premier League side Birmingham City out of the competition in a 2–1 defeat at the Galpharm Stadium. He scored his second goal of the season, in the following game against Gillingham, but was sent off {{in the final minute}} of a 1–1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion the next week. Brandon's red card meant he was suspended for Huddersfield's fourth round FA Cup tie with Oldham Athletic, but following a 1–0 victory, he returned in time for their visit to Chelsea in the fifth round, which Chelsea won 3–1. Brandon scored <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> goal {{during the rest of the}} season, with his last game coming on 15 April 2008 in the Yorkshire derby with Leeds United. With his contract due to expire in the summer, it turned out to be his final game for Huddersfield after 135league appearances, during which time he scored 12goals, and a total of 148games.|$|E
5|$|Lavender's primary pitch was the spitball, and {{his method}} of {{preparation}} was to lick the ball. In a game on July19, Lavender was about to load the ball when he smelled a liniment on the ball. He reported this to the home plate umpire, who then ejected the Phillies manager, Red Dooin, from the game. Dooin had been caught doing this to another spitballer, Marty O'Toole, a few days earlier. On September26, Lavender and the Cubs were ahead 9–0in {{the top half of}} the ninth inning versus Cincinnati, when the Reds scored 10runs against Lavender and two other pitchers to take the lead 10–9. The Cubs ultimately prevailed and gained the victory by scoring two runs in the bottom half of the ninth. Lavender started <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> game in 1912, a 3–2victory on October5 against St. Louis. Following the season, the Cubs played a series of exhibition games with the Chicago White Sox of the American League called the City Series. Lavender started the first game against Ed Walsh, and the game ended after nine innings with a scoreless tie. Lavender gave six hits and Walsh just one. After the two teams played to a 12-inning tie two days later, Lavender pitched the Cubs to victory in game three. Two additional victories gave the Cubs a 3–0series lead, but the White Sox were able to win four straight games, twice defeating Lavender, including in the series finale. He completed his rookie season with his career-high 16victories, against 13losses, and a 3.04earned run average(ERA) in 251innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|That May, RKO {{released}} Citizen Kane, coproducing with director Orson Welles's Mercury Productions. While {{it opened}} to strong reviews and {{would go on}} to be hailed {{as one of the greatest}} movies ever made, it lost money at the time and brought down the wrath of the Hearst newspaper chain on RKO. The next year saw the commercial failure of Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons—like Kane, critically lauded and overbudget—and the expensive embarrassment of his aborted documentary It's All True. The three Mercury productions combined to drain $2 million from the RKO coffers, major money for a corporation that had reported an overall deficit of $1 million in 1940 and a nominal profit of a bit more than $500,000 in 1941. Many of RKO's other artistically ambitious pictures were also dying at the box office and it was losing its last exclusive deal with a major star as well. Rogers, after winning an Oscar in 1941 for her performance in the previous year's Kitty Foyle, held out for a freelance contract like Grant's; after 1943, she would appear in <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> RKO production, thirteen years later. On June 17, 1942, Schaefer tendered his resignation. He departed a weakened and troubled studio, but RKO was about to turn the corner. Propelled by the box-office boom of World War II and guided by new management, RKO would make a strong comeback over the next half-decade.|$|E
