5|$|The career mode {{is broken}} {{up into a}} dozen-some show sets, <b>each</b> <b>set</b> {{consisting}} of about 3-5 songs. The video for <b>each</b> <b>set</b> includes the band's introduction, banter between the band and crowd between songs, and final ovations on conclusion of the show. The player must unlock <b>each</b> <b>set</b> in order as to move forward. Once a set is complete, the player is shown the game's ranking of their performance and for each song, based on factors such as percentage of notes hit correctly, the longest streak of properly played consecutive notes, and how long they kept the virtual crowd excited about their performance. The player then unlocks the ability to play the individual songs outside of sets.|$|E

40|$|This study {{looks at}} how the media used in online {{discussion}} can affect the learning outcomes for students involved in distance learning activities. Online discussion within any learning environment can provide the opportunity for students to engage in thoughtful, content-based conversations about the topic under study, which may result in deeper understanding and greater learning gains. A content analysis of student discussion in listserv-based (electronic- mail), discussion, World Wide Web-based threaded discussion, and chat discussion in an educational technology course at American University (District of Columbia) is presented. Three main research questions guided the study: (1) What type of discussion takes place in <b>each</b> <b>setting?</b> (2) How much discussion takes place in <b>each</b> <b>setting?</b> and (3) What {{is the quality of}} the discussions in <b>each</b> <b>setting?</b> A student survey conducted {{at the end of the}} semester assessed the effectiveness of the discussions in terms of understanding and perceptions of course content.

The standard configuration of <b>each</b> <b>set</b> was five cars: power cars at either end, a food service car, and two coaches. In that configuration, each trainset could carry 264 passengers. At times, Amtrak operated Turboliners with an additional coach cut into the consist.

5|$|Many {{people had}} {{attempted}} to add tracks to moving machines. Over 100 patents had already been issued worldwide, but all failed to work in practical situations. In 1903 Benjamin Holt paid Alvin Lombard US$60,000 {{for the right to}} produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler. The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was experimenting with a chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a steering clutch that varied the speed of <b>each</b> <b>set</b> of wheels, allowing the operator to turn the tractor by retarding one tread or the other. Roberts of Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|E

Capcom has also released commercial products modeled on the character, such as an adult size Halloween mask, and later a silver ring modeled after Nemesis's head available for purchase through their Japanese online store. Palisades Toys used its likeness to create a posable action figure (packaged with a base and equipable rocket launcher) and a mini bust, which were released alongside several other Resident Evil-based merchandise. Moby Dick released its own line of Resident Evil action figures bundled in pairs of a playable character and enemy. Included in the series were Nemesis's first and second form, with the first form featuring an alternate head and equipable rocket launcher. <b>Each</b> <b>set</b> additionally includes a part of an action figure of Nemesis's third form, which measures 24inches (60cm) long when completed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It {{is common}} that, in a {{long-term}} asynchronous collaborative activity, groups of users engage in occasional synchronous sessions. In this paper, we discuss the data management requirements for supporting this common work practice. As users interact in different ways in <b>each</b> <b>setting,</b> requirements and solutions often need to be different. We present a data management system that allows to integrate a synchronous session {{in the context of}} a long-term asynchronous interaction, using the suitable data sharing techniques in <b>each</b> <b>setting</b> and an automatic mechanism to convert the long sequence of small updates produced in a synchronous session into a large asynchronous contribution. We exemplify the use of our approach with two multi-synchronous applications. ...|$|R
