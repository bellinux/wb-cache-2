500|$|The Washington Post stated, [...] "There's {{too much}} <b>here.</b> <b>Yet</b> it's the most {{interesting}} NIN in years." [...] The review went on to describe each track as [...] "the sonic equivalent of a silver orb hovering {{in your living room}} [...] explodes into a million shiny balls of mercury that splash to the floor before trickling, magnetically, back into a large round mass." ...|$|E
500|$|Described by {{commentators}} as an autobiographical album, My Truth is a pop and R record. Music critic John Lucas from AllMusic conceived it as [...] "hardly {{a radical}} departure" [...] from Robyn Is <b>Here,</b> <b>yet</b> more mature with [...] "intelligent and introspective" [...] lyrics and greater {{focus on the}} lyrical content as a whole. [...] "Det g√∂r ont ibland" [...] featuring Petter {{is located on the}} pregap of the first track as a hidden track. Aftonbladet Per Bjurman interpreted the first track, [...] "Play", as slightly world music-tinged, while Lucas deemed it [...] "as playful a song as 's ever recorded". It is followed by the R piece [...] "My Only Reason". Next is the ballad [...] "Underneath the Heart", which was likened by one critic to the catalogue of American singer Toni Braxton.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} his second {{appointment}} as deputy sheriff that Shibell challenged an old friend, a former guide and scout for the U.S. Army named Alfred Franklin Banta, the reputed discoverer of Meteor Crater, {{to track down}} a fugitive 900 miles into Old Mexico and back. He returned with his prisoner, saying he [...] "had one horse shot; missed being assassinated three or four times, but I am <b>here</b> <b>yet,</b> telling the story." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{subject of}} our present {{narrative}} would appear to have devoted himself to the Pirate profession at a comparatively early age. We find him in command of a splendid schooner of one hundred guns, loaded to the muzzle, <b>'ere</b> <b>yet</b> {{he had had a}} party in honour of his tenth birthday.|$|R

2500|$|Similarly, a Midrash cited [...] as an {{application}} of the principle that all miracles that God did for Israel, and the punishment of the wicked on their behalf, took place at night. To this end, the Midrash cited [...] "And he divided himself against them by night"; [...] "But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night"; [...] "And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night"; [...] "It was a night of watching unto the Lord [...] [...] [...] this same night"; [...] "And it came to pass at midnight"; [...] "And there was the cloud and the darkness <b>here,</b> <b>yet</b> gave it light by night there"; and [...] "And God came to Balaam at night." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Midrash {{taught that}} the {{six days of}} {{darkness}} occurred in Egypt, while the seventh day of darkness was a day of darkness of the sea, as [...] says: [...] "And there was the cloud and the darkness <b>here,</b> <b>yet</b> it gave light by night there." [...] So God sent clouds and darkness and covered the Egyptians with darkness, but gave light to the Israelites, as God had done for them in Egypt. Hence [...] says: [...] "The Lord is my light and my salvation." [...] And the Midrash taught that in the Messianic Age, as well, God will bring darkness to sinners, but light to Israel, as [...] says: [...] "For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but upon you the Lord will shine." ...|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic, however, gave a more lukewarm review, {{giving it}} 3/5 stars, saying: [...] "It's what Kelly wanted to do, so {{on that level}} it's a success, and one that {{listeners}} who share her viewpoint (and quite likely her age) will respond to but for everybody else, My December is a disappointment." [...] Commenting on Clarkson's feud with her record label, they also claimed: [...] "My December proves that both camps were correct: Davis is correct {{that there are no}} big crossover hits <b>here,</b> <b>yet</b> it's also true that this is an artistic move that Clarkson needed to make. If left up to Davis, she would simply be another vocalist singing professional product." [...] Rolling Stone, giving a similar lukewarm review, wrote: [...] "Clarkson clobbers you over the head with her emotions and arena-ready choruses. The result is a record that's bland in some spots and annoying in others." ...|$|E
60|$|Feeling that I {{must for}} ever tread the earth a branded boy--person I mean--or that I must clear up my honour, I demanded {{to be tried}} by a Court-Martial. The Colonel {{admitted}} my right to be tried. Some difficulty was found in composing the court, {{on account of the}} Emperor of France's aunt refusing to let him come out. He was to be the President. <b>'Ere</b> <b>yet</b> we had appointed a substitute, he made his escape over the back wall, and stood among us, a free monarch.|$|R

60|$|It {{was when}} the shades of the next evening but one were {{beginning}} to fall, <b>'ere</b> <b>yet</b> the silver beams of Luna touched the earth, that four forms might have been descried slowly advancing towards the weeping willow on {{the borders of the}} pond, the now deserted scene of the day before yesterday's agonies and triumphs. On a nearer approach, and by a practised eye, these might have been identified as the forms of the Pirate-Colonel with his Bride, and of the day before yesterday's gallant prisoner with his Bride.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. There are {{thirteen}} thousand here. I am sure you'll {{like the}} place. I am delighted with it, although I have been <b>here</b> as <b>yet</b> only two days." ...|$|R
6000|$|No. I will not. This suits.... Don't {{come with}} me; [...] There's more {{for you to}} do out <b>here</b> as <b>yet.</b> [Cheerful shouts.] [...] A-ha! 'Tis THIS way I have wished to die! ...|$|R

60|$|I {{arrived here}} on Tuesday night, {{after a very}} slow passage from Halifax against head-winds. All the tickets {{for the first four}} {{readings}} <b>here</b> (all <b>yet</b> announced) were sold immediately on their being issued.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have saved}} him." [...] It was not {{another of the}} dreams {{in which he had}} often come back; he was really <b>here.</b> And <b>yet</b> his wife trembled, and a vague but heavy fear was upon her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't say, I'm sure," [...] she answered. [...] "I haven't seen {{anything}} <b>here</b> <b>yet</b> {{that reminds me}} of fairies, but Cap'n Bill said a floating island in the sky was sure to be a fairyland." ...|$|E
