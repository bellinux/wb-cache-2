Due to the limited weldability, joining these materials by self-pierce riveting has been established. The challenge {{in this regard is}} that these materials, especially new high strength aluminum die castings, have a limited ductility, while the joining processes locally induce large plastic deformations. Consequently, joining by forming of these materials can be accompanied by cracks, which develop during the forming operation. This paper shows the experimental and numerical investigation of a new die concept for self-pierce riveting materials with limited ductility. At the new tool concept the riveting die is separated and a movable <b>die</b> <b>element</b> is used. This element allows that the parts are superimposed with compressive stresses during the self-pierce riveting process. In the paper it can be shown, that in contrast to the conventional process crack-free joints can be generated by using the new tool concept. Determination of the joining parameters and the die design was supported by simulative investigations. Additionally, the new and the conventional self-pierce riveting process are compared on the basis of results from the experimental investigations...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{facilities}} for radionuclide production at iThemba LABS have undergone {{a number of}} significant upgrades over the last decade in order to increase the production capacity and to diversify the product portfolio. Central to this effort is a new vertical beam target station (VBTS) and its associated targetry, designed and built to operate at higher proton beam intensities for the large-scale production of relatively long-lived, high-value radionuclides such as 22 Na, 68 Ge and 82 Sr. Along with the VBTS, an existing smaller horizontal beam target station was adapted to accommodate targetry for 18 F production, mainly to supply 18 F-FDG for use in positron emission tomography (PET). The production capacity was further enhanced by means of a beam splitter to enable bombardments in two target stations simultaneously. This required new developments on several systems, e. g. beam diagnostics, control, interlocking and cooling. This project brings together a number of different aspects of the upgraded facilities as well as the associated research and development that enable the production of radionuclides in the medium energy region, up to approximately 70 MeV. Investigations were performed on the cooling of the interfacial windows between the cyclotron vacuum and the targets as well as the direct cooling of the targets themselves during intense proton bombardments. For this purpose, empirical as well as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations were performed. In addition, the local radiation shield of the VBTS as well as the beam transport in some of the targetry was investigated by means of Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations. Excitation functions for the production of various radionuclides in the 66 MeV proton bombardment of 192 Os, 159 Tb, natGd, 155 Gd, 152 Gd, 93 Nb, natZr and 89 Y were measured and compared with theoretical predictions by means of statistical nuclear model calculations as well as the TENDL- 2012 library. In particular, the production of 186 Re, selected radioterbiums (149; 152; 155 Tb) and radiozirconiums (88; 89 Zr) is of interest in existing and emerging diagnostic and therapeutic applications in nuclear medicine. A study on 28 Mg production in the proton bombardment of natCl using stacked chloride targets was also performed at 200 MeV. This radionuclide is of interest as 28 Mg is the only practical radiotracer of Mg. Finally, new targetry for the production of 18 F was developed, modelled and optimized for the non-standard degraded beam employed in this particular case. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die fasiliteite vir die produksie van radionukliede by iThemba LABS is gedurende die afgelope dekade aansienlik opgegradeer om die produksiekapasiteit te verhoog en om die portfolio van produkte te diversifiseer. Sentraal tot hierdie poging is ’n vertikale-bundel skyfstasie (VBTS) wat gebou is om skywe met hoër intensiteit protonbundels te bombardeer ten einde relatief langlewende, hoë-waarde radionukliede op grootmaat te produseer, insluitende 22 Na, 68 Ge en 82 Sr. Terselfdetyd is ’n bestaande, kleiner horisontale-bundel skyfstasie aangepas om skywe vir die produksie van 18 F te huisves, meestal om 18 FFDG vir positronemissietomografie (PET) te lewer. Die produksiekapasiteit is verder verhoog d. m. v. ’n bundeldeler sodat bundel gelyktyding aan twee skyfstasies gelewer kan word. Dit het ontwikkelingswerk vereis aan verskeie stelsels, insluitende diagnostiek, beheer, vergrendeling en verkoeling. Hierdie projek bring verskeie aspekte bymekaar t. o. v. die opgegradeerde produksiefasiliteite sowel as die geassosieerde navorsing en ontwikkeling benodig vir radionukliedproduksie in die middelenergiegebied tot ongeveer 70 MeV. Die verkoeling van die foelievensters tussen die vakuum van die siklotron en die skyfgerei is ondersoek sowel as die direkte verkoeling van skywe onder intense protonbombardement. Hierdie studie sluit beide empiriese sowel as numeriese vloeidinamika berekeninge in. Verder is die afskerming van die VBTS asook die bundeltransport in verskeie skywe ondersoek m. b. v. Monte Carlo stralingstransport berekeninge. Opwekkrommes vir die produksie van verskeie radionukliede met protongeïnduseerde reaksies tot en met 66 MeV op 192 Os, 159 Tb, natGd, 155 Gd, 152 Gd, 93 Nb, natZr en 89 Y is gemeet en vergelyk met statistiese kernmodel berekeninge sowel as die TENDL- 2012 biblioteek. Die produksie van 186 Re, verskeie radioterbiums (149; 152; 155 Tb) en radiozirkoniums (88; 89 Zr) is van spesifieke belang vir bestaande en toekomstige diagnostiese en terapeutiese toepassings in die kerngeneeskunde. ’n Studie op die produksie van 28 Mg in die bombardement van natCl met 200 MeV protone is ook onderneem. In hierdie ondersoek is ’n stapel chloriedskywe gebruik. Die 28 Mg is van belang omdat dit die enigste Mg radioisotoop is wat geskik is as ’n radiospoorder van <b>dié</b> <b>element.</b> Laastens is nuwe skyfgerei vir die produksie van 18 F ontwikkel, gemodelleer en geoptimiseer vir die nie-standaard afgeremde bundel wat benut word in hierdie geval...|$|E
40|$|AFRIKAANS: Die waardering van die Afrika-onafhanklike kerke het gedurende die twintigste eeu grootliks verander, vanaf negatief tot positief. Die meer positiewe waardering hang saam met 'n ruimer en meer akkommoderende ekklesiologiese beeld waartoe gedurende die afgelope nagenoeg veertig jaar in die Sendingwetenskap gekom is. Teologiese opleiding as 'n ondememing onder die AOK het in die verlede gemengde sukses behaal. Westerse kerke het geneig om hulle eie model na die AOK oor te plant. Daar was min bereidheid om in terme van inheemse behoeftes en strukturele tradisies te dink. Aan die kant van die AOK was daar weer agterdog oor die motiewe van Westerse kerke en is sodanige opleidings relatief swak ondersteun. Vanuit Bybelse en historiese gegewens wil hierdie proefskrif 'n meer geloofwaardige opleidingsbenadering aanbied wat ook kerkopbou in die hand sal werk. Heling speel 'n sleutelrol in feitlik al die AOK en skakel met die sogenaamde profeetamp, 'n unieke funksie of bediening in die AOK. Die proefskrif stel 'n geïntegreerde of ekumeniese-genesingsopleidingsmodel voor om die AOK se profete in teologiese opleiding te betrek. Dit kom daarop neer dat integrasie bewerk moet word tussen tradisionele benadering, Westerse medies-biologiese metodes, sowel as Bybelse pastorale bedieningsmetodes. Daar moet vir 'n kragontmoetende benadering en vertrekpunt ruimte gemaak word, maar dit moet verder begelei word na 'n waarheidsontmoeting met die groot Waarheid wat 'n persoonlike ontmoeting is. By die leraars word 'n multidimensionele ekumeniese kerkopboumodel voorgestel wat kerugma, koinonia en diakonia sinkronies en diakronies benut. Aanduidings in die praktyk (aan die hand van diakonia en koinonia as assesseringskriteria) was dat derglike opleiding 'n transformasieproses begin het wat tot groter balans kan lei. Van die profete wat oorspronklik bloot diakonies te werk gegaan het, het tot 'n verchristelikte ubuntu of koinonia beweeg. Die leraars is weer kruisbestuif deur meer koinoniale insigte wat onder andere uitmond in diakoniese uitkomste. Ook die Westerse kerke of sendende kerke moet tot groter balans in eie denke en benadering kom. Eensydige beklemtonings, soos op die kerugma, kerkplanting, persoonlike vroomheid of geloofservarings of aan die ander kant op diakonia, moet plek maak vir 'n meer gebalanseerde en holistiese benadering. Sommige opleidingsinstitute is goeie evangelisasiekatalisators maar, gaan gebrek om aan ware klinies-pastorale insigte. Eksegeties-hermeneutiese insigte word seIde kontekstualiserend gekommunikeer. Materiaal is dikwels nog eensydig sinkronies of diakronies en kultuurontkennend. Indien die Westerse opleiding enigsins {{relevant}} wil wees, sal hulle meer van koinonia moet maak as die verlore dimensie in Westerse kerklike lewe, maar 'n lewende werklikheid in die AOK. Sonder <b>die</b> <b>element</b> van koinonia wat kontekstualisering verseker en die dualismes van teorie en praktyk, ekstraksie en abstraksie deurbreek, sal die Westerse instansies irrelevant in teologiese opleiding van die AOK bly. Aan die ander kant sal die Westerse instansies moet waak teen 'n ooroptimistiese siening van die AOK en byvoorbeeld redeneer dat alle kerke op een of ander manier sinkretisties is en dat die AOK toegelaat moet word om hulle eie gang te gaan. Dit is nie alleen histories onrealisties nie, maar ontken ook die onderlinge verbondenheid en verantwoordelikheid van die een, heilige, algemene en Christelike kerk. ENGLISH: Appraisal of the African indigenous/independent/initiated churches (AIC's) changed quite markedly {{during the}} twentieth century: from negative (at {{the beginning of}} the century) to positive (at the end thereof). The more positive judgement followed a change during the past forty years of Missiological understanding of the essence and role of church. Theological training during the past fifty years {{of the leaders of the}} AIC's had mixed success. Western churches tended to transplant their own model to the AlC's and did not really try to accommodate indigenous needs or structural traditions. On the other hand the AlC's tended to be suspicious of the motives of Western churches. Therefore they tried to be self-sufficient in training. This dissertation aimed to develop a more credible and viable approach in such training from Biblical and historical perspectives. Another aim was to make such training subservient of the ideal of developing of the AIC's as church. Healing plays a key role in the AlC's with the so-called prophetical office as a unique function and ministry. The dissertation proposes an integrated or ecumenical healing model to address the training needs of the prophets. The model aims to integrate Western medical-biological methods, traditional African healing and Biblical-ministerial principles. A ministry of confronting the powers (as accepted in many AlC's) must be transformed toward meeting the Truth and focused toward building a personal relationship between the ill member and his/her Saviour linked with the koinonia of the faith community. In the case of the ministers a multidimensional, ecumenical church development model is proposed which aims to realise kerygma, koinonia and diaconia in a synchronical and dia¬chronical manner. Preliminary indications from such training (done as part of this research) were that a transformation process was started which promised inter alia greater balance between diaconia and koinonia. Prophets, who formerly operated solely in the diaconial sphere of healing, began to show greater appreciation of the importance of koinonia (albeit a Christianised ubuntu). The ministers began to understand that true koinonia couldn't be separated from diaconia, since it follows from the faith relationship with God. On the other hand it became clear that Western churches also need some re-examination of their own traditions, theological presuppositions, ideas and missiological strategies. No church can afford to focus on one or two aspects in training, like kerygma, church planting, personal piety or experiential faith, or diaconia on the other hand. What is needed is a balanced, holistic view and approach. Many places of training are excellent catalysts of evangelism, but do not really succeed in training for the healing ministry, because e. g. clinical input is precluded due to a strict pietistic understanding of the ministry. Exegesis and hermeneutical skills are not really contextualised and therefore tend to remain an ethereal ideal. Training material suffer either from synchronical or diachronical one-sidedness, or cultural/contextual ignorance. If Western churches' or training institutes' ideal is relevancy in the training of the AlC's, much more must be made of koinonia - the lost dimension in Western Christianity, but a living reality in the AIC's. Without the element of koinonia contextualisation will be nothing but an idle dream, because it facilitates the bridging of dualisms (such as theory and practice, extrac¬tion and abstraction etc), which proofed to be the undoing of many training enterprises in Africa. On the other hand Western churches and agencies must guard against an over-optimistic view of the AlC phenomenon. In many instances such a view is justified with the argument that all churches are or have been syncretistic in one way or another. Therefore the AIC's must be left to their own resources to develop a true African Christianity and ecclesiastical model. However, such argument is not historical realistic and denies the mutuality, interdependency and mutual responsibility of the one, holy, universal and Christian church.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2006. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Today's market {{environment}} {{stands in}} stark contrast to the business world of just a few decades ago when there was less global competition, the pace of business was much slower, and work was predominantly non-tacit in nature. This new environment calls for transformational change, which is the topic of this project. It is also about a small company called Pragma that had to find its way in a twnultuous business environment. Not only has Pragma had to contend with the prevailing macroeconomic forces, but the company also found itself in one of the most turbulent market environments, namely software development. In response to mounting external pressures, Pragma launched a change initiative dubbed "Recubed". This thesis evaluates this initiative by first considering a wide spectrum of change management literature and cases before applying it to Pragma. Pragma provides solutions that improve the perfonnance of physical assets at optimal lifecyc 1 e cost. Since the company's foundation in 1990, it has helped hundreds of organisations ranging in size from small enterprises to large multinationals to achieve improved operational efficiency. Clients have billions of rand invested in plants and equipment. In order to be globally competitive it is crucial that they should derive optimal value from these assets during their lifecycles, and Pragma helps them achieve this through a range of offerings that include software, outsourced services, consulting, and training. In late 2003, faced with poor company perfOiTIlanCe, Pragma had to ask itself in depth questions about the industry it was competing in, the business models and corporate structures it was employing, the vision it was pursuing and the culture it was living. The first change management model to be considered is the Four Box model as it provides a very basic, yet universal approach to thinking about change. The more complicated BurkeLitwin model is discussed next, as it has in recent years become a favoured framework for thinking about organisational change and perfonnance. The DICE model is a recent innovation purported to provide some hard handles on a very soft subject. The Positive Deviance approach seeks to identify individuals or organisational divisions that defy the status quo. Organisations can then learn from their practices and apply it throughout. Collins' Good to Great model is included since it provides a non-traditional view on what is really important in bringing about lasting change. To balance this, the author also include Kotter's model as the traditional change management benchmark. The MegaChange model is based on the assumption of human capability rather than limitations. The thesis considers the situations at some large international companies that successfully transfonned themselves. These companies are P&G, Telef 6 nica de Espaiia, D&B, Poste Italiane, Banca Intesa, EMC and Barclays Bank. The one overriding conclusion is that deep change is possible, whatever the challenges faced or the industry under consideration might be. Yet change does not bappen by itself, and in each of the cases there was a strong leader and a competent and motivated team that supported him. Each case places emphasis on a different element of the change process, but underlying patterns emerged. These include the importance of speaking to both the hearts and minds of people, ceaseless communication, facing up to the current reality, managing simultaneously for the short and long-tenn, the alignment of systems with the vision, and progress measurement. Leadership is essential to organisational change. Change, by definition, requires an alternative vision of the future. Leaders are required to craft this vision and to get people to believe in it. Employees and managers today need to know much more about leadership than their predecessors. In the modem organisation, every employee should be a leader, as he will be required to lead at least himself. Great leaders are instigators. Their challenge is to do everything in their power to get other people to join together to make the envisioned future come true. To do this they require a capacity to stir an excitement and belief within people, and the way they do this is through words, actions, images, pictures, and scores. If they can tap into the common thread that runs through humanity's hopes and dreams, they will be successful. There are many leadership styles, each with its own pros and cons. This thesis will consider charismatic leadership, leadership when you are not the boss, servant leadership, and spiritual leadership. The leadership chapter concludes with a case study on leadership - the leadership style of Colin Powell. The main positive elements of the Recubed initiative included strong individual leadership, a willingness to face the reality of the crisis, a culture of discipline, a commitment to a Hedgehog Concept, and copious communication of the vision. The element that most set the initiative apart from other literature and cases is the use of sensual stimuli to tap into the emotional side of the audience, as well as the use of creative elements such as stories, riddles and puzzles. The primary shortcomings of the initiative relate to its implementation. There were not enough senior managers who were prepared to devote the required amount of time to cascading change down into the organisation. Progress measurement tools were also not implemented. The lack of a fonnal HR function exacerbated the implementation problems. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Vandag se mark omgewing sien daar baie anders daar uit as die besigheidswêreld van’n paar dekades gelede toe daar minder globale kompetisie was, die pas waarteen besigheid bedryf was aansienlik stadiger was, en werk tipies nie-taktiel van aard was. Hierdie nuwe omgewing verg transformele verandering, wat die onderwerp van hierdie studie is. Dit handel ook oor ‘n klein maatskappy genaarnd Pragma wat sy weg moes baan te midde van 'n ongeordende besigheidsomgewing. Pragma moes nie net rekening hou met die heersende makroekonomiese kragte nie, maar die maatskappy het homself ook bevind in een van die mees turbulente mark segmente, naamlik sagteware ontwikkeling. In reaksie op toenemende druk het Pragma 'n veranderingsinisiatief geloods wat "Recubed" genoem is. Die tesis evalueer hierdie inisiatief deur eerstens 'n wye spektrum literatuur en gevallestudies oor verandering bestuur te oorweeg voordat dit op Pragma van toepassing gemaak word. Pragma voorsien oplossings wat die prestasie van fisiese bates verbeter en die lewensiklus koste optimeer. Sedert die maatskappy se ontstaan in 1990 het dit honderde organisasies wat wissel vanaf klein ondernemings tot groot multinasionale maatskappye gehelp om hul operasionele effektiwiteit te verbeter. Kliënte besit aanlegte en toerusting ter waarde van biljoene rande. Om globaal te kan kompeteer is dit noodsaaklik dat hulle optimale waarde uit hul bates put, en Pragma help hulle hiermee deur middel van 'n reeks aanbiedinge wat sagteware, uitkontraktering, konsultasie en opleiding insluit. In laat 2003 het Pragma swak presteer, en die maatskappy was verplig om diepgaande ondersoek in te stel na die industrie waarbinne dit kompeteer, die besigheidsmodelle en strukture wat dit aanwend, die visie wat dit nastreef, en die kultuur wat dit leef. Die eerste bestuursmodel wat oorweeg word, is die Four Box-model aangesien dit 'n baie eenvoudige, maar tog universele benadering tot verandering versinnebeeld. Die meer ingewikkelde Burke-Litwin-model word ook bespreek aangesien dit die afgelope jare 'n voorkeur raamwerk vir denke oor organisasie verandering en prestasie geword het. Die DICE model is 'n onlangse innovasie wat streef daarna om vaste greep te kry op 'n klaarblyklik moeilike onderwerp. Die Positiewe Afwyking-benadering streef daarna om individue te identifiseer wat beter as die status quo presteer. Organisasies kan van hul praktyke leer en dit regdeur die organisasie aanwend. Collins se Good to Great-model word ingesluit as 'n nie-tradisionele uitkyk op wat werklik belangrik is om volhoubare verandering teweeg te bring. Ter wille van balans word Kotter se model ook beskou as 'n tradisionele riglyn vir bestuursverandering. Die MegaChange model is gegrond op die veronderstelling van menslike bekwaamheid eerder as beperkinge. Die tesis bestudeer ook 'n aantal groot internasionale maatskappye wat daarin geslaag het om suksesvol te transformeer. Hierdie maatskappye is P&G, Telefonica de Espana, D&B, Poste ltaliane, Banca Intesa, EMC en Barclays Bank. Die sentrale gevolgtrekking wat uit hierdie gevallestudies gemaak kan word, is dat verandering moontlik is, ongeag die uitdagings of industrie ter sprake. Tog gebeur verandering nie vanself nie, en in elk van die bespreekte gevalle was daar 'n sterk Ieier wat ondersteun is deur 'n bevoegde en gemotiveerde span. Elke geval benadruk 'n spesifieke element van die veranderingsproses, maar onderliggende patrone tree na vore. Dit sluit in die belangrikheid daarvan om tot mense deur te dring deur sowel hul hart as hulle verstand aan te spreek, onophoudelike kommunikasie, die trotsering van die huidige realiteit, om gelyktydig vir beide die kort- en langtermyn te bestuur, om stelsels in lyn te bring met die visie, en die meting van vordering. Leierskap staan sentraal tot verandering wat per definisie 'n alternatiewe visie van die toekoms vereis. Leiers word benodig om hierdie visie te vorm en om mense te oorreed om daarin te glo. Werknemers en bestuurders moet vandag meer weet van leierskap as hul voorgangers. Binne die moderne organisasie moet alle werknemers leiers wees, aangesien hulle ten minste hulleself sal moet lei. Goeie leiers is aanstigters. Hul uitdaging is om alles binne hul vermoë te doen om ander te kry om hulle visie 'n realiteit te maak. Dit verg die vermoë om mense te inspireer en aan te moedig deur middel van woorde, dade, beelde, prente en tellings. Hulle is suksesvol wanneer hulle mense se universele hoop en drome aanspreek. Daar is verskeie leierskap style, elk met sy eie voor- en nadele. Die tesis sal 'n aantal andersoek - charismatiese Ieierskap, leierskap wanneer jy nie die baas is nie, dienende leierskap, and geestelike leierskap. Die Ieierskap hoofstuk sluit af met 'n gevallestudie - die leierskap styl van Colin Powell. Die belangrikste positiewe elemente van die Recubed-inisiatief sluit in individuele leierskap, 'n bereidheid om die realiteit van die krisis te trotseer, 'n kultuur van dissipline, 'n verbintenis tot 'n Hedgehog Concept, en oorvloedige kommunikasie van die visie. <b>Die</b> <b>element</b> wat dit die meeste onderskei van ander modelle en gevallestudies is die gebruik van sensuele stimulus om die emosies van die luisteraars aan te spreek, asook die gebruik van kreatiewe elemente soos stories en raaisels. Die primêre tekortkomings het betrekking op die implementering van die inisiatief. Nie genoeg senior bestuurders was bereid om die tyd te bestee wat dit sou verg om die verandering deur die maatskappy te laat filter nie. Die nodige instrumente om vordering te meet, het ook ontbreek. Die gebrek aan 'n formele personeelbestuursfunksie het die probleem vererger...|$|E

And yet this revival is itself imbued with assumptions rooted in the European cultures that initiated modernist colonisation. Contemporary Sakha shamanism reflects the ten-sions within the nationalist revival, in the contrasting tendencies for activists, firstly, to recover what is seen as the old, genuine shamanic practice—and, secondly, to assim-ilate foreign spiritual techniques. But when these two strands of endeavour are exam-ined with reference to the perceptions of person and environment that formed the basis of pre-Soviet Sakha life, it becomes apparent that they complement each other. Both facilitate the intersection of contrasting knots of relationship, predicated on dif-fering ontologies. Sakha people currently live and work within institutions that have their roots in European modernism. However, older Sakha relationships with a live natural environment have not entirely disappeared. The authors suggest that the per-sistent presence of an environment imbued with spiritual agency differentiates the Sakha shamanic revival from the European traditions that shape its central motiva-tions. This case reveals the importance of attending to place and environment, in the discussion of post-colonialist identity politics. 246 peers and kolodeznikov...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a simulation study and experimental verification of a die design in extrusion processing wood-plastic composite profile. Flow balancing at the die exit {{is a major}} challenge in the profile extrusion die design as an unbalanced flow causes imperfect profile output. This is especially important when the final profile is complicated by having large dimensions and non-uniform thicknesses. In this study, an I-shaped profile of wood-plastic composite (WPC) has been considered for the <b>die</b> design. Finite <b>element</b> method {{has been used to}} design the die channel to yield a balanced output. Phases of die design and manufacture of the I-shape profile is presented. The results show that the prediction by the simulation could give a good insight to the die design which eventually could yield an acceptable profile.

40|$|Thesis (MEng) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2000. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{optimisation}} of medium power traction switched reluctance machines with tapered and straight stator poles. Only the prototype of the tapered stator pole machine is constructed and evaluated in this study. A non-commercial finite element package {{is used in the}} design and optimisation of the machines. The finite element method is applied directly in the optimisation procedure to optimise the design of the machines in multi-dimensions. The lumped circuit analysis method is used only for the purpose of verifying some of the finite element calculated. It is not used in the optimisation procedure. The performance characteristics of the tapered and straight stator pole machines are compared and discussed and the tapered stator pole machine is found to have better torque performance. Also the calculated and measured static torque versus rotor position characteristics of the tapered stator pole machine are compared and discussed.

40|$|The {{advantages}} and disadvantages of existing technical solutions and methods of pressure stabilization in the forming die of the extruding machines were examined. The developed functional scheme of mechatronic system which provides automatic maintenance of a constant pressure drop in the forming die channels was shown. We presented construction solutions of the <b>die</b> restricting <b>elements</b> allowing use of mechatronic system and providing rational hydrodynamic flow conditions of the process material. Analysis of analytical studies and experimental results allowed us to determine calming lengths with the movement of various non-Newtonian fluids in die channels with a complex geometry and head and rate in the area of restricting element. Solutions obtained allowed to extend the application field of the forming die by stabilizing the pressure during raw materials processing with different rheological properties. ??????????????? ????????????? ???????, ?????????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ? ??????? ????????? ???????. ??????????? ?????????????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????? ???????, ????????????????? ???????????? ????????????????? ??????? ??????? ????????????????? ?????????. ?????????? ??????? ????????????????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ????? ?????????????? ????????? ???????. ?????????? ??????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ?? ???? ???????????? ???????? ?? ???? ????? ?????????? ?????? ??? ??????????? ????? ? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????????...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Together with {{conventional}} alloys, ultra-fine or nano-structured aluminum alloys were prepared by equal channel angular rolling (ECAR) and pressing (ECAP). Formability of cylindrical bosses was investigated by compression tests of a closed <b>die.</b> Finite <b>element</b> (FE) analysis was also {{carried out to}} investigate the effect of die friction on the forming behavior. Cylindrical bosses with the aspect ratio over three were formed in a closed die at elevated temperatures even under a frictional condition, although more uniform deformation was expected under a frictionless condition by the FE simulation. Boss formability increased with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate, and fine structured aluminum alloys had superior boss formability to the conventional alloys. Near-net shape forming of a simplified cellular phone case was performed at elevated temperatures using a set of closed dies. A nano-structured aluminum alloy showed higher formability {{in all aspects of}} bosses, sidewalls and face thickness than conventional alloys...|$|R
