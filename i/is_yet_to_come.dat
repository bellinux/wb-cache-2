"Towards {{the end of}} last season, where I {{said the}} best <b>is</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> I {{strongly}} felt that way because towards {{the end of last}} season we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Christian {{faith is}} {{inherently}} political because allegiance to Jesus as risen Lord relativises all earthly rule and authority. [...] Jesus is called [...] "Lord" [...] over 230 times in Paul's epistles alone, {{and is thus}} the principal confession {{of faith in the}} Pauline epistles. [...] Further, N.T.
