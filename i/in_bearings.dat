5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used <b>in</b> <b>bearings.</b> The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} work in contact mechanics {{dates back to}} 1882 {{with the publication of}} the paper [...] "On the contact of elastic solids" [...] (...) by Heinrich Hertz. Hertz was attempting to understand how the optical properties of multiple, stacked lenses might change with the force holding them together. Hertzian contact stress refers to the localized stresses that develop as two curved surfaces come in contact and deform slightly under the imposed loads. This amount of deformation is dependent on the modulus of elasticity of the material in contact. It gives the contact stress {{as a function of the}} normal contact force, the radii of curvature of both bodies and the modulus of elasticity of both bodies. Hertzian contact stress forms the foundation for the equations for load bearing capabilities and fatigue life <b>in</b> <b>bearings,</b> gears, and any other bodies where two surfaces are in contact.|$|E

During the transit, Detmers received {{a signal from}} Germany indicating that his ship had been awarded two First Class Iron Crosses, and 50 Second Class Iron Crosses, to be distributed as he saw fit. Detmers transmitted a request on 18 February for WM-80 white metal (Babbitt (metal)), as the softer WM-10 used <b>in</b> <b>bearings</b> {{for two of the}} four diesel engines were wearing out too quickly. Some metal was acquired from the raider Pinguin on 25 February, but this was not enough to replace all the bearings. On 15 March, Kormoran met [...] to transfer torpedoes, provisions, and spare parts, but rough seas forced the two vessels to head south, where they met the German cruiser Admiral Scheer a day later. The raider's broken radar and a sailor with an eye injury were transferred to Scheer, but attempts to replenish the U-boat were again interrupted by bad weather, forcing the two vessels to relocate again. The equipment transfer and refueling took another three days, during which crewmen from U-124 enjoyed the relatively luxurious facilities aboard Kormoran, and a sick sailor from the submarine was traded for a healthy man from the raider.|$|E
2500|$|The Clarkson wind engine {{consisted}} of a rotor or a number of rotors, one behind the other, revolving in a casing with fixed guide vanes between and of opposite pitch {{to those of the}} rotors, and having a further casing to admit a fresh supply of wind to the rotors behind. The cylindrical casings are open at each end with a larger opening facing the wind. The wind catches a number of wheels and feathered vanes fixed to a shaft revolving <b>in</b> <b>bearings</b> inside the casings. When the wind has passed between the vanes of the front wheel it is directed by the guide vanes to the second wheel and is again taken up by guides and passed to a third wheel and so on, the action each time increasing the effect of the wind on the shaft and improving efficiency. The Clarkson of which an illustration survives (1919) was erected by the Air Power Co. of Prestwich, Cheshire on the estate of Lord Derby. This small engine was designed to work in a [...] wind, but could start under load in a wind of only [...] The wind wheel was only [...] diameter and is designed to lift [...] of water per hour to a height of [...] in a [...] wind, or double that quantity in a [...] wind.
