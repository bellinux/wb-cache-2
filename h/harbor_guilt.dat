30|$|In this article, {{treatment}} {{with a brief}} intervention based on Naikan (self-reflection) therapy for a patient presenting with pathological gambling is described. The patient, a 66 -year-old woman, had suffered from this disorder for 13  years. She also <b>harbored</b> <b>guilt</b> toward her mother, and resentment toward her father, which governed her own behavior and exerted an influence on her gambling. Treatment consisted of six individual sessions based on Naikan therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). At 1 -year follow-up, the patient was much improved, with an absence of gambling behavior and its associated symptoms. The implications of this case for clinical research and practice are discussed.|$|R

Flashbacks {{revealed}} that the Hulk had absorbed a dangerous new type of radiation while helping Iron Man and the Black Panther deal with a massive accident on Kiber Island. Fearing the Hulk's meltdown would kill countless innocents, Cho {{was able to use}} special nanites to absorb the Hulk from Banner and take it into himself to become his own version of the Hulk, leaving Banner normal and free from the Hulk. He is then rescued from a bar fight by Amadeus, who tells him that he is cured. Having confirmed that he can no longer transform or sense the Hulk, Bruce spends some time travelling across America taking various risks such as driving at high speeds, running away from a bear, or gambling in Las Vegas, until he is confronted by Tony Stark out of concern that Bruce has a death wish.

5000|$|In 1986, at age 28, Blundetto was arrested, tried, and incarcerated {{for almost}} 17 {{years for the}} armed {{hijacking}} of a truck. Soprano {{was supposed to go}} along with his cousin the night of the hijacking but was not able to make it due to a severe panic attack during which he passed out and injured his head, which was caused by an argument with his mother. Soprano tells Blundetto he was mugged by a group of black men the night of the hijacking, and was knocked unconscious. Soprano strongly believes Blundetto holds some ill-will towards him because Blundetto's life and family fell apart during his incarceration while Soprano grows wealthy and has a family. Blundetto denies this ill will, but Tony still <b>harbors</b> enormous <b>guilt.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the pre-Zero Hour Legion, Cosmic Boy was romantically {{involved}} with Night Girl (Lydda Jath) from the Legion of Substitute Heroes. During the [...] "Five Year Gap" [...] following the Magic Wars, {{he lost his}} powers {{in the course of}} a war between the planets of Braal and Imsk (the homeworld of Shrinking Violet), in which the Imskian army used a [...] "dampener" [...] on the magnetic fields within the Braalian soldiers. [...] "Vi" [...] was on the scene when her fellow Legionnaire was crippled by the dampener during the battle of Venado Bay, and <b>harbored</b> deep <b>guilt</b> for years. No longer using his codename, Rokk retired to the slums of a demilitarized Braal with his wife Lydda, who gave birth to their son Pol (named for Rokk's brother).|$|R
50|$|Children with {{a parent}} {{who was part of}} an occupying force, or whose parent(s) collaborated with enemy forces, are {{innocent}} of any war crimes committed by parents.

They also suffer from association {{with a parent}} whose war crimes are prosecuted in the postwar years. As such children grew to adolescence and adulthood, many <b>harbored</b> feelings of <b>guilt</b> and shame.|$|R
5000|$|The last {{fight between}} Paret and Griffith {{was the subject}} of many controversies. It is theorized {{that one of the reasons}} Paret died was that he was {{vulnerable}} due to the beatings he took in his previous three fights, all of which happened within twelve months of each other. New York State boxing authorities were criticized for giving Paret clearance to fight just several months after the Fullmer fight. The actions of Paret at the weigh in before his final fight have come under scrutiny. It is alleged that Paret taunted Griffith by calling him maricón (Spanish slang for [...] "faggot"). [...] Griffith wanted to fight Paret on the spot but was restrained. Griffith would come out as bisexual in his later years, but in 1962 allegations of homosexuality were considered fatal to an athlete's career and a particularly grievous insult in the culture both fighters came from. The referee Ruby Goldstein, a respected veteran, came under criticism for not stopping the fight sooner. It has been argued that Goldstein hesitated because of Paret’s reputation of feigning injury and Griffith’s reputation as a poor finisher. [...] Another theory is that Goldstein was afraid that Paret’s supporters would riot. The incident, combined with the death of Davey Moore a year later for a different injury in the ring, would cause debate as to whether boxing should be considered a sport. Boxing would not be televised on a regular basis again until the 1970s. The fight marked the end of Goldstein's long and respected career as a referee, as he was unable to find work after that. [...] The fight was the centerpiece of a 2005 documentary entitled Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story. At the end of the documentary Griffith who has <b>harbored</b> <b>guilt</b> over the incident over the years is introduced to Paret's son. The son embraced Griffith and told him he was forgiven.|$|R
50|$|Josh later meets Ellen, {{a former}} prostitute who {{has now become}} a minister.

Just before Madea's trial, Ellen asks Josh how he knows Candace. He tells Ellen that they were close friends from childhood through college, but all his friends mistreated and bullied Candace, and he started pushing her away out of embarrassment. He then breaks down when he talks about one particular night when he took her to a party. He ended up going on a date and leaving Candace behind at the party, where a group of his friends gang raped her in his absence, for which Josh continues to <b>harbor</b> deep-seated <b>guilt.</b> Ellen comforts him and tells him that he should not continue holding on to the guilt and that it was not completely his fault, since Candace already had personal troubles beforehand.|$|R
5000|$|The {{relatives}} sue {{the airline}} for damages, and Janice's role is revealed when Buddy {{is called to}} testify. As Abby watches on television, Buddy explains that gave his ticket to Greg and did not take Greg's in exchange. In coercing Janice to change the roster, the airline's security procedures were compromised, getting her fired. Buddy remembered that Greg was not the good flier he once was, having had [...] "too many people in his wallet". Buddy is excused by the judge, but does not feel [...] "excused". Abby had <b>harbored</b> the same <b>guilt</b> as her son in pressuring Greg to come home on the fateful flight.|$|R
2500|$|Analyst Jennifer Hayward {{described}} {{this aspect of}} the writing as not being about sex, women, or Marty herself, but rather about what takes place between {{men and women in the}} aftermath of rape. The story draws out powerful archetypes, such as the fight between good and evil, reminiscent of 19th-century melodrama, where critique would be given to [...] "power relations, especially the oppression of the poor by the rich and of women by men". Malone had Powell initially resist raping Marty, <b>harbor</b> deep <b>guilt</b> for his part in the rape, and act as a conscience that Todd ignores. Analyst Mary Buhl Dutta reasoned the storyline invokes [...] "rape myths" [...] cataloged by scholar Martha R. Burt, such as [...] "only bad girls get raped," [...] "women ask for it," [...] and [...] "women 'cry rape' only when they've been jilted or have something to cover up". Burt said such myths [...] "deny or reduce perceived injury, or ... blame the victims for their own victimization". Author Gerry Waggett said the [...] "close-ups of the rapists' faces during the assault, distorted to capture Marty's scared and drunken perspective, rank among the show's most graphic images" [...] and that [...] "Marty's subsequent quest to bring her rapists to justice dominated throughout the summer".|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, {{the child}} Isabella and Paul had, Ricky Williams was re-introduced {{to the series}} as an adult, now portrayed by Pete Porte. The role had been {{dramatically}} rapidly aged over the duration of 8 years to an adult. Adam Hughes of Yahoo! stated that bringing the character back would work well, he wrote: [...] "Regardless of his initial motivation for heading back to Wisconsin, Ricky will undoubtedly open up many old wounds and many new story line possibilities. Will he angrily confront Paul? Will Isabella manage to return home, as well, to see her big boy?" [...] Doug Davidson stated that Paul <b>harbored</b> possible <b>guilt</b> in regards to Ricky's upbringing, having been raised by his grandparents. Lauralee Bell spoke about the love triangle between Paul, Christine and Isabella {{and what kind of}} twists would occur through Ricky returning. She said: [...] "That whole Isabella thing was a very scary time for Chris and Paul and now they wonder if there's something off about Ricky. At first, no one knew Isabella was crazy. He could be a whack job like his mother. Time will tell. But seeing Ricky {{for the first time as}} a man is really startling for Chris. And for me, too." [...] Ultimately, Ricky turned out to be psychotic like his mother and was killed by his own father Paul to prevent him from killing Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap).|$|R
50|$|Physical {{effects of}} {{witnessing}} domestic violence in older children are less evident than behavioral and emotional effects. The trauma that children experience when they witness domestic {{violence in the}} home, {{plays a major role}} in their development and physical well being. Older children can sometimes turn the stress towards behavioral problems. Sometimes children who see the abuse turn to drugs, hoping to take the pain away. The children, however, will exhibit physical symptoms associated with their behavioral or emotional problems, such as being withdrawn from those around them, becoming non-verbal, and exhibiting regressed behaviors such as being clingy and whiney. Anxiety often accompanies a physical symptom in children who witness domestic violence in the home. These children <b>harbor</b> feelings of <b>guilt,</b> blame, and are constantly on edge. They may startle at the smallest things, such as a car door slamming or a glass cup accidentally falling to the floor. If their anxiety progresses to more physical symptoms, they may show signs of tiredness from lack of sleep and weight and nutritional changes from poor eating habits.|$|R
25|$|The Jerusalem Talmud (Shevi'it 6:1) relates {{how that}} Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, a priest of Aaron’s lineage, {{and others with}} him, used to go down into the {{marketplace}} of the Saracens in Ashkelon to buy wheat during the Seventh Year, and return to their own city, and immerse themselves in order to eat their bread (Terumah) {{in a state of}} ritual purity. The Beth-Din of Rabbi Ishmael ben Jose and Ben HaKapar, when they heard about what Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair had done, a most pious man on all other accounts, but who went down into Ashkelon when it was not permitted for priests to venture outside the Land of Israel, understood thereby that Ashkelon – though not conquered by those returning from the Babylonian exile – was not like other lands of the gentiles, and that defilement had not been decreed upon that city. Therefore, taking as an exemplum the act they heard performed by Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair, they assembled themselves and reverted the old practice, decreeing a state of cleanness over the city’s air, and that, henceforth, Jews (including those of the priestly stock) were permitted to go into the city without <b>harboring</b> feelings of <b>guilt</b> or fear of contracting uncleanness.|$|R
