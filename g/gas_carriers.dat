500|$|There {{are various}} ways {{to define the}} term bulk carrier. As of 1999, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea defines a bulk carrier as [...] "a ship {{constructed}} with a single deck, top side tanks and hopper side tanks in cargo spaces and intended to primarily carry dry cargo in bulk; an ore carrier; or a combination carrier." [...] However, most classification societies use a broader definition where a bulker is any ship that carries dry unpackaged goods. Multipurpose cargo ships can carry bulk cargo, but can also carry other cargoes and are not specifically designed for bulk carriage. The term [...] "dry bulk carrier" [...] is used to distinguish bulkers from bulk liquid carriers such as oil, chemical, or liquefied petroleum <b>gas</b> <b>carriers.</b> [...] Very small bulkers are almost indistinguishable from general cargo ships, and they are often classified based more on the ship's use than its design.|$|E

50|$|In 1974, Fearnley & Eger, a {{shipping}} company likewise based in Norway, decided {{to expand its}} gas tanker fleet and commissioned seven <b>gas</b> <b>carriers.</b> One order was passed to Bergesen and another to Gotaas-Larsen A/S. However, Fearnley & Eger faced financial difficulty in seeing the remaining deals through and another four of their contracts were transferred to Bergesen. Bergesen would also acquire the other vessel from Gotaas-Larsen A/S. These six LPG tankers were the first of Bergesen's gas tanker fleet.By the late 1980s, Bergesen was a prominent owner and operator of large LPG tankers. In 1999, {{it was decided that}} Bergesen would specialise in large and very large <b>gas</b> <b>carriers</b> while A.P.

40|$|AbstractThe silicon {{nanorods}} {{have been}} successfully synthesized via a chemical vapor deposition using an one-end sealed tube system at atmospheric pressure. The ice-bath silicon tetrachloride, high-pure H 2, high-pure Ar and silicon wafer were used as silicon source, reaction <b>gas,</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>gas,</b> and substrate, respectively. The effect of the reaction temperature, the holding time and the flow rate of the reaction <b>gas</b> and <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> on the silicon nanostructures has been investigated. The higher the reaction temperature, the longer the holding time and the higher the flow rate of the reaction gas, the more silicon nanorods grow.
