5|$|Previously, Tajikistan was {{on track}} to become a {{potential}} member of the union, having signed the treaty on the Eurasian Customs Union and the Single Economic Space.

5|$|The land {{forces are}} made up of about 14 {{integrated}} brigades, of fighters from all the former warring factions which have gone through a brassage <b>integration</b> <b>process</b> (see next paragraph), and a not-publicly known number of non-integrated brigades which remain solely made up from single factions (the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD)'s Armée national congolaise, the ex-government former Congolese Armed Forces (FAC), the ex-RCD KML, the ex-Movement for the Liberation of Congo, the armed groups of the Ituri conflict (the Mouvement des Révolutionnaires Congolais (MRC), Forces de Résistance Patriotique d'Ituri (FRPI) and the Front Nationaliste Intégrationniste (FNI)) and the Mai-Mai).|$|E
5|$|Uzbekistan remains {{hesitant}} {{to join the}} Economic Union, with Uzbek officials making opposing claims on the prospect of integration.

Uzbekistan began its <b>integration</b> <b>process</b> when Russia announced it would write off USD$865 million off debt owed by the country.

5|$|The European Council officially {{gained the}} status of an EU {{institution}} after the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, distinct from the Council of the European Union (Council of Ministers). Before that, the first summits of EU heads of state or government were held in February and July 1961 (in Paris and Bonn respectively). They were informal summits {{of the leaders of}} the European Community, and were started due to then-French President Charles de Gaulle's resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (e.g. the European Commission) over the <b>integration</b> <b>process,</b> but petered out. The first influential summit held, after the departure of de Gaulle, was the Hague summit of 1969, which reached an agreement on the admittance of the United Kingdom into the Community and initiated foreign policy cooperation (the European Political Cooperation) taking integration beyond economics.|$|E
5|$|The <b>integration</b> <b>process</b> {{repeatedly}} brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict. During negotiations, Jinnah, {{representing the}} Muslim League, strongly supported {{the right of}} the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, an attitude which was diametrically opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress and which was reflected in Pakistan's support of Hyderabad's bid to stay independent. Post-partition, the Government of Pakistan accused India of hypocrisy on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan—which India refused to recognise—and the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India's incorporation of Junagadh, treating it as de jure Pakistani territory.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{execution of}} <b>integration</b> <b>processes</b> between dis-tributed, heterogeneous data sources and applications is a challenging research area of data management. These in-tegration processes are an abstraction for workflow-based integration tasks, used in EAI servers and WfMS. The ma-jor problem are significant workload changes during run-time. The performance of <b>integration</b> <b>processes</b> strongly de-pends on those dynamic workload characteristics, and hence workload-based optimization is important. However, exist-ing approaches of workflow optimization only address the rule-based optimization and disregard changing workload characteristics.

40|$|Enterprise systems play {{a central}} role in the {{business}} processes and management of data within an organization. However it is not uncommon for organizations to posses a multitude of autonomous systems. This thesis examines the way organizations can integrate financial data from different autonomous source systems and examines different factors that can have an impact on data <b>integration</b> <b>processes.</b> The empirical findings were gathered through a case study at Sandvik, a large Swedish industrial firm, making use of qualitative research techniques. The findings contribute to create an in-depth understanding of financial data <b>integration</b> <b>processes.</b> The empirical findings show how an organization can accomplish financial data integration without tight coupling of autonomous systems. Moreover the research contributes by describing various organization and technological factors that impact data integration. The findings indicate that a decentralized organizational structure and singular system architecture play an important role in financial data <b>integration</b> <b>processes.</b> Hereby the research helps to further explore the topic integration within enterprise system research and provides context behind the organizational and technological factors that influence financial data <b>integration</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of heterogeneous systems {{is still an}} evolving research area. Due {{to the complexity of}} <b>integration</b> <b>processes,</b> there are challenges for the optimization of <b>integration</b> <b>processes.</b> Message-based <b>integration</b> systems, like EAI servers and workflow process engines, are mostly documentoriented using XML technologies in order to achieve suitable data independence from the different and particular proprietary data representations of the supported external systems. However, such an approach causes large costs for single-value evaluations within the <b>integration</b> <b>processes.</b> At this point, message indexing, adopting extended database technologies, could be applied in order to reach better performance. In this paper, we introduce our message indexing structure MIX and discuss and evaluate immediate as well as deferred indexing concepts. Further, we describe preliminary adaptive index tuning techniques. 1...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: {{the article}} deals {{underscores}} the importance of research into <b>integration</b> <b>processes</b> in the field of higher education for their subsequent use {{in the formation of the}} higher school’s innovative environment. The authors highlight the points that define the importance of the issues in the formulation of the state policy in the sphere of education. Materials and Methods: the research methodology is based on the general scientific analysis of scientific literature and empirical data. The authors used the relevant works by Russian and foreign researchers, and legal documenta¬tion of the Russian higher education. Results: the analysis of the term “integration” from the perspective of fundamental science and in relation to the practice of the higher school allowed us to distinguish between the state and the process of the above term. Con¬sideration of the ongoing <b>integration</b> <b>processes</b> in the field of higher education allowed us to identify three levels of their manifestation. Discussion and Conclusions: the authors come to the conclusion about the necessity of distinguishing approach to the research of <b>integration</b> <b>processes</b> due to the differences between the forms of integration manifestations at various levels; present visual distinction of the notion “integration” in respect to levels of its manifestation; as the cause of <b>integration</b> <b>processes</b> the authors indicate the desire to win the competition, but as the main objective of integration – to increase the competitiveness of the participants involved in <b>integration</b> <b>processes,</b> ensuring their joint progress...|$|R
