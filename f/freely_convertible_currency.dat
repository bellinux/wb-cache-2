2500|$|Switzerland's {{trade was}} {{blockaded}} {{by both the}} Allies and by the Axis. Each side openly exerted pressure on Switzerland not to trade with the other.

Concessions reached their zenith after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland completely surrounded by the Axis. Switzerland relied on trade for half of its food and essentially all of its fuel, but controlled vital trans-alpine rail tunnels between Germany and Italy. Switzerland's most important exports during the war were precision machine tools, watches, jewel bearings (used in bomb sights), electricity, and dairy products. Until 1936, the Swiss franc was the only remaining major <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency</b> in the world, and both the Allies and the Germans sold large amounts of gold to the Swiss National Bank. Between 1940 and 1945, the German Reichsbank sold 1.3billion francs worth of gold to Swiss Banks in exchange for Swiss francs and other foreign currency, which were used to buy strategically important raw materials like tungsten and oil from neutral countries. Hundreds of millions of francs worth of this gold was monetary gold plundered from the central banks of occupied countries. A total of 581,000 francs' worth of [...] "Melmer" [...] gold taken from Holocaust victims in eastern Europe was sold to Swiss banks. In total, trade between Germany and Switzerland contributed about 0.5% to the German war effort and did not significantly lengthen the war.|$|E

In 1966, Mujib proclaimed a 6-point plan titled Our Charter of Survival at a national conference of opposition political parties at Lahore, in which he demanded self-government and considerable political, economic and defence autonomy for East Pakistan in a Pakistani federation with a weak central government. According to his plan:# The constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense on the Lahore Resolution and the parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a legislature directly elected {{on the basis of the}} universal adult franchise.# The federal government should deal with only two subjects: defense and foreign affairs, and all other residuary subjects shall be vested in the federating states.# Two separate, but <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currencies</b> for two wings should be introduced; or if this is not feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East to West Pakistan.

The Federation will be entitled to a share in the state taxes to meet its expenditures.# There should be two separate accounts for the foreign exchange earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange requirements of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of duty between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the units to establish trade links with foreign countries.# East Pakistan should have a separate militia or paramilitary forces.|$|R

5000|$|The {{manner in}} which the Soviet Union transacted trade varied from one trade partner to another. Soviet trade with the Western industrialized {{countries}}, except Finland, and most Third World countries was conducted with hard currency, that is, <b>currency</b> that was <b>freely</b> <b>convertible.</b> Because the ruble was not <b>freely</b> <b>convertible,</b> the Soviet Union could only acquire hard currency by selling Soviet goods or gold on the world market for hard currency. Therefore, the volume of imports from countries using <b>convertible</b> <b>currency</b> depended on the amount of goods the Soviet Union exported for hard currency. Alternative methods of cooperation, such as barter, counter trade, industrial cooperation, or bilateral clearing agreements were much preferred. These methods were used in transactions with Finland, members of Comecon, the People's Republic of China, Yugoslavia, and a number of Third World countries.|$|R
50|$|Guinea {{was part}} of the franc zone {{countries}} that included most of the former French Colonies. After Independence, these countries did not become completely economical free. France decided against monetary autonomy hence they could not use a <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency.</b> The state intervention of the new governments was characterized by stops of quotas on imports and internal price controls. In the time up to c. 1980, the franc-zone countries had on average a lower inflation and a higher economic growth compared to the Anglophone counterparts, who could use their own currencies. But regarding the time after c. 1980 and the economic liberalism, characterized by Structural Adjustments, the franc zone countries could not outperform the rest.|$|E

40|$|Factoring is the {{contract}} negotiated continuous purchase of short-term debts, incurred by supplier {{due to the}} provision of unsecured credit supply. Factoring is a method of financing that can offer a lot to businesses, especially with its added value. This method mainly includes protection before customersâ€™ insolvency, management of receivables, {{as well as the}} opportunity to dispose with the funds {{before the end of the}} maturity of receivables. Forfeiting is the purchase of export receivables on credit at the time of delivery. It is related to receivables with the future maturity denominated in <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> <b>currency,</b> and secured with a bank aval bill, letter of credit with deferred payment or a bank guarantee. The conditions, under which each company provides forfeiting, depend essentially on the creditworthiness of the applicant and customer, as well as creditworthiness of the bank that issued the payment instrument.

The strong position of Hong Kong as a trade center is the result of its economic policies. Next month, after almost 100 years of British rule, Hong Kong rule will revert to China. The British had acquired this territory through a combination of wartime concessions, and a 99 -year lease negotiated and signed with China, which expires on July 1, 1997.
