25|$|Game 5 {{began with}} the unconventional, soulful singing of the {{national}} anthem by José Feliciano, drawing boos from some Detroit fans. When the game got underway, the Cardinals immediately scored three runs {{in the first inning}} off Mickey Lolich. In the fifth inning, Lou Brock doubled, and the Cardinals had a chance to break the game open, but Brock tried to score from second base on a single to left field. Brock was out in a collision with Bill Freehan at home plate, as Willie Horton's throw hit Bill Freehan's glove on the fly, and Brock elected not to slide. Brock later remarked that he never slid because no one had <b>ever</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> throw him out at home. In the 7th inning, the Cardinals led, 3–2. Mickey Lolich led off for the Tigers in the 7th inning with a bloop single, and the Tigers loaded the bases for Al Kaline to slap a single into right field, driving in two runs. Cash drove in another run, and the Tigers led, 5–3, which proved to be the final score. Mickey Lolich pitched his second complete game victory.|$|E

500|$|For decades {{following}} her death, Wong's image remained {{as a symbol}} in literature {{as well as in}} film. In the 1971 poem [...] "The Death of Anna May Wong", Jessica Hagedorn saw Wong's career as one of [...] "tragic glamour" [...] and portrayed the actress as a [...] "fragile maternal presence, an Asian-American woman who managed to 'birth' however ambivalently, Asian-American screen women in the jazz age". [...] Wong's character in Shanghai Express was the subject of John Yau's 1989 poem [...] "No One <b>Ever</b> <b>Tried</b> <b>to</b> Kiss Anna May Wong", which interprets the actress' career as a series of tragic romances. In David Cronenberg's 1993 film version of David Henry Hwang's 1986 play, M. Butterfly, Wong's image was used briefly as a symbol of a [...] "tragic diva". Her life was the subject of China Doll, The Imagined Life of an American Actress, an award-winning fictional play written by Elizabeth Wong in 1995.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "This episode will strike a chord with anyone that's <b>ever</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> {{fit in with the}} crowd [...] Lisa gets to show the many facets of her character, and there's a superb slapstick sequence as Homer tries to dispose of a firework." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times praised the episode and said: [...] "The episode is quite simply my favourite Lisa episode regardless of season. From calm to cool and fiercely aggressive, we've rarely seen Lisa so enticing as we do here, and the episode's many elements including the side stories for the other family members culminate in one of the finest this season has to offer." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he likes how it addresses Bart's resentment of Lisa's popularity. [...] "Granted, it makes [...] a little too mean, but it's entertaining", he added. Jacobson went on to say: [...] "Marge gets the best moment again, as I love watching her non-violent approach to the bumper cars." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best parts of the episode to be the scenes that feature Milhouse, particularly his yearbook message to Lisa and the scene with the Mystery Date board game. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{selected}} as [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] in the Sunday Age, where Michael Gordon wrote: [...] "This is not the whole story, {{but it is a}} well-researched and superbly presented summary of the story so far – a kind of companion to the John Lennon book, 'Imagine' – including the temper tantrums. Fans may, however, disagree with the closing assessment that Morrison may be running out of themes and ideas to express." [...] Publishers Weekly was critical of the book's tone, commenting: [...] "Turner is more adulatory than probing." [...] The review noted: [...] "A complete discography makes this book a necessity for fans of the Irish Rover." [...] Writing for The Boston Globe, Thomas C. Palmer Jr. called the book [...] "a coffee-table biography that fills an extensive void, both for those hungry for gossip and for those who have wondered at the source of the creativity in this prolific producer of often stunningly original – if difficult to categorize – music". Palmer commented on the book's value: [...] "The value of the book is that it has at its heart the same subjects that most of Morrison's music has featured, subtly or otherwise (but never as blatantly as Dylan in his [...] "Saved" [...] period): religion and spirituality." [...] Robert Sandall reviewed the book for The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "Steve Turner has performed his task as a biographer diligently enough in Too Late To Stop Now, but the really interesting story here is told by the photographs." [...] Sandall commented: [...] "Thirty years of constant rowing with anybody who has <b>ever</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get close to him, and a fitful and irritable hankering after religion (any religion) have left him looking bloated, sad and, as Turner has the courage and decency to point out, not as great a musician now as his current reputation would suggest.

[...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero."

Featuring [...] "cooing shooby-doos and sha-la-las" [...] by the Muses, who perform [...] "gospel-tinged" [...] back up vocals and riffs on the track, Jeffrey Gantz of the Boston Phoenix compared Egan's [...] "soaring" [...] vocals girl group The Ronettes. Describing [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] as [...] "a traditional Disney [...] lament," [...] Vulture.com's Lindsey Weber acknowledged its [...] "unique Motown edge", comparing the Muses to The Supremes. Musically, Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic described the teen pop-influenced [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] as [...] "the closest the Herculean villa ever comes to approximating a Broadway show". Combined, Egan and the Muses' vocals span two octaves, from G3 to C5. Egan's vocal performance is more restrained than those of the actresses who voice Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989) and Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991). Chelsea Fagan of Thought Catalog described Egan's voice as [...] "sarcastic" [...] and [...] "smoky", while Billboards Taylor Weatherby called it [...] "soulfully belt".Lyrically, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love) is a love song about denial, specifically one's reluctance to fall in love or admit to romantic clichés.

Rob Burch of The Hollywood News dubbed [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] an [...] "anti-love song". Described as an [...] "emotional barnstormer", the song begins with Egan singing the lyrics [...] "If there's a prize for rotten judgment I guess I've already won that", which is soon followed by [...] "Been there, done that". Thought Catalogs Chelsea Fagan believes that the first verse [...] "sums up in four lines everything that we’ve <b>ever</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> convey while on our third drink out at the bar with the girls", joking, [...] "I believe this song would come shortly after dancing in a circle with all women, but just before the tearful texting of your ex".|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin {{awarded the}} film five stars out of five, likening the {{experience}} of watching it to rediscovering a favorite childhood cartoon. He praised del Toro for investing his own affection for the genre and sense of artistry into the project {{in such a way}} that the viewer found themselves immersed in the film rather than watching from afar, noting the director had catered to younger and older audiences alike and expressed surprise that the film could rise above the sum of its parts. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review, describing the film as the sum of the potential every monster film had <b>ever</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> fulfill. Lou Lumenick of The New York Post gave the film four stars out of four, and said it had [...] "no shortage of brains, brawn, eye candy, wit and even some poetry", praising the [...] "clean and coherent" [...] action sequences and the [...] "terrific chemistry" [...] between Hunnam and Kikuchi. Drew McWeeny of HitFix highlighted other aspects of the film, paying particular attention to the production and art design. He also praised the cinematography for [...] "perfectly capturing" [...] the film, and described the score as [...] "ridiculously cool". Rolling Stones Peter Travers called the film [...] "the work of a humanist ready to banish cynicism for compassion", saying that del Toro [...] "drives the action with a heartbeat". Keith Uhlich of Time Out called the film [...] "pure, pleasurable comic-book absurdity", and noted that del Toro had lent the proceedings a [...] "plausible humanity" [...] lacking in most of summer 2013's destruction-heavy blockbusters. He said the Kaijus' civilian victims make a [...] "palpably personal impression", deeming one scene with Mako Mori [...] "as mythically moving as anything in the mecha anime, like Neon Genesis Evangelion, that the director emulates with expert aplomb." [...] The Village Voices Stephanie Zacharek called it [...] "summer entertainment with a pulse", praising its [...] "dumbly brilliant" [...] action and freedom from elitism, but noted the story is predictable and suggested del Toro's time would be better spent on more visionary films. Angela Watercutter of Wired called it the [...] "most awesome movie of the summer", a [...] "fist-pumping, awe-inspiring ride", and opined that its focus on spectacle rather than characterization [...] "simply does not matter" [...] in the summer blockbuster context. Richard Roeper gave the film a B, commenting that either the Jaegers or Kaiju [...] "can take down any of the Transformers."
