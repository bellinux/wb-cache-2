5|$|Traditionally, {{from the}} 1940s, {{lanthanum}} {{has been placed}} under scandium and yttrium in group 3 of the periodic table, as its differentiating electron from the previous element <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> d-orbital. This results in a consistent set of electron configurations in group 3 (Sc: 3d14s2; Y: 4d15s2; La: 5d16s2). However, this position has sometimes been disputed, {{on the grounds that}} yttrium {{and to a lesser extent}} scandium are closer in their chemical properties to lutetium than lanthanum. Indeed, early techniques on separating the rare earths relied on the distinction between the early lanthanides in the cerium group (whose sodium double sulfates dissolve in water with difficulty) and the late ones (as well as yttrium) in the yttrium group (whose sodium double sulfates are very water-soluble), prompting some researchers in the 1920s and 1930s to place lutetium under yttrium instead. Since the differentiating electron between ytterbium and lutetium also <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> d-orbital, both lutetium and lanthanum appear by this argument as equally valid candidates for being the third member of group 3.|$|E

5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E

Camonte ignores this warning and begins a series of executions and extortions that result in a war with the North side gang. Camonte then takes the gang over from Lovo, at which point Lovo tries to kill him but fails. Camonte murders Lovo and Poppy becomes his girl. When Camonte finds his missing sister in a hotel room with his closest friend, the coin flipping gangster Guino Rinaldo (played by George Raft), he <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> rage and kills Rinaldo. After he finds out that they had become married and wanted to surprise Camonte he becomes despondent. The film ends with first Camonte sister then Camonte being gunned down by police at his home.|$|E
