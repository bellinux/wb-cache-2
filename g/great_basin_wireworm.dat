40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{mountain}} pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) populations reached epidemic levels across much of western North America, including high elevations where cool temperatures previously limited beetle persistence. Many high-elevation pine species are susceptible hosts and experienced high levels of mortality in recent outbreaks, but co-occurring <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva), the longest-living non-clonal organism, were not attacked. I assessed <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine resistance to mountain pine beetle by evaluating mountain pine beetle host selection behavior and reproductive success in this species. To evaluate mountain pine beetle host selection preference for <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine, I used no-choice 48 -hour attack box experiments that confined pioneering female beetles onto pairs of living <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone and limber pine (P. flexilis), a susceptible host tree species. To investigate the effect of induced tree defenses on host selection behavior, I repeated the tests on paired sections of <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone and limber pines that had been recently cut, thereby removing their capacity for induced defensive reactions to an attack. Mountain pine beetles avoided <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine relative to limber pine, suggesting that <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine has {{a high level of}} resistance to mountain pine beetle due at least in part to stimuli that repel pioneering females from initiating attacks, even when induced defenses are compromised. To investigate mountain pine beetle reproductive success in <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine, I compared the mating success, fecundity, and brood production of mountain pine beetle parents placed in cut <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine bolts with that of mountain pine beetles placed in cut bolts of limber pine and lodgepole pine (P. contorta), two susceptible species. Initial reproductive development was similar in all three tree species, but nearly all brood in <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine died before emerging. The extensive offspring mortality observed in <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine may be a key evolutionary driver behind mountain pine beetle aversion to the species. These findings suggest that <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine is a highly resistant species with low vulnerability to climate-driven increases in mountain pine beetle outbreaks at high elevations...|$|R

40|$|High {{elevation}} five needle pines {{are rapidly}} declining throughout western North America due to warming temperatures, mountain pine beetle, white pine blister rust, and alteration of the naturally occurring fire regime. The impact {{of climate change}} is especially acute in sky islands of the <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> as warming temperatures alter tree distribution and contribute to overstory tree mortality. <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine forests occur as ecological islands at the highest elevations of mountain ranges separated by extensive rangeland or desert <b>basins.</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Basin</b> bristlecone pine ecosystems are highly fragmented and contain many biodiversity “hot spots” {{with a high degree}} of species endemism.
