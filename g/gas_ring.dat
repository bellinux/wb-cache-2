40|$|In {{previous}} studies a {{relationship has been}} found between repeated checking behaviour - a common symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) - and confidence in memory. Paradoxically, perseverative checking serves to increase distrust in memory. The current study has investigated perseverative mental checking, which is the repeated retrieval of memories of (OCD relevant) situations, by means of two experiments. In the first experiment the relationship between perseverative mental checking and confidence in memory, vividness and detail of memory was investigated. For this purpose an interactive computer program, displaying <b>gas</b> <b>rings</b> and/or light bulbs, was used. The experiment consisted of a training phase, a pre-test phase, a checking phase and a post-test phase and included two conditions. In the relevant condition participants imagined to check combinations of similar objects (<b>gas</b> <b>rings</b> or light bulbs) throughout the whole experiment. In the irrelevant condition however, in the checking phase participants were supposed to imagine to check objects other than the objects checked during pre-test phase. The results did not fully answer the initial questions. In both conditions there was a similar decline of vividness and detail and moreover there was no decline in confidence. In a second experiment the effect of memory decay on confidence, vividness and detail of memory has been investigated. A third condition was included in which participants during the checking phase did not check but read aloud a story. The second experiment {{made clear that the}} results from the first experiment could be explained by retroactive interference of mental activity. In all conditions vividness and detail of memory declined. Despite this decline, no decrease of confidence in memory was observed, although vividness and detail of memory were expected to influence confidence in memory.

40|$|We {{investigate}} rapid mass {{supply process}} by nested bars in the Galaxy by numerical simulation. We simulate gas {{flow in the}} whole galaxy disk with nested bars, which are the outer bar and the inner bar, especially with highly spatial resolution in the galactic central region. We assume two cases of inner bar size which are a smaller one and a larger one than the radius of the 200 pc <b>gas</b> <b>ring</b> which is corresponds to the Central Molecular Zone. From our numerical results, in the large size bar cases, the inner bars with large elongation induce sufficient mass inflow and destroy the 200 pc <b>gas</b> <b>ring.</b> On the other hand, in the small size bar cases, the inner bars with large elongation induce large mass inflow and do not destroy the 200 pc <b>gas</b> <b>ring.</b> This mass inflow is caused by straight shocks excited by the inner bar. In this case, nuclear gas disks of ~ 15 pc radius are formed. The nuclear gas disks are self-gravitationally unstable and we expect formation of compact star clusters under strong tidal force in the nuclear gas disks. We discuss evolution of the nuclear gas disk. Comment: 36 pages, 11 figures. Submitted to Ap...|$|E

Over the course of 2. 2 years, the spectra show complete velocity reversals in the circumstellar absorption, moving from strongly red-shifted in 2015 April to strongly blue-shifted in 2017 June. The depth of the absorption also varies, increasing {{by a factor of}} two over the same period. The dramatic {{changes in the}} line profiles are consistent with eccentric circumstellar <b>gas</b> <b>rings</b> undergoing general relativistic precession. As the argument of periapsis of the rings change relative to the line of sight, the transiting gas shifts from receding in 2016 to approaching in 2017.

Spectroscopic monitoring of WD 1145 + 017 will test these projections and aid in developing more accurate white dwarf accretion disk models. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

40|$|In our {{previous}} paper, {{we have shown}} that a gas disk in the nuclear region of a barred galaxy which contains a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) rapidly evolves into a nuclear <b>gas</b> <b>ring</b> by the effect of an additional inner Lindblad resonance caused by the SMBH. In this paper, we investigate {{the fate of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>ring,</b> involving self-gravity of gas, using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the <b>gas</b> <b>ring</b> becomes gravitationally unstable for a gas surface density of gas above a critical value, and fragments into several gas clumps. Some denser clumps increase their mass via the accretion of the surrounding gas and collisions with other clumps, and finally a very massive gas clump (10 ^ 7 M_sun) is formed. Due to the torque from the most massive clump, a part of the gas in the ring loses its angular momentum and falls into the galactic center. As a result, a nuclear gas disk (50 pc) is formed around the SMBH. The accretion rate for $R< 50 $ pc attains about 1 M_sun/yr for 3. 5 * 10 ^ 7 yr. At the final phase of the bar-driven fueling, self-gravity is crucial for the angular momentum transfer of the gas. This is a new mechanism for gas fueling to the vicinity of the SMBH.

We find that kinematic peculiar subsystems are preferably formed in equal-mass mergers. Equal-mass collisionless remnants can show almost no rotation, regular rotation or strong kinematic misalignment. The inclusion of gas makes the remnants appear more round (1 : 1) and axisymmetric (3 : 1). CRCs are almost exclusively formed in equal-mass mergers with a dissipational component. 3 : 1 remnants show a much more regular structure.
