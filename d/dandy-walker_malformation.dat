30|$|The advent in MRI {{technology}} {{has led to}} better understanding of CSF flow disorders which are frequently encountered in children [1, 2]. Flow-sensitive MRI techniques and three-dimensional high-resolution sequences have been applied for functional and anatomical assessment of CSF flow dynamics, respectively [3 – 5]. These studies can discriminate between communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus with accurate localization of the site of obstruction [6]. Assessment of arachnoid cysts and determination of CSF movement alterations in cases with Chiari and <b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>malformations</b> can be properly performed [3, 7]. Moreover, hydrocephalus and ventriculomegaly ex-vacuo can be differentiated. In addition to shunt surgeries, interventional procedures such as endoscopic third ventriculostomy and aqueductoplasty are among the treatment options. Accurate diagnosis of the site of obstruction and detection {{of a combination of}} pathologies are crucial for proper selection of the treatment strategy and improving the postoperative outcome [7, 8]. In this review, we will describe the MRI protocol adopted for the assessment of the ventricular system and CSF flow in children and the value of each imaging sequence in order to help reach the diagnosis.

40|$|Dilatation of {{the fetal}} {{cerebral}} ventricles (ventriculomegaly) is a generic sonographic sign common to several pathological entities carrying different prognoses. The main causes of fetal ventriculomegaly are aqueductal stenosis, Chiari II <b>malformation,</b> <b>Dandy-Walker</b> complex and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Ventriculomegaly is easily recognized by ultrasound {{by measuring the}} atrial width. This simple measure allows the recognition of mild forms of ventricular dilatation and {{is used as a}} screening method for ventriculomegaly. However, although the diagnosis of ventriculomegaly is easy, the prenatal identification of the cause of ventricular dilatation is a more difficult task. To this end, the evaluation of the posterior fossa in association with the visualization of the corpus callosum is a useful landmark. Research into the cause of ventriculomegaly is clinically useful, since the prognosis mainly depends on the etiology and on the presence of associated anomalies. In this article the role of prenatal sonography in recognizing the cause of ventriculomegaly and the prognostic value of the prenatal sonographic findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Syringomielia {{could be}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} presence or absence of association with hindbrain pathology. Therefore, hindbrain-related syringomielia could either appear as a result of an hindrance to the cranio-spinal CSF flow (3 / 4 cases) usually as a consequence of a <b>malformation</b> (<b>Dandy-Walker,</b> Chiari I-II, basilar impression) or could less frequently show up as an acquired form caused by tumors or foramen magnum arachnoiditis. In the non hindbrain-related syringomielia, the perimedullary CSF flow is slowed by a diffuse spinal meningeal fibrosis, caused by spinal trauma, bacterial or chemical (contrast medium) meningitis, Pott disease, scoliosis, spinal canal stenosis. The aim of the present review is to analyze the most convincing etiopathogenetic hypotheses regarding the so called non hindbrain syringomielia and, in the light of these etiologic concepts, to review the current therapeutic options.

50|$|Dandy-Walker {{syndrome}} (DWS) {{is a rare}} {{group of}} congenital human brain malformations. There are three subtypes which affect multiple organs to varying degrees, but the fundamental abnormalities involve the cerebellum which controls muscle coordination. The adjacent fourth ventricle is often affected, which can alter the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, increase intracranial pressure, and lead to multiple other brain function problems. The degree of disability varies but is typically lifelong. Treatment may involve physical therapy, special education, or surgical placement of a cerebral shunt. It is named for Walter Dandy and Arthur Earl Walker. In the majority of individuals with <b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>malformation,</b> signs and symptoms caused by abnormal brain development are present at birth or develop within {{the first year of}} life. Some children have a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) that may cause increased head size (macrocephaly). Up to half of affected individuals have intellectual disability that ranges from mild to severe, and those with normal intelligence may have learning disabilities. Children with <b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>malformation</b> often have delayed development, particularly a delay in motor skills such as crawling, walking, and coordinating movements. People with <b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>malformation</b> may experience muscle stiffness and partial paralysis of the lower limbs (spastic paraplegia), and they may also have seizures. While rare, hearing and vision problems can be features of this condition.|$|E

50|$|The cranial bones fuse {{by the end}} of {{the third}} year of life. For head {{enlargement}} to occur, hydrocephalus must occur before then.

50|$|ZIC1 is {{classified}} as a ZIC protein due to conservation of the five C2H2 zinc fingers, which enables the protein to interact with DNA and proteins. ZIC1 is found in close genomic configuration in another member of this protein family, ZIC4. Correct function of these proteins in critical for early development, and as such mutations of the genes encoding these proteins is known to result in various congenital defects. For example, if function of both ZIC1 and ZIC4 is lost (which can occur via an interstitial deletion due to their adjacent location) then this may result in the <b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>malformation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>malformation</b> is a {{congenital}} malformation associated with hydrocephalus. In 1921 Dandy reported {{a case of}} hydrocephalus caused by obstruction of outflow of CSF from the fourth ventricle. In 1944 A. Earl Walker (who eventually became chairman of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins) described a similar case of congenital closure of the outflow of the fourth ventricle. This congenital anomaly {{became known as the}} Dandy-Walker cyst. It is associated with closure of the foramina of Luschka and Magendie (the outflow openings of the fourth ventricle), atrophy of the cerebellum and cerebellar vermis, dilation of the fourth ventricle, hydrocephalus, and often atrophy of the corpus callosum.|$|E

50|$|Inspection of the {{posterior}} fossa {{is a common}} feature of prenatal ultrasound and is used primarily to determine whether excess fluid or malformations of the cerebellum exist. Anomalies of the cerebellar vermis are diagnosed in this manner and include phenotypes consistent with <b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>malformation,</b> rhombencephalosynapsis, displaying no vermis with fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres, pontocerebellar hypoplasia, or stunted growth of the cerebellum, and neoplasms. In neonates, hypoxic injury to the cerebellum is fairly common, resulting in neuronal loss and gliosis. Symptoms of these disorders range from mild loss of fine motor control to severe mental retardation and death. Karyotyping has shown that most pathologies associated with the vermis are inherited though an autosomal recessive pattern, with most known mutations occurring on the X chromosome.|$|E

All MRI examinations were performed using a 1. 5 Tesla magnet without maternal sedation. RESULTS: MRI diagnosed 15 / 31 cases of <b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>Malformation,</b> 6 / 31 cases of vermian partial caudal agenesis, 2 / 31 of vermian hypoplasia, 4 / 31 of vermian malrotation, 2 / 31 of Walker-Warburg Syndrome, 1 / 31 of Blake pouch cyst, 1 / 31 of rhombencephalosynapsis. All data were compared with fetopsy results, Fetal MR after the 30 th week or postnatal MRI; the follow up depended on the maternal decision to terminate or continue pregnancy.

Here we report a child harboring a cryptic de novo 6 p 25 deletion, bilateral optic disc coloboma and characteristic anterior segment anomalies. We review reported ophthalmic findings in patients with this syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective case review of a 4 -day-old male with <b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>malformation</b> and cardiac defects who was referred with a suspected diagnosis of iris coloboma. RESULTS: The ophthalmic examination showed bilateral corectopia associated with posterior embryotoxon. Fundus examination revealed bilateral optic disc excavation, which was diagnosed as colobomatous because of its configuration and stability over time. Because {{of the association of}} posterior embryotoxon with <b>Dandy-Walker</b> <b>malformation,</b> a terminal 6 p deletion syndrome was clinically suspected. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies revealed a 3. 2 Mb deletion at 6 p 25. 2 p 25. 3 including the FOXC 1 gene.
