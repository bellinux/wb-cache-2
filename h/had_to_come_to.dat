At the same time the team moved to the Three Mills studio complex in east London, where a 4x4 metre scale model of the stadium was built. For security reasons, a single CGI-assisted version of the ceremony was kept on editor Sascha Dhillon's laptop; anyone needing it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the studio.|$|E
5|$|When questioned, Patrick Darby {{testified that}} in 1824, Beauchamp had {{solicited}} his services {{in order to}} bring suit against Sharp for unspecified charges. During their ensuing conversations, Beauchamp had related the story of Sharp's abandonment of Anna Cooke and her child, swearing that he would kill him one day, even if he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Frankfort and shoot him down in the street. The combined testimonies of Eliza Sharp and Patrick Darby were sufficient to persuade the city magistrates to hold Beauchamp for trial during the circuit court's next term, which began in March 1826.|$|E

The Carolingian reformation of monasticism and church-state relations was the culmination of the Frankish Church.|$|E

For example, he obtained the right to host the post office at his store; as a result, everyone <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his establishment to get their mail. He sold a lot cheaply to blacksmith Lewis Wyckoff; people needing smithing therefore came to Seattle instead of its rival Port Madison. Perhaps his greatest coup was persuading Henry Yesler {{to set up a}} steam sawmill on land sliced from the north part of Maynard's claim and the south part of Boren's. This sawmill helped establish Seattle's economic ascendancy.|$|E

But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.|$|E

25|$|Now Montrose {{found himself}} {{apparently}} master of Scotland. After Kilsyth, the king's secretary arrived with letters from Charles documenting that Montrose was lieutenant and captain general. He first conferred knighthood on Alasdair. Then he summoned a parliament {{to meet at}} Glasgow on 20 October, in which he no doubt hoped to reconcile loyal obedience to the King {{with the establishment of}} a non-political Presbyterian clergy. That parliament never met. Charles had been defeated at the Battle of Naseby on 14 June, and Montrose <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> his aid if there was to be still a king to proclaim. David Leslie, the best of the Scottish generals, was promptly dispatched against Montrose to anticipate the invasion. On 12 September he came upon Montrose, who had been deserted by his Highlanders and was guarded only by a little group of followers, at Philiphaugh. He won an easy victory. Montrose cut his way through to the Highlands; but he failed to organise an army. In September 1646 he embarked for Norway.|$|E
25|$|With {{the death}} of Hugh of Chester in 1101, Gruffudd was able to {{consolidate}} his position in Gwynedd, as much by diplomacy as by force. He met King Henry I of England who granted him the rule of Llŷn, Eifionydd, Ardudwy and Arllechwedd, considerably extending his kingdom. By 1114, he had gained enough power to induce King Henry to invade Gwynedd in a three-pronged attack, one detachment led by King Alexander I of Scotland. Faced by overwhelming force, Gruffudd was obliged {{to pay homage to}} Henry and to pay a heavy fine, but lost no territory. By about 1118, Gruffudd's advancing years meant that most of the fighting, which pushed Gwynedd's borders eastward and southwards, was done by his three sons by his wife Angharad, daughter of Owain ab Edwin of Tegeingl: Cadwallon, Owain Gwynedd and later Cadwaladr. The cantrefs of Rhos and Rhufoniog were annexed in 1118, Meirionnydd captured from Powys in 1123, and Dyffryn Clwyd in 1124. Another invasion by the king of England in 1121 was a military failure. The king <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> terms with Gruffudd and made no further attempt to invade Gwynedd during Gruffudd's reign. The death of Cadwallon in a battle against the forces of Powys near Llangollen in 1132 checked further expansion for the time being.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday 19 November 2011, Youth Challenge International (YCI), in {{partnership}} with local and international organizations celebrated International Men's Day {{for the first time}} in Arusha and Morogoro, Tanzania. In Arusha, YCI, The Umoja Centre, Support for International Change, UMATI, Initiative for Youth Organization and Global Service Corps hosted the event at the Mbauda Open Market Ground. This event was aimed to promote men and boys as positive role models and to educate the community on the role of males and females in health, education, family life, violence and life choices. The event included performances, games, and educational activities. Over 500 youth and other community members came together to acknowledge the roles and responsibilities of men and boys in creating a brighter future for all Tanzanians. To celebrate the event in Morogoro, volunteers, along with partner organization Faraja Trust Fund, held a soccer tournament on with 8 local teams. To qualify to participate in the tournament each team <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> two information sessions on male sexual and reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, gender roles and good governance. YCI and Faraja provided an on-site HIV testing centre, a DJ with music and dancing throughout the day, and drama group performances on the key objectives of International Men's Day. Plans exist for the Tanzanian Men's Rights Organisation (TAMRA) to celebrate International men's day in 2013.|$|E

The Fenerbahçe players were told a draw would be enough {{towards the end of}} the match only to find out that other games went against their favour as Bursaspor beat Beşiktaş 2-1 to get the title. Despite the title loss, Fenerbahçe ended the season with the highest number of clean sheets (10), as well as the joint longest winning streak (8). In July 2011, Fenerbahçe fans invaded the pitch during a {{friendly}} against the Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk. As punishment, Fenerbahçe was sentenced to two Turkish league games in empty stadia. The TFF later allowed those two games to be filled with spectators; the men were barred while women and children under twelve were admitted for free.

500|$|In October 1636 the ministers, {{realizing that}} a {{theological}} tempest was forming in the colony, {{decided to get}} {{to the heart of the}} issue, and held a series of meetings, which also included Hutchinson and some of the magistrates. [...] In order to deal with the theological errors of the Hutchinson group, the ministers first <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a consensus about their own positions, and this they were unable to do. [...] Hutchinson's followers used this impasse to attempt to have Wheelwright appointed as another minister to the Boston church, an expression of their dissatisfaction with Wilson. [...] Winthrop came to Wilson's rescue, as an elder in the church, by invoking a ruling requiring unanimity in a church vote, and was thus able to forestall Wheelwright's appointment there. Instead, Wheelwright was sent about ten miles south to Mount Wollaston to preach.|$|E

500|$|Musically, the remix {{does not}} greatly differ {{from that of}} the {{original}} apart from a new second verse by Ne-Yo. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey praised the track. He wrote {{that it was one of}} the standouts on Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel and that [...] "it's about as close to 'classic' Mariah as 'new' Mariah gets". He complimented Carey's [...] "classy" [...] and [...] "effortless" [...] vocals, and added that Ne-Yo gave the track an emotional [...] "extra dimension". Copsey likened the song to one of Carey's previous singles, [...] "We Belong Together" [...] (2005): [...] "It's a bit of a 'We Belong Together' retread, but it's a thoroughly pleasant 'We Belong Together' retread". Leonie Cooper of The Guardian gave a mixed review of the remix. Although she did not express her dislike for the track, she felt that it was too similar to Carey previous material, writing that it is middle-of-the road [...] "inoffensive semi-soul fodder we've <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> expect from her." [...] Cooper was, however, critical of the decision to include Ne-Yo and that his addition makes the song even more bland.

Having turned due west to close on Beatty's ships, the Invincibles were broadside to the oncoming torpedoes, but Invincible turned north, while Inflexible and Indomitable turned south to present their narrowest profile to the torpedoes.
