5|$|HMS Resistance {{was ordered}} on 14 December 1859 and laid down {{a week later}} by Westwood, Baillie at their {{shipyard}} in Cubitt Town, London. She was launched on 11 April 1861, commissioned in July 1862 and completed on 5 October {{at the cost of}} £258,120. After completion she served in the Channel Fleet until 1864 when she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, the first British ironclad assigned to that fleet. In 1867 the ship was paid off in Portsmouth for refit and re-armament. Resistance recommissioned in 1869 as <b>guardship</b> in the River Mersey and served there until 1873 when she returned to the Channel Fleet. In 1877 the ship resumed her post as Mersey <b>guardship</b> until she was paid off in 1880 at Devonport.|$|E
5|$|In October of that year, Howe was {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet where she remained until December 1896, when she became port <b>guardship</b> at Queenstown. Captain Henry Louis Fleet was in command from January 1900 until she was paid off at Devonport on 12 October 1901, when her entire crew {{was transferred}} to , which took over as the Queenstown <b>guardship.</b> The ship was then assigned to the Reserve Fleet and then fully decommissioned after her last manoeuvres in September 1904. Howe was sold to Thos W Ward for £25,100 on 11 October 1910 and towed to Briton Ferry, Wales, to be broken up in January 1912.|$|E
5|$|She {{served in}} the Channel Fleet until 1868. After a refit and her first major re-armament, Achilles became the <b>guardship</b> at Portland until 1874 when she was again re-armed. Upon its {{completion}} in 1875, the ship became <b>guardship</b> at Liverpool until 1877 when Captain William Hewett, VC, assumed command. In 1878 {{she was one of}} the ships in the Particular Service Squadron which Admiral Geoffrey Hornby took through the Dardanelles at the time of the Russian war scare in June–August 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. Achilles accidentally collided with the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet, , in October 1879, but was only lightly damaged by Alexandras propeller. The ship rejoined the Channel Fleet in 1880 and was paid off in 1885.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} in, but {{will have to}} wait until the agent gets formal {{permission}} from the <b>guardship's</b> commander, who must see our papers first," [...] he said. [...] "As this may take some time, perhaps you had better dine on board." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} book of the Guardians of the Flame fantasy novel series by Joel Rosenberg, [...] "The Sleeping Dragon", selkies are shown to be enslaved by the {{authorities}} of Pandathaway and forced to propel her military <b>guardships</b> through the heavily trapped harbor bay.|$|R
5000|$|His {{subsequent}} appointments {{were to the}} [...] on 2 May 1785, {{and then}} the [...] on 6 July 1786, both 74's stationed as <b>guardships</b> at Plymouth, commanded by Captain Anthony Molloy. On 16 June 1790, {{he moved to the}} , under Captain Peter Rainier, fitting out at Spithead for the East Indies.|$|R
5|$|After a brief {{deployment}} {{with the}} Channel Squadron upon commissioning in 1867, Lord Warden {{was transferred to}} the Mediterranean Squadron later that year. She became the squadron flagship in 1869 and retained that duty until 1875 when she returned home for a refit. Upon recommissioning in 1876, the ship became the <b>guardship</b> of the First Reserve in the Firth of Forth. Lord Warden was mobilised in 1878 when war with Russia seemed imminent during the Russo-Turkish War. She was paid off in 1885 and broken up in 1889.|$|E
5|$|HMS Howe was an Admiral-class ironclad {{battleship}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the 1880s. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Channel Fleet in mid-1890 and was badly damaged when she ran aground in late 1892. After repairs were completed, Howe was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in late 1893. She returned home in late 1896 and became a <b>guardship</b> in Ireland. Howe remained there until late 1901 when she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet. The ship was paid off in three years later and then sold for scrap in 1910.|$|E
5|$|Henri IV was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy {{built to}} test {{some of the}} ideas of the prominent naval architect Louis-Émile Bertin. She began World War I as <b>guardship</b> at Bizerte. She was sent to reinforce the Allied naval force in the Dardanelles campaign of 1915, although some of her secondary armament had been removed for transfer to Serbia in 1914. Afterwards, she was relegated to second-line roles before being sent to Taranto as a depot ship in 1918. She was struck from the navy list in 1920 and scrapped the following year.|$|E
50|$|Twelve days later, Perry {{launched}} an all-out assault against Tabasco, {{the last remaining}} large port commanded by the Mexicans on the Gulf coast. Although captured earlier by American forces, Tabasco had fallen again to Mexican hands. After leaving <b>guardships</b> at Coatzacoalcos and Tuxpan, Perry arrived off Frontera on 14 June 1847, {{at the mouth of}} the river which led to Tabasco.|$|R
2500|$|On 17 March Morgiana and [...] were {{stationed}} at St. Helens as <b>guardships.</b> On 28 March Morgiana sailed from Portsmouth for Jersey returning on 26 April with seamen. On 5 May the Admiralty ordered Morgiana, then at Portsmouth, prepared and provisioned for foreign service, {{believed to be}} the West Indies, and to sail immediately to Plymouth. Later in the year she sailed for the Mediterranean.|$|R
60|$|Crowd all {{sail for}} Malaga, then; there perhaps a {{regiment}} will join us; there,--or if not, we are but lost! Fancy need not paint a more tragic situation {{than that of}} Torrijos, the unfortunate gallant man, in the gray of this morning, first of December, 1831,--his last free morning. Noble game is afoot, afoot at last; and all the hunters have him in their toils.--The <b>guardships</b> gain upon Torrijos; he cannot even reach Malaga; has to run ashore {{at a place called}} Fuengirola, not far from that city;--the <b>guardships</b> seizing his vessels, so soon as he is disembarked. The country is all up; troops scouring the coast everywhere: no possibility of getting into Malaga with a party of Fifty-five. He takes possession of a farmstead (Ingles, the place is called); barricades himself there, but is speedily beleaguered with forces hopelessly superior. He demands to treat; is refused all treaty; is granted six hours to consider, shall then either surrender at discretion, or be forced to do it. Of course he does it, having no alternative; and enters Malaga a prisoner, all his followers prisoners. Here had the Torrijos Enterprise, and all that was embarked upon it, finally arrived.|$|R
5|$|Hizen {{supported}} the Japanese {{intervention in the}} Russian Civil War in 1918 and was often stationed in Vladivostok as a <b>guardship.</b> On 1 September 1921 she was reclassified as a 1st class coast defence ship and disarmed at Sasebo in April 1922 {{in accordance with the}} Washington Naval Treaty. She was stricken on 20 September 1923 and sunk as a target ship in the Bungo Channel on 25 July 1924.|$|E
5|$|Jauréguiberry {{was in the}} Mediterranean when World War I {{began and}} she spent most of 1914 escorting troop convoys from North Africa and India to France. She {{supported}} French troops during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915 before she became <b>guardship</b> at Port Said from 1916 {{for the rest of}} the war. Upon her return to France in 1919 she became an accommodation hulk until 1932. She was sold for scrapping in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Fleet {{conducted}} another fruitless {{sweep of}} the North Sea in late December and, while trying to enter Scapa Flow in a Force 8 gale and minimal visibility, Monarch was accidentally rammed by Conqueror on 27 December. The former had to unexpectedly manoeuvre to avoid a <b>guardship</b> at the entrance and Conqueror could not avoid her. Monarch suffered moderate damage to her stern and received temporary repairs at Scapa before proceeding to Devonport for full repairs on 4 January 1915, rejoining the Grand Fleet on 20 January.|$|E
5000|$|At 19:16 on 13 June 1917, the {{steamship}} [...] {{was standing}} out of New York Harbor {{in a thick}} fog and collided with Amphitrite, suffering damage below the waterline. Attempting to clear, Manchuria scraped the <b>guardship's</b> bow, and her propeller strut fouled her cable, holding her fast for 20 minutes. Manchuria lowered her boats and abandoned ship; two section patrol boats and a motor sailer stood by and took life boats in tow. Ultimately, Manchuria was towed and beached off Tompkinsville, while Amphitrite continued her net-tending duties.|$|R
5000|$|Apart from {{specially}} built coastal defence ships, some navies used various obsolescent {{ships in}} this role. The Royal Navy deployed four s as <b>guardships</b> in the Humber {{at the start}} of the First World War. Similarly, the U.S. Navy redesignated the [...] and [...] classes as [...] "Coast Defense Battleships" [...] in 1919. Such ships tended to be near the end of their service lives and while generally considered no longer fit for front-line service, they were still powerful enough for defensive duties in reserve situations.|$|R
50|$|The {{second in}} command in the Mediterranean was Rear-Admiral Richard Lestock. Mathews knew Lestock from their time at Chatham Dockyard, when Mathews had been the Commissioner and Lestock had {{commanded}} the <b>guardships</b> stationed in the Medway. The two had not been on good terms, and Lestock had hoped to receive the command of the Mediterranean fleet himself - he had been acting commander for several weeks after Nicholas Haddock was recalled. On receiving the Mediterranean posting, Mathews requested that Lestock be recalled to Britain. Lestock also asked to be reassigned, requesting the command of the West Indies fleet instead. The Admiralty declined to act upon either request.|$|R
5|$|HMS Collingwood was {{the lead}} ship of her class of ironclad battleships built for the Royal Navy during the 1880s. The ship's {{essential}} design became the standard {{for most of the}} following British battleships. Completed in 1887, she spent the next two years in reserve before she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet for the next eight years. After returning home in 1897, the ship spent the next six years as a <b>guardship</b> in Ireland. Collingwood was not significantly damaged during an accidental collision in 1899 and was paid off four years later. The ship was sold for scrap in 1909 and subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|Iwami was {{assigned}} to the 1st Fleet on 26 November 1907 although she participated in the 1908 naval maneuvers as part of the 2nd Fleet before rejoining the 1st Fleet the following year. On 1 September 1912, the ship was reclassified as a second-class coastal defense ship. Shortly after the start of World War I in 1914, Iwami {{was assigned}} to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet, formed from captured Russian ships. The division blockaded the port and bombarded German defenses during the Siege of Tsingtao in August–November 1914. In 1915 Iwami was a <b>guardship</b> at Kure, but she did participate in that year's naval maneuvers and subsequent fleet review.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1800, Agamemnon {{was damaged}} {{when she ran}} onto the Penmarks Rocks. She came into Falmouth on 25 March 1800. On her way to port she had {{encountered}} , which assisted her and accompanied her into port. With {{the assistance of the}} crews from two sloops, the <b>guardship</b> , and troops from Pendennis Castle at the pumps, the crew managed to stop the water level in the hold rising any further. Agamemnon made for Plymouth for repairs. Movement caused the leak to gain on the men at the pumps once more, and when she was off Penlee Point, Agamemnon fired a gun for assistance. When she reached Plymouth she was lashed to a sheer hulk to prevent her sinking.|$|E
60|$|It was on {{the last}} night of November, 1831, that they all set forth; Torrijos with Fifty-five companions; and in two small vessels {{committed}} themselves to their nigh-desperate fortune. No sentry or official person had noticed them; it was from the Spanish Consul, next morning, that the British Governor first heard they were gone. The British Governor knew nothing of them; but apparently the Spanish officials were much better informed. Spanish <b>guardships,</b> instantly awake, gave chase to the two small vessels, which were making all sail towards Malaga; and, on shore, all manner of troops and detached parties were in motion, to render a retreat to Gibraltar by land impossible.|$|R
5|$|From 21 February 1917, Bodrog and Körös were {{deployed}} as <b>guardships</b> at Brăila. On 1 March, Bodrog became stuck in ice at nearby Măcin. LSL Guido Taschler took command of Bodrog in 1918. That year's spring thaw saw Bodrog, Körös, Szamos, Bosna {{and several other}} vessels sent through {{the mouth of the}} Danube into the Black Sea as part of Flottenabteilung Wulff (Fleet Division Wulff) under the command of Flottenkapitän (Fleet Captain) Olav Wulff, arriving in Odessa on 12 April. On 15 July, she and Bosna sailed to the port of Nikolaev, and from 5 August, Bodrog was stationed at Cherson. On 12 September, she returned to Brăila along with other vessels.|$|R
25|$|The {{son of a}} {{distinguished}} naval officer, Jonathan Faulknor continued the family tradition and forged {{a career in the}} navy. He was made an officer prior to the Seven Years' War and commanded his first ships before it ended. His service was punctuated by periods without command of a ship, and times as captain of <b>guardships.</b> Nevertheless he was able to impress his superiors with his services, including his cool handling of a crisis when his ship ran aground off Cork. He was back in command of ships during the American War of Independence, and was flag captain to Admiral Keppel at the battle of Ushant in 1778. He captained several other ships during the war, relieving Gibraltar in 1782 with Howe and seeing action at the Battle of Cape Spartel.|$|R
5|$|The ships {{received}} electric dynamos and searchlights {{were installed}} in the late 1870s. Their boilers were replaced in {{during the winter of}} 1881–82. Steam-powered steering gear was {{installed in the}} sisters in 1887 and they were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads on 13 February 1892. By this time, their role in Russian war plans was to defend the Gulf of Riga against an anticipated German amphibious landing. A few years later they often served with the fleet's Artillery Training Detachment. Admiral Lazarev was transferred to the port of Libava as a <b>guardship</b> during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05.|$|E
5|$|A large repair {{was carried}} out at Plymouth Dock (i.e. Devonport) for the sum of £78,909 between March 1814 and March 1816, but {{with the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars she was laid up for a number of years. Canopus was fitted for sea at Devonport in May 1834, and {{underwent}} further repairs between December 1839 and May 1842. She was prepared for sea again in early 1845, spending time under the command of Fairfax Moresby, before being laid up at Devonport in 1848. She was fitted out there as a receiving ship between June and October 1862, and served as a tender to , the Devonport <b>guardship.</b> Canopus became a mooring hulk in 1869, with her masts being removed in April 1878. She was finally sold after 89 years service with the Royal Navy in October 1887 to J. Pethick, and was broken up.|$|E
5|$|Amiral Charner {{spent most}} of her career in the Mediterranean, {{although}} she was sent to China during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900–01. Together with her sisters, Chanzy and Latouche-Tréville, the ship was assigned to the International Squadron off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 to protect French interests and citizens. With the exception of Bruix, the sisters {{spent most of}} {{the first decade of the}} 20th century as training ships or in reserve. Bruix served in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, and in the Far East before World War I. In 1902 she aided survivors of the devastating eruption of Mount Pelée on the island of Martinique and spent several years as <b>guardship</b> at Crete, protecting French interests in the region in the early 1910s. Chanzy was transferred to French Indochina in 1906. She ran aground off the Chinese coast in mid-1907, where she proved impossible to refloat and was destroyed in place after her crew was rescued without loss.|$|E
5000|$|If war was declared, or {{an enemy}} fleet was sighted, the guard ships could become fully manned {{and ready for}} sea {{in a matter of}} hours or days, as opposed to the months it could take to recommission a ship [...] "in ordinary". This was of {{greatest}} utility to the British prior to the outbreak of the War of Jenkins' Ear against Spain. On 10 July, 1739 King George II authorised preparations for a maritime assault on Spanish colonies. For this purpose, Admiral Edward Vernon was able to assemble a fleet of eight fully armed and provisioned <b>guardships</b> within ten days of the Royal Command. The fleet was so quickly assembled that it reached the Spanish West Indies on 22 October, one day before war was formally declared.|$|R
2500|$|He was {{commander}} {{there for}} three years, flying his flag aboard the 84-gun HMS Royal William during the Spanish armament in 1790. During the crisis he received orders from the Admiralty to prepare the <b>guardships</b> for sea. He had them fitted and ready for manning within five days, and on being ordered to fit a further five ships for sea, completed the task in fourteen days. His rapid response attracted French attention, who reported in their newspapers that 'British ships of war [...] sprung up complete like mushrooms.' With {{the passing of the}} crisis Roddam struck his flag in 1792. With the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars Roddam received a promotion to admiral of the blue on 1 February 1793. He was promoted to admiral of the white on 12 April 1794, and admiral of the red on 9 November 1805.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{proposals}} {{were made in}} the 1900s to reconstruct them and replace their obsolete armor and guns, but none of these were carried out. Ekaterina II and Chesma were both eventually sunk as target ships after being decommissioned in 1907, but both Sinop and Georgii Pobedonosets were converted into artillery training ships before becoming <b>guardships</b> at Sevastopol before World War I. There they spent most of the war and were captured by the Germans in 1918, who eventually turned them over to the British who sabotaged their engines when they abandoned the Crimea in 1919. Immobile they were captured by both the Whites and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. Sinop was abandoned when Wrangel's fleet sailed for Bizerte, but Georgii Pobedonosets was towed there. Sinop was scrapped beginning in 1922 by the Soviets while Georgii Pobedonosets was eventually scrapped in Bizerte beginning in 1930 by the French.|$|R
5|$|Balchen was {{exchanged}} {{almost immediately}} {{and the court}} martial, once again, exonerated him from all blame {{for the loss of}} his ship. He was rewarded for his bravery with command of HMS Colchester in 1710, in which, on 9 November, Balchen secured his first prize, a 20-gun French privateer which he outran in a gale. In 1712 and 1713, Balchen was in the Mediterranean under Sir John Jennings and returned home in 1713 for a period of unemployment on shore. With the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1715, Balchen was returned to sea in the 40-gun frigate HMS Diamond, which he used in the suppression of piracy in the West Indies until 1716. The same year, he received the shore position commanding the <b>guardship</b> HMS Orford in the Medway.|$|E
5|$|Black Prince {{was ordered}} on 6 October 1859 from Robert Napier and Sons in Govan, Glasgow {{for the price}} of £377,954. The ship was laid down on 12 October 1859 and {{launched}} 27 February 1861. Her completion was delayed by a drydock accident at Greenock while fitting out, which damaged her masts. She steamed to Spithead in November 1861 with only jury-rigged fore and mizzenmasts. The ship was commissioned in June 1862, but was not completed until 12 September 1862. Black Prince was assigned to the Channel Fleet until 1866, then spent a year as flagship on the Irish coast. Overhauled and rearmed in 1867–68, she became <b>guardship</b> on the River Clyde. The routine of that duty was interrupted in 1869 when she and Warrior towed a large floating drydock from Madeira to Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|During 1783, Curtis {{was sent}} to Morocco to renew {{treaties}} with the country and then remained in Gibraltar, accepting the Spanish peace treaty delegates at the war's end. Brilliant was paid off in 1784, although Curtis remained in employment during the peace, commanding HMS Ganges as <b>guardship</b> at Portsmouth. In 1787 he was placed on half-pay, {{although it has been}} speculated that during this period he conducted a secret mission to Scandinavia to ensure British supplies on naval materials from the region in the event of war. In the Spanish armament of 1790, Curtis was briefly made flag captain of HMS Queen Charlotte under Howe, but soon transferred to HMS Brunswick. As captain of Brunswick, Curtis had to deal with an outbreak of a deadly and infectious fever. He was successful in controlling the disease and later published and advisory pamphlet on techniques for other officers to follow when faced with contagion aboard their ships.|$|E
50|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war with}} Spain and the imminent threat of war with France {{during the early stages}} of the War of the Austrian Succession led to Mathews' return to active service, with a promotion directly to vice-admiral of the red on 13 March 1741. He was given a command in the Mediterranean, and made plenipotentiary to Charles Emmanuel III, king of Sardinia, and the other courts of Italy. The appointment was somewhat unexpected, Mathews was not especially distinguished, and had not served in the navy for a number of years. His second in command in the Mediterranean was Rear-Admiral Richard Lestock, a man Mathews knew from his time as commissioner at Chatham, when Lestock had commanded the <b>guardships</b> stationed in the Medway. The two had not been on good terms, and on receiving the Mediterranean posting, Mathews requested that Lestock be recalled, a request the Admiralty declined to act upon.|$|R
500|$|Bellerophon {{anchored}} off Brixham on {{the morning}} of 24 July, and there Maitland received orders from Admiral Lord Keith to [...] "prevent every person whatever from coming on board the ship you command, except the officers and men who compose her crew." [...] Despite turning away the shore boats which approached the anchored warship bringing fresh bread and fruit to sell, word eventually leaked out that Napoleon was aboard the ship. The news created a sensation, and large numbers of boats filled with sightseers soon surrounded the ship. Occasionally Napoleon would come out to look at them, but despite entreaties from some people to be allowed on board, Maitland refused to allow any contact between ship and shore. On 26 July Bellerophon received orders to proceed to Plymouth harbour where Lord Keith was anchored aboard his flagship [...] Napoleon remained on board Bellerophon and the ship was kept isolated from the throngs of curious sightseers by two <b>guardships,</b> [...] and , anchored close at hand.|$|R
25|$|Wood's replacement, in May 1797, was Commander S. Powell. Some months later, in July, Commander James Hanson assumed command. Then Thomas Pitt, Lieutenant Lord Camelford, took command, {{replacing}} Hanson, who {{had taken}} ill. Although Camelford was apparently appointed in January, he had been acting captain for some time. On 13 January 1798, Camelford shot and killed Lieutenant Charles Peterson, acting captain of Perdrix for mutiny, {{in a dispute over}} which of them was senior to the other. At the time, both vessels were in English Harbour, Antigua, serving as <b>guardships.</b> What triggered the dispute was the departure from the harbour on the previous day of , whose captain, Jemmet Mainwaring, had previously been the senior officer in the port. Peterson had been first lieutenant under Camelford for three months when Camelford had taken over Favourite, even though Peterson was senior on the lieutenants list and represented Captain Fahie of Perdrix, who was away in St. Kitts. The two ships' companies almost fired on each other when Camelford shot Petersen. Captain Henry Mitford of Matilda arrived that evening and put Camelford under arrest. Mitford put Lieutenant Parsons of Favourite in command of Perdrix and sent her out to sea. The subsequent court martial acquitted Camelford.|$|R
