5000|$|Erythema multiforme (EM) is a skin {{condition}} of unknown cause; it {{is a type}} of erythema possibly mediated by deposition of immune complexes (mostly IgM-bound complexes) in the superficial microvasculature of the skin and oral mucous membrane that usually follows an infection or drug exposure.

40|$|Background: <b>Erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> is {{an acute}} disease {{on the skin}} and mucous membrane. This lesion can erupt in mucous {{membranes}} of the oral cavity. Improper and late treatment may cause Stevens Johnson syndrome which may cause patient mortality, therefore proper and accurate diagnosis are needed. Purpose: The immunopathological aspect of oral <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> through literature study can help us to find the definite diagnosis and to know the differential diagnosis. review: In immunopathology, <b>minor</b> type of <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> is vasculitis caused by the immune complex hypersensitivity reaction among antigen antibodies. The mayor type of <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> may appeared from autoimmune reaction and from untreated <b>minor</b> type of <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme.</b> Conclusion: Immunopathological approach of <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> is important beside the clinical manifestation, histology, and the differential diagnosis to find the definitive diagnosis. </span...|$|R

40|$|<b>Erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> is {{an acute}} muco-cutaneous {{hypersensitivity}} reaction {{with a variety}} of etiologies. It is characterized by a skin eruption, with or without oral or other mucous membrane lesions. 1 - 3 It can be induced by drug intake (Box 1) or several infections, in particular herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, 1 which has been identified in up to 70 % of <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> cases. 4 When HSV infection is implicated, the diagnosis is herpes-associated <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme.</b> In these cases, recurrent episodes of <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> are usually related to HSV infection. 5 A study by Ng and colleagues 6 detected HSV DNA in 50 % of patients with recurrent idiopathic <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme.</b> <b>Erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> typically affects teenagers and young adults (20 – 40 years), but the onset may be as late as 50 years of age o...|$|R

40|$|Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute, self-lim-ited illness {{characterized}} by the presentation and distinctive distribution of fi xed red papules. 1, 2 Over time, these primary lesions typically grow larger and produce well demarcated plaques that undergo variable concentric changes; some have central blisters with a necrotic blister roof, while others have areas of central epidermal necrosis without circumscribed blister formation. Because of their annular appearance, complete with red border and a central white-gray area, these lesions are known as “iris ” or “target ” lesions. 3 Although {{there has been some}} debate about the accuracy of the classification scheme, 2 EM is clas-sically separated into two clinical forms. 4 <b>Erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> <b>minor</b> is {{characterized by}} symmetric involvement of the extremities and predominantly aff ects the extensor surfaces, usually sparing the trunk and mucous membranes. Th e duration of EM minor from onset to healing ranges from 2 to 4 weeks. 3 In contrast, the course of EM major is longer; healing occurs within 6 weeks in most cases. 3 Erythema multiforme major is also known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS); in SJS, the mucous membranes are heavily aff ected. 3 - 5 Generally, two or more mucosal surfaces are aff ected, including the ocular, nasal, buccal, and anogenital mucosae. 3, 5 In extreme cases, complications can include visual impairment, systemic symptoms, and damage to the internal viscera. 3, 4 Causes Both type III and type IV host-specifi c hypersensi-tivity reactions have been put forth as the possible Use of steroids for erythema multiforme in childre...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Sorafenib {{is one of}} the few {{standard}} {{agents for}} metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Although sorafenib-induced <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> is rarely reported, we evaluated the cases of <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> induced by sorafenib for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Methods: From November 2006 to November 2011, 36 eligible patients who had been treated with sorafenib were enrolled in this study. Patients received sorafenib 200 or 400 mg orally, twice daily, at 12 h intervals, on a continuous dosing schedule. All patients who experi-enced rash or <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> underwent a skin biopsy, and the histopathological diag-nosis was confirmed. Results: Twenty-eight patients (78 %) experienced a skin reaction of any toxicity grade. Hand-foot skin reactions occurred in 17 (47 %), <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> in 9 (25 %), rash/ desquamation in 6 (17 %) and alopecia in 9 (25 %). Skin biopsy was performed and histo-pathological diagnosis was confirmed for all nine patients (25 %) who experienced <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme.</b> All nine showed a positive reaction to sorafenib on a subsequent patch test. Conclusions: Sorafenib-induced <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> may not be rare in Japanese patients. Patients who once showed <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> after sorafenib treatment are never to be treated with sorafenib again. Patients treated with sorafenib should be monitored carefully, with a multidisciplinary approach. Consultation with a dermatologist is critical because some cases quickly become severe.

A strong association with HLA-DQ 3 has been documented in patients with recurrent <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme.</b> We have performed HLA typing in 39 patients with recurrent <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme,</b> of whom 33 were associated with herpes simplex virus infection. The results were compared with 309 controls. In the recurrent <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> patients there was a statistically significant increase in HLA-B 62 and HLA-B 35. An increase in HLA-DR 53 was also found, although this did not reach statistical significance. There was no increase in HLA-A 33. The presence of HLA-DQ 3 in the study population approached that in the controls. Finally, the study population demonstrated a trend towards a reduction in the HLA antigens A 1, B 8, and DR 3. The study confirms the previously reported associations with HLA-B 62 (B 15), HLA-B 35 and HLA-DR 53. We have been unable to confirm an association of HLA-A 33 or HLA-DQ 3 with <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme.</b> The HLA antigens A 1, B 8, and DR 3 are associated with autoimmune disease, reflecting an increased host response to tissue self antigens.

40|$|The {{specificity}} and {{incidence of}} deposits of immunoglobulin and complement {{in the walls}} of vessels in the superficial cutaneous microvasculature were evaluated in a prospective study of consecutive skin biopsy specimens submitted for evaluation by direct immunofluorescence. Of 597 specimens, 32 showed granular deposits of C 3, either alone or associated with immunoglobulin in the vessels of the papillary dermis. In most cases, the immunoglobulin was identified as IgM. Rheumatoid arthritis was identified as the diagnosis in 19 % of patients who were biopsied, while syndromes of vasculitis, connective tissue diseases and <b>erythema</b> <b>multiforme</b> were the diagnoses in 28 %, 28 % and 16 % of the biopsies respectively.
