40|$|The <b>human</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> PRAME (preferentially {{expressed}} antigen in melanoma) {{is frequently}} overexpressed during oncogenesis, and high PRAME levels {{are associated with}} poor clinical outcome {{in a variety of}} cancers. However, the molecular pathways in which PRAME is implicated are not well understood. We recently characterized PRAME as a BC-box subunit of a Cullin 2 -based E 3 ubiquitin ligase. In this study, we mined the PRAME interactome to a deeper level and identified specific interactions with OSGEP and LAGE 3, which are human orthologues of the ancient EKC/KEOPS complex. By characterizing biochemically the human EKC complex and its interactions with PRAME, we show that PRAME recruits a Cul 2 ubiquitin ligase to EKC. Moreover, EKC subunits associate with PRAME target sites on chromatin. Our data reveal a novel link between the oncoprotein PRAME and the conserved EKC complex and support a role for both complexes in the same pathways...|$|E
40|$|A first BAGE (B {{melanoma}} antigen) gene, BAGE 1, {{was identified}} because it encodes a <b>human</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> recognised by a cytolytic T lymphocyte. Here, we characterised five new BAGE genes mapping to the juxtacentromeric regions of human chromosomes 13 and 21 and nine BAGE gene fragments mapping to the juxtacentromeric regions of chromosomes 9, 13, 18, and 21. Genes and gene fragments share extensive regions of 90 - 99 % nucleotide identity. We analysed {{the expression of}} BAGE genes on 215 tumours of various histological types and on nine normal tissues. Similar to BAGE 1, the new BAGE genes are expressed in melanomas, bladder and lung carcinomas {{and in a few}} tumours of other histological types. All the normal tissues were negative, with the exception of testis. Our results show that human juxtacentromeric regions harbour genes, which are transcribed and translated, in addition to gene fragments that are generally not expressed. We suggest that the pattern of expression restricted to cancer/testis is a feature of the few genes mapping to juxtacentromeric regions...|$|E
40|$|Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a 180 -kDa {{glycoprotein}} {{found on}} the surface of normal colon and malignant human adenocarcinomas. Recently, a fusion protein containing two of the seven Ig-like domains present in CEA (N and A 3) has been constructed and expressed in Pichia pastoris [You, Hefta, Yazaki, Wu and Shively (1998) Anticancer Res. 18, 3193 3201]. Here, we report the generation and selection of a multi-copy clone expressing this fusion protein, the optimization of the shake-flask expression protocol and the upscaled production of CEA N-A 3 using fermentation technology. P. pastoris transformants secreting the CEA N-A 3 domain were generated by electrotransformation of the GS 115 host strain with the pPIC 9 K vector containing the CEA N-A 3 cDNA [You, Hefta, Yazaki, Wu and Shively (1998) Anticancer Res. 18, 3193 3201] then screened for CEA N-A 3 expression and G 418 resistance. The recombinant CEA N-A 3 domain was detected in the culture supernatant using the monoclonal anti-CEA antibody T 84. 66. Optimization of methanol-induction conditions resulted in a high-methanol shake-flask expression protocol yielding significantly increased CEA N-A 3 levels. Fermentation and culture conditions were optimized for 5 -l working-volume fermentations and CEA N-A 3 was affinity purified using Ni-IDA (imino di-acetic acid) affinity chromatography from the clarified fermentation supernatant. Peptide N-glycosidase F treatment revealed that the recombinant protein was heavily glycosylated but expressed as a single polypeptide of 28 kDa with no evidence of proteolytic degradation. Our results demonstrate that functional CEA N-A 3 domain can be produced in sufficient quantities in P. pastoris for structural analysis or diagnostic applications.

40|$|Mucins {{are high}} {{molecular}} weight glycoproteins that provide a protective layer on epithelial surfaces and are involved in cell-cell interactions, signalling, and metastasis. The membrane-bound MUC 1 mucin is expressed in normal mucosas and the aberrant expression of its under-glycosylated forms {{has been reported in}} various carcinomas of the epithelium. MUC 1 is a <b>human</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> expressed in breast, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. Agents able to bind tightly and specifically to the surface of malignant cells would greatly benefit cancer diagnosis and treatment, whereas the targeting of cell surface receptors would have significant implications on inflammation and immunity. While antibodies have the ability to specifically recognise some tumour cell markers, their large size and own immunogenicity markedly limit their pharmacological value. The development of nuclease resistant DNA molecules, termed aptamers, has provided a new alternative to antibodies. Using the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) methodology, one can generate vast libraries of oligonucleotide ligands (DNA, RNA, or unnatural products), screened rapidly for specific sequences that have appropriate binding affinities and specificities to the clinically relevant marker. We have identified synthetic DNA oligonucleotide aptamers that bind to the MUC 1 tumour marker with low nanomolar affinity via the 20 tandem repeat sequence of the MUCI. These specific aptamers were selected from an initial library that contained a degenerate region of 25 bases to result in 425 random- sequence DNA molecules. Ten rounds of in vitro selection and amplification were performed, to confer affinity maturation of aptamers for MUCI. Selected aptamers were cloned, sequenced and found to be sharing some unique consensus sequences. The affinity of each aptamer for MUC 1 was studied by qualitative and quantitated methods such as ELISA, BIAcore, and EMSA. Affinities on the nanomolar range have been identified and confirmed. Efforts in our laboratory are now focusing on optimization of their delivery, functionality and structural properties. Fluorescent labelled aptamers have been successfully used in the identification of MUC 1 expressing tumour cell lines such as the MCF 7 breast tumour cell line and can be used in future diagnostic assays, whereas radiolabelled aptamers can be used clinically to enable imaging and therapy of the tumour marker bearing cancer cells. ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{now clear}} that many <b>human</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> can be {{recognised}} by the immune system. These <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> can be classified into several groups including cancer-testis, differentiation, tissue specific, over-expressed, and viralassociated antigens. In many cases, there is a known molecular basis of carcinogenesis which provides the explanation for the differentiated expression of these <b>antigens</b> in <b>tumours</b> compared with normal cells. Improved understanding of the biology of the immune response, particularly of immune recognition and activation of T-cells, allow better design of vaccines. Pre-clinical comparative studies allow evaluation of optimal vaccine strategies which can then be delivered to the clinic. Currently, a range of cancer vaccines are being tested including those using tumour cells, proteins, peptides, viral vectors, DNA or dendritic cells. Ultimately, this research should give rise to an entirely new modality of cancer treatments.

40|$|The {{generation}} of tumour-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses {{is the primary}} focus {{in the design of}} immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines. We have recently demonstrated {{generation of}} ovalbumin (OVA) -specific CTLs and tumour-protection in a murine tumour model using vaccination with dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with E. coli expressing listeriolysin O (LLO) and OVA as a model antigen. In this system paraformaldehyde fixation of E. coli/LLO provided an additional safety feature without compromising vaccine efficacy. We therefore reasoned that paraformaldehyde-fixed recombinant E. coli expressing LLO would be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of <b>human</b> <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> to <b>human</b> DCs. In the present study, we demonstrate that fixed E. coli expressing LLO are taken up efficiently by human monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) with minimal toxicity. As a consequence of the interaction with bacteria, human DCs undergo marked phenotypic and functional maturation. Furthermore, we show that fixed E. coli/LLO expressing the well-characterised human melanoma antigen, MART 1, efficiently deliver the HLA-A 2 -restricted MART 127 - 35 epitope for processing and presentation on human MoDCs, suggesting the potential of this system as a novel strategy for <b>human</b> <b>tumour</b> immunotherapy...|$|R

40|$|During past decades, many {{attempts}} have been made to induce or enhance tumour-specific T-cell immunity in cancer patients by vaccination. However, it has become apparent that in a large number of cases the naturally occurring tumour-specific T-cell repertoire is of low affinity and therefore inefficient in mediating tumour rejection. Because of the potential therapeutic value of high affinity TCRs with tumour/lineage specificities, we set out to develop a number of new technologies that can be used to create improved tumour-specific T-cell immunity. These strategies entail: (i) the efficient expansion of low affinity T cells specific for self antigens through the use of variant peptides with improved TCR-binding characteristics; (ii) a retroviral library-based technology to improve the affinity of (self-specific) T-cell receptors in vitro, and (iii) proof of principle for the feasibility of TCR gene transfer as a means to generate T-cell populations with a desired antigen-specificity in vivo.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the results {{reviewed}} here, there are two major mechanisms whereby <b>tumour</b> rejection <b>antigens</b> may arise. The first mechanism is mutational. Point mutations occurring in a large variety of genes may produce new antigenic peptides, either by providing them with the ability to bind to MHC class I molecules or by providing them with a new epitope (Fig. 2). The second mechanism is the activation of a gene that is silent in normal tissues and for which no strong natural tolerance has been established. Plausible candidates for the mutational mechanism are the "tumour specific transplantation antigens" observed on methylcholanthrene induced tumours and tumours induced by ultraviolet light. The diversity of these antigens appears to be very large, like that of the tum- <b>antigens.</b> Moreover, these <b>tumours</b> have been obtained with high doses of carcinogens, which are proven mutagens. On the other hand, a P 815 <b>tumour</b> rejection <b>antigen</b> appears to arise through the activation of a silent gene, and it may turn out that this is the rule for most <b>tumour</b> rejection <b>antigens.</b> It is our hope that other genes coding for mouse and <b>human</b> <b>tumour</b> rejection <b>antigens</b> will soon be identified, so that it will become clear whether the activational mechanism is the rule or the exception. In our view, this is a crucial issue. Insofar as <b>tumour</b> rejection <b>antigens</b> result from mutations, they may be highly specific for every individual tumour. The tumour specific nature of these antigens would then be easily ascertained. However, active immunization of cancer patients would require that a tumour cell line be obtained from each patient, a most unpractical prospect. If, on the other hand, production of <b>tumour</b> rejection <b>antigens</b> results from the activation of a normal gene, then there is a good probability that the same gene may be activated in many different tumours, being perhaps preferentially shared by tumours of the same histological type. This would probably not result in the expression of the same antigen in all these tumours, because the patients would differ in their presenting molecules, which are determined by their HLA haplotype. However, a subset of the tumours expressing the same "tumour rejection" gene should share the same class I restricting element, so that all of these patients could be immunized with a cell that would express the gene and carry the appropriate HLA molecule...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHybrid cells {{created by}} fusion of <b>antigen</b> {{presenting}} and <b>tumour</b> cells {{have been shown}} to induce potent protective and curative anti-tumour immunity in rodent cancer models. The application of hybrid cell vaccines for <b>human</b> <b>tumour</b> therapy and the timely intervention in disease control are limited by the requirement to derive sufficient autologous cells to preserve homologous <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> presentation. In this study, the efficiency of various methods of electrofusion in generating hybrid human cells have been investigated with a variety of human haemopoietic, breast and prostate cell lines. Cell fusion using an electrical pulse is enhanced by a variety of stimuli to align cells electrically or bring cells into contact. Centrifugation of cells after an exponential pulse from a Gene Pulser electroporation apparatus provided the highest yield of mixed cell hybrids by FACS analysis. An extensive fusogenic condition generated in human cells after an electrical pulse contradicts the presumption that prior cell contact is necessary for cell fusion. Alignment of cells in a concurrent direct current charge and osmotic expansion of cells in polyethylene glycol also generated high levels of cell fusion. Waxing of one electrode of the electroporation cuvette served to polarise the fusion chamber and increase cell fusion 5 -fold. Optimisation of a direct current charge in combination with a fusogenic pulse in which fusion of a range of human cells approached or exceeded 30 % of the total pulsed cells. The yield of hybrid prostate and breast cancer cells with dendritic cells was similar to the homologous cell fusion efficiencies indicating that dendritic cells were highly amenable to fusion with <b>human</b> <b>tumour</b> cells under similar electrical parameters.

Several prime vaccines were trialled with different results, highlighting the importance of priming CD 4 + T cells and avoiding off-target effects. In vivo testing of the vaccine particles in BALB/c mice showed that mice with pre-existing immunity to MLV (those that were “primed” beforehand) had higher antibody responses against the <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> than non-primed mice.

Most studies come from eastern-Asia, where hepatitis-B is the main cause of HCC. However, <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> expression is poorly studied in low-endemic, western areas where the aetiology of HCC differs. Methods: We constructed tissue microarrays from resected HCC tissue of 133 patients. Expression of a comprehensive panel of cancer-testis (MAGE-A 1, MAGE-A 3 / 4, MAGE-A 10, MAGE-C 1, MAGE-C 2, NY-ESO- 1, SSX- 2, sperm protein 17), onco-fetal (AFP, Glypican- 3) and overexpressed <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> (Annexin-A 2, Wilms tumor- 1, Survivin, Midkine, MUC- 1) was determined by immunohistochemistry. Results: A higher prevalence of MAGE antigens was observed in patients with hepatitis-B. Patients with expression of more <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> in general had better HCC-specific survival (P= 0. 022). The four <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> with high expression in HCC and no, or weak, expression in surrounding tumour-free-liver tissue, were Annexin-A 2, GPC- 3, MAGE-C 1 and MAGE-C 2, expressed in 90, 39, 17 and 20 % of HCCs, respectively. Ninety-five percent of HCCs expressed {{at least one of these}} four <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens.</b> Interestingly, GPC- 3 was associated with SALL- 4 expression (P= 0. 001), an oncofetal transcription factor highly expressed in embryonal stem cells. SALL- 4 and GPC- 3 expression levels were correlated with vascular invasion, poor differentiation and higher AFP levels before surgery. Moreover, patients who co-expressed higher levels of both GPC- 3 and SALL- 4 had worse HCC-specific survival (P= 0. 018). Conclusions: We describe a panel of four <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> with excellent coverage and good tumour specificity in a western area, low-endemic for hepatitis-B.

40|$|Abstract Dendritic cells (DC) are {{attractive}} targets for cancer immunotherapy as they initiate strong and long-lived tumour-specific T cell responses.

Cross-presentation of <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> is enhanced with strong adjuvants such as TLR ligands. However, often these adjuvants have off-target effects, and {{would benefit from}} a DC-specific targeting strategy, similar to the <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen.</b> The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a strategy for specifically targeting DC with <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> and adjuvant by using glycoliposomes. We have generated liposomes containing the glycan Lewis(Le) X which is highly specific for the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN expressed by DC. LeX-modified liposomes were taken up by human monocyte-derived DC in a DC-SIGN-specific manner. As adjuvants we incorporated the TLR ligands Pam 3 CySK 4, Poly I:C, MPLA and R 848 into liposomes and compared their adjuvant capacity on DC. Incorporation of the TLR 4 ligand MPLA into glycoliposomes induced DC maturation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in a DC-SIGN-specific manner, and DC activation was comparable to administration of soluble MPLA. Incorporation of MPLA into glycoliposomes significantly enhanced antigen cross-presentation of the melanoma <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> gp 100280 - 288 peptide to CD 8 + T cells compared to non-glycosylated MPLA liposomes. Importantly, antigen cross-presentation of the gp 100280 - 288 peptide was significantly higher using MPLA glycoliposomes compared to the co-administration of soluble MPLA with glycoliposomes. Taken together, our data demonstrates that specific targeting of a gp 100 <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> and the adjuvant MPLA to DC-SIGN-expressing DC enhances the uptake of peptide-containing liposomes, the activation of DC, and induces tumour antigen-specific CD 8 + T cell responses.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are {{attractive}} targets for cancer immunotherapy as they initiate strong and long-lived tumour-specific T cell responses. DC can be effectively targeted in vivo with <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> by using nanocarriers such as liposomes. Cross-presentation of <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> is enhanced with strong adjuvants such as TLR ligands. However, often these adjuvants have off-target effects, and {{would benefit from}} a DC-specific targeting strategy, similar to the <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen.</b> The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a strategy for specifically targeting DC with <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> and adjuvant by using glycoliposomes. We have generated liposomes containing the glycan Lewis(Le) X which is highly specific for the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN expressed by DC. LeX-modified liposomes were taken up by human monocyte-derived DC in a DC-SIGN-specific manner. As adjuvants we incorporated the TLR ligands Pam 3 CySK 4, Poly I:C, MPLA and R 848 into liposomes and compared their adjuvant capacity on DC. Incorporation of the TLR 4 ligand MPLA into glycoliposomes induced DC maturation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in a DC-SIGN-specific manner, and DC activation was comparable to administration of soluble MPLA. Incorporation of MPLA into glycoliposomes significantly enhanced antigen cross-presentation of the melanoma <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> gp 100280 – 288 peptide to CD 8 + T cells compared to non-glycosylated MPLA liposomes.

40|$|Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is an {{attractive}} approach to adjuvant therapy {{in the treatment of}} cancer. Marimastat is the first orally administered, synthetic MMP inhibitor to be evaluated, in this capacity, in the clinic. Measurement of the rate of change of circulating <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> was used for evaluating biological activity and defining optimum dosage in the early clinical trials of marimastat. Although <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> levels have been used in the clinical management of cancer for many years, they have not been validated as markers of disease progression. In order to investigate the relationship between the effects of marimastat on tumour growth and circulating <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> levels, mice bearing the <b>human</b> gastric <b>tumour,</b> MGLVA 1, were treated with marimastat. The MMP inhibitor exerted a significant therapeutic effect, reducing tumour growth rate by 48 % (P = 0. 0005), and increasing median survival from 19 to 30 days (P = 0. 0001). In addition, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were measured in serum samples from animals sacrificed at regular intervals, and correlated with excised tumour weight. It was shown that the natural log of the CEA concentration was linearly related to the natural log of the tumour weight and that treatment was not a significant factor in this relationship (P = 0. 7). In conclusion, circulating CEA levels were not directly affected by marimastat, but did reflect tumour size. These results support the use of cancer antigens as markers of biological activity in early phase trials of non-cytotoxic anticancer agents. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
40|$|Various {{steady state}} and {{inflamed}} tissues {{have been shown}} to contain a heterogeneous DC population consisting of developmentally distinct subsets, including cDC 1 s, cDC 2 s and monocyte-derived DCs, displaying differential functional specializations. The identification of functionally distinct tumour-associated DC (TADC) subpopulations could prove essential for the understanding of basic TADC biology and for envisaging targeted immunotherapies. We demonstrate that multiple mouse tumours as well as <b>human</b> <b>tumours</b> harbour ontogenically discrete TADC subsets. Monocyte-derived TADCs are prominent in <b>tumour</b> <b>antigen</b> uptake, but lack strong T-cell stimulatory capacity due to NO-mediated immunosuppression. Pre-cDC-derived TADCs have lymph node migratory potential, whereby cDC 1 s efficiently activate CD 8 + T cells and cDC 2 s induce Th 17 cells. Mice vaccinated with cDC 2 s displayed a reduced tumour growth accompanied by a reprogramming of pro-tumoural TAMs and a reduction of MDSCs, while cDC 1 vaccination strongly induces anti-tumour CTLs. Our data might prove important for therapeutic interventions targeted at specific TADC subsets or their precursors. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Altered <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> can {{initiate}} cellular and humoral immune responses; {{however, they}} {{often fail to}} eliminate <b>tumours.</b> In <b>humans,</b> the presence of cancer is generally associated with the suppression of T cell activation and effector responses, characterized as a Th 1 to Th 2 biased response. This Th 2 response leads {{to the production of}} tumour-reactive antibodies. Further, neoplastic lesions and biological fluids of cancer patients contain an abundance of tumour-derived exosomes (TDE) expressing <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens.</b> Expression of <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> on TDE may represent an antibody target and serve to block antibody binding to the tumour, implicating a role for these nanovesicles in tumour survival. In this study, ovarian tumour cell proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) and patient-derived antibodies were used to analyse immunoreactivity. Common immunoreactive proteins among ovarian cancer patients were identified by mass spectrometry and six proteins were selected based on recognition and correlation with cancer pathogenesis. The identity of these proteins were confirmed by immunoreactivity of patient-derived antibodies with recombinant proteins and their presence on in vivo and in vitro-derived ovarian tumour exosomes was defined. Analysis of the TDE demonstrated bound tumour-reactive immunoglobulins, exhibiting immunoreactivity with specific antigens, suggesting that patient-derived antibodies recognize <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> on circulating exosomes...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{identification}} of many <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> {{with the potential to}} act as targets for cancer vaccines and/or T-cell therapies very few have been used in clinical trials to date. This led to the timely development of a criteria which identified the ideal characteristics of <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> which should be actively pursued for use in immunotherapy clinical trials. A list of 75 antigens were assessed against these criteria and although none harboured all of the characteristics identified as desirable, a number did show many of the characteristics identifying them as worthy of further pursuit to enable an organised development towards immunotherapy clinical trials. The study highlighted the benefit of focussing on a short list of antigens which would enable the rapid progress of a smaller number of antigens into clinical trials as targets for immunotherapy. However the antigens expressed by solid tumours often differ to those expressed by haematological malignancies, leading to this editorial which states the need for a similar study prioritising <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> for use in clinical trials of haematological malignancies, independently of solid tumours. We also debate the importance of looking for new antigens in cancers in which few targets are known and discuss the importance of <b>tumour</b> <b>antigens</b> as biomarkers of disease diagnosis, stage and survival...|$|R

Six out of 8 GYL tumour bearing nude mice tested had elevated plasma levels of HCG.
