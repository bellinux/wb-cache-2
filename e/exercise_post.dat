40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate whether co-ingestion of carbohydrate and protein as compared with protein alone augments muscle protein synthesis (MPS) during early exercise recovery. Two months old rats performed 10 repetitions of ladder climbing with 75 % of body weight attached to their tails. Placebo (PLA), whey protein (WP), or whey protein plus carbohydrate (CP) was then given to rats by gavage. An additional group of sedentary rats (SED) was used as controls. Blood samples were collected immediately and at either 1 or 2 h after exercise. The flexor hallucis longus muscle was excised at 1 or 2 h <b>post</b> <b>exercise</b> for analysis of MPS and related signaling proteins. MPS was significantly increased by CP compared with PLA (p< 0. 05), and approached significance compared with WP at 1 h <b>post</b> <b>exercise</b> (p = 0. 08). CP yielded a greater phosphorylation of mTOR compared with SED and PLA at 1 h <b>post</b> <b>exercise</b> and SED and WP at 2 h <b>post</b> <b>exercise.</b> CP also increased phosphorylation of p 70 S 6 K compared with SED at 1 and 2 h <b>post</b> <b>exercise.</b> 4 E-BP 1 phosphorylation was inhibited by PLA at 1 h but elevated by WP and CP at 2 h <b>post</b> <b>exercise</b> relative to SED. The phosphorylation of AMPK was elevated by exercise at 1 h <b>post</b> <b>exercise,</b> and this elevated level was sustained only in the WP group at 2 h. The phosphorylation of Akt, GSK 3, and eIF 2 Bε were unchanged by treatments.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the level of compliance with a continued aquatic exercise program following discharge from a limited hospital outpatient aquatic service, and to discover patient perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to ongoing aquatic exercise in the community. Methods: A cross-sectional telephone survey comprising both closed and open-ended questions was conducted. Participants were 25 people who had attended a minimum of six outpatient aquatic physiotherapy sessions. Self-reported compliance with continued aquatic exercise, and descriptions of barriers and facilitators to this were recorded. Responses to open-ended questions were recorded verbatim and thematically analysed by investigators. Results: Eight out of 25 participants were continuing with a community-based aquatic exercise program as instructed (30 %, Wald binomial 95 % confidence interval 1752 %). A range of barriers and facilitators were identified. Major themes for non-compliance included reduced perception of therapeutic outcome from aquatic physiotherapy and external constraints (e. g. transport difficulties and cost associated with access).

These findings suggest that short-term creatine supplementation does not enhance non-enzymatic antioxidant defence or protect against lipid peroxidation induced by exhaustive cycling in healthy males...|$|E
40|$|The American College of Sports Medicine {{guidelines}} on <b>post</b> <b>exercise</b> fluid replacement {{are based on}} studies that used exercise to induce hypohydration(1). However, other rapid weight loss practices such as fluid restriction are frequently adopted by athletes in weight-categorised sports to dehydrate prior to competition(2). The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess whether the method of dehydration would affect subsequent <b>post</b> <b>exercise</b> rehydration.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Elastic bands offer {{variable}} elastic resistance (ER) {{throughout a}} range of motion and their incorporation with exercise movements {{has been used for}} variable strength training and rehabilitation purposes. Objective: Investigate the effect of acute bout of progressive elastic-band exercise on muscle damage and inflammatory response in Taekwondo athletes (TKD) compared with untrained ones. METHODS: Fourteen (TKD, n = 7 and untrained, n = 7) men performed 3 sets of progressive resistance elastic exercise. Blood samples were taken pre-exercise and also immediately and 24 h <b>post</b> <b>exercise.</b> Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, total leukocyte counts, interleukin- 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analyzed. RESULTS: Only DOMS increased in untrained group, but elevation of DOMS was observed in both groups (TKD and untrained) at 24 h after exercise (p< 0. 05). CK and LDH activity increased in both groups significantly. Also TKD group only showed CK increasing 24 h <b>post</b> <b>exercise</b> (p< 0. 05). Total circulating leukocyte counts increased immediately in <b>post</b> <b>exercise</b> experiments and decreased in 24 h ones in both groups (p< 0. 05). Serum IL- 6 immediately increased in both groups and 24 h <b>post</b> <b>exercises</b> but {{there was no significant difference}} between immediate and 24 h <b>post</b> <b>exercise</b> experiments in TKD group. Furthermore, CRP just increased 24 h after exercise in both groups (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Progressive resistance elastic exercise induced muscle damage and inflammation in TKD athletes, but also had smaller changes in comparison with untrained group and other forms of exercise...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the effect of acute plyometric {{exercise}} on indices of muscle damage and collagen breakdown. Nine untrained men performed an intense bout of plyometric jumping exercises (experimental group) and nine men remained at rest (control group). Seven days before and 24, 48, and 72 hours after plyometric exercise or rest, several physiological and biochemical indices of muscle damage and two biochemical indices of collagen damage were determined. No significant changes in concentric and eccentric peak torque of knee extensors and flexors or flexion and extension range of motion were found after the plyometric exercise. Delayed-onset muscle soreness increased 48 hours after exercise. Creatine kinase increased 48 and 72 hours <b>post</b> <b>exercise,</b> whereas lactate dehydrogenase increased 24, 48, and 72 hours <b>post</b> <b>exercise.</b> Serum hydroxyproline increased 24 hours <b>post</b> <b>exercise,</b> peaked at 48 hours, and remained elevated up to 72 hours <b>post</b> <b>exercise.</b> Hydroxylysine (which was measured only before exercise and at 48 hours) was found increased 48 hours <b>post</b> <b>exercise.</b> No differences were found in any physiological or biochemical index in the control group. Intense plyometric exercise increased muscle damage, delayed-onset muscle soreness, and serum indices of collagen breakdown without a concomitant decrease in the functional capacity of muscles. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine levels in serum seem promising measures for describing exercise-induced collagen degradation. Coaches need to keep in mind that by using plyometric activities, despite the increased muscle damage and collagen turnover that follow, it is not necessarily accompanied by decreases in skeletal muscle capacity...|$|R
