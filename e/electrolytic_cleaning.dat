He was {{assigned}} professor of oceanography at the University of Oslo from 1964. His research centered on radioactivity of ocean waters, and on pollution of the oceans. He designed a method for <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cleaning</b> of sewage.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to plating {{either the}} nickel master or nickel mother, {{it needed to}} be passified to prevent the next matrix from {{adhering}} to the mother. There were several methods used; EMI favoured the fairly difficult albumin soaking method whereas CBS Records and Philips used the electrolytic method. Soaking in a dichromate solution was another popular method, however, this method risked contaminating the nickel solution with chrome. The electrolytic method was similar to the standard <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cleaning</b> method except the cycles were reversed finishing the process with the matrix as the anode. This also cleaned the surface of the matrix about to be copied. After separating from the master, a new mother was polished with a fine abrasive to remove (or at least round-off) the microscopic [...] "horns" [...] {{at the top of the}} grooves, produced by the cutting lathe. This allowed the vinyl to flow better in the pressing stage and reduced the non-fill problem.|$|E

It is {{supposed}} that remaining dirt on surface of strip is evenly distributed before <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cleaning</b> with thickness of d, a bubble (radius of r) generated from strip can remove dirt with the volume of 4 πr 2 d, {{and in the process}} of a bubble generated the thickness of the dirt (d) keeps invariant. Under the premise of simplified conditions, taking Faraday’s Law as a starting point main model had been built. And so expressions of the relations between process parameters and decontamination ratio were obtained. The results of experiment accord with those of simulation. Based on the model, using mixed program of Matlab and Visual C++, the simulation program software was developed. The results show that the way to simulate original <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cleaning</b> process of cold rolled strip is feasible...|$|E

Such an operation generates considerable, intimate contact among the gas, liquid and the solid {{in the system and}} provides substantial advantages for application in physical, chemical or biochemical processing involving gas, liquid and solid phases. Among all the types of three-phase fluidized beds, three-phase concurrent gas-liquid-solid fluidized beds are used {{in a wide range of}} applications including hydro-treating and conversation of heavy petroleum and synthetic crude, coal liquefaction, methanol production, sand filter <b>cleaning,</b> <b>electrolytic</b> timing, conversion of glucose to ethanol, aerobic waste water treatment, and various other hydrogenation and oxidation reactions. The recent fluidized bed bioreactors are superior in performance due to immobilization of cells on solid particles reducing the time of treatment, volume of reactor is extremely small, lack of clogging of bio-mass and removal of pollutant like phenol even at lower concentrations. In the fluidized bed system used in waste water treatment, low density solid matrix is used to immobilize the microbes as the system operates at low water and air velocities to avoid transportation of the particles from the bed. Hydrodynamics study of three-phase fluidized bed with low density particles are rarely seen in literature although a tremendous work is seen for moderate or high density solid particles. In the present work, the computational studies have been carried out on two dimensional fluidized beds to characterize there hydrodynamic behavior. Air, water and low density solid particles have been used as the gas, liquid and solid phase to analyze the system behaviors...|$|R

The {{model of}} <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cleaning</b> for {{cold rolled strip}} was established, and the {{simulation}} of cleaning process {{was carried out in}} the finite element method with the software(Ansoft). The influence of processing parameters was investigated. The results show that, the processing parameters, such as the current efficiency, the electrode plate intervals and the insulation board have intense influence on current efficiency, which is significant for improving cleaning efficiency and energy conservation...|$|E

40|$|The {{quantification}} of mass loss, surface topography, {{depth of}} pitting, and localized corrosion for steels subject to marine corrosion requires {{the removal of}} rusts, preferably without causing additional mass loss, pitting, or other damage. Conventional procedures using inhibited hydrochloric acid or Clarke's solution are shown to remove short-term marine rusts but also to cause new corrosion including pitting and related rust products. Both increase with longer exposure to the cleaning solutions. Water washing with soft water left calcareous materials on the metal surface. Ultrasonic removal did not cause additional corrosion but was effective only for very light rusts. Although relatively slow, <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cleaning</b> (electrolysis) produced clean surfaces without new corrosion...|$|E

Correction of the {{influence}} of baseline artefacts and electrode polarisation on dielectric spectra. Bioelectrochemistry, 51 (1), 53 - 65 The deconvolution of biological dielectric spectra can be difficult enough with artefact-free spectra but is more problematic when machine baseline artefacts and electrode polarisation are present as well. In addition, these two sources of anomalies can be responsible for significant interference with dielectric biomass measurements made using one- or two-spot frequencies. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop mathematical models of baseline artefacts and electrode polarisation which can be used to remove these anomalies from dielectric spectra in a way that can be easily implemented on-line and in real-time on the Biomass Monitor (BM). We show that both artefacts can be successfully removed in solutions of organic and inorganic ions; in animal cell and microbial culture media; and in yeast suspensions of varying biomass. The high quality of the compensations achieved were independent of whether gold and platinum electrodes were used; the electrode geometry; electrode fouling; current density; the type of BM; and of whether <b>electrolytic</b> <b>cleaning</b> pulses had been applied. In addition, the calibration experiments required could be done off-line using a simple aqueous KCl dilution series with the calibration constants being automatically calculated by a computer without the need for user intervention. The calibration values remained valid for a minimum of 3 months for the baseline model and indefinitely for the electrode polarisation one. Importantly, application of baseline correction prior to polarisation correction allowed the latter's application to the whole conductance range of the BM. These techniques are therefore exceptionally convenient to use under practical conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|E
