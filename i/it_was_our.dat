500|$|Hezbollah {{emerged in}} South Lebanon during a {{consolidation}} of Shia militias as a rival {{to the older}} Amal Movement. Hezbollah {{played a significant role}} in the Lebanese civil war, opposing American forces in 1982–83 and opposing Amal and Syria during the 1985–88 War of the Camps. However, Hezbollah's early primary focus was ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon following Israel's 1982 invasion and siege of Beirut. Amal, the main Lebanese Shia political group, initiated guerrilla warfare. In 2006, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak stated, [...] "When we entered Lebanon … there was no Hezbollah. We were accepted with perfumed rice and flowers by the Shia in the south. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> presence there that created Hezbollah".|$|E
500|$|Gosling was {{scheduled}} to begin filming The Lovely Bones in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of [...] "creative differences" [...] {{and was replaced by}} Mark Wahlberg. Gosling had been cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes. Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds in weight and grew a beard to appear older. Walsh then [...] "began to feel he was not right. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what." [...] Gosling later said, [...] "We didn't talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ... I just showed up on set, and I had gotten it wrong. Then I was fat and unemployed." [...] He has said the experience was [...] "an important realisation for me: not to let your ego get involved. It's OK to be too young for a role." ...|$|E
500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, and before we knew it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> baby, and though {{there was a sense that}} we were standing on the shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to being}} cast on Knots Landing, Mills was {{predominantly}} known for playing [...] "damsel in distress" [...] roles, {{which is why}} the producers didn't initially consider her. Abby's storylines focused on business dealings, affairs and family troubles. Introduced as the sister of Sid Fairgate, she was initially portrayed as a friendly, warm-hearted woman with great love for her children. In due time, she evolved into the series' main antagonist, constantly causing mayhem in others' lives. According to series creator David Jacobs, the producers always intended Abby to be a J.R. Ewing-esque character. Jacobs said, [...] "When we were casting the role of Abby, we were looking for a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> intention to have this nice person gain the trust of the other women and then cause trouble for them. We didn't want the other characters and the audience to know that there was a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen." ...|$|E
500|$|Abby {{was always}} {{intended}} to be the show's promiscuous seductress. In an interview with Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune, Jacobs said: [...] "When we were casting the role of Abby, {{we were looking for}} a homey type, someone whom the other women characters would trust. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> intention to have this nice person gain the trust of the other women and then cause trouble for them. We didn't want the other characters and the audience to know that there was a scheming person under this nice facade. We wanted her to come on as a good person and then evolve into a vixen." [...] Author June L. May of Monsters and Critics said, [...] "In season two of Knots Landing, a catalyst moves into the neighborhood in the form of Sid’s sister, the drop dead gorgeous Abby Cunningham. [...] Whether Abby is directly involved, or simply in the neighborhood, she has a detrimental affect on the harmony of couples." [...] Almost immediately, Abby sank her claws into Richard Avery (John Pleshette), one of the neighborhood husbands. Though the affair was brief, it set the stage for what was to come.|$|E
500|$|Ainsworth {{herself was}} the first to find {{difficulties}} in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed [...] "tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both because they tended to occur chiefly in the separation episodes and because they tended to be prodromal to crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur when a child is attempting to control crying, for they tend to vanish if and when crying breaks through." [...] Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behavior was [...] "without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behavior, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress". Beginning in 1983, Crittenden offered A/C and other new organized classifications (see below).|$|E

500|$|Musically, 21st Century Breakdown {{is similar}} to the punk rock style of American Idiot, but many critics have claimed that Green Day's {{traditional}} sound has evolved in the five years since their last release to incorporate new influences such as heavier, louder pop rock and stadium rock on an epic scale. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone indicated that the album sports ballads that are Green Day's most polished; he claimed that the band [...] "combine punk thrash with their newfound love of classic-rock grandiosity". MTV compared the material to that of classic rockers like The Who, while Spin called the title track [...] "Green Day's most epic song yet". Cool has remarked: [...] "It's important to us that we're still looked at as a punk band. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> religion, our higher education". However, he also noted that Armstrong had delved into the past in writing 21st Century Breakdown, gleaning inspiration from the artists who shaped rock music. Armstrong himself has stated: [...] "Ground zero for me is still punk rock. I like painting an ugly picture. I get something uplifting out of singing some of the most horrifying shit you can sing about. It's just my DNA." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} being {{shuttled}} {{into and out}} of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth. The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. [...] According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. [...] After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family." [...] However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.|$|E
