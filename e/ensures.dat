5|$|FN's 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} {{cases are}} covered with a special polymer coating for easier extraction with the PS90 carbine due to the high chamber pressures and lack of case tapering. In addition, this coating <b>ensures</b> proper feeding and function in the magazines.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion <b>ensures</b> sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion <b>ensures</b> adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are often}} {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This <b>ensures</b> that the inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs. An {{example of such a}} transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring oxonium ion in the reaction of the viral enzyme neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|Flowering {{may take}} some years from seed; a minimum of four years is average. Buying an {{advanced}} plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant.

Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this <b>ensures</b> that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>ensure</b> or insure: In the UK (and Australia and New Zealand), {{the word}} <b>ensure</b> (to make sure, to make certain) has a {{distinct}} meaning from the word insure (often followed by against– to guarantee or protect against, typically {{by means of an}} [...] "insurance policy"). The distinction is only about a century old. In American usage, insure may also be used in the former sense, but <b>ensure</b> may not be used in the latter sense.
