2500|$|Though {{the show}} had been meeting the network's {{projections}} {{for the show}} itself, it has been severely detrimental to the ratings of the late local news on NBC affiliates. Several stations across the country <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> {{is known as the}} [...] "Leno Effect", where the lower audience for Leno (as compared to NBC's scripted prime time offerings) translated directly into a domino effect of severe audience drops for late local news (on the order of 25–30%), effects that NBC had underestimated.|$|E
2500|$|Gompers and his AFL unions vigorously {{fought the}} IWW in the U.S. and in Latin America, as a {{disruptive}} dual union that tried harder to destroy capitalism than to help workers. He cooperated with widespread government arrests of union leaders for the IWW's militant {{opposition to the}} World War. He said, [...] "the IWW's...are exactly what the Bolsheviki are in Russia, and we <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> the IWW Bolsheviki in Russia have done for the working people." [...] The IWW was practically defunct by 1920.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] said Pyecroft. [...] "They daren't {{leave us}} loose aboard for one revolution," [...] and I {{knew that he}} <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> I <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Late--late in {{the evening}} Kilmeny came home, For Kilmeny had been she could not tell where, And Kilmeny <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> she could not declare.|$|R
2500|$|... "You {{will have}} the papers by now, and will <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> has become of me. The strain has been too long and too strong, and I have cracked up under it. I hope, however, {{for the sake of}} dear Vy that my new song [...] "Moonoloo", turns out a winner, for she will need to get every penny she can. Think as pleasantly as yon can of me, who came nearer to being a big success than people think; and who {{consequently}} became the greatest failure. Regards and regrets.–De Garis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pullman's {{concept of}} [...] "intercision" [...] has been {{compared}} to circumcision and female genital mutilation. In The Subtle Knife, Ruta Skadi says, [...] "Some of you <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> they did at Bolvangar. And that was horrible, {{but it is not the}} only such place, not the only practice. Sisters, you know only the north: I have travelled in the south lands. There are churches there, believe me, that cut their children too, as the people of Bolvangar did – not in the same way, but just as horribly – they cut their sexual organs, yes, both boys and girls – they cut them with knives so that they shan’t feel".|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing Saint Maybe, Jay Parini {{describes}} how Tyler’s characters {{must deal with}} “Ms. Tyler's oddball families, which any self-respecting therapist would call ‘dysfunctional’…. [...] An inexplicable centripetal force hurls these relatives upon one another, catches them in a dizzying inward spiral of obligation, affection and old-fashioned guilt—as well as an inexpressible longing for some perfect or [...] "normal" [...] family in a distant past that never really was. [...] Almost every novel by Anne Tyler begins with a loss or absence that reactivates in the family some primordial sense of itself.” Larry McMurtry wrote, [...] "...in book after book, siblings are drawn inexorably back home, as if their parents or (more often) grandparents had planted tiny magnets in them which can be activated once they <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> the extrafamilial world is like....sooner or later a need to be {{with people who are}} really familiar – their brothers and sisters – overwhelms them." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{it was all}} for {{the sake}} of Little Toomai, who <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> never man <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> before--the dance of the {{elephants}} at night and alone {{in the heart of the}} Garo hills! ...|$|R
60|$|The Honourable Company had won {{its first}} victory: Major Apsley, having {{fulfilled}} Miss Blossom's commands, <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> she {{expected him to}} see, and was disentangled from Miss Limmer.|$|R
50|$|Kaulback {{wrote in}} defence of the {{possible}} existence of the Yeti, <b>having</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> he took to be large footprints while attempting to locate {{the source of the}} Salween River.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Harry, you can't <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> he's doing. He's grimacing and contorting {{himself in}} the most {{extraordinary}} fashion." ...|$|E
60|$|We <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> England and France {{gained by}} the Chinese {{declaration}} of war. What Japan gained was somewhat different.|$|E
6000|$|... 'For a black eye?' {{cried the}} hard-hearted mother, laughing. 'You should <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> Maurice and Fred {{used to do}} to each other.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Having</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> I did, I wasn't {{particularly}} {{surprised to}} meet Bobbie {{at the club}} next day looking about as merry and bright as a lonely gum-drop at an Eskimo tea-party.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Oldbuck, I am {{obliged to}} you for your {{indifferent}} opinion of my discernment; but I think you will give me credit for <b>having</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> I say I saw." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were angry}} ejaculations and the faces round the table grew set and stern. Some {{of the men}} <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> happens when a heavy train goes through a {{railroad}} trestle.|$|R
60|$|You should <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> Bolgani did to me, and Kerchak, and Terkoz, before I killed them--then {{you would}} laugh {{at such a}} little scratch.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{few moments}} she could not speak, and then she whispered, [...] "I believe that I <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> you have told me I should see." ...|$|E

60|$|Now we {{had only}} to wait for Sergeant Corney, and, <b>having</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> he could do in the wilderness, I had no doubt but that he would succeed in his purpose, which he soon did.|$|R
60|$|Could the boy <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> was at {{that time}} {{occurring}} at Westville, he would not have been so contented, but would instead have taken the first train homeward.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} she'd have liked that," [...] Jake replied. [...] "It's a pity {{you have no}} artistic taste, or you might <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> a picture she made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am just {{a little}} {{astonished}} you did not consider it advisable to follow the thing up further, when you must <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> it pointed to," [...] said Clavering.|$|E
500|$|Rothenberg then {{discusses}} the Thayers' {{account of the}} wood duck, which Rothenburg calls [...] "our most garishly colored duck". He explains that the Thayers believed they, [...] "trained as artists", <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> earlier observers <b>had</b> missed: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If all {{the world}} to-day <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> we <b>have</b> seen," [...] the older man was saying, [...] "there {{would be no more}} talk of Wilbur Wrights or Farmans. Those men are babies, playing with their toys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou art {{the first}} man," [...] said Zadok, [...] "who <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> thou art {{about to see}} for seven-and-thirty years. Come, I will show thee a queen, the most {{beautiful}} that the eyes of man ever looked upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's simply disgusting," [...] {{said the}} bow-plates. [...] "They might <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> we've been through. There isn't a ship {{on the sea}} that has {{suffered}} as we have--is there, now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] said Lord Worthington, astonished. [...] "Why {{on earth}} should he give it up? Paradise's money {{is as good}} as in his pocket. You <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> he can do." ...|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, {{even though}} he spoke thus, Barwell Dawson was {{secretly}} as hopeful as were the boys. Could he <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> was before him, his enthusiasm might have quickly died within him.|$|E
60|$|She {{glanced at}} him a moment, and was afraid to look again. The man's face was very grim, but she <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> was in his eyes, and waited almost breathless, until he stooped and laid his hand upon her shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forty {{years and}} five," [...] said Machua Appa, [...] "have I {{followed}} my lord, the elephant, but never have I heard that any child of man <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> this child <b>has</b> <b>seen.</b> By all the Gods of the Hills, it is--what can we say?"

6000|$|If she <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> {{came and}} went over the wires of the [...] "Great International Telegraph," [...] she would have laughed till her {{spectacles}} flew off her Roman nose.
