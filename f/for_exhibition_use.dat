5000|$|Authentic sandpaintings {{are rarely}} photographed, {{so as to}} not disrupt {{the flow of the}} ceremony. For many reasons, {{medicine}} men will seldom allow outsiders inside a sacred ceremony. Because so many outsiders are curious about sandpainting, some medicine men may create pieces <b>for</b> <b>exhibition</b> purposes only, <b>using</b> reversed colours and variations.

The sandpaintings for sale in shops and on the Internet are commercially produced and contain deliberate errors, as the real sandpaintings are considered sacred.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{augmented}} reality (AR) application <b>for</b> museum <b>exhibitions</b> <b>using</b> natural features instead of calibrated fiducials to recognize paintings and recover their pose. The ability to augment and annotate exhibits with virtual content represents a potentially {{powerful tool for}} museum curators. By presenting visitors with rich, interactive content, an augmented museum {{such as the one}} proposed here, can add a dynamic element to normally static content. The proposed system utilizes an adapted Multiple View Kernel Projection (MVKP), which combines a multiple view training stage for geometric invariance and kernel projection based on Walsh-Hadamard kernels for feature description. We demon-strate that its real-time performance and robustness to lighting and viewpoint changes make it ideal for AR applications like AR exhibition system. Experimental results on a real-world painting exhibition have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a preliminary {{foray into the}} historical role of planning exhibitions {{in the development of}} modern town planning culture drawing on the Australian experience. While the catalytic role of major expositions on urban society has been acknowledged in the literature, the staging, evolution and meanings attached to purpose-built planning exhibitions at a global scale have made only modest incursions into planning history. Such events provide a useful aesthetic and historical lens through which to understand how the objectives of planning have evolved through communication to the wider community. Our objective is to frame the role of exhibitions in different time periods through {{the first half of the}} twentieth century with reference to the Australian planning. Exhibitions in the 1910 s were often attached to conferences and helped codify the aims, icons and progress of the planning movement as an eclectic, largely spatial discipline. The 1940 s were arguably the golden era <b>for</b> planning <b>exhibitions</b> <b>used</b> to communicate and crystallize a mature and universal canon of modernist planning ideals and values as part of the post-war reconstruction effort.

40|$|In {{this paper}} our {{aim is to}} examine the {{historical}} role that planning exhibitions have had in communicating ideas. While the catalytic role in urban change of major expos is acknowledged, the staging, evolution and meanings attached to purposebuilt planning exhibitions have made only modest incursions into planning history, despite the importance attached to displays by pioneers like Patrick Geddes. Such events provide a useful aesthetic and historical lens through which to understand how the objectives of planning are marketed to planners and the wider community. Here, the objective is to frame the role of exhibitions in different time periods throughout {{the first half of the}} 20 th century with special reference to the Australian experience. Exhibitions in the 1910 s were often attached to conferences and helped codify the aims, icons and progress of the planning movement as an aclectic, albeit largely spatial discipline.

40|$|The {{technology}} that underpins the Internet of Things, offers ways to embed interactivity within the exhibition: microprocessors, sensors, and actuators can be concealed within reactive spaces and smart objects that seamlessly blend with their surroundings. This {{offers a new}} perspectives on how to deliver digital curated content {{in the context of}} a museum visit through, for example, smart artefacts. Through a series of museum case studies we will discuss how smart artefacts can bridge the gap between the physical and the digital: Can this integration give the visitor an enriched experience and higher level of object association? And to what level do these smart objects act as transitional objects for the curated content? Our observations / evaluations show that the act of holding an object empowers the visitor and engages them to a deeper level. The curator’s role in the multidisciplinary team is then that of a storyteller that blends the content and interpretation with aspects of the visitor’s interactive experience. The knowledge gained through several case studies was instrumental to the creation of a toolkit that aims at bringing the potential and power of the internet of things on the <b>exhibition</b> floor. By <b>using</b> the cloud-based toolkit, cultural heritage and museum professionals can embed digital content into smart objects and spaces with just a few clicks. This opens up possibilities <b>for</b> <b>exhibition</b> creation <b>using</b> design thinking and fast prototyping. Museums can then explore a wide range of possible visitors’ experiences in an experimental environment to assess whether ‘it works!’ or not. Starting from the case studies the presentation will discuss the journey for idea to implantation...|$|R
40|$|In 2011 Peter Madsen {{left his}} estate, {{including}} his art collection, to York Museums Trust. Five artists have made new work <b>for</b> this <b>exhibition,</b> <b>using</b> objects from his collection. We can {{never know what}} drew Peter Madsen to collect and keep these things but each artist has found new ways to value them. York Art Gallery is currently undergoing an £ 8 million redevelopment. This ambitious project {{was made possible by}} the bequest of £ 2 million by Peter Emil Madsen and his sister Karen Madsen, both from York. Their gift also included Peter’s diverse collection of paintings, books, prints, small sculptures and ethnographic objects. York Art Gallery has been allowed to sell any pieces not taken into the City’s art collections. Of course, the historical importance and artistic quality of some works meant they had to be kept. Other works were sold at auction, happily passing into the care of other collectors whilst adding to the monetary value of the gift. I produced 40 new paintings <b>for</b> the <b>exhibition</b> 'Finding the Value' at York St Mary's. I have used a selection of the figurative paintings from the Madsen siblings collection, to create new ReconFigure paintings. I responded to the diversity of the collection, by using examples of different styles and types of the figurative paintings to paint over with my triangular/crystalline paintwork. By displaying the paintings on mass I foresee my marks creating a consistency to the original paintings; as a way of bringing the diversity together, whilst also celebrating it. I also see a parallel with the somewhat unknown figures of the Madsen brother and sister and the painted out figures in my paintings. In both cases they are present, but almost hidden behind a veil, but are also something that is absent, no longer with us...|$|R
