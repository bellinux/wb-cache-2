5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E

25|$|Rosalind Ivy Fuller was {{the third}} of four daughters born to a Portsmouth draper, whose eldest child was a son, Walter (born 1881). Behind the draper’s shop was a hall <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr</b> Fuller {{organized}} free public entertainment on Sunday afternoons, having his daughters recite, sing and play various instruments – the eldest girl learned the harp, for instance. Rosalind, who was called Ivy by her family until she was 21, when she opted for her first given name, always disliked having to perform on stage because she suffered agonies of self-consciousness.|$|E
25|$|On 9 June 1995, Mr Dixon, aged 47, and {{his wife}} were {{passengers}} on Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 when the aircraft crashed in the Tararua Ranges near Palmerston North. Mr Dixon escaped from the wreckage with fractures. However, despite his injuries, he returned to the aircraft to help other passengers trapped in the wreckage. As a result of this selfless action, he was critically burned when a flash fire broke out on the left wing of the aircraft near a hole in the fuselage from which he was helping passengers escape. He was hospitalised and underwent surgery and skin grafts. Mr Dixon remained in a coma, and although he made some initial improvement, his condition worsened and he died two weeks later, the fourth victim of the crash. The situation <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr</b> Dixon found himself was extremely dangerous and he displayed great bravery in returning to the aircraft, although injured, to help other passengers which subsequently resulted in the loss of his own life. His bravery undoubtedly ensured that the loss of life was not greater.|$|E
25|$|There are doubts {{though as}} to Gochiyaev's guilt. In November 2003, an article {{appeared}} in the weekly Moskovskiye Novosti, authored by an investigative journalist, Igor Korolkov. It described a meeting between Mikhail Trepashkin and Mark Blumenfeld, a former businessman who had rented the basement in the apartment house on Guryanov Street to Gochiyaev, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr</b> Blumenfeld stated {{that the person who}} was making use of the Laipanov passport, and who was publicly presented by the investigation as Gochiyaev, was not in fact Gochiyaev. In Lefortovo Prison, Blumenfeld had been shown a photo of someone he was told was Gochiyaev but Blumenfeld replied that he had never seen the man but the investigators insisted that he identify Gochiyaev, at which point Blumenfeld ceased arguing and signed the document. The person who had met Blumenfeld was evidently not the same person depicted in the photograph but was, according to Blumenfeld, a man with a simple face whereas the person Blumenfeld had actually met looked externally like an intellectual. False-Laiponov had been seen by several persons. They all maintained that the original composite photo was very similar to the actual person who rented the storage facilities. The Russian Procuracy General unwittingly substantiated Trepashkin’s claim. Of the four storage premises named (two bombed and two not), the Delo (case) states that the witnesses for three, V.A. Avseev, Mark Blumenfeld and N.A. Gollubeva are not reported to have identified Gochiyaev as False-Laipanov. It should be noted that Blumenfeld’s account was different to the statement that he had signed for the FSB. One witness, Yu.E. Petrunkin, did identify a photograph of Gochiyaev as the man known by him as Laipanov. A driver, V.P.Sinitsyn, hired by False-Laipanov to deliver sacks of sugar, was not reported to have made an identification. Another hired driver, A.V.Prushinskii, stated that he was paid for his work by a man in glasses, about 1.8m tall, similar to the composite photo of Laipanov. It should be noted that Prushinskii was not shown an actual photo of Gochiyaev, even though one existed (it had been shown to Petrunkin).|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Mark Ervin. The idea for the episode was pitched by the Simpsons writing staff, who wanted to make an episode <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns becomes a [...] "thrillionaire", a millionaire who goes on thrilling adventures. Although it would originally be green, a mistake in the overseas animation led to the Loch Ness monster looking pink, a mistake that was ultimately too expensive to fix.|$|E

Every word of the divorce episode was reviewed by CTW's advisory board, content experts, and developmental psychologists. The episode featured Gordon explaining the concept of divorce, Snuffy being assured that his parents still loved him, and the characters talking and singing [...] "about how Snuffy will have good homes, {{and so on and}} so on".|$|E

Despite his overall rating, he praised several moments, {{including}} Orton hitting Orndorff with his cast, King Kong Bundy's win, and André the Giant throwing {{the money into}} the crowd. Powell, however, listed Mr. T wrestling as his least favorite moment of the pay-per-view. He claimed the main event match, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> T took part, was humorous despite its lack of technical wrestling.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} the episode <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns shows his room with a {{thousand}} monkeys working at a thousand typewriters, {{a reference to the}} infinite monkey theorem, has inspired a real-life experiment about the theorem. The episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California Berkeley, where it is used to [...] "examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show", and {{to figure out what it}} is [...] "trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies." ...|$|E
500|$|Part of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around the practice of religious male circumcision in Judaism, and the related ceremony called the brit milah or bris, and the boys' misunderstanding of the tradition. The boys believe that circumcision entails the cutting off of one's penis, which they refer to by the childish colloquial term [...] "", except for Cartman, who insists on calling it [...] "fireman". Cannabis is also referred to by various names, including weed, grass, pot, and marijuana, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Mackey constantly pronounces the letter j as [...] (as in jam), which makes Kyle mispronounce the drug as [...] "marry-Jew wanna".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the year}} Formby started filming Get Cracking, a story about the Home Guard, which was {{completed}} in under a month, the tight schedule brought about by an impending ENSA tour of the Mediterranean. Between the end of filming Get Cracking and the release of the film in May 1943, Formby undertook a tour of Northern Scotland and the Orkney Islands, and had nearly completed shooting on his next film, Bell-Bottom George. The reviewer for The Times opined that [...] "Get Cracking, although a distinct improvement on other films <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr</b> Formby has appeared, is cut too closely to fit the demands of an individual technique to achieve any real life of its own".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland and written by John Swartzwelder. The writing staff had thought about an episode <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns would lose his money {{and would have to}} interact with the outside world. In DVD commentary the writers explained that while Mr. Burns tried to change he [...] "couldn't help being himself". Professional wrestler Bret Hart made a cameo as himself, animated in his pink wrestling outfit. [...] "The Old Man and the Lisa" [...] contains cultural references to the television series That Girl and the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It was positively received by critics and won the Environmental Media Award for [...] "TV Episodic Comedy".|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose to}} present the Muppet Mr. Snuffleupagus ("Snuffy") and his family's experience of divorce. The episode was written by staff writer Norman Stiles, who also wrote the 1983 episode <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hooper's death was explained. Every word of the divorce episode was reviewed by the Children's Television Workshop's (CTW) advisory board, content experts, and developmental psychologists. After tests showed that their young viewers were confused by the episode and did not understand important concepts about divorce, the producers decided to not air it, despite the investment they had made. It {{was the first time}} the show's producers made this kind of decision, and was cited as an example of the producer's practice of [...] "listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first", despite the costs.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} {{frequent}} topics of discussion are the real-life location of Springfield, the sexuality of Waylon Smithers and [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?", a two-episode publicity stunt <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns was shot by an unknown character. The writers inserted many secret clues into the episode and implemented a contest in which whoever first discovered the shooter would be animated on an episode of the show. Although the alt.tv.simpsons community debated this mystery to an extreme degree, no one officially guessed the right answer, and therefore no one was ever animated on the show. Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of {{a random sample of}} entries. The sample did not contain any correct answers, so the winner who was chosen did not have the right answer and was paid a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E

500|$|The season's {{first two}} episodes, [...] "Bart of Darkness" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Rival", were held {{over from the}} {{previous}} season, as production was delayed because of the 1994 Northridge earthquake. [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] caused some controversy among the staff with series creator Matt Groening removing his name from the episode's credits {{as he saw it}} as blatant advertising for The Critic, which was airing at the time. The season finale [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] (which aired in two parts, the second acting as the following season's premiere) came from Groening, who had wanted to do an episode <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns was shot, which {{could be used as a}} publicity stunt.

500|$|The writing staff {{often used}} their {{individual}} life experiences for inspirations {{to come up}} with the storylines of the series' episodes. For example, the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", in which SpongeBob and Patrick learn profanity, was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience of getting in trouble as a child for using the f-word in front of his mother. Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life". The end of the episode, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself". The idea for the episode [...] "The Secret Box" [...] also came from one of Drymon's childhood experiences. Hillenburg explained, [...] "Drymon had a secret box [...] and started telling us about it. We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dog of Death" [...] {{features}} {{a number of}} references to popular culture and famous dogs. Santa's Little Helper's adventure resembles {{the plot of the}} 1963 film The Incredible Journey. The scene <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns brainwashes Santa's Little Helper with the Ludovico technique is a parody of Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange, including the way Santa's Little Helper's eyes are held open while he is forced to watch a film featuring dog abuse, such as dogs being physically assaulted and getting their heads slammed by falling toilet lids. Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony is heard during the sequence. In another scene, the dog Lassie is referenced when Santa's Little Helper rescues a child from a burning building. Homer claims that Santa's Little Helper will be going to Doggie Heaven, while Richard Nixon's dog Checkers and Adolf Hitler's dog Blondi will be going to Doggie Hell. The doctor who performs the surgery on Santa's Little Helper is based on the main character in the Ben Casey television series.|$|E
