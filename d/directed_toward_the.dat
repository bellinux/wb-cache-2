Specific lipids and proteins are localized to different layers of the membrane, with carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> outer surface of the milk fat globule; the lipid-to-protein weight ratio in MFGM is approximately 1:1.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation, ultraviolet light or chemicals {{are prone to}} acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. The accumulation of damage, to be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cells' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or apoptosis. The common features of global response are induction of multiple genes, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell division.|$|E

5|$|Hall had {{no special}} {{academic}} background or sailing experience (he was a blacksmith, engraver, then {{owner of a}} Cincinnati newspaper), {{but he was a}} voracious reader with an obsession for the Arctic. After John Franklin's 1845 expedition was lost, Hall's focus was <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Arctic. He was able to launch two expeditions in search of Franklin and his crew; one in 1860–63, and a second in 1864–69. These experiences established him as a seasoned Arctic explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the Inuit people. The renown he gained eventually allowed him to convince the United States government to fund his third expedition, an attempt on the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|RNAi {{has been}} used to genetically {{engineer}} plants to produce lower levels of natural plant toxins. Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks. Cotton seeds are rich in dietary protein but naturally contain the toxic terpenoid product gossypol, making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi {{has been used}} to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of delta-cadinene synthase, a key enzyme in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production {{in other parts of the}} plant, where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests. Similar efforts have been <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> reduction of the cyanogenic natural product linamarin in cassava plants.|$|E
5|$|Cantonese people, {{like the}} Hakka, were well known {{throughout}} Southeast Asia as mineworkers. Their migration in the 19th century was largely <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> tin mines of Bangka, off {{the east coast}} of Sumatra. Notable traditionally as skilled artisans, the Cantonese benefited from close contact with Europeans in Guangdong and Hong Kong by learning about machinery and industrial success. They migrated to Java {{about the same time as}} the Hakka, but for different reasons. In Indonesia's cities they became artisans, machine workers, and owners of small businesses such as restaurants and hotel-keeping services. The Cantonese are evenly dispersed throughout the archipelago, and number far less than the Hokkien or the Hakka. Consequently, their roles are of secondary importance in the Chinese communities.|$|E

In Puerto Rico, workers quickly responded to power and water outages. Similarly on Saint Croix, power systems were quickly restored. On November23, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster area. This allocated federal funding for loans to public and private entities and provided 75percent {{of the cost of}} debris removal. By December10, nearly 3,000residents had applied for assistance, mostly on St. Croix. In response, the federal government provided about $480,000 to the affected people. The United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided $185,000, mostly <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> United Nations Development Programme, for aid to other islands in the eastern Caribbean.

5|$|Medical centers, dispensaries and {{hospitals}} are {{found throughout the}} island, although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in Antananarivo. Access to medical care remains {{beyond the reach of}} many Malagasy, especially in the rural areas, and many recourse to traditional healers. In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010 Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000people and a total of 3,150doctors, 5,661nurses, 385community health workers, 175pharmacists and 57dentists for a population of 22million. 14.6percent of government spending in 2008 was <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> health sector. Approximately 70percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30percent originated with international donors and other private sources.

5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E

5|$|The Autonomist Party's base grew rapidly, in {{part due}} to Muñoz Rivera's {{writings}} and speeches <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> jíbaro population. The Conservative Party considered this a threat and closed the newspapers where he published his work, sending part of their staff to jail in Fort San Felipe del Morro. After Francisco Cepeda Taborcias, editor of La Revista de Puerto Rico's was jailed, the position was offered to Muñoz Rivera, who accepted it. After being released from prison, Cepeda criticized Baldorioty de Castro's policies. Cepeda was elected secretary of the party and Baldorioty de Castro was named honorary president. This action angered Muñoz Rivera, who challenged him to a duel. Cepeda originally accepted the challenge, but later declined the same once the preparations were underway, losing his position within the party's hierarchy.|$|E

Users may employ sockpuppets—separate online identities controlled by the same person—to accuse other forum members of disloyalty and persecution, or support the user who is under suspicion.

5|$|Most of {{the comets}} seen {{close to the}} Sun seem to have reached their current {{positions}} through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon's tidal force deforms Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the galactic tide also distorts the orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to {{the gravity of the}} Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field has substantial effects. Galactic tidal forces stretch the cloud along an axis <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> galactic centre and compress it along the other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun. The point at which the Sun's gravity concedes its influence to the galactic tide is called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 AU, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet 1st and 3rd Guard Armies, in {{conjunction}} with the Soviet 6th Army, launched Operation Little Saturn on 16 December. Despite early troubles due to stubborn resistance from Italian troops, the Red Army was able to partially overrun the Italian 8th Army by 18 December. The breakthrough -even if small and quickly contained- proved a possible threat to Army Group Don's left flank, while the city of Rostov was threatened by the 3rd Guards Army. This, and mainly heavy losses sustained by the German armor divisions forcing their way to the Myshkova river, forced Manstein to reconsider continuing the offensive. The German field marshal decided that he could not defend his left flank while also sustaining the attempt to relieve the 6th Army. Although the 6th Panzer Division was able to cross the Myshkova River by the night of 19 December, the LVII Panzer Corps had still not made major advances against increased Soviet opposition, despite the arrival of the 17th Panzer Division; in fact, {{it seemed as if the}} corps would have to go on the defensive. Furthermore, the Soviet raid on Tatsinskaya managed to destroy the airfield and several dozen aircraft being used by the Luftwaffe to resupply forces inside the Stalingrad pocket, forcing Manstein to order the XLVIII Panzer Corps on the defensive, instead of reserving it to bolster his forces <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> breakthrough to Stalingrad. To make matters worse for the Germans, on 18 December Hitler refused to allow the German 6th Army to begin a breakout operation towards the rest of Army Group Don, despite pleas from Manstein.|$|E
