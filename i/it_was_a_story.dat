5|$|Skirth {{gave the}} memoir to his {{daughter}} Jean in 1975, two years {{before his death in}} 1977 Although for many years she found it too upsetting to read in full, she felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that should be shared with others, and in 1999 she donated four of the five ring binders, containing the bulk of the memoir but excluding its more personal sections, to the Imperial War Museum in London, where they remain to this day.|$|E

I tried to make believable, reasonable characters, and Stuart would insist on throwing in clichés and caricatures.

25|$|Although {{there would}} {{appear to have been}} {{performances}} of plays on religious themes in Ireland from as early as the 14th century, the first well-documented instance of a theatrical production in Ireland is a 1601 staging of Gorboduc presented by Lord Mountjoy Lord Deputy of Ireland in the Great Hall in Dublin Castle. The play had been written by Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton for the 1561/2 Christmas festivities at the Inner Temple in London and appears to have been selected because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of a divided kingdom descending into anarchy that was applicable to the situation in Ireland {{at the time of the}} performance. Mountjoy started a fashion, and private performances became quite commonplace in great houses all over Ireland over the following thirty years.|$|E

500|$|Matthew McConaughey as Ron Woodroof, {{a real-life}} AIDS patient who smuggled unapproved {{pharmaceutical}} drugs into Texas {{when he found}} them effective at improving his symptoms. In an interview with CBS News' Lee Cowan in February 2014, McConaughey said that he selected the role {{because he thought it}} was not just a normal story, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of a [...] "wild man." [...] McConaughey was born and raised near Dallas, so he was very familiar with the culture. Additionally, he thought that the script was [...] "incredibly human, with no sentimentality." [...] McConaughey lost nearly 50 pounds (22 kilograms) to play Woodroof in the film.|$|E
500|$|Though {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy was {{reluctant}} to return after completing his three-episode commitment on the show that had ended with the season's tenth episode, he returned for the season finale when the producers [...] "essentially called him up and pleaded". They discussed their plans for the character, and [...] "told him <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> we couldn't tell without him." [...] He [...] "graciously agreed." [...] "Over There" [...] marked Nimoy's longest appearance on Fringe, a longer and [...] "much more involv" [...] shoot of roughly seven days was required. Despite Leonard Nimoy's planned exit from the show, the show's producers have said that nothing is final in the Fringe world. Pinkner commented that Nimoy's retirement from acting obviously hinders his character's possible return but, [...] "if Leonard chooses to come back, there is a story in place that we'd love to tell." [...] Wyman elaborated that [...] "I think it's {{fair to say that}} you have not experienced the last of William Bell". When the producers told Nimoy their ideas for Bell's storyline in the third season, he returned for some brief voice and animation work in the episode [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the letters}} was from Bannon, asking for {{professional}} assistance in getting published. On writing to Meaker, she said, [...] "To this day I {{have no idea why}} she responded to me out of the thousands of letters she was getting at that time. Thank God she did. I was both thrilled and terrified." [...] Bannon visited Meaker and was introduced to Greenwich Village, which made a significant impression on Bannon: she called it [...] "Emerald City, Wonderland, and Brigadoon combined—a place where gay people could walk the crooked streets hand in hand." [...] Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll, who read Bannon's initial 600-page manuscript. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who {{had fallen in love with}} each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed. While raising two young children, Bannon lived in Philadelphia and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends. She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village, [...] "I wanted to be one of them, to speak to other women, if only in print. And so I made a beginning—and that beginning was the story that became Odd Girl Out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Kevin Williamson {{had little}} {{interest}} in developing the series, finding the premise too similar to other vampire tales. However, at the urging of Julie Plec, he began to read the novels and started to become intrigued by the story: [...] "I began to realize that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about a small town, about that town's underbelly and about what lurks under the surface." [...] Williamson has stated the town's story will be the main focus of the series rather than high school.|$|E

[...] But the underlying story behind Murder in Television House had haunted him almost since he began working at Israeli television. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that he needed to tell, and it made no difference where he told it.|$|E

2500|$|Oesterheld worked {{again with}} Ernie Pike in the 1970 decade, in the [...] "Top Maxi Historietas" [...] comic book {{published}} by Cielosur Editora. The approach was slightly changed {{in this new}} run: instead of World War II, the stories were about the ongoing Vietnam War. The stories kept the same style as before, but Pike was now involved with the events as they took place, thus becoming an active character of the stories instead of just the narrator. The stories were also more critical of {{the involvement of the}} US in the war, in line with the new politically radical views that Oesterheld was developing. Oesterheld would work later with many strips in the Skorpio comic book, but Ernie Pike would last only for a single story. This story, penciled by Solano López, worked again with World War II, but from a new angle: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> set in current times, about people having a dispute about things that took place during the war.|$|E
2500|$|On October 16, 1965, Abbey married Judy Pepper, who {{accompanied}} Abbey as a seasonal park ranger in the Florida Everglades, {{and then as}} a fire lookout in Lassen Volcanic National Park. Judy was separated from Abbey for extended periods of time while she attended the University of Arizona to get her master's degree. During this time, Abbey had relations with other women—something that Judy gradually became aware of, causing their marriage to suffer. On August 8, 1968 Pepper gave birth to a daughter, Susannah [...] "Susie" [...] Mildred Abbey. Ed purchased the family a home in Sabino Canyon, outside of Tucson. Judy died of leukemia on July 11, 1970, an event that crushed Abbey, causing him to go into [...] "bouts of depression and loneliness" [...] for years. It was to Judy that he dedicated his book Black Sun. However, the book was not an autobiographical novel about his relationship with Judy. Rather <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about a woman with whom Abbey had an affair in 1963. Abbey finished the first draft of Black Sun in 1968, two years before Judy died, and it was [...] "a bone of contention in their marriage." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Innocence + Experience Tour {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Philip Cosores of Consequence of Sound, reviewing a Los Angeles show, said, [...] "U2 {{was every bit}} the brash, boisterous, larger-than-life rock stars fans would expect, or even hope for". He complimented the show for feeling intimate and said that performances of the new songs [...] "argued that perhaps the most recent U2 output was given an unfair shake from critics more interested in attacking the new album's release method than the actual songs". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune praised the show, writing, [...] "Visuals, sound and sequencing synced up to tell a story, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> built on emotionally involving songs presented {{with a minimum of}} fuss." [...] Kot, who was critical of Songs of Innocence, thought the album's songs were redeemed by their live performances, saying, [...] "it's tempting to ask for a do-over of [...] latest album... after witnessing this show. Despite the album's flat, slick surfaces, the Irish quartet made its latest material the centerpiece of its current tour." [...] Jim DeRogatis of WBEZ wrote, [...] "U2 has got its mojo back." [...] Despite doubts about U2 after their previous tour and the release of Songs of Innocence, the band's opening four songs of a Chicago show [...] "convinced [...] that U2 is as ferocious, focused, and no-nonsense committed as it's ever been". Like Kot, DeRogatis agreed that [...] "the new songs were much harder-hitting and far more emotional than in the bland, over-produced versions on record".|$|E
