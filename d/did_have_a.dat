5|$|Alabama {{extended}} their lead to 24–10 at halftime {{with a pair}} of second-quarter touchdowns. Courtney Upshaw scored a defensive touchdown early in the quarter after he intercepted a Brantley pass and returned it 45-yards for the score. AJ McCarron scored later in the quarter on a one-yard quarterback sneak to cap a ten-play, 61-yard drive. Late in the quarter, the Gators <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> scoring opportunity by driving to the Alabama 13-yard line. However, the Alabama defense sacked Brantley on consecutive snaps for a loss of 22-yards and knocked Brantley out of the game with an injury. Sturgis then missed a 52-yard field goal attempt and Alabama led 24–10 at the half.|$|E
5|$|All of the Irish kingdoms {{had their}} own kings but were {{nominally}} subject to the High King. The High King was drawn {{from the ranks of}} the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept didn't become a political reality until the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one. Ireland <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.|$|E

5|$|By the 1030s Malcolm's sons, {{if he had}} any, were dead. The only {{evidence}} that he <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> son or sons is in Rodulfus Glaber's chronicle where Cnut {{is said to have}} stood as godfather to a son of Malcolm. His grandson Thorfinn would have been unlikely to be accepted as king by the Scots, and he chose the sons of his other daughter, Bethóc, who was married to Crínán, lay abbot of Dunkeld, and perhaps Mormaer of Atholl. It may be no more than coincidence, but in 1027 the Irish annals had reported the burning of Dunkeld, although no mention is made of the circumstances. Malcolm's chosen heir, and the first tánaise ríg certainly known in Scotland, was Duncan.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{the main}} {{industries}} of employment in Didsbury were 20% property and business services, 15% education, 15% {{health and social}} work, 10% retail and wholesale, 9% manufacturing, 6% transport and communications, 5% financial services, 4% hotels and restaurants, 4% construction, 4% public administration and defence, and 8% other. These figures {{were similar to those}} from surrounding areas, but Didsbury <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> relatively larger education sector than other nearby wards, perhaps explained by the high density of schools in the area. A significant number of people (12%) commute to areas outside Didsbury; at the 2001 census there were 6,555 jobs in Didsbury, compared with the 7,417 employed residents.|$|E
5|$|Macaulay's {{final two}} seasons were {{affected}} by injury, as he was increasingly bothered by rheumatism. In the 1934 season, while trying to take a catch, he injured the finger he used to spin the ball. He did not appear for Yorkshire until June, but went on to take 55 wickets {{at an average of}} 23.43. The next season was his final one. He only played nine matches, taking 22 wickets at 20.09. At the end of the year, he retired from first-class cricket and Yorkshire awarded him a special grant of £250. Yorkshire <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> replacement in mind; Frank Smailes was considered to be versatile enough in his bowling style to take Macaulay's place, {{but it was not until}} Ellis Robinson secured a place in 1937 that a new specialist off-spinner was found.|$|E

Among those who played in the chorus during the New York run was future star Shirley MacLaine; Shirley Jones was a chorus girl in the Chicago performances. Subsequent productions include one by Kansas City's Starlight Theatre in 1955. Equity Library Theatre produced it in New York in 1970; it returned to that city, though not to Broadway, in 2002 with the York Theatre. A London production was presented by the Finborough Theatre in 2010 in a fifty-seat theatre; the production was billed as the show's European premiere.|$|E
5|$|Other pirate radio {{stations}} in Britain were connected with the indie scene, with the most notable being Q102 and Radio Phoenix in London, and KFM Radio in Manchester.

5|$|The Vaishnava {{movement}} in the Kannada-speaking regions found momentum after {{the arrival of the}} philosopher Ramanujacharya (1017–1137). Fleeing possible persecution from the Chola King (who was a Shaiva), Ramanujacharya sought refuge initially in Tondanur and later moved to Melkote. But this event had no impact on Vaishnava literature in Hoysala lands at that time. However, the teachings of Madhvacharya (1238–1317), propounder of the Dvaita philosophy, <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> direct impact on Vaishnava literature, in both the Sanskrit and Kannada languages. This body of writings is known as haridasa sahitya (haridasa literature).|$|E

5|$|Zelda {{had a deep}} {{desire to}} develop a talent that was entirely her own, perhaps a {{reaction}} to Scott's fame and success as a writer.

She had been praised for her dancing skills as a child, and although the opinions of their friends vary as to her skill, it appears that she <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fair degree of talent. But Scott was totally dismissive of his wife's desire to become a professional dancer, considering it a waste of time.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, 5 September, the Australians {{arrived at}} Clifton for what {{promised to be}} an {{explosive}} encounter. Midwinter did not play for Gloucestershire due to his hand injury but his absence probably counted for little as the Australians took due revenge on the Graces and beat Gloucestershire soundly by 10 wickets inside two days. Spofforth had 12 wickets in the match, taking 7–49 and 5–41 as Gloucestershire struggled to 112 and 85, Grace making 22 and 5. As it happened, Spofforth did not get his wicket, though he caught Grace off Boyle in the first innings. In the second, Grace was lbw to Garrett. Grace could take only 1–90 in the Australian first innings of 183, in which Spofforth, who really <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> score to settle, top-scored with 44. To completely make his point, Spofforth then opened the Australian second innings in which he and Bailey scored the necessary 17 without loss. It {{was the first time}} Gloucestershire, formed in 1870, had been beaten in a home match.|$|E
5|$|Stratton wrote Experimental Psychology and its Bearing upon Culture {{to explain}} both typical {{psychological}} experiment methodology {{and how the}} results obtained answered philosophical problems. The book covered experimental results in psychology and how they influenced overall social behavior and the everyday cultural life of people. It did so {{by looking at the}} history of experimental psychology, and then surveying experimental methods covering both their applications and limits. Stratton pointed out how psychological experiments differed from the ones in physiology. The survey of experiments also included studies on mental perception, including among the blind. Stratton noted that the blind <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sense of space. He also described how measurements of mental phenomena were both possible and being done in practice, though he did believe the results had to be interpreted on a psychic scale different from the usual physical ones used for measures such as lengths and weights. He rejected the argument the mind was unitary and could not be studied by splitting it into parts, by drawing on the analogy of studying a tree by looking at its constituent parts, themselves not functionally trees. He presumed sensations were akin to trees in how they could be split up into parts.|$|E

5|$|The 1996 {{season began}} well for Zolak, whose {{contract}} was extended through 1998. However, {{to remain with}} the Patriots, Zolak took a $250,000 pay cut to work around the salary cap. While he appeared set to keep his backup job heading into training camp, he faced tough competition from Jay Barker. While Zolak welcomed the challenge, his status as the backup quarterback began to seem uncertain a few weeks into training camp. By the end of training camp, Barker had been cut, and Zolak's quarterback job was safe. He took the role of emergency quarterback throughout the 1996 season, with Bledsoe taking nearly all the snaps and Tom Tupa serving as the backup upon his signing. Zolak played in three games, completing one pass for five yards. He saw some playing time in the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but did not play in Super Bowl XXXI. Parcells ordered Zolak to lose weight, which Zolak did {{throughout much of the}} season. The 1997 season was more of the same for Zolak, backing up Bledsoe, though the Patriots <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new coach in Pete Carroll. As training camp ended, Zolak gained significantly more playing time during drills and the preseason matchups then he had under Parcells. As the regular season came and went, however, he had minimal playing time. Zolak saw action in four games, completing six of nine passes for 67yards and two touchdowns, giving him a quarterback rating of 128.2.|$|E
