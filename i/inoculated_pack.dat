40|$|ABSTRACT: A 915 -MHz Microwave-Circulated Water Combination (MCWC) heating {{technology}} was validated for a {{macaroni and cheese}} product using <b>inoculated</b> <b>pack</b> studies. Before the tests, heat resistances of a Clostridium sporogenes (PA 3679) spore crop were determined in neutral phosphate buffer and macaroni and cheese product. Trays of maca-roni and cheese products were subjected to 3 processing levels: target process (F 0 = 2. 4), under target process (F 0 = 1. 2), and over target process (F 0 = 4. 8). The inoculated packs were evaluated by count-reduction method and end-point method. The microbial results showed that microbial destruction resulting from MCWC heating technology matched the calculated degree of sterilization (F 0 value). This study suggests that the MCWC heating technology has potential in sterilizing packaged foods...|$|E
40|$|In <b>inoculated</b> <b>pack</b> {{experiments}} on Clostridium botulinum type E, unirradiated and 0. 1 -Mrad irradiated haddock fillets often gave nonspecific toxicities by the mouse assay test for botulinum toxin. Samples given 0. 2 -Mrad radiation {{failed to produce}} nonspecific reactions. Nonspecific deaths sometimes occurred within 24 hr after injection, although deaths between 24 and 48 hr were more common. The symptoms and the pattern of these deaths suggested a septicemia. Heart-blood cultured from mice showing nonspecific symptoms indicated an infectious process. Among 23 isolates from the blood, eight were identified as Proteus vulgaris, two P. morganii, one P. rettgeri, one Providence subgroup B, two Aerobacter aerogenes, one Actinobacillus, three enterococci, one Alcaligenes marshalli, and four Erysipelothrix insidiosa. The E. insidiosa, Aerobacter, Providence group, {{and most of the}} Proteus isolates were infectious for mice when injected by the intraperitoneal route. But the enterococci, Alcaligenes, and Actinobacillus isolates were not infectious and probably represent secondary invaders. The cultural characteristics of the E. insidiosa isolates conform to those described in the literature, with the exception that the four strains grew in the temperature range 50 F (10 C) to 40 F (4. 4 C). Nonspecific toxicities were avoided in assays for botulinum toxin by the protection of mice with chloramphenicol and oxytetracycline...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary concern}} about {{microbial}} safety of irradiated food is {{the survival of}} pathogenic spore forming bacteria. Clostridium sporogenes {{was selected as the}} spore forming test organism for conducting <b>inoculated</b> <b>pack</b> studies for its similarities to the most toxigenic Cl. botulinum, in radiation resistance. Minimum radiation dose applied (45 kGy under cryogenic condition, in - 790 C) was determined to eliminate Cl. sporogenes spores and other bacterial contaminants in different kind of Indonesian chicken and beef dishes. In separate studies, irradiation doses of 3 – 7 kGy at cryogenic condition was used to improve the microbiological safety of a number chilled prepared meals. The dishes or ready to eat foods were packaged in air impermeable pouches. Irradiation process was carried out after inoculation on chicken and beef dishes with certain amounts of Cl. sporogenes spores. The evaluation of colony count differences between the irradiated and unirradiated foods revealed the effect of radiation on the survival of bacterial spores or other bacterial contaminants. It was demonstrated that a minimum dose of 45 kGy under cryogenic condition eliminated the spore of Cl. sporogenes, Bacillus spp and Staphylococcus spp. Irradiation at doses 5 - 7 kGy significantly reduced some potential pathogenic microorganisms in samples without affecting quality up to 3 months of storage at the refrigeration temperature...|$|E
40|$|<b>Inoculated</b> <b>packs</b> {{of cooked}} and raw ground beef were sterilized with gamma {{radiation}} from cobalt- 60. With inocula of 5, 000, 000 Clostridium botulinum 213 B spores per g of cooked ground beef, 3. 8 megarad were required for sterilization; in raw ground beef, 3. 72 megarad sterilized the meat when inocula of 1, 700, 000 C. botulinum 213 B spores were used per g. Using C. botulinum 62 A spores, cooked ground beef inoculated with 5, 200, 000 spores per g was sterilized with 3. 85 megarad; raw ground beef, inoculated with 2, 670, 000 spores per g, was sterilized with 3. 6 megarad. Cans of meat that were considered sterile {{by lack of}} culture growth after incubation for at least 6 months and, in some instances, as long as 5 years, were tested {{for the presence of}} botulinus toxin. No toxin was found in any meat taken from <b>inoculated</b> <b>packs</b> prepared from C. botulinum 213 B spores; however, all cans of meat that had been inoculated with more than 2, 670, 000 C. botulinum 62 A spores per g of meat, contained type A toxin. It was shown that these latter inocula of heat-shocked spores, by themselves, contained sufficient toxin to kill mice. However, more toxin appeared to be present than could be ascribed to the unirradiated spores alone. This finding is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Sales and {{consumption}} of refrigerated processed foods of extended durability (REPFEDs) have increased many-fold in Europe over the last 10 years. The safety and quality of these convenient ready-to-eat foods relies {{on a combination of}} mild heat treatment and refrigerated storage, sometimes in combination with other hurdles such as mild preservative factors. The major hazard to the microbiological safety of these foods is Clostridium botulinum. This paper reports on the prevalence and behaviour of proteolytic C. botulinum and non-proteolytic C. botulinum in gnocchi, a potato-based REPFED of Italian origin. Attempts to isolate proteolytic C. botulinum and non-proteolytic C. botulinum from gnocchi and its ingredients were unsuccessful. Based on assessment of the adequacy of the methods used, it was estimated that for proteolytic C. botulinum there was 4. 2 for proteolytic C. botulinum, and > 6. 2 for non-proteolytic C. botulinum.

40|$|ABSTRACT: There is {{a current}} need for fresh-cooked-like yet {{shelf-stable}} egg products for U. S. military combat rations. Novel thermal processes based on radio frequency (RF) energy can shorten the heating time and reduce overheating. This technology was explored to produce shelf-stable egg products for combat ration development. Clostridium sporogenes (PA 3679) spores {{were used as}} a surrogate to validate the RF sterilization process to control Clostridium botulinum. Decimal reduction time (D value) of PA 3679 in scrambled eggs was determined using aluminum thermal-death-time (TDT) tubes. The thermal inactivation kinetic information was then used in <b>inoculated</b> <b>pack</b> studies to validate a novel thermal process based on 27. 12 MHz radio frequency (RF) pilot scale unit. Trays of scrambled eggs inoculated with PA 3679 were subjected to 3 processing levels: target process (F 0 about 5. 3 min), under-target process (F 0 about 3. 0 min), and over-target process (F 0 about 9. 1 min). The results of the microbial challenge study showed that microbial destruction from the RF process agreed with sterilization values calculated from time-temperature data measured at the cold spot in the treated trays. A comparison of RF- and retort-treated scrambled eggs showed {{significant differences in the}} degree of lightness (L*) and redness (a*). RF-processed egg was less brown compared with conventional retorted eggs. Retort treatment of fully cooked scrambled eggs had higher hardness, springiness, and smaller cohesiveness than RF-treated samples. This study suggests that RF thermal processes can produce safe, shelf-stable sterilized scrambled eggs for both military and civilian uses...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{consisting of}} a Dewar flask and a relay system controlling the flow of liquid nitrogen permitted the irradiation of samples in tin cans or Pyrex tubes at temperatures ranging from 0 ± 1. 5 C to - 194 ± 2 C. An <b>inoculated</b> <b>pack</b> comprising 320 cans of ground beef containing 5 × 104 spores of Clostridium botulinum 33 A per can (10 cans per radiation dose) was irradiated with Co 60 at 0 and - 196 C. Incubation was carried out at 30 C for 6 months. Approximately 0. 9 Mrad more radiation was required to inactivate the spores at - 196 C than at 0 C. Cans irradiated at - 196 C showed partial spoilage at 3. 6 Mrad and no spoilage at 3. 9 Mrad; the corresponding spoilage-no spoilage doses at 0 C were 2. 7 and 3. 0, respectively. The majority of positive cans swelled in 2 to 14 days; occasional swelling occurred as late as 20 days. At progressively higher doses, swelling was delayed proportionally to the radiation dose received. The remaining nonswollen cans had no toxin after 6 months of storage, although occasional cans contained very low numbers of viable spores comprising on the average 0. 1 % of the original spore inoculum. The D 10 values in phosphate buffer were 0. 290 Mrad for 0 C and 0. 396 Mrad for - 196 C; in ground beef, the corresponding D 10 values were 0. 463 Mrad and 0. 680 Mrad, respectively. These D 10 values indicate that the lethal effect of γ rays decreased at - 196 C as compared with 0 C by 13. 5 % in phosphate buffer, and by 47 % in ground beef...|$|E

40|$|Clostridium botulinum type E studies {{reported}} in this paper include the incidence of the organism in selected Chesapeake Bay areas, growth and toxin production in crabmeat homogenates, {{and the effect of}} pasteurization upon varying levels of spores in crabmeat. Type E spores were detected in 21 of 24 bottom mud samples taken at locations from which blue crabs were being harvested. Sterilized crabmeat homogenates inoculated with as little as five spores per 10 g became toxic after 8 days at 50 F, 2 days at 75 F, and 1 day at 85 F. Growth at 50 F and above was accompanied by gas production and a slightly sour odor. Growth and toxin production at 40 F required 55 days or longer and inocula of 103 spores or higher per 10 g of homogenate. At 40 F gas production was usually not apparent and no off odors could be detected. A recommended minimum pasteurization of 1 min at 185 F internal meat temperature reduced type E spore levels in <b>inoculated</b> <b>packs</b> of crabmeat from 108 spores per 100 g to 6 or less spores per 100 g, and the pasteurized meat remained nontoxic during 6 months of storage at 40 F...|$|R

40|$|Biogas, {{composed}} principally of methane, {{has limited}} use in energy generation {{due to the}} presence of hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S). Biogas cannot be burned directly in an engine as H 2 S present causes corrosion in the reaction chamber. There currently exist various technologies for the removal of H 2 S from a gas stream, but most are chemically based, expensive, and are limited in use. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine a biogas purification technique suitable for a small scale farm application; including using a technology inexpensive, efficient, robust and easy to operate. As such, biofiltration was investigated for H 2 S removal from biogas. Factors considered in the design of the biofiltration system included the source and conditioning of inoculum, type of packing material, and general operating conditions including inlet gas flow rate and H 2 S loading rate to the biofilter. Activated sludge conditioned in A. ferrooxidans media was an effective inoculum source. This was tested for growth support compatibility with gravel packing material, to be used in the biofilter. The <b>inoculated</b> <b>packing</b> material was loaded into the biofilter initially during start-up and acclimatization. In this study, synthetic biogas (49. 9 %volCH 4, 49. 9 %volCO 2, 2000 ppmv H 2 S) mixed with air (totalling 4 %vol O 2) was added at 5 - 10 L/hr to a biofilter of 0. 4 L gravel <b>packing</b> <b>inoculated</b> with conditioned activated sludge. Baseline H 2 S removal studies in a non-inoculated biofilter were performed with anticipated operating conditions, including an inlet gas stream at 7. 5 L/h (25 oC, 1 atm), resulting in 31 - 56 % H 2 S removal. A factorial test performed found that air content in the inlet gas stream was the significant factor affecting the removal of H 2 S in the non-inoculated biofilter. Operation of the biofilter with biogas was done for 61 days, including 41 days for start-up and acclimatization and 20 days of H 2 S loading tests. Start-up and acclimatization with biogas resulted in complete H 2 S removal after 2 days, with an average overall H 2 S removal of 98. 1 %± 2. 9 std deviation over 34 days. Loading tests performed on the system ranged 5 - 12. 4 L/h (25 oC, 1 atm), with a loading rate of 27. 8 to 69. 5 gH 2 S/m 3 h of filter bed. Throughout this test the average H 2 S removal rate was 98. 9 %± 2. 1 std deviation over 20 days. Although complete H 2 S breakthrough studies were not performed, these results indicate that biofiltration is a promising technology for H 2 S removal from biogas in a small scale application...|$|R
40|$|Several {{statistical}} methods, {{including the}} conventional technique of Schmidt and Nank, were evaluated for estimating radiation resistance values of various strains of Clostridium botulinum {{by the use}} of partial spoilage data from an <b>inoculated</b> ham <b>pack</b> study. Procedures based on quantal response were preferred. The tedious but rigorous probit maximum likelihood determination was used as a standard of comparison. Weibull's graphical treatment was the method of choice because it is simple to utilize, it is mathematically sound, and its ld 50 values agreed closely with the reference standard. In addition, it offers a means for analyzing the type of microbial death kinetics that occur in the pack (exponential, normal, log normal, or mixed distributions), and it predicts the probability of microbial death with any radiation dose used, as well as the dose needed to destroy any given number of organisms, without the need to assume the death pattern of the partial spoilage data. The Weibull analysis indicated a normal type kinetics of death for C. botulinum spores in irradiated cured ham rather than an exponential order of death, as assumed by the Schmidt-Nank formula. The Weibull 12 D equivalent of a radiation process, or the minimal radiation dose (MRD), for cured ham was consistently higher than both the experimental sterilizing dose (ESD) and the Schmidt-Nank average MRD. The latter calculation was lower than the ESD in three of the five instances examined, which seems unrealistic. The Spearman-Kärber estimate was favored as the arithmetic technique on the bases of ease of computation, close agreement with the reference method, and providing confidence limits for the ld 50 values...|$|R
30|$|The {{method of}} {{inoculation}} significantly impacted how the fungi performed within the logs, and fungi with different types of pigmentation appeared to prefer different methods of inoculation. Zone line producing fungi produced more zone lines when introduced into the logs in sterile plugs, while pink staining fungi performed better when sprayed onto the logs. Both methods are based in past literature, which includes pressing fungal mats against log ends [14, 15], spraying a mixture of distilled water and fungi on the logs [16 – 18], <b>packing</b> <b>inoculated</b> sawdust into drilled holes in the log [19], and using inoculated plugs to deliver active cultures directly into the wood [20]. Although spray inoculation was more effective with S. cuboidea, {{it is possible that}} the opening of the sapwood for spray inoculation also partially inhibited the pink stain production. As noted by Leatham [20], inoculum generally performs better when the bark is retained, as the bark helps maintain moisture content, insulates against temperature changes, and can inhibit the colonization by airborne contaminants. An inoculation method which enables entire surface coverage without exposing large portions of the internal wood would be ideal, but would be exceptionally difficult to achieve.|$|R

In this investigation, antagonistic activity on agar against 17 mold species was determined. The abilities of Pichia anomala, Pichia guilliermondii, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to inhibit {{the growth of}} the mold Penicillium roqueforti in nonsterile high-moisture wheat were compared by adding 10 (3) Penicillium roqueforti spores and different amounts of yeast cells per gram of wheat. <b>Inoculated</b> grain was <b>packed</b> in glass tubes, incubated at 25 degrees C with a restricted air supply, and the numbers of yeast and mold CFU were determined on selective media after 7 and 14 days. Pichia anomala reduced growth on agar plates for all of the mold species tested in a dose-dependent manner. Aspergillus fumigatus and Eurotium amstelodami were the most sensitive, while Penicillium italicum and Penicillium digitatum were the most resistant. Pichia anomala had the strongest antagonistic activity in wheat, with 10 (5) and 10 (6) CFU/g completely inhibiting the growth of Penicillium roqueforti. Inhibition was least pronounced at the optimum temperature (21 degrees C) and water activity (0. 95) for the growth of Penicillium roqueforti. Pichia guilliermondii slightly reduced the growth of Penicillium roqueforti in wheat inoculated with 10 (5) and 10 (6) yeast CFU/g. S. cerevisiae inhibited mold growth only weakly at the highest inoculum level. Pichia anomala grew from 10 (3) to 10 (7) CFU/g of wheat in 1 week. To reach the same level, Pichia guilliermondii had to be inoculated at 10 (4) CFU while S. cerevisiae required an inoculum of 10 (5) CFU to reach 10 (7) CFU/g of wheat...|$|R
40|$|An <b>inoculated,</b> {{irradiated}} beef <b>pack</b> (1, 240 cans) {{study was}} conducted for the determination of microbiological safety for unrestricted human consumption. Each can contained a mixture of 106 spores of each of 10 strains of Clostridium botulinum (5 type A and 5 type B), or a total of 107 spores/can. The cans were irradiated to various doses (100 cans/dose) with 60 Co gamma rays at - 30 ± 10 C, incubated at 30 ± 2 C for 6 months, and examined for swelling, toxicity, and recoverable botulinal cells. The minimal experimental sterilizing dose based on nonswollen, nontoxic sterile cans was 2. 2 < experimental sterilizing dose ≤ 2. 6 Mrad. Using recoverable cells as the most stringent criterion of spoilage, and assuming the conventional simple exponential (without an initial shoulder) rate of spore kill, the “ 12 D” dose was 3. 7 Mrad when estimated {{on the basis of}} a mixture of 10 strains totaling 107 spores/can, and 4. 3 Mrad if it is assumed that each can of beef contained 106 spores of a single most resistant strain and all of these spores were of identical resistances. However, an analysis of the data by extreme value statistics indicated with 90 % confidence that the spore death rate was not a simple exponential but might be a shifted exponential (with an initial shoulder), Weibull, lognormal, or normal, with a “ 12 D” equivalent of about 3. 0 Mrad regardless of the initial spore density per can. There was an apparent antagonism between the irradiated type A and B strains in the cans. Some of the cans contained type B toxin but did not include type B viable cells. Other cans had a mixture of type A and B toxins, but a large number of these cans did not yield recoverable type B cells.
