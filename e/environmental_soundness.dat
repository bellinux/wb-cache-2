40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} possibilities of forwarding timber in an efficient and environmentally friendly way, under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils of Croatian lowland forests due to their increased moisture all the year round. Reduced soil bearing capacity causes restricted mobility and decreases the forwarder productivity, and also increases the level of damage caused to forest soil, reflected in its compaction and rutting (Fig. 1). In lowland even-aged forests of Croatia, main felling is mostly carried out based on wood cutting and processing by chain saws and forwarding of timber, processed by cut-to-length method, by six-wheel forwarders, usually not equipped with semitracks on rear wheels of bogie axle (Fig. 1). The analysis was carried out on {{the example of a}} medium-weight six-wheel forwarder Valmet 840. 2 (nominal load capacity of 12 t, whose dimensions and load distribution of empty vehicle are shown in Fig. 4), and this analysis involved as follows: 1) the effect of load reduction on forwarder efficiency, 2) forwarder <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness</b> under conditions of limited soil strength based on nominal ground pressure (Mellgren 1980) of front and rear wheels of the vehicle depending on the mass of loaded timber, vehicle with narrower (600 mm) and wider (710 mm) tires, or with tracks on wheels of the rear (bogie) axle. The limit value of <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness</b> would be the allowed ground pressure of limited bearing capacity < 60 kPa (Owende et al. 2002). The effect of load reduction (4 t, 8 t with respect to 12 t of the vehicle nominal load capacity) on forwarder efficiency with respect to the distance of timber forwarding, is expressed according to the multicriteria calculation model of productivity of these vehicles (Stankić 2010), which takes into account: 1) forwarder class 2) soil strength, 3) use of tracks, 4) felling density, 5) volume of the average felling tree and 6) distance of timber forwarding. The unit cost of timber forwarding was calculated according to machine rate made by the company »Hrvatske šume» d. o. o Zagreb for the forwarder Valmet 840. 2 (433. 19 kn/h). For calculating the nominal ground pressure (Fig. 3), a theoretical model of axle load distribution was used, the case of vehicle at standstill on level ground, depending on mass and length of loaded logs in the bunk area of the forwarder (Poršinsky and Horvat 2005). The analysis of axle load distribution was based on an average length of logs (4 m) made by cut-to-length method {{in the area of the}} Croatian lowland forests, and the mass of 1800 kg of a pair of semitracks. The wheel load assumed even load distribution of axle load by pertaining wheels. The contact area between wheels (tracks) and soil was calculated according to Mellgren (1980), for narrower (front – 600 / 65 - 34, rear – 600 / 55 - 26. 5) and wider (front – 710 / 55 - 34, rear – 710 / 45 - 26. 5) tires recommended by the manufacturer of forwarder. The analysis of the forwarder <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness</b> was based on: 1) values of nominal ground pressure of front and rear wheels of the vehicle depending on the mass of loaded timber, and use of narrower and wider tires, i. e. or use of tracks, and 2) the upper limit value of the allowed ground pressure (< 60 kPa) of limited bearing capacity (class 3 – Fig. 2), which prevails at the time of main felling in the Croatian lowland forests. The results of efficiency analysis of timber forwarding (Fig. 5) showed that the reduction of load under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils, as a measure for providing vehicle mobility as well as for diminishing the level of damage caused to forest soil, is highly unacceptable due to the decrease of productivity and increase of unit costs. The analysis of nominal ground pressure (Fig. 7) under wheels of the front axle and wheels (tracks) of the rear axle, showed that under conditions of limited soil bearing capacity: 1) the forwarder nominal load capacity may be used and that efficient timber forwarding may be performed, 2) the <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness</b> can be provided by the application of four-axle (eight-wheel) forwarders equipped with wider tires and half-tracks on wheels of front and rear bogie axle of the vehicle. These results should be used as guidelines for purchasing forwarders, and such approach would provide in future ecoefficient timber forwarding under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils in main felling sites of lowland forests...|$|E

40|$|Eucharistic worship is at {{the core}} of the Christian faith. It is a {{tradition}} that the Christian faith observes and is done in remembrance of Christ, as Christ instructed during the last supper. This is a tradition that is observed within the Anglican Church of Southern Africa (ACSA), just as in many other denominations. The liturgical movement within ACSA can be traced back to 1848 with the arrival of the first Bishop, of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa (CPSA), with the utilization of the 1662 Anglican Prayer Book (APB), a liturgy which resembled that in the United Kingdom. Worth noting though is that even then, in the liturgy and in Eucharistic worship, the prayers of offertory place the congregants in a humble position and viewed as part of creation and nowhere above any other created being. This showed some <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness</b> within the Eucharistic service. The anchor liturgy for the CPSA, was the Book of Common prayer which was revised in 1928, and in 1969 the first experimental liturgy for the CPSA was published, and followed by another publication in 1979. The 1969 APB, contained a number of special prayers for the environment, such as prayers in times of famine and prayers for good harvest and good weather. These adaptations show that the ACSA was long environmentally aware. The 1979 APB, posited some regression in terms of <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness</b> as it only contained a prayer for the stewardship of creation. And the 1989 APB which is the book that is currently being used in ACSA, contained a number of environmentally aware prayers but a stark improvement was in that it contained a special prayer for the environment. In 2008 ACSA published the Seasons of Creation and Ryan the Rhino, series which sought to bring issues of the environment into the core of worship and thereby addressing the deficiencies in the APB. These provided a separate liturgy, which emphasizes the role of the church and congregants as stewards of creation. ACSA also became a member of the movement of Eco Bishops. We conclude that though the Eucharistic service has remained constant over time, the liturgy around the service has evolved to one that is environmentally sound. And the teachings are such that congregants are propelled into a more environmentally sound people.

The limit value of <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness</b> would be the allowed ground pressure of limited bearing capacity < 60 kPa (Owende et al. 2002). The effect of load reduction (4 t, 8 t with respect to 12 t of the vehicle nominal load capacity) on forwarder efficiency with respect to the distance of timber forwarding, is expressed according to the multicriteria calculation model of productivity of these vehicles (Stankić 2010), which takes into account: 1) forwarder class 2) soil strength, 3) use of tracks, 4) felling density, 5) volume of the average felling tree and 6) distance of timber forwarding. The unit cost of timber forwarding was calculated according to machine rate made by the company »Hrvatske šume» d. o. o Zagreb for the forwarder Valmet 840. 2 (433. 19 kn/h). For calculating the nominal ground pressure (Fig. 3), a theoretical model of axle load distribution was used, the case of vehicle at standstill on level ground, depending on mass and length of loaded logs in the bunk area of the forwarder (Poršinsky and Horvat 2005). The analysis of axle load distribution was based on an average length of logs (4 m) made by cut-to-length method {{in the area of the}} Croatian lowland forests, and the mass of 1800 kg of a pair of semitracks. The wheel load assumed even load distribution of axle load by pertaining wheels. The contact area between wheels (tracks) and soil was calculated according to Mellgren (1980), for narrower (front – 600 / 65 - 34, rear – 600 / 55 - 26. 5) and wider (front – 710 / 55 - 34, rear – 710 / 45 - 26. 5) tires recommended by the manufacturer of forwarder. The analysis of the forwarder <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness</b> was based on: 1) values of nominal ground pressure of front and rear wheels of the vehicle depending on the mass of loaded timber, and use of narrower and wider tires, i. e. or use of tracks, and 2) the upper limit value of the allowed ground pressure (< 60 kPa) of limited bearing capacity (class 3 – Fig. 2), which prevails at the time of main felling in the Croatian lowland forests. The results of efficiency analysis of timber forwarding (Fig. 5) showed that the reduction of load under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils, as a measure for providing vehicle mobility as well as for diminishing the level of damage caused to forest soil, is highly unacceptable due to the decrease of productivity and increase of unit costs. The analysis of nominal ground pressure (Fig. 7) under wheels of the front axle and wheels (tracks) of the rear axle, showed that under conditions of limited soil bearing capacity: 1) the forwarder nominal load capacity may be used and that efficient timber forwarding may be performed, 2) the <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness</b> can be provided by the application of four-axle (eight-wheel) forwarders equipped with wider tires and half-tracks on wheels of front and rear bogie axle of the vehicle. These results should be used as guidelines for purchasing forwarders, and such approach would provide in future ecoefficient timber forwarding under conditions of limited bearing capacity of gley soils in main felling sites of lowland forests...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{countries}} have established policies for reducing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and have suggested goals pertaining to these reductions. To reach the target reduction amounts, studies on the reduction of carbon emissions have been conducted with regard to all stages and processes in construction projects. According to a study on carbon emissions, the carbon emissions generated during the construction stage of road projects account for approximately 76 to 86 % of the total carbon emissions, far exceeding the other stages, such as maintenance or demolition. Therefore, this study aims to develop a quantitative decision making model that supports the application of green technologies (GTs) to reduce carbon emissions during the construction stage of road construction projects. First, the authors selected <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness,</b> economic feasibility and constructability as the key assessment indices for evaluating 20 GTs. Second, a fuzzy set/qualitative comparative analysis (FS/QCA) was used to establish an objective decision-making model {{for the assessment of}} both the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the key indices. To support the developed model, an expert survey was performed to assess the applicability of each GT from a practical perspective, which was verified with a case study using two additional GTs. The proposed model is expected to support practitioners in the application of suitable GTs to road projects and reduce carbon emissions, resulting in better decision making during road construction projects...|$|E
40|$|Systems with {{parts in}} {{relative}} motion experience friction and wear. The {{need to understand}} tribology on the micro- and nanoscale increases in importance with decreasing technological device sizes. Micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems often experience failure due to stiction (static friction). During {{millions of years of}} evolution, natural systems have optimized their tribological and other performances. The aim of biotribology is to gather information about friction, adhesion, lubrication and wear of biological friction systems and to apply this knowledge to innovate technology, with the additional benefit of <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness.</b> Examples for biological friction systems at different length scales are bacterial flagellae, joints and articular cartilage as well as muscle connective tissues. Our model system for biotribological investigations at the micro- and nanoscale are diatoms. Diatoms are single celled microalgae with a cell wall consisting of amorphous glass enveloped by an organic layer. Diatoms are small, highly reproductive, and accessible with different kinds of microscopy methods. There are several diatom species which actively move (e. g. Bacillaria paxillifer forms colonies of 5 to 30 cells which rhythmically expand and contract) or which can – as cell colonies – reversibly be elongated by a major fraction of their original length (e. g. Ellerbeckia arenaria). Diatoms also seem to show highly efficient self lubrication while cells divide and grow. These algae might provide lubrication strategies which are still unknown to engineers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In Asia, {{including}} Japan and Korea, {{rice paddies}} occupy the largest cultivated area in agricultural land. Rice paddies provide the habitats for many organisms including endemic species, sustaining high biodiversity. Insect natural enemies inhabiting rice paddies {{have an important}} function for rice production as agents of ‘ecosystem services ’ because they {{play a major role}} in suppressing rice pests. The diversity and abundance of natural enemies can be a good index reflecting the ‘healthiness ’ of agro-ecosystem services in rice paddies. The present study investigates whether insect natural enemies could be good biological indicators for general arthropod biodiversity and agricultural practice. First, the concept of ideal bio-indicators was summarized. The strategy to explore and select such bio-indicators was then proposed. Lastly, field survey was made to evaluate the abundance and biodiversity of natural enemies in Japanese rice paddies where chemical inputs, i. e., insecticide use, were different. The results showed that reduction of chemical inputs led to an increase in species richness or diversity of natural enemies including parasitoids and predators. Then, the data were analyzed to examine suitable indicator species to assess <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness</b> of agricultural practice and biodiversity in rice paddies. The density of several species of natural enemies did respond both to pesticide use and to general arthropod biodiversity. The analyses thus have indicated that natural enemies can be suitable as bio-indicators. Usefulness of indicator species in rice paddies is discussed in the context of ecologically sound agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Dredging is {{the process}} of {{removing}} sediments from the seabed to deepen the waters for the safe navigation of vessels. The dislodged materials from the seabed, i. e. dredged marine soils, are generally disposed of as a geowaste. This paper examines the potential reuse of the dredged materials within a comprehensive framework of technological feasibility, <b>environmental</b> <b>soundness</b> and knowledge creation (SAKET management system). The existing multi-discipline knowledge base serves as a vast reservoir of good practices to be adopted and moulded into the proposed system. The environmental background and impact that are related to the reuse mechanism need to be thoroughly investigated and determined too. The background data enables an informed selection of relevant technology to be implemented in the reuse exercise of dredged marine soils, which could lead to technological integration and innovation for optimum outputs. The subsequent monitoring and reviews would then create new insights and understanding to enrich the existing knowledge base, i. e. a full circle return. The proposed SAKET framework aims to provide a handling and management system of dredged marine soils which is simultaneously proactive and responsive, while being sufficiently flexible and predictive to ensure effective operational outputs with efficient utilization of the resources available. In short, the framework would embrace existing know-how in the folds of technological advances and innovations to develop an allencompassing management system for reusing the dredged marine soils in a responsible manner for long term benefits...|$|E
