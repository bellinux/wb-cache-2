40|$|ABSTRACT. The asymbiotic {{technique}} of orchid seeds germination {{is an important}} method of mass production of seedlings. Studies on the best culture conditions for each species are important to obtain seedlings in less time and at lower costs. Current analysis evaluates different consistencies of culture medium, saline formulations and culture conditions on the germination rate and further development of protocorms of Epidendrum fulgens. After 45 days in culture the protocorms were classified into three categories of development. The liquid saline formulation of Murashige and Skoog (1962) (MS) provided the highest germination rate (83. 5 %), and the Knudson formulation (1946) the lowest (10. 9 %). The different consistencies or conditions or culture conditions {{did not affect the}} germination rate percentage, except the Knudson medium, which resulted in the highest rate in response to the <b>gelled</b> <b>consistency.</b> Protocorms cultured in liquid MS medium with or without agitation showed the fastest development...|$|E

Ten different generations including P 1, P 2, F 1, RF 1, BC 1, RBC 1, BC 2, RBC 2, F 2 and RF 2 were evaluated using generation mean analysis. In generation mean analysis, one of non-allelic interaction components, [i], [j] 1, [j] 2, [l] 1, [l] 2, [l] was significant indicating the genetic model of these characters were described by additive-dominance model with non-allelic gene interaction (except for gelatinization temperature trait in Sang-Tarrom × Gerdeh cross).

Nitrogen fertilizer have been applied in three stages (1 / 3 in transplanting stage, 1 / 3 in tillering stage and finally 1 / 3 in flowering initiation stage) and potassium fertilizer have been applied in two stages (½ in transplanting stage and ½ in shooting stage).

40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa) grain attributes, {{including}} {{among others}} milling quality, grain length and shape, amylose content, and aroma are critical in varietal development and subsquent adoption at the farm level.

40|$|China is {{the first}} country to use {{heterosis}} successfully for commercial rice production. This study compared the main quality characteristics (head rice rate, chalky rice rate, chalkiness degree, <b>gel</b> <b>consistency,</b> amylose content, and length-to-width ratio) of 635 rice varieties (not including upland and glutinous rice) released from 2000 to 2014 to establish the quality status and offer suggestions for future rice breeding for grain quality in China. In the past 15 years, grain quality in japonica rice and indica hybrid rice has improved. In japonica rice, inbred varieties have increased head rice rates and decreased chalkiness degree over time, while hybrid rice varieties have decreased chalky rice rates and chalkiness degree. In indica hybrid rice, the chalkiness degree and amylose contents have decreased and <b>gel</b> <b>consistency</b> has increased. Improvements in grain quality in indica inbred rice have been limited, with some increases in head rice rate and decreases in chalky rice rate and amylose content. From 2010 to 2014, the percentage of indica varieties meeting the Grade III national standard of rice quality for different quality traits was low, especially for chalky rice rate and chalkiness degree. Japonica varieties have more superior grain quality than indica rice in terms of higher head rice rates and <b>gel</b> <b>consistency,</b> lower chalky rice rates and chalkiness degree, and lower amylose contents, {{which may explain why}} the Chinese prefer japonica rice. The japonica rice varieties, both hybrid and inbred, had similar grain qualities, but this varied in indica rice with the hybrid varieties having higher grain quality than inbred varieties due to significantly better head rice rates and lower chalkiness degree.

40|$|Forty five {{aromatic}} rice genotypes {{were evaluated}} {{to assess the}} genetic variability and diversity {{on the basis of}} nine characters. Significant variations were observed among the genotypes for all the characters (grain breadth (mm), grain length (mm), grain L/B ratio, gelatinization temperature (score), <b>gel</b> <b>consistency</b> (mm), amylose content (%), protein content (%), 1000 grain weight (g) and grain yield per plant (g)) studied. High GCV, PCV, heritability and GA as observed in amylose content, grain length average and L/B ratio suggested that these three characters could be transmitted to the progeny. Multivariate analysis revealed that 45 genotypes were grouped into six clusters. There were marked variations in intra-cluster distances, which ranged from 0. 482 to 7. 851. The highest intra cluster mean for five traits (amylose content, width average, L/B ratio, length average, 1000 grain weight) was obtained from cluster I constituted 10 genotypes. Thousand grain weight and amylose content have been found to contribute maximum towards genetic diversity in 45 genotypes of aromatic rice...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} and compare the agronomic and grain quality attributes of three advanced backcross-derived transgenic rice lines expressing synthetic cry 1 Ab gene vs. non-transgenic control in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) under field conditions. The data exhibited that transgenic rice lines, Neda and Nemat were higher in height, earlier in maturity and highly resistant to striped stem borer (Chilo suppressalis) in comparing with non-transgenic varieties. In contrast, no significant difference was observed for transgenic Khazar as compared to its control, except for 1000 -grain weight. Laboratory tests for grain physicochemical properties showed no significant variations between transgenic lines and non-transgenic controls. However, some variations for traits like Amylose Content (AC) and <b>Gel</b> <b>Consistency</b> (GC) were seen for transgenic Neda and Khazar, respectively. As regards the rice striped stem borer natural infestation, field-release experiment indicated that all three transgenic rice lines conferred a very high degree of resistance to rice striped stem borer as compared to non-transgenic check varieties...|$|R
