5|$|This {{pay raise}} {{proposal}} was submitted as {{an amendment to}} the government's general appropriations bill. Had Grant vetoed the bill, the government would not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> to operate for the following fiscal year, which would have necessitated a special session of Congress. However, Grant missed an opportunity to make a statement by threatening a veto.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to Detroit's declaration of bankruptcy, Paul stated {{he would not}} allow the government to attempt to bail out Detroit. In a phone interview with Breitbart News on July 19, 2013, Paul said, [...] "I basically say he is bailing them out over my dead body, because we don't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> in Washington." [...] Paul said he thought a federal bailout would send {{the wrong message to}} other cities with financial problems.|$|E

500|$|Van Peebles {{recalls that}} [...] "music {{was not used}} as a selling tool in movies at the time. Even musicals, it would take {{three months after the}} release of the movie before they would bring out an album." [...] Because Van Peebles did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> for {{traditional}} advertising methods, he decided that by releasing a soundtrack album in anticipation of the film's release, he could help build awareness for the film with its music.|$|E
500|$|The film also {{influenced}} American film productions: John Carpenter {{has suggested that}} the film inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the Michael Myers character in the slasher film series Halloween. Carpenter recalls that the film crew [...] "didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> to make a mask. It was originally written the way you see it, in other words, it's a pale mask with human features, almost featureless. I don't know why I wrote that down, why Debra [...] and I decided on that, maybe it was because of an old movie called Eyes Without a Face".|$|E
500|$|Albert Daniels as Brooklyn, a New York {{transplant}} {{and one of}} Rashad's closest friends. Robinson {{had known}} Daniels {{since he was a}} fifteen-year-old production assistant on his music video shoots in New York. [...] "He was an annoying little kid who got fired every time he was a P.A. because he was so inquisitive. But every time they fired him I'd bring him back because I felt like he always had something." [...] Eight years later, Robinson ran into Daniels at a poetry reading in New York City, and told him to audition for the film. Daniels didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> to get to Atlanta where he had to audition, so he hustled money doing poetry in subways, and bought a bus ticket to get there.|$|E

500|$|The {{musical score}} of Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song was {{performed}} by Earth, Wind & Fire. Van Peebles did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> for traditional advertising methods, so he released the soundtrack album prior to the film's release in order to generate publicity. Initially, the film was screened only in two theaters in the United States. It went on to gross $4.1 million at the box office. Huey P. Newton celebrated and welcomed the film's revolutionary implications, and Sweetback became required viewing {{for members of the}} Black Panther Party. According to Variety, it demonstrated to Hollywood that films which portrayed [...] "militant" [...] blacks could be highly profitable, leading {{to the creation of the}} blaxploitation genre, although critic Roger Ebert did not consider this example of Van Peebles' work to be an exploitation film.|$|E
2500|$|The limited budget {{dictated}} {{the production and}} Figgis ended up filming in super 16mm and composing his own score. He remarked, [...] "We didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money,</b> and we weren't pretending to be something we weren't. We couldn't shut down The Strip to shoot".|$|E

[...] "It's not in our plans to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> left over," [...] Mike Malaise said.

2500|$|Tunnell left Iowa in January 1948 {{in order}} to make some money to enable him to return and play {{football}} in the fall. [...] He was told by school officials that, {{in order to}} be eligible to play football again in the fall, he would need to return for summer school and make up for a class he failed in the fall. Tunnell later explained: [...] "I got a telegram on Sunday saying I had to be back in school on Monday and didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> or nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{choosing}} {{a career in}} chess, Duchamp said, [...] "If Bobby Fischer came to me for advice, I certainly would not discourage him—as if anyone could—but I would {{try to make it}} positively clear that he will never <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> from chess, live a monk-like existence and know more rejection than any artist ever has, struggling to be known and accepted." [...] Duchamp left a legacy to chess {{in the form of an}} enigmatic endgame problem he composed in 1943. The problem was included in the announcement for Julian Levi's gallery exhibition Through the Big End of the Opera Glass, printed on translucent paper with the faint inscription: [...] "White to play and win". Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem, with most concluding that there is no solution.|$|E
2500|$|Opeth {{were signed}} by Candlelight without a demo. For them, {{to go into}} the studio to record a demo was as big a step as going in to record an album. Åkerfeldt explained, [...] "We didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> to spend on things like that. That would cost us, at least, a couple of hundred bucks... We didn't know where to go to record a demo." [...] Åkerfeldt had sent out {{rehearsal}} tapes to several labels, but never received a reply. But the band received an offer from Lee Barrett to record an album. Åkerfeldt found it [...] "quite weird". Anders Nyström (of Katatonia) said Candlelight was interested, based on a rumor from Samoth (of Emperor). Samoth had sent out a tape of unsigned bands to Barrett at Candlelight. It only had a few seconds of [...] "The Apostle in Triumph". Barrett liked it so much he wanted to sign the band. Later, Åkerfeldt received a call from Barrett, who wanted to release a full-length album by Opeth.|$|E

2500|$|Frank P. Ramsey {{visited him}} on 17 September 1923 {{to discuss the}} Tractatus; he had agreed to write a review of it for Mind. He {{reported}} in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free. After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends {{to persuade him to}} return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family. Ramsey wrote to John Maynard Keynes: [...] " [...] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> he hasn't earned ... It is an awful pity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ullman credits {{her sense}} of humour to a feeling of both classlessness {{as well as her}} mother's working class roots. [...] "It comes from being classless, I think. My father was Polish and he died when I was six. And from being a little girl who went to gymkhana and had ponies, and went to a private school, and lived in a big house we {{suddenly}} didn’t <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> any more and had to go to a state school. And my mother’s family is all from South London, {{and we have a lot}} of uncles and friends over there. And when my father died they were very supportive, and they used to come down for the weekend - all these hordes of South London oiks. They used to invade our big Posh Bucks home and use the swimming pool, ride the ponies, and they were so funny these blokes; they really affected my sense of humour ... But I think the man who really affected my sense of humour was my uncle Butch, he was called Butch Castle. He was a decorator from South London - lazy old sod. [...] An he’s got the sharpest mind I’ve ever known; he’s so hysterically funny. And I wanted to be like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Selma {{is caught}} and {{eventually}} put on trial. It {{is here that}} she is pegged as a Communist sympathizer and murderess. Although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal Bill's secret, saying that she had promised not to. Additionally, when her claim that the reason she didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> was {{because she had been}} sending it to her father in Czechoslovakia is proven false, she is convicted and given the death penalty. Cvalda and Jeff eventually put the pieces of the puzzle together and get back Selma's money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her. Selma becomes furious and refuses the lawyer, opting to face the death penalty rather than let her son go blind, but she is deeply distraught as she awaits her death. Although a sympathetic female prison guard named Brenda tries to comfort her, the other state officials show no feelings and are eager to see her executed. Brenda encourages Selma to walk. On her way to the gallows, Selma goes to hug the other men on death row while singing to them. However, on the gallows, she becomes terrified, so that she must be strapped to a collapse board. Her hysteria when the hood is placed over her face delays the execution. Selma begins crying hysterically and Brenda cries with her, but Cvalda rushes to inform her that the operation was successful and that Gene will see. Relieved, Selma sings the final song on the gallows with no musical accompaniment, although she is hanged before she finishes. A curtain is then drawn in front of her body, while the missing part of the song shows on the screen: [...] "They say it's the last song/They don't know us, you see/It's only the last song/If we let it be." ...|$|E
