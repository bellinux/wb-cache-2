5|$|On 28 June 2012 eurozone leaders {{agreed to}} permit loans by the European Stability Mechanism {{to be made}} {{directly}} to stressed banks rather than through eurozone states, to avoid adding to sovereign debt. The reform was linked to plans <b>for</b> <b>banking</b> regulation by the European Central Bank.

5|$|On {{taking office}} as Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown gave the Bank of England {{operational}} independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. At {{the same time}} he also changed the inflation measure from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index and transferred responsibility <b>for</b> <b>banking</b> supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the 2007 global banking crisis.|$|E
5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save <b>for</b> <b>banking</b> his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of earlier Greek and Hellenistic thought on the Muslim world began largely with Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun, who sponsored {{the translation of}} Greek texts into Arabic in the 9th century by Syrian Christians in Baghdad. But already by that time numerous Muslim scholars had written on economic issues, and early Muslim leaders had shown sophisticated attempts to enforce fiscal and monetary financing, use deficit financing, use taxes to encourage production, the use of credit instruments <b>for</b> <b>banking,</b> including rudimentary savings and checking accounts, and contract law.|$|E
25|$|British {{usage of}} Garratts was minimal. A single large Garratt (2-8-0+0-8-2, London and North Eastern Railway Class U1 number 2395/9999/69999) {{was built in}} 1925 <b>for</b> <b>banking</b> heavy coal trains on the Woodhead route. Thirty-three 2-6-0+0-6-2 {{locomotives}} were built for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and several 0-4-0+0-4-0s for industrial use, {{one of which is}} preserved at Bressingham Steam and Gardens. The Garratt design was not generally used on British railways as most goods trains were short and light, on railways with broad curves and moderate grades compared with elsewhere in the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} practices of redlining, mortgage discrimination, and racially restrictive covenants {{contributed to the}} overcrowding and physical deterioration of areas where minorities chose to congregate. Such conditions are considered to {{have contributed to the}} emigration of other populations. The limited facilities <b>for</b> <b>banking</b> and insurance, due to a perceived lack of profitability, and other social services, and extra fees meant to hedge against perceived profit issues increased their cost to residents in predominantly non-white suburbs and city neighborhoods. According to the environmental geographer Laura Pulido, the historical processes of suburbanization and urban decentralization contribute to contemporary environmental racism.|$|E

40|$|Our {{analytical}} {{description of how}} banks’ responses to asset price changes can result in procyclical leverage reveals that <b>for</b> <b>banks</b> with a binding regulatory leverage constraint, absent differences in regulatory risk weights across assets, leverage is not procyclical. <b>For</b> <b>banks</b> without a binding constraint, fair value and bank regulation both can contribute to procyclical leverage. Empirical findings based on a large sample of US commercial banks reveal that bank regulation explains procyclical leverage <b>for</b> <b>banks</b> relatively close to the regulatory leverage constraint and contributes to procyclical leverage for those that are not. Fair value accounting does not contribute to procyclical leverage...|$|R

25|$|The 'Castle' Class were a {{powerful}} 4-6-0 passenger locomotive with large tenders that ran on two bogies. From 1900 {{a total of}} twelve were built, the last two in 1910/11, and they worked between Perth and Inverness. One was fitted in 1912 with a Phoenix superheater, but this was later removed. Between 1903 and 1906 seven tank engines were built at Lochgram, three 0-6-0s for shunting and four 0-4-4s for branch services. Six 'Big Bens' followed, similar to the 'Small Bens' but with slighter larger boilers. In 1909 and 1911 twelve 0-6-4 tank engines were built, designed <b>for</b> <b>banking.</b>|$|E

25|$|With {{the end of}} the Bretton Woods system (1971–73) and the {{transition}} to floating exchange rates, financial stability issues came to the fore. The collapse of internationally active banks, such as Bankhaus Herstatt (1974), highlighted the need for improved banking supervision at an international level. The G10 Governors created the Basel Committee <b>for</b> <b>Banking</b> Supervision (BCBS), which remains active to this day. The BIS developed into a global meeting place for regulators and for developing international standards (Basel Concordat, Basel Capital Accord, Basel II and III). Through its member central banks, the BIS was actively involved in the resolution of the Latin American debt crisis (1982).|$|E
