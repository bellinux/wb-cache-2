40|$|Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of <b>product</b> <b>mean</b> scores is {{generally}} {{used to obtain}} a product map from sensory profiling data. However, this approach {{does not take into}} account the variance of the <b>product</b> <b>mean</b> scores due to the individual panelist variability. Therefore, Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) of the product effect in the two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) should be considered as a natural alternative analysis to PCA. Indeed, it is the extension of the classical univariate approach used for the analysis of each descriptor separately. This analysis generates successive components maximizing product discrimination as measured by the usual Fisher statistics in analysis of variance. The outcome of CVA is a product map maximizing product separation, while gathering individual evaluations of the same product as close as possible. This article is an introduction to the rationale of CVA applied to sensory profiling data. In addition, it offers an R package (CVApack) and instructions for running it...|$|R

Essentially, producing value-added wood <b>products</b> <b>means</b> taking raw materials and turning it into something useful. For example: engineered wood, millwork, cabinets, furniture, tongue depressors or popsicle sticks, just to name a few. Additional processing of a commodity wood product by manufacturers creates a specialty product whose value is more than the original product. These value-added products become part of the secondary sector of our economy.|$|R

A negative value of strategic value for a <b>product</b> <b>means</b> that including this product to the export basket of a country will diminish the value of new sophisticated production possibilities. A curious feature of this indicator is that it takes negative values for the most sophisticated products, because new sophisticated possibilities won’t now take into account these products. In order to avoid lengthening, I only present the values of strategic values for the “best” products.|$|R
