500|$|Lochte said he {{was pleased}} with his {{performance}} at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships but feels that he can improve his times before the 2012 Olympics. [...] "Getting five gold medals is definitely great, but the times that I went, I know I could go a lot faster," [...] he said. [...] "There {{are a lot of}} places in my races that I messed up on that I could have changed and gone faster, but I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a whole year to make sure I have those perfect swims." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The song is sort {{of about}} transformation, so I took that in a nature kind of way, the way nature deals with transformation. It's {{basically}} about coming from a very poisoned place to an empowerment, a place of strength. I've always had this fear of moths, and I subconsciously wrote this thing with these moths in it, so I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to deal with it. They're furry and they carry dust. I found out in old mythology {{they are supposed to}} represent the soul. I think that's very appropriate".|$|E
500|$|Miles sarcastically nicknames his acquaintances, {{prompting}} critics, {{fans and}} characters to compare {{him to the}} character Sawyer {{and give him a}} nickname of his own: [...] "mini-Sawyer". [...] Ken Leung claims that he is often approached by people who like the character and he assumes that it is because of Miles's [...] "sardonic wit" [...] and [...] " [...] sort of attitude." [...] Leung surmised that [...] "Usually when people are like that, just … kind of throwing off quick [...] quirky remarks … they're hiding something, so he's definitely hiding something." [...] Asked if Miles is much like him, Leung responded with [...] "I don't think I'm that similar. [...] Um, I don't know—I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> moments." [...] Leung said that [...] "Miles doesn't know how to be social, which is great, because I don't know how to be social." [...] He has also stated that Miles [...] "trust the dead more than the living" [...] and is intrigued as to whom Miles grieves for. [...] Leung stated that [...] "He seems haunted by something, that—that's for sure … one of the first thoughts I had [...] communication with the dead … can't be a great thing … it's not a happy skill to have." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I've already eaten my fill, I can't go another one. I've enjoyed {{them ever}} so much. Now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better be off for Cedarville." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, for two years, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{a passionate}} love affair when I was thirteen," [...] she replied, with the nonchalance and sophistication of experience.|$|R
2500|$|African-American singer Jackie Wilson {{recorded}} a tribute album to Jolson, You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet, which included his personal liner note, [...] "...the greatest entertainer {{of this or}} any other era... I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just about every recording he's ever made, and I rarely missed listening to him on the radio.... During the three years I've been making records, I've had the ambition to do an album of songs, which, to me, represent the great Jolson heritage.. his is simply my humble tribute to the one man I admire most in this business... to keep the heritage of Jolson alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early December, Moore made a {{preliminary}} offer to Saban's agent Jimmy Sexton to coach at Alabama for $5 million per season {{for seven years}} with a $7 million signing bonus. At that time Saban also stated he had not personally interviewed at Alabama and told his players {{that he was not}} leaving. After West Virginia head coach Rich Rodriguez turned down an offer to coach the Crimson Tide, speculation again focused on Saban. As the rumors persisted that he was prepared to take the Alabama job, on December 21 Saban stated [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say it, I'm {{not going to be the}} Alabama coach" [...] in an effort to stop the Alabama rumors. After the Dolphins season ended, it was speculated again that Alabama was to offer their head coaching position to Saban. On January 3, 2007, Saban officially resigned from the Dolphins and became the head coach of the Crimson Tide. At that time he signed an eight-year contract worth a guaranteed $32 million to coach Alabama.|$|E

6000|$|... “To {{tell the}} truth, I haven’t {{the heart to}} go anywhere,” {{answered}} Dave, soberly. “I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better stay here and see if something doesn’t turn up.” ...|$|R
60|$|As {{you are all}} {{standing}} [he drawled in his characteristic voice], <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better stand too.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{the wind}} {{knocked out of}} me, that's all." [...] He tried to get up, but his legs refused to support him. [...] "I'll have to keep quiet awhile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Devine, drily, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a notion. I've been {{finding out}} {{a good deal}} about him. But get on with your objections." ...|$|E
6000|$|Do you <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> some {{intricate}} purpose? [...] Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the [...] {{side of a}} rock has.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{about as}} much {{business}} as {{you have to make}} it." [...] Then he added, [...] "You are just the very man she wants to keep out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sounds like you're {{getting the}} same jitters as the Ivans." [...] Hendricks {{examined}} his wrist watch. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better get started, if I {{want to be there}} before dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better {{wait until}} {{something}} more turns up," [...] he thought. [...] "If I mention this Smith, {{and he is}} innocent, both he and Reff will be terribly angry at me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would ye {{shoot at}} the moon with a hand-gun?" [...] said Dick. [...] "'Tis a valiant knight, and hath a hand of iron. An he <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made or meddled with your flight, it would go sore with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad they've gone--I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{to thank}} you for what you did," [...] she said. [...] "It was right smart, and I'm not sure my mother caught on to the thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I have a <b>guess,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a guess,” replied Glenalmond. “We {{will talk}} of it presently—when Carstairs {{has come and}} gone, and {{you have had a}} piece of my good Cheddar cheese and a pull at the porter tankard: not before.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only I'm {{not sure}} I can put through my schemes. I really can't draw much. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> pretty fair taste in fabrics, but since I've known you I don't {{like to think}} about fussing with dress-designing. But as a miller, I'd have the means--books, piano, travel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are," [...] she persisted. [...] "There isn't a man {{breathing}} {{who has a}} more wonderful {{capacity for}} caring than you. You hide your feelings from most people. Are you very angry with me for <b>having</b> <b>guessed?</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We didn't make {{a single}} mistake,' he assured his partner, 'and we {{actually}} had the odd in our hands, but not one of our finesses came off, and all his did.' He turned to Alec. 'How the dickens did you <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> those two queens?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{had very}} few acquaintances in the city," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "He {{used to have}} some close friends, but they are either dead or have moved away.

6000|$|... "I could but <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> tauld ye your mother's purpose, and I ken Teresa was a fiend. She {{was never}} mair seen in Scotland, and I {{have heard that}} she {{returned}} to her ain land. A dark curtain has fa'en ower the past, and the few that witnessed ony part of it could only surmise something of seduction and suicide. You yourself"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a busy two days of it, boys, as you may <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no {{particularly}} good news to tell you, but, on the other hand, I have no bad news. I was in time to warn all our friends, and when the soldiers came {{for them in the}} morning, it was only to find that their nests were empty.|$|E
6000|$|So I was a {{mark for}} plunder at once, And lost my cash (can you wonder?) at once, But I didn't {{give up and}} knock under at once, I worked in the Yards, for a spell.

A tall, angular woman, wearing large spectacles, soon answered his summons.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he {{certainly}} did act queer," [...] agreed Hiram Duff. [...] "But that ain't here nor there. I want my box back, with all that's in it, and I'm going to <b>have</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better go to town and tell the police about this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} possible," [...] Dias {{admitted}} reluctantly, [...] "and {{if they knew}} that the five mules were all loaded with gold they might be tempted to follow; but that they could only <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no doubt, too, that many of them had been walking for hours across the mountains before the attack, and as you fired into the thick of them, a fair share must have been too much wounded to start on a forty-miles' tramp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he said as}} if with {{suddenly}} conceived determination, [...] "again I see {{no cause}} why I should deny it. Yes, sir, {{you have made a}} shrewd <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> need of your services, of your chivalry and of your valour and ... well, yes," [...] he added after an instant's hesitation, [...] "of your daring and your paucity of scruples too.

"I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a {{confession}} to make," [...] he said, [...] "Couldn't help hearing what your sister said, though I kept banging the harness {{to let you}} know I was there, so I figured as to their probable trail and lit out after them. Came up with the pair toward nightfall by the big sloo, and invited Mr. Fletcher to an interview. Fletcher didn't seem to see it. He said he wouldn't get down, but mentioned several things--they're not worth repeating--about his wife and you, with a word of your sister that settled me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gracious! this {{certainly}} is growing serious," [...] he murmured to himself, when Asa Lemm made the declaration {{that he would}} go down to Haven Point and have Jack and Walt arrested.

6000|$|... "They {{must have}} met with an accident," [...] said the pioneer at length. [...] "Perhaps one of them fell in a hole and broke a leg.

6000|$|... "We're company {{enough for}} ourselves," [...] said Mrs. Durgin. [...] "I ain't ever been lonesome here, {{from the first}} minute. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> company enough when I was a girl to last me the sort that hotel folks are.
