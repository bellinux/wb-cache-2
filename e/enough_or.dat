5|$|Despite the British training, the SLA was {{not large}} <b>enough</b> <b>or</b> {{strong enough to}} enter into combat with the RUF while also holding the ground it had recaptured, so the British persuaded UNAMSIL to move forward behind the {{advancing}} SLA to defend its recaptured ground. Additional British liaison officers were attached to UNAMSIL, and the British facilitated a daily coordination meeting for SLA and UNAMSIL commanders, while also assisting the UN forces in drawing up a campaign plan.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{defeated}} Funaki {{once again}} in his SmackDown! debut on August 25, 2005. Kennedy also created an ongoing mini-feud with SmackDown! ring announcer Tony Chimel, based on Kennedy believing that Chimel's announcing was not done well <b>enough</b> <b>or</b> with sufficient respect, and therefore performing his own introductions or forcing Chimel to introduce him again. Kennedy's self-ring introductions before the match became one of his trademarks. While working on both Velocity and SmackDown!, he was also still working in OVW. Kennedy made his pay-per-view debut at SmackDown!'s No Mercy, defeating Hardcore Holly and injuring Holly's ribs during the match.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a hostile}} ship is in range, the player {{will have the}} choice to either open fire or outmanoeuvre the enemy. The Bismarck is able to {{withstand}} 99 points of damage; internal fires may break out during battle and will risk destroying the ship if the fires are not contained quickly <b>enough</b> <b>or</b> if they reach fuel tanks. If fires occur, the player is given the option to order fire-fighting crews to contain the blaze, although it will cause the ship to disengage from combat. The game proceeds in real time, and has the option to change speed from slow to fast at any time.|$|E

5|$|Progress is {{punctuated by}} cutscenes and codec, {{as well as}} {{encounters}} with bosses. To progress, players must discover the weaknesses of each boss and defeat them. Play controls and strategies can also be accessed via the Codec radio, where advice is delivered from Snake's support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving his progress often <b>enough,</b> <b>or</b> explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to press on the gamepad. The Codec {{is also used to}} provide exposition on the game's backstory.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far <b>enough</b> <b>or</b> the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E
5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart <b>enough</b> <b>or</b> lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E

5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated <b>enough,</b> <b>or</b> slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their eye, or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E
5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Pickwickian syndrome) {{is a condition}} in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly <b>enough</b> <b>or</b> deeply enough, resulting in low blood oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for short periods of time during sleep (obstructive sleep apnea), resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which eventually may lead to the symptoms such as heart failure, leg swelling and various other related symptoms. The most effective treatment is weight loss, but it is often possible to relieve the symptoms by nocturnal ventilation with positive airway pressure (CPAP) or related methods.|$|E
5|$|Obstacles for the {{proposal}} include the proposed Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, {{the lack of}} electrification on the line, and the single-tracking {{in some parts of}} the line. The current iteration of the plan would have its northern terminus be Co-Op City South using the Hells Gate Branch. The LIRR Bay Ridge Branch and the New York Connecting Railroad have freight operating along them, and are regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). FRA rules require a certain distance between freight and passenger trains that share rights-of-way, and as a result it is uncertain whether the right-of-way is wide <b>enough</b> <b>or</b> if more durable train cars are needed to be able to share the same tracks. The RPA's 2015 plan considered having FRA compliant light rail vehicles run over the line. In addition to providing transfer opportunities, the line would provide transit access to areas without it in Glendale and Middle Village in Queens, and in Flatlands and Canarsie in Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|The Sun's {{convection}} zone {{extends from}} 0.7 solar radii (200,000km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense <b>enough</b> <b>or</b> {{hot enough to}} transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, {{the density of the}} plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks {{to the base of the}} convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).|$|E
5|$|The {{lifestyle}} of Archaeopteryx {{is difficult to}} reconstruct {{and there are several}} theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal. The absence of trees does not preclude Archaeopteryx from an arboreal lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of Archaeopteryx point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small <b>enough,</b> <b>or</b> with its claws if it was larger.|$|E
5|$|With Japan's {{entry into}} the war {{following}} the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, it became {{more likely that the}} division would be called upon to undertake active service overseas, and the division was mobilised for war. In early January 1942, Major General Stanley Savige, an experienced officer who had commanded the 17th Brigade in combat against the Germans in the Middle East earlier in the war, took over command of the division. Savige set about the task of preparing the division for combat and he began by removing officers that he did not think were physically fit <b>enough</b> <b>or</b> competent to lead in battle and replacing them with men who had gained experience in AIF units. A comprehensive training program was established and in April 1942 the division was assigned to the Australian I Corps, and in order to enable divisional exercises to begin, the 3rd Division moved to Bonegilla, Victoria. In order to toughen the men up, Savige decided that they would march on foot to the new camp.|$|E
