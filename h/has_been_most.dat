5|$|The reverence due to {{writings}} {{that have}} long subsisted arises therefore not from any credulous confidence in the superior wisdom of past ages, or gloomy persuasion of the degeneracy of mankind, but is the consequence of acknowledged and indubitable positions, that what has been longest known <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> considered, and what is most considered is best understood.|$|E
5|$|Vitamin E is the {{collective}} {{name for a}} set of eight related tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are fat-soluble vitamins with antioxidant properties.

With the remaining two gangs by their side, the Sole Survivor will have to eliminate the rogue gang. Their actions ultimately decide who controls Nuka-World. In an alternate scenario, they are also given the option of ending raider influence by assassinating the leaders of each gang and their lieutenants, thereby returning control of Nuka-World to the traders who originally {{used it as a}} hub of commerce.|$|E

5|$|Mephisto {{is the son}} of Luchador Astro Rey/Kahoz and has {{previously}} worked both as Astro Rey Jr. and Kahoz Jr. but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> successful as Mephisto. Since adopting the Mephisto gimmick he has been associated with the group Los Infernales ("The Infernal Ones") and later on Los Hijos del Averno ("The Sons of Hell"), especially working closely with Averno as his regular tag team partner for years. Mephisto and Averno are considered one of the top teams in Mexico between 2000 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Canada Highway, {{passing through}} Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for {{wildlife}} due to vehicle traffic {{and as an}} impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed {{at a number of}} points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.|$|E

It has primarily {{served in}} this capacity since that time, {{though it has}} also maintained a secondary strike capability and was also tasked with reconnaissance duties between 1979 and 1993. No.6 Squadron is currently based at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> recently equipped with Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft between January 2011 and December 2016. The squadron was re-equipped with Boeing EA-18G Growlers in 2017.|$|E
5|$|All Upanishads are {{associated}} {{with one of the}} four Vedas—Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda (there are two primary versions or Samhitas of the Yajurveda: Shukla Yajurveda, Krishna Yajurveda), and Atharvaveda. During the modern era, the ancient Upanishads that were embedded texts in the Vedas, were detached from the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of Vedic text, compiled into separate texts and these were then gathered into anthologies of Upanishads. These lists associated each Upanishad with one of the four Vedas, many such lists exist, and these lists are inconsistent across India in terms of which Upanishads are included and how the newer Upanishads are assigned to the ancient Vedas. In south India, the collected list based on Muktika Upanishad, and published in Telugu language, became the most common by the 19th-century and this is a list of 108 Upanishads. In north India, a list of 52 Upanishads <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> common.|$|E
5|$|Muralitharan is {{well ahead}} of other bowlers by number of five-wicket hauls in Tests with 67 to his name; Australian cricketer Shane Warne ranks in second place with 37. Making his Test debut in 1992, Muralitharan took his first five-wicket haul a year later against South Africa. Since then, he has {{performed}} this feat against every other Test playing nation. He {{has gone on to}} take ten or more wickets per match on 22 occasionsalso a world recordwhile Shane Warne ranks second, having achieved this on 10 occasions. His career best is 9 wickets for 51 runs against Zimbabwe, which ranks as the world's fifth-best figures in an innings. He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> successful against Bangladesh and South Africa, with 11 five-wicket hauls against each team. Fourteen of Muralitharan's five-wicket hauls were taken at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground (SSC) in Colombo, Sri Lanka. He retired from Test cricket in July 2010, capturing his 67th and final five-wicket haul during his last match.|$|E

5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E
5|$|The pied currawong {{is common}} in both wet and dry sclerophyll forests, rural and semi-urban environments {{throughout}} eastern Australia, from Cape York Peninsula to western Victoria and Lord Howe Island, where it occurs as an endemic subspecies. In general, the pied currawong is sedentary, although some populations from higher altitudes move to areas of lower elevation in winter. However, evidence for the extent of migration is conflicting, and the species' movements have been little studied to date. It has adapted well to European presence, and has become more common {{in many areas of}} eastern Australia, with surveys in Nanango, Queensland, Barham, New South Wales, Geelong, Victoria, as well as the Northern Tablelands and South West Slopes regions in New South Wales, all showing an increase in population. This increase <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>most</b> marked, however, in Sydney and Canberra since the 1940s and 1960s respectively. In both cities, the species had previously been a winter resident only, but now remains year-round and breeds there. They are a dominant species and common inhabitant of Sydney gardens. More recently still, a survey of the population of pied currawongs in southeastern Queensland between 1980 and 2000 had found the species had become more numerous there, including suburban Brisbane. One 1992 survey reported the total number of pied currawongs in Australia had doubled from 3 million birds in the 1960s to 6 million in the early 1990s.|$|E
