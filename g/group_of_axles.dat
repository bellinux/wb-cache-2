40|$|Locomotive PWM Rectifiers {{employed}} in A. C traction systems represent several megawatts of electrical load. Typically they use multiple rectifiers/converters in parallel {{in order to}} secure high power ratings and high frequency operation. And the rectifiers are supplied from the single-phase A. C. traction transformer with multiple secondaries of high leakage inductance. The switching instants of the PWM rectifiers are phase shifted and interlaced in order to achieve high ripple current cancellation, assuming that the converter loads are balanced. This would ensure the rectifiers to provide better harmonic performance and also redundancy of operation with multiple units in operation. However, in practice, rectifiers may be closely coupled to the traction inverter to an axle or a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> and the real power developed will depend upon the traction conditions. Creep and slip can give rise to variations in power and perfect power balance at the rectifiers is an improbable proposition. There is high degree of interest in the recent times to examine the possibility of equipment failures in locomotive systems that degrade gracefully. Failure of one traction inverter would lead to load unbalance for the rectifier modules. Or sometimes, partial failures may result in unbalanced operation which can cause reduced ripple current cancellation and generate switching frequency harmonic current components. This may adversely impact the signalling systems and/or result in over voltage effects due to resonance in the overhead supply system. This paper examines a 4 MW locomotive with three rectifier modules and a device switching frequency of 900 Hz. This results in a 5400 Hz ripple frequency in the mains current. And this paper will consider what may be the most frequently occurring case; that of loss of load in one traction motor due to wheel slip. Current ripple cancellation is partially lost in this case and lower frequency current components can be produced. Traditionally, number of solutions have been {{employed in}} the industry like passive Filters, Active Filters etc., for this type of a problem.

40|$|The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration {{requested}} {{information regarding}} overweight and oversized vehicle traffic entering inspection stations (ISs) {{in order to}} develop strategies for future research efforts and possibly help guide regulatory issues involving overweight commercial motor vehicles (CMVs). For a period of one month, inspection stations in Knox County and Greene County, Tennessee, recorded overweight and oversized vehicles that entered these ISs. During this period, 435 CMVs were recorded using an electronic form filled out by enforcement personnel at the IS. Of the 435 CMVs recorded, 381 had weight information documented with them. The majority (52. 2 %) of the vehicles recorded were five-axle combination vehicles, and 50. 6 % of all the vehicles were permitted to operate above the legal weight limit in Tennessee, which is 80, 000 lb for vehicles with five or more axles. Only 16. 8 % of the CMVs recorded were overweight gross (11. 5 % of permitted vehicles) and 54. 1 % were overweight on an axle group. The low percentage of overweight gross CMVs was because only 45 of the vehicles over 80, 000 lb. were not permitted. On average, axles that were overweight were 2, 000 lb. over the legal limit for an axle or <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles.</b> Of the vehicles recorded, 172 vehicles were given a North American Standard (NAS) inspection during the assessment. Of those, 69 % of the inspections were driver-only inspections (Level III) and only 25 % of the inspections had a vehicle component (such as a Level I or Level II). The remaining 6 % of inspections did not have valid Aspen numbers; the type of was inspection unknown. Data collected on the types of trailers of each vehicle showed that about half of the recorded CMVs could realistically be given a Level I (full vehicle and driver) inspection; this estimate was solely based on trailer type. Enforcement personnel at ISs without an inspection pit have difficulty fully inspecting certain vehicles due to low clearance below the trailer. Because of this, overweight and oversized vehicles were normally only given a Level III (driver) inspection; thus, {{little is known about the}} safety of these vehicles. The out-of-service (OOS) rate of all the inspected vehicles (driver and vehicle inspections) was 18. 6 %, while the OOS rate for vehicle inspections (Level I and II) was 52. 4 %. Future work will focus on performing Level I inspections on five-axle combination tractor-trailers and the types of violations that overweight vehicles may have. This research will be conducted in Tennessee and possibly in other states as well...|$|E

40|$|Different {{aspects of}} dynamic {{identification}} of moving loads {{from a vehicle}} traveling {{on top of a}} beam-slab type bridge deck are studied in this paper. The bridge deck is modeled as an orthotropic plate and the loads are modeled as a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> wheel loads or a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>axle</b> loads moving on top of the bridge deck at a fixed spacing. The dynamic response of the bridge deck is obtained from the Hamilton principle with modal superposition. The equation of motion is formulated in state space and the resulting damped least-square identification problem is solved using the dynamic programming method with regularization on the solution. The combination of dynamic strain and velocity measurements, the number of analytical modes included in the identification, the effect of load eccentricity and the choice of regularization parameter are studied and discussed. The use of separate regularization parameter for each of these loads has been implemented and discussed. These considerations are further studied with experimental results from the laboratory. Recommendations on the selection of sensor number and sensor locations for moving loads identification are given. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{toll rate}} charged for {{the usage of}} {{facilities}} such as a tunnel or a bridge is usually proportional to the number <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> possessed by a vehicle. However, it is sometimes difficult {{to determine the number}} <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> a vehicle by the toll-booth operator and therefore, an automatic system that can identify the number <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> is sought. Instead <b>of</b> detecting the <b>axle,</b> wheels <b>of</b> a vehicle are tested and a method based on the Hough transform for detecting circles is proposed. As the system must be able to detect the correct number of wheels in real-time, sub-sampling based on the Haar Wavelet transform is applied. Experimental results show that the system is able to identify the wheel correctly and to process the input images in real-time...|$|R
