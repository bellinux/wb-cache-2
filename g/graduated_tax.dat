500|$|Floyd B. Olson of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party {{was elected}} as the {{governor}} in the 1930 election. [...] In his first term, he signed a bonding bill that authorized $15 million ($ as of [...] ) for highway construction, {{in an effort to}} provide work for the unemployed. [...] He also signed an executive order that provided for a minimum wage of 45 cents per hour for up to 48 hours weekly. [...] This effort predated the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that established a nationwide minimum wage. [...] By 1932, with the Depression worsening, the Farmer-Labor Party platform was proposing a state income tax, a <b>graduated</b> <b>tax</b> on nationwide chain stores (such as J.C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck and Company), low-interest farm loans, and a state unemployment insurance program. [...] The progressive 1933 legislative session saw a comprehensive response to the depression including a moratorium on mortgage foreclosures, a reduction in property taxes for farmers and homeowners, the state income tax, and chain store taxes, tavern reform, ratification of a child labor amendment, a state old-age pension system, and steps toward preserving the area that later became the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.|$|E
2500|$|To raise {{revenue to}} fund the American Civil War, the income tax was {{introduced}} in the United States with the Revenue Act of 1861, as a flat tax of 3% on annual income above $800. The following year, it was replaced with a <b>graduated</b> <b>tax</b> of 3 to 5% on income above $600 by the Revenue Act of 1862, which specified a termination of income taxation in 1866. The Socialist Labor Party advocated a graduated income tax in 1887. The Populist Party [...] "demanded a graduated income tax" [...] in its 1892 platform. William Jennings Bryan, a Democrat who supported cooperation with the Populists, was among those Congressional Democrats who advocated the income tax law passed in 1894. As a three-time Democratic candidate for president, Bryan advocated an income tax and wrote that advocacy into the Democrats' platform in 1908.|$|E

40|$|<b>Graduate</b> <b>tax</b> is {{a concept}} that was only {{recently}} introduced into the public discourse in South Africa. Little is known about how it will be implemented and who will be liable to pay such a tax. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the proposed introduction of <b>graduate</b> <b>tax</b> for South African tertiary education graduates and the public perception of such a tax. To achieve the objectives of the study, relevant literature was reviewed that explained the concept of a <b>graduate</b> <b>tax</b> and the possible advantages and disadvantages of its imposition. Data collected by means of a questionnaire was analysed, which revealed the public perception of a <b>graduate</b> <b>tax</b> as well as its possible consequences. The analysis of the data collected indicated that <b>graduate</b> <b>tax</b> is perceived as an additional tax to be paid by graduates from tertiary institutions, whereas the literature defined it as a tax paid by tertiary institution graduates who received their tertiary education at no cost. Furthermore, it was found that the imposition of a <b>graduate</b> <b>tax</b> may deter some from pursuing a tertiary degree in order to avoid liability for such tax. The imposition of a <b>graduate</b> <b>tax</b> could also lead to an outflow of skills, as graduates would be likely to seek employment outside South Africa in order to avoid paying <b>graduate</b> <b>tax.</b> It is recommended in this study that more clarity should be given to the public as to what this proposed <b>graduate</b> <b>tax</b> would entail and who would be affected by it.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of a <b>graduate</b> <b>tax</b> when the return to {{education}} is uncertain and wages are determined through equilibrium in a labor market with signalling. The consequence of uncertainty is that both ability and initial wealth matter for educational choice. Compared to a constrained first-best the market outcome with uncertainty and signalling results in an inefficiently high number of people entering higher education. Due to the positive wealth effect over-entry is proportionately greater for high-wealth individuals. The <b>graduate</b> <b>tax</b> reduces entry into education so enhances efficiency. However, it has undesirable distributional consequences: low-wealth individuals are deterred from entering education but high-wealth are encouraged. In this respect, the <b>graduate</b> <b>tax</b> has clear failings as a method of financing higher education...|$|R
