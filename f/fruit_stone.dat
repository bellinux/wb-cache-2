The spectra obtained through MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed that the dominant A-type procyanidin polymers occurred in each polymer length with one or more A-type linkages. The polymeric proanthocyanidins of litchi <b>fruit</b> <b>stones</b> exhibited longer polymer length than those of fruit pericarps, with polymerization degrees up to 20 and 11 for <b>fruit</b> <b>stones</b> and pericarps, respectively. After depolymerization with toluene-a-thiol, HPLC-ESI-MS analysis showed that epicatechin and A-type dimer were the major constituent units, and the mean polymerization degrees were 15. 4 and 5. 8 for polymeric proanthocyanidins of <b>fruit</b> <b>stones</b> and pericarps, respectively. The antioxidant properties investigated using DPPH, ABTS and FRAP methods showed that the higher polymerization degree of polymeric proanthocyanidins from litchi <b>fruit</b> <b>stones</b> exhibited higher antioxidant activities than those from litchi pericarps.

Here we propose a new name Sarcocystis cafferi from the African buffalo. Histological examination of heart (92), skeletal muscle (36), and tongue (2) sections from 94 buffalos from the Greater Kruger National Park, South Africa, and {{a review of the}} literature revealed only 1 species of Sarcocystis in the African buffalo. Macrocysts were up to 12 mm long and 6 mm wide and were located in the neck muscles and overlying connective tissue. They were pale yellow; shaped like a lychee <b>fruit</b> <b>stone</b> or cashew nut; turgid or flaccid and oval to round (not fusiform). By light microscopy (LM) the sarcocyst wall was relatively thin. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the sarcocyst wall had a mesh-like structure with irregularly shaped villar protrusions (vp) that were of different sizes and folded over the sarcocyst wall. The entire surfaces of vp were covered with papillomatous structures. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the sarcocyst wall was up to 3. 6 lm thick and had highly branched villar protrusions that were up to 3 lm long. The villar projections contained filamentous tubular structures, most of which were parallel to the long axis of the projections, but some tubules criss-crossed, especially at the base. Granules were absent from these tubules. Longitudinally cut bradyzoites were 12. 132. 7 lm in size, had a long convoluted mitochondrion, and only 2 rhoptries. Phylogenetic analysis of 18 S rRNA and cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) gene sequences indicated that this Sarcocystis species is very closely related to, but distinct from, Sarcocystis fusiformis and Sarcocystis hirsuta. Thus, morphological findings by LM, SEM, and TEM together with molecular phylogenetic data (from 18 S rRNA and cox 1) confirm that the Sarcocystis species in the African buffalo is distinct from S. fusiformis and has therefore been named Sarcocystis cafferi.

50|$|Plant macrofossils are {{preserved}} through four main modes of preservation at archaeological sites. First, plant remains, usually cereal grains, chaff, seeds and charcoal are largely reduced to elemental carbon (charred) {{when they are}} heated in a reducing atmosphere. These {{are referred to as}} 'charred' or 'carbonised' plant remains. This mode of preservation is biased towards plant remains that come into contact with fire, through cooking or fuel use, and those which are less fragile, such as cereal grains and nutshell. Second, plant remains deposited in permanently waterlogged anoxic conditions {{are preserved}} as the absence of oxygen prohibits microbial activity. This mode of preservation occurs in deep archaeological features such as wells, in urban settlements where organic refuse is rapidly deposited, and at settlements adjacent to lakes or rivers. A wide range of plant remains are usually preserved, including seeds, <b>fruit</b> <b>stones,</b> nutshells, leaves, straw and other vegetative material. Third, calcium-phosphate mineralisation of plant remains occurs usually in latrine pits and in middens, as plant remains are completely replaced by calcium-phosphate. In latrine pits, plant remains which have been consumed by humans are the most common items, such as seeds of flavourings, fruit pips and <b>fruit</b> <b>stones.</b> Finally, plant remains are preserved by desiccation in arid environments, where the absence of water limits decomposition. Delicate vegetative plant remains are preserved, such as onion skin and artichoke bracts, alongside <b>fruit</b> <b>stones,</b> cereal chaff and seeds of wild plants.|$|R

40|$|During early Iron Age {{in western}} Sicily three {{different}} ethnic groups were settling in close vicinity: the indigenous Elymians as well as Greek and Phoenician/Punic colonies. Within the EU-project "Emergence of European Societies" and together with American universities (Stanford University, Northern Illinois University) Elymian sites on Monte Polizzo and in Salemi were excavated. The long term excavation project of the Greek town of Selinunte was undertaken by the Rome Department of German Archaeological Institute (DAI). All three excavations were sampled for archaeobotanical analyses, sediment samples were locally processed by flotation. At the Elymian sites three cereals were the main crops: hulled multi-rowed barley (Hordeum vulgare), emmer (Triticum dicoccum), and free-threshing wheat (T. aestivum / T. durum). Another important crop for alimentation was faba bean/field bean (Vicia faba). The oil containing crops linseed (Linum usitatissimum) and poppy (Papaver somniferum) are proofed by finds as well as following fruits and nuts: fig (Ficus carica), grapevine (Vitis vinifera), and almond (Amygdalus communis). To compare the Elymian crops {{with those of the}} contemporaneous Greek town of Selinunte: free-threshing wheat was the dominant cereal of the Greek, while hulled barley was common but less important and emmer was unimportant there. The pulses lentil (Lens culinaris) and bitter vetch (Vicia ervilia) are listed for Selinunte but faba bean is missing. While Selinunte provided plenty of finds of <b>fruit</b> <b>stone</b> fragments from olive (Olea europaea), this type of finds was missing on Iron Age Monte Polizzo. However, charcoal analyses detected the use of olive tree wood for timberwork there. Chemical analysis of an amphora from Monte Polizzo resulted in animal fat as a content of a vessel. These results might suggest a difference of the food systems: Greek olive oil versus Elymian animal fat as well as the use of different cereals and pulses. The Greek town of Selinunte might have imported free-threshing wheat from the indigenous Elymians who have based their own nutrition mainly on barley and emmer. As charcoal analyses of early Iron Age site of Monte Polizzo have shown, huge beams of evergreen oak (Quercus subgen. Sclerophyllodrys) and deciduous oak (Quercus subgen. Quercus and Q. subgen. Cerris) were used for roofing. Consequently, tall oak trees must have been available to the inhabitants as construction timber. As up to now the charcoal record has not provided any evidence on pioneer taxa (e. g. Pinus), a rather undisturbed climax vegetation at Iron Age Monte Polizzo can be assumed. The local deciduous oak species are restricted to higher elevations and surely must have derived from the mountain itself. The results of an unpublished pollen profile from Mazara del Vallo (W. Tinner, University of Bern) between Selinunte and Monte Polizzo are supporting both assumptions: widespread late Bronze/early Iron Age undisturbed climax vegetation in western Sicily and the import of crops by the Greek town of Selinunte...|$|E

Para se obter o óleo da polpa do abacate faz-se necessário o processo de secagem da mesma. O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar o processo de secagem do abacate cortado em fatias e de se utilizar modelos matemáticos para simular a transferência de massa durante este processo. As equações dos modelos matemáticos resultantes foram resolvidas numericamente e com o método dos mínimos quadrados foram identificados à Difusividade Efetiva e o Coeficiente Convectivo de Transferência de Massa ao longo do processo. As condições experimentais estudadas no processo de secagem levam em consideração a velocidade do ar fixada em 3 m/s e temperaturas usadas de 50, 60 e 70 ºC. O conhecimento dos coeficientes de transferência de massa é de suma importância para a secagem, sendo que o Coeficiente Convectivo de Transferência de Massa está associado às influências orgânicas e geométricas do produto e as propriedades termodinâmicas do ar. Analisando os resultados, observou-se que o aumento da temperatura favoreceu o processo de transferência de massa e com isso o aumento desses coeficientes. Observou-se também que o modelo de Fick não teve um bom ajuste aos dados experimentais, enquanto que o de Newton demonstrou ser capaz de predizer melhor a transferência de massa na superfície do produto. Os resultados obtidos foram importantes, pois permitiram o conhecimento da transferência de massa durante o processo de secagem convectiva da polpa do abacate.

The purpose of the present work has been to study the drying process used for sliced avocado based on mathematical models so as to simulate mass transfer during this procedure. The equations applied to the mathematical models were numerically solved, and, by using the method of the least squares, it was possible to obtain the Effective Diffusivity and the Mass Transfer Convective Coefficient. The experimental conditions studied during the drying operation required that the velocity set at 3 m/sec at temperatures of 50, 60 and 70 º C were taken into account. A thorough knowledge of the mass transfer coefficients was of paramount importance for the drying process, as the Coefficient of Convective Mass Transfer is associated to the product s organic and geometric influences as well as to the thermodynamic properties of the air. On analyzing the results, it was observed that a rise in temperature favored the process of mass transfer, increasing these coefficients. It was also noted that the Fick model did not fit the experimental data well; whereas the Newton model showed better results, being capable of predicting the mass transfer on the product surface. The results were most significant because they made known the mass transfer during the convective drying of the avocado pulp...|$|E

40|$|Introduction According to {{statistics}} presented by FAO in 2011, the world area under olive cultivation {{has been estimated}} about 9 million and six hundred thousand hectares from which Iran shares approximately 103 thousand hectares. Tarom region in Zanjan province {{is one of the}} important olive cultivation in which 12600 hectare has been devoted to olive planting. A growing trend could be seen if the cultivation area regarding the fertile and non- fertile olive orchards along with amount of production were compared during the last decades which may be attributed mainly to favorable climatic condition for olive cultivation in the region. Temperature as the most important environmental factor affects flowering and fruiting of olive trees. Temperatures that stimulate olive fruiting, and sub-zero temperatures which cause damage to olive tree or fruit yielding are of great importance in determining the adaptability of olive trees. Regarding the quality of olive oil, fruit characters such as: cultivar, ripening and climatic conditions are considered as main characters too. To determine the adaptable cultivars for any region and microclimates many experiments have been carried out worldwide. In Iran, Zard and Roghany local olive cultivars selected for northern parts of Iran with the most area under cultivation in Rudbar and Tarom regions but the Dezful cultivar has been released for southern regions of the country. This study was carried at Tarom Olive Research Station, Zanjan, Iran and aimed to evaluate the vegetative and reproductive traits of some domestic and foreign olive cultivars and to determine the adaptability of them to the studied area. Materials and Methods At the beginning of the study, age of the olive trees varied between 4 to 6 years and all the trees were in the reproductive phase. Plantation system was also 8 × 8 meters with trickle irrigation systems. The cultivars were: Amigdalolia, Arbequina, Abusatl, Bladi, Picual, Roghany, Zard, Koroneiki, Konservolia, Leccino, Mary, Mastoidis, Manzanilla, and Mission. The experiment was conducted based on a RCBD layout with three replications considering four trees for each plot. Vegetative characters (tree vigor, growth habit and crown density), flower traits (number of flower per inflorescence, number of inflorescence per shoot, perfect flower) and fruit characters (fruit weight, length and diameter of <b>fruit,</b> <b>stone</b> weight, flesh to stone ratio, oil percent in dry fruit weight and yield per hectare) as well as susceptibility of crown trees to wind and susceptibility to cold, along with the cumulative yield of 5 -year were measured. For statistical analysis the SAS software was used and means comparisons were performed using Duncan Multiple Range Test. Results and Discussion: Results showed that among evaluated cultivars, the number of flowers per inflorescence in most cultivars except Leccino, Baladiand Koroneiki were the same level. Manzanillaand Mission had the highestflowers per inflorescence but Leccino and Baladi had the lowest number of flowers per inflorescence. Arbequina, Koroneiki, Baladi, Zard, Konservolia, PicualandRoghany in comparison with other cultivars had high perfect flowers. Konservolia, Zard, Koroneiki, Arbequinaand Abusatl had the highest yield. Theyield of these cultivars was 4265, 3498, 3104, 2625, 2273 and 2101 kg per hectare, respectively. The cumulative yield of abovementioned cultivars in 5 -year were 22472, 17490, 15520, 13125, 11365 and 10505 Kg/ha, respectively. Amigdalolia, Konservolia, Baladiand Mastoidis cultivars had the highest oil content in dry matter basis. Also Mari, Koroneiki and Arbequina cultivars had the highest oil content. Fruit weight of Amigdalolia, Abusatl and Konservolia cultivars were more than 8 gr. More over Picual, Zard, Mission and Manzanilla cultivars fruit weight were between 5 and 6 gr. Konservolia, Abusatl, Manzanilla, Amygdalolia, Picual and Mastoidis had the highest flesh to stone ratio. The flesh to stone ratio of these cultivars was 10. 09, 9. 35, 9. 04, 8. 16, 7. 45 and 7. 05 respectively. Conclusion: Konservolia as a double purpose cultivar was the first olive cultivar choice of this research. Konservolia as compared with other cultivars had the highest yield. In addition,it is reported that this cultivar tolerated cold temperatures (low temperatures) during years of 2006 and 2007. Konservolia with large fruit and a high ratio of flesh to stone can be a substitute for the Zard olive cultivars in Tarom area. Zard, Koroneiki and Arbequina were the other selected of these studies. Zard is a native cultivar. Now, this cultivar is the first priority of Tarom region, because is a double purpose cultivar. Moreover studies showed that Zard in comparison with other native cultivars had high oil quality...|$|E

Frequently, these raw materials can also be regarded as a source to produce activated carbons (ACs) via chemical of physical activation [2].|$|R

Nouns in the x-class typically refer to countable, non-human beings or things, for example animals, <b>fruit,</b> <b>stones,</b> eggs, or coins; conversely, nouns in the y-class are as a rule uncountable abstractions or mass nouns, such as rice, fire, water, snow, wool, etc.|$|R
25|$|Cyanides are {{produced}} by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae and are found {{in a number of}} plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and <b>fruit</b> <b>stones,</b> e.g., those of apricots, apples, and peaches. In plants, cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of cyanogenic glycosides and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.|$|R

The physico-chemical characteristics, structural parameters and sorption characteristics of obtained active carbons were determined. The ability of carbonaceous adsorbents for detoxification of soil against pesticides, purification of surface waters and for removal of organic pollutants from wastewaters has been evaluated. The obtained results reveal {{the effectiveness of}} their use in a number of environmental technologies...|$|R
