25|$|Heading {{into the}} 2012 World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, England were {{considered}} favourites after an 18-month unbeaten streak that only {{ended in the}} weeks before the tournament, in a series against the West Indies which England won 4-1. England were forced into a late change for the tournament during this series, when Susie Rowe fractured <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> was replaced by the uncapped Amy Jones. England were grouped with Australia, India and Pakistan in Group A, following their group stage exit in the previous World Twenty20.|$|E
25|$|Mary is {{depicted}} {{sitting on a}} stool, with a slightly oversized Christ child figure sitting on her lap. She wears a tight, long-sleeved tunic and a cloak (palla) drawn over her shoulders.

In her right hand she holds aloft a globe with <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> two fingers, while her left hand supports the infant in her lap. The Christ figure himself wears a pontifical gown and presses a book against his breast with his left hand.|$|E
500|$|Type 1 is [...] "partial or {{total removal}} of the {{clitoris}} and/or the prepuce". Type Ia (circumcision) involves {{removal of the}} clitoral hood only. This is rarely performed alone. The more common procedure is Type Ib (clitoridectomy), the complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans (the visible tip of the clitoris) and clitoral hood. The circumciser pulls the clitoral glans with <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> index finger and cuts it off.|$|E
6000|$|But Fanny {{was holding}} up my {{envelope}} between both <b>her</b> <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> forefingers, and steadily smiling at me, over its margin. [...] "A joke, Midgetina; {{and one of}} your very own. How exciting. And how bulgy. May I open it? I wouldn't miss it for the world." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{chemical}} reaction {{that occurs when}} plaster is mixed with water is exothermic. When plaster sets, it can reach temperatures of more than 60 Â°C and, in large volumes, can burn the skin. In January 2007, a secondary school student in Lincolnshire, England sustained third-degree burns after encasing her hands in a bucket of plaster {{as part of a}} school art project. The burns were so severe she required amputation of both <b>her</b> <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> six of <b>her</b> fingers.|$|R
6000|$|The woman seized Ball-Carrier between <b>her</b> finger <b>and</b> <b>thumb,</b> <b>and</b> {{was going}} to carry him to the kitchen, when the boy spoke: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was holding}} in the air, between <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> forefinger, a folded bit of well-worn newspaper. Her eyes sparkled.|$|E
60|$|As Mrs. Tulliver spoke {{she drew}} a bright bunch of keys from her pocket, and singled out one, rubbing <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> finger up and down it with a placid smile while {{she looked at the}} clear fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Jimmy!" [...] she said, [...] "I {{want you}} to do nothing but get me another cigarette. At my age one expects no more than one gets!" [...] She held out <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> finger: [...] "Do you mind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Kla'uns," [...] said Susy calmly, {{making a}} little pleat in the skirt {{of her dress}} with <b>her</b> small <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> fingers, [...] "don't you talk to me. I was there. I'se a SERIVER! The men at the fort said so! The SERIVERS is allus, allus there, and allus allus knows everythin'." ...|$|R
40|$|A 53 {{year old}} woman {{presented}} to the office with complaint of severe bilateral <b>thumb</b> nail pain <b>and</b> the deformity shown (Figure 1). She denied previous trauma to <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> nails <b>and</b> had no history of previous bacterial or fungal infections of her nails. Based on the curvature of her nails, which increased from proximal to distal, a diagnosis of bilateral thumb pincer nail deformity was made...|$|R
6000|$|... "Haven't {{you noticed}} that she often doubles <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> under <b>her</b> fingers--folds her fist across it--so--especially when anybody talks about {{anything}} alarming? If the conversation happens to turn on jungle fever, or any subject like that, down goes <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> instantly, <b>and</b> she clasps her fist over it with a convulsive squeeze. At the same time, too, her face twitches. I know what that trick means. She's horribly afraid of tropical diseases, though she never says so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a dear little coz," [...] she said, just {{touching}} {{the tip of}} Anna's chin with <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> forefinger. [...] "I don't ever {{want to do anything}} that will vex you. Especially if Rex is to make everything come off--charades and everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{replied the}} girl; [...] "but {{in this case}} I think you had better write." [...] She kept {{slipping}} Ehrhardt's letter up and down between <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> finger against {{the palm of her}} left hand, and delayed giving it to him, as if she wished him to say something first.|$|E
6000|$|The first {{afternoon}} {{was given to}} trying her in this light and that, and studying her from different points. She wished to stand before her easel, in her Synthesis working-dress, with her palette on <b>her</b> <b>thumb,</b> <b>and</b> a brush in her other hand. He said finally, [...] "Why not?" [...] and Cornelia made a tentative sketch of her.|$|E
60|$|Henrietta hung back, but her arm {{was linked}} in Agatha's, {{and she was}} drawn along in spite of herself. Smilash did not move. Agatha strolled on coolly, and as she passed him, adroitly caught the apron between <b>her</b> finger <b>and</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> twitched it from his face. Instantly Henrietta uttered a {{piercing}} scream, and Smilash caught her in his arms.|$|R

5000|$|Leena Tom Thumb {{is small}} in size but very brave, just like <b>her</b> grandpa Tom <b>Thumb,</b> <b>and</b> {{she has no}} fear of runaway {{pumpkins}} or rampaging ogres. However, she is always [...] "squished" [...] flat because she can't {{get out of the}} way.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{chestnuts}} were ripe {{when we were}} married," [...] said Tessa, {{marking off}} <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> fingers again as she spoke; [...] "and then again they were ripe at Peretola before he came back, and then again, after that, on the hill. And soon the soldiers came, and we heard the trumpets, and then Naldo had the coat." ...|$|E
60|$|Her friend did not look, but Tommy looked, {{and there}} was none. He assured her of this so earnestly that Bob {{fell in love with}} him on the spot, and chucked him under the chin, first with <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> then with her toe, which feat was duly {{reported}} to Shovel, who could do it by the end of the week.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{understand}} what I mean; and I think it's {{one of the great}} charms of a husband, that you're not forced to express yourself to him. A husband," [...] continued Isabel, sententiously, poising a bit of meringue between <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> finger,--for they had reached that point in the repast, [...] "a husband is almost as good as another woman!" ...|$|E
60|$|There she {{interrupted}} me--and, oh, in what an impudent manner! She took my chin between <b>her</b> finger <b>and</b> <b>thumb,</b> <b>and</b> {{lifted my}} downcast face, {{and looked at}} me with an appearance of eager expectation which I was quite at a loss to understand.|$|R
60|$|An imp {{danced in}} Holly's eyes--Val's eyelashes were meeting. Whatever happened, he must NOT snore. <b>Her</b> finger <b>and</b> <b>thumb</b> closed on his thigh; till he stirred uneasily.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. I {{have nothing}} to do with it," [...] she answered; and taking the upper hinge of the slate between <b>her</b> fingers <b>and</b> <b>thumb</b> she slowly raised it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your hand {{is asleep}} in my hand's arms," [...] he whispered. The ball of his thumb pressed <b>her</b> <b>thumb,</b> <b>and</b> he whispered once more: [...] "See. Now our hands are kissing each other--we--we must watch them better.... Your thumb {{is like a}} fairy." [...] Again his thumb, {{hardened}} with file and wrench and steering-wheel, touched hers. It was startlingly like a kiss of real lips.|$|E
60|$|On {{the smooth}} jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, {{leave it to}} my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the {{polished}} knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.|$|E
60|$|Then of {{a sudden}} Hadden felt {{something}} cold {{at the back of}} his neck, and the next instant the Bee had sprung from him, holding between <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> finger a curl of dark hair which she had cut from his head. The action was so instantaneous that he had neither time to avoid nor to resent it, but stood still staring at her stupidly.|$|E
60|$|This did {{not seem}} quite right to Dot, {{but she did not}} know how to reply; and to add to her confusion, the candy man {{suddenly}} held up his left hand, which he had placed behind him as he talked, and showed <b>her</b> that his <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> two of the fingers were missing.|$|R
5000|$|Vedic {{sacrifice}} rituals at a weddingWest of the (sacred) fire, a stone (for grinding {{corn and}} condiments) is placed and northeast a water jar. The bridegroom offers an oblation, standing, looking towards the west, and taking {{hold of the}} bride's hands while she sits and looks towards the east. If he wishes only for sons, he clasps <b>her</b> <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> says, [...] "I clasp thy hands {{for the sake of}} good fortune"; the fingers alone, if he wishes only for daughters; the hairy side of the hand along with the thumbs if wishes for both (sons and daughters). Then, whilst he leads her towards the right three times around the fire, and round the water jar, he says in a low tone,"I am he, thou are she; thou art she, I am he,I am the heaven, thou art the earth; I am the Saman, thou art the Rig.Come let us marry, let us possess offspring,united in affection, well disposed to each other,let us live for a hundred years".â ÄÅvalÄyana Kalpa sutra, Book 1.7, Translated by Monier Monier-Williams ...|$|R
60|$|The two of 'em {{stood there}} {{looking at each other}} for a minute, and then my wife, holding the letter between <b>'er</b> finger <b>and</b> <b>thumb</b> as if it was pison, passed it to Mrs. Smithers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, for I've been {{watching}} her for weeks," [...] said the Canary. [...] "She has six magic hairpins, which she wears in her hair, and a magic ring which she wears on <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> which is invisible to all eyes except {{those of a}} fairy, and magic bracelets on both her ankles. So I am positive that she will manage {{to find a way}} out of her prison." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{woman had}} taken them, used their light and colour, and then flung them back! She wrapped them {{again in the}} paper, tied the string, and went towards the river. She did not hurry, but walked with her eyes {{steadily}} before her. She crossed the Embankment, and stood leaning on the parapet with her hands over the grey water. <b>Her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> fingers unclosed; the white parcel dropped, floated a second, and then disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|Teresa {{looked at}} her, and {{suddenly}} looked away again. Mrs. Gallilee stopped {{on her way}} out, at a chiffonier, and altered the arrangement {{of some of the}} china on it. The duenna followed on tiptoe--folded <b>her</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> two middle fingers into the palm of her hand--and, stretching out the forefinger and the little finger, touched Mrs. Gallilee on the back, so softly that she was unaware of it. [...] "The Evil Eye," [...] Teresa whispered to herself in Italian, as she stole back to her place.|$|E
50|$|The statue was modeled, {{and then}} {{following}} its {{approval by the}} various committees in Texas, carved by the Piccirilli Brothers in New York City. At {{some point in the}} carving process, someone, either Friedlander or the Piccirilli carvers, became concerned that the statues right hand <b>and</b> <b>her</b> right <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> forefinger might be too weak to be self-supporting, so a small block of marble was left to add strength. Often such aids are removed in the works final carving; they were not in this case.|$|R
60|$|A child, {{finger in}} mouth, had paused {{a little way}} from where she sat, and stared with cloudy {{interest}} upon this laughing lady. She called it nearer; but the child hung back. Instantly, with that curious passion which you may see any {{woman in the world}} display, on the most odd occasions, for a similar end, the Countess bent herself with singleness of mind to overcome this diffidence; and presently, sure enough, the child was seated on <b>her</b> knee, <b>thumbing</b> <b>and</b> glowering at <b>her</b> watch.|$|R
60|$|She drew {{forth the}} letter, {{unfolded}} it, {{and held it}} up to him, letting it hang by one corner from between <b>her</b> finger <b>and</b> <b>thumb,</b> so that the light from the lamp, though remote, fell directly upon its surface.|$|R
