CCI co-counsellors may and <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> whole range of personal relationships with other co-counsellors. However, new co-counsellors are encouraged not to develop new non-co-counselling relationships with other co-counsellors until they have more experience and experienced co-counsellors will often have people with whom they only have a co-counselling relationship. Teachers of co-counselling are strongly discouraged from having sexual relationships with people they have taught.|$|E

Campus facilities include laboratories for student projects and three runways adjacent to campus.|$|E
25|$|With a {{population}} of 75,529, Galway is the fourth most populous city in the State and the 23rd most populous area of local government. Services such as waste collection, recycling, traffic control, parks and housing are controlled by a fifteen-member city council elected to five-year terms by proportional representation through means of the Single Transferable Vote PR-STV. The City Council is chaired by a mayor who is elected to a one-year term by fellow councillors. The role of mayor is mainly ceremonial, although they <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> casting vote. The first mayor was Peirce Lynch Fitzjohn, elected in 1485. Cllr. Frank Fahy was elected Mayor in June 2015.|$|E
25|$|Health disparities {{are also}} {{due in part}} to {{cultural}} factors that involve practices based not only on sex, but also gender status. For example, in China, health disparities have distinguished medical treatment for men and women due to the cultural phenomenon of preference for male children. Recently, gender-based disparities have decreased as females have begun to receive higher-quality care. Additionally, a girl’s chances of survival are impacted by the presence of a male sibling; while girls <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same chance of survival as boys if they are the oldest girl, they have a higher probability of being aborted or dying young if they have an older sister.|$|E

25|$|Students that {{attend a}} nursing college {{or just a}} nursing school receive the same degree that one would who {{graduated}} from a nursing university, {{but they do not}} have the same educational background. The classes offered at nursing colleges and nursing schools are focused on more practical aspects of nursing. These institutions do not offer many general education classes, so students who attend these schools will solely be focusing on their nursing educations while they are in school. Students who attend a nursing college or school <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to become a midwife or a public health nurse. They have to go through a training institute for their desired field after graduating from the nursing school or college. Japanese nurses never have to renew their licenses.

25|$|On 2 February 1999, the Constitutional Court of Russia {{issued a}} {{temporary}} stay on any executions for a rather technical reason, but nevertheless granting the moratorium an unquestionable legal status {{for the first}} time.

The court found that such disparity makes death sentences illegal {{in any part of}} the country, even those that <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> process of trial by jury implemented. According to the ruling, no death sentence may be passed until all regions of country have jury trials, which may happen as early as 2007, at which point the legal status of the death penalty may again become questionable.|$|E
25|$|Igapó {{forests are}} {{characterized}} by sandy acidic soils that have a low nutrient content. The color and acidity of the water {{is due to the}} acidic organic humic substances (e.g. tannins) that dissolve into the water. The acidity from the water translates into acidic soils. They are the more nutrient poor than a comparable várzea forest. They also “carry less suspended inorganic elements and contain elevated concentrations of dissolved organic material such as humic and fulvic acids”. Therefore, igapó forests support comparatively less life and the environment found within these areas tend to lack species diversity and animal biomass. Várzea forest soils have high nutrient contents because they receive a transport of high sediment loads from the whitewater rivers. In contrast, igapó forests do not receive this seasonal influx of sediments which explains the nutrient poor soils. However, they <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> highest phosphorus concentrations out of comparable várzea and terra firme forest soils. Nevertheless, the seasonal inundation of the soils leads to anoxic conditions which limits plant growth.|$|E

25|$|Response to {{infection}} by Leishmania donovani varies a great deal, {{not only by}} the strength but also by the type of the patient's immune reaction. People with a history of infection by strains of leishmania that cause visceral leishmaniasis show a continuum of immune responses from protective to non-protective. Those who acquired protective immunity (skin test positive) without ever having visceral leishmaniasis have a strong type 1 CD4+ response to leishmania antigens. Antigen specific interferon-gamma and proliferation, as well as the ability to kill intracellular leishmania, are hallmarks of protective immunity. Because visceral leishmaniasis patients lack these responses to leishmania and other antigens, they usually die of secondary infections if left untreated. In addition, increased interleukin-10 secretion is characteristic of the disease. Addition of interleukin-12, anti-interleukin-10, or anti-interleukin-4 to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from acute patients sometimes increases interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation. Acute patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells include CD8+ T regulatory cells that decrease interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation responses to leishmania and other antigens and increase interleukin-10 secretion when added to autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested after successful treatment. Thus, the CD8+ T regulatory cells reproduce the immune response characteristic of visceral leishmaniasis. CD8+ T regulatory cells are also associated with post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis. Addition of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma does not prevent CD8+ T regulatory activity. The dominance of type 1 CD4+ T cells in skin test positive adults maybe explained by their secretion of factors that inhibit and kill CD8+ T regulatory cells. Successfully treated patients rarely develop visceral leishmaniasis a second time. Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells show a mixed T1/T2 CD4+ and CD8+ T suppressor response but <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to kill intracellular leishmania.|$|E

500|$|In spiral galaxies, {{the spiral}} arms <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> shape of {{approximate}} logarithmic spirals, {{a pattern that}} can be theoretically shown to result from a disturbance in a uniformly rotating mass of stars. Like the stars, the spiral arms rotate around the center, but they do so with constant angular velocity. The spiral arms {{are thought to be}} areas of high-density matter, or [...] "density waves". As stars move through an arm, the space velocity of each stellar system is modified by the gravitational force of the higher density. (The velocity returns to normal after the stars depart {{on the other side of}} the arm.) This effect is akin to a [...] "wave" [...] of slowdowns moving along a highway full of moving cars. The arms are visible because the high density facilitates star formation, and therefore they harbor many bright and young stars.|$|E

They ultimately settled for Sky, as the network was [...] "the one that we believed would let us do what we wanted".
