5|$|Phantom Blood was {{originally}} serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump {{under the title}} JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 1 Jonathan Joestar: His Youth. It ran from January 1 to October 26, 1987 {{for a total of}} 44 chapters, and was later collected in five volumes. It was also collected in a three-volume collection on February 15, 2002, and in another three-volume collection with new cover art by Araki from December 4, 2013 to January 4, 2014 as part of the JoJonium line, along with the second and third part of the series, Battle Tendency and Stardust Crusaders. This version was released in North America by Viz Media, beginning <b>digitally</b> in 2014 and in print in 2015. A <b>digitally</b> colored version of the complete manga was released <b>digitally</b> for smartphones and tablet computers in Japan on July 13, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Planet Terror makes {{heavy use}} of digital effects {{throughout}} the film. Perhaps {{the most notable}} effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams <b>digitally</b> removed McGowan's right leg from the shots {{and replaced it with}} computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an M16 rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to <b>digitally</b> remove it during post-production.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} <b>digitally,</b> {{and almost all}} of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be <b>digitally</b> recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also <b>digitally</b> built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on Chroma key with the cave background inserted later.|$|E
5|$|Shantae was <b>digitally</b> re-released via the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on July 18, 2013. The game is {{available}} via eShop in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Sony Pictures Imageworks {{designed}} {{the special effects}} for the film. The digital composition of the film, including the scene where the battle of Spider-Man and Electro in Times Square, took one year to complete. The sets of Times Square were built in Gold Coast Studios with the green screens {{and most of the}} scenes were <b>digitally</b> re-designed by computer. The photography and VFX team took over 36,000 photos of the Times Square in order to re-create the location <b>digitally.</b> In addition, the animation team captured over 100 billboards during the photography process.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{available}} <b>digitally</b> between June 16 and 30, 2016 on the Xbox 360 {{as part of}} Xbox Live's Games with Gold.|$|E
5|$|The missile silo {{used for}} the episode's climactic scene was {{incomplete}} when the scene was filmed, as the crew {{did not have enough}} time or money left to complete the set. The crew built the incomplete silo on a sound stage around a completed spacecraft prop, and were able to <b>digitally</b> extend the set with computer generated interiors to give the impression of a much larger silo. Exterior shots of the silo building were also enhanced <b>digitally,</b> with various buildings and machinery created with computer generated imagery and composited into the exterior shots.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack was {{released}} <b>digitally</b> {{and in two}} physical formats: a two-disc CD edition and a vinyl record edition, the latter of which was limited to 2000units. The vinyl edition contains 16tracks on two sides and comes with a code to download {{the rest of the}} Anniversary soundtrack <b>digitally.</b> The compact disc edition contains thirty-nine tracks and {{was released}} on November 15, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{title was}} re-released <b>digitally</b> through Nintendo's Virtual Console service in Japan, for the Wii on July 15, 2008 and for Wii U on July 10, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles also {{received}} digital enhancement. For {{the scene in}} which the Expendables crash their Canadair CL-215 amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use Miniature effects, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet wing span plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered <b>digitally.</b> The plane itself was also <b>digitally</b> modified, adding a nose mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A rear hatch door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane but the crafts design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves {{and so it was}} <b>digitally</b> removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors and they were <b>digitally</b> added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs Mi-8 helicopter was a civilian variant, but it was <b>digitally</b> replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black reflective coating and armaments. The T-72 tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots with a digital version that performed the shooting.|$|E
5|$|A Moon Shaped Pool is {{the ninth}} studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, {{released}} <b>digitally</b> on 8 May 2016. CD and LP releases followed in June 2016 through XL Recordings. Radiohead also sold {{a special edition}} from their website, containing two extra tracks and additional artwork.|$|E
5|$|A soundtrack to {{accompany}} the film was released <b>digitally</b> by Lakeshore Records on October 9, 2012. It features a mix of the film's original score, composed by Andy Cabic and Eric D. Johnson, as well as music from other artists heard throughout various portions of the film.|$|E
5|$|After {{numerous}} delays, U2 <b>digitally</b> released their thirteenth album, Songs of Innocence, on 9 September 2014 in {{a surprise}} release. The band appeared {{the same day}} at an Apple Inc. product launch event to announce the album and reveal it was being released to all iTunes Store customers at no cost.|$|E
5|$|As part of Apollo 11's 40th {{anniversary in}} 2009, NASA spearheaded {{an effort to}} <b>digitally</b> restore the {{existing}} videotapes of the mission's live televised moonwalk. After an exhaustive three-year search for missing tapes of the original video of the Apollo 11 moonwalk, NASA concluded the data tapes had more than likely been accidentally erased.|$|E
5|$|Asylum <b>digitally</b> created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed {{suddenly}} by {{a shot in the}} head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum <b>digitally</b> created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.|$|E
5|$|At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, Sean Callery {{revealed}} he was composing {{music for}} Jessica Jones, eventually {{stating that the}} music required for each episode ranged from 9 to 20 minutes, totaling approximately 415 minutes of music for the season. A soundtrack album for the season was released <b>digitally</b> on June 3, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Blow {{stated that}} they had been in discussions with {{publishers}} for a physical release of the game, but opted to not do that step initially, citing the additional time that would have been needed for the manufacturing and distribution processes. However, with the game completed and released <b>digitally,</b> they are looking to potential retail versions.|$|E
5|$|Del Rey Manga, in North America, and Tanoshimi in the United Kingdom {{licensed}} School Rumble for an English-language release. It {{has also}} been translated into other languages, although the German-language release which Tokyopop initially published was cancelled and later continued by Egmont Manga & Anime.2|date=January 5, 2009|accessdate=June 15, 2009}} Del Rey released the first English-language volume on February 28, 2006, and the latest—volumes 14-16 in an omnibus—on July 27, 2010. Following Kodansha's lead, the Del Rey translation places the main plot chapters first followed by the side stories. Del Rey also retained the Japanese naming order to preserve puns and humor involving {{the names of the}} characters. The manga ceased to be published in North America after Del Rey became defunct. Kodansha released 13 volumes of the manga <b>digitally</b> on iTunes on July 26, 2016. As of August 2017, all 22 volumes of the main series have been published <b>digitally</b> in English by Kodansha and can be purchased from typical ebook sites such as kobo.com and amazon.com.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies {{was given}} a digital-only release in the West. This was {{partially}} because of the game's tight development schedule: by releasing it <b>digitally,</b> Capcom was able to release the English version close to the Japanese release date. Although Ace Attorney Investigations 2 has not been officially localized, it has received a full fan translation.|$|E
5|$|Enter the Voids {{post-production}} process lasted {{more than}} a year. Work on the digital effects was led by Pierre Buffin of BUF Compagnie. Every scene in the film includes computer-generated imagery (CGI)—even the flashback scenes, where the backdrops were <b>digitally</b> altered. Studio scenes, helicopter shots, and CGI were forged together in the hovering sequences with the intention that the viewer should be unable to determine which is which. For shots from high altitudes, the team started with helicopter footage from video, and then created computer models of the neighbourhoods with textures from photographs. Neon lights, reflections, and dark areas were consistently accentuated. Flickers were created through a mixture of motion blur, chromatic aberration, and focus effects. For scenes seen as through a fisheye lens, the team recreated the sets <b>digitally</b> and progressively increased the environments' reflection values along with the lens effect.|$|E
5|$|For {{the battle}} {{sequence}} in North Africa, two actual Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks in Desert Air Force paint schemes were used, accompanied by cloned images {{of them or}} by computer-generated planes. In scenes showing squadrons of soldiers, digital extras were not used; instead, photography of real squadrons was cloned. Sony Pictures Imageworks also <b>digitally</b> expanded details on stage locations and at practical locations. The exterior of Hitler's Bavarian residence Berghof was <b>digitally</b> created, since little {{was left of the}} original structure, and the creation was superimposed on a shot of a ski area in Austria. In Berlin itself, city officials helped reduce the need for visual effects by removing power poles and modern lighting over the weekend when filming took place and restoring the equipment by the start of the new week.|$|E
5|$|Four of the films—Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, The Woman in Green, Terror by Night and Dressed to Kill—are in {{the public}} domain. In 2006 the four films were <b>digitally</b> {{restored}} and computer colourised by Legend Films, who released the colour and black and white films on DVDs.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, it was {{released}} on VHS in North America {{for the first time}} and on UK VHS in 1988 for the first time. The 1992 re-issue was <b>digitally</b> restored by cleaning and removing scratches from the original negatives one frame at a time, eliminating soundtrack distortions, and revitalizing the color.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs {{became the}} first film to be entirely scanned to digital files, manipulated, and {{recorded}} back to film. The restoration project was carried out entirely at 4K resolution and 10-bit color depth using the Cineon system to <b>digitally</b> remove dirt and scratches and restore faded colors.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005 BBC Worldwide {{released}} a DVD box set {{of all their}} existing Quatermass material. This included <b>digitally</b> restored versions of all six episodes of Quatermass II, with the sound and vision of the telerecording copies cleaned up as far as possible, {{and some of the}} existing special effects inserts that survived on their original film elements being re-inserted into the episodes.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies {{acquired}} the film negative rights of fourteen Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Malliswari, to release their <b>digitally</b> remastered versions in colour. Though the <b>digitally</b> remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar, released in January 2010, was commercially successful, Goldstone Technologies {{decided not to}} remaster the remaining fourteen films including Malliswari, saying {{that most of the}} producers who sold the rights of the negatives to TV channels lost control over them. Goldstone said furthermore that {{there were a number of}} legal issues over ownership and copyright issues whenever other producers try to do something on their own.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, in {{commemoration}} for the film's 25th anniversary, Back to the Future was <b>digitally</b> {{restored and}} remastered for a theatrical re-release in the US, the UK and Italy. The release also coincided with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment's Blu-ray Disc releases of the trilogy.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, McCreary {{announced}} {{that there were}} plans for an Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. soundtrack, which was released <b>digitally</b> a year later by Marvel Music on September 4, 2015, and on CD on October 9. Featuring music from the first two seasons, the soundtrack was written and produced by McCreary and Steven Kaplan, with the album produced by Joe Augustine with McCreary.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Adobe, for the Adobe Imagination Challenge, Cuomo revealed that Adobe Photoshop was used to <b>digitally</b> alter the cover. Cuomo stated that, while the band liked the chosen band photo for the cover, Matt Sharp was {{not happy with the}} way his head looked. The Geffen Art Director used Photoshop to swap out the head with one from another shot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of January 2015, Sony {{announced}} The Interview would receive a wide theatrical release in the United Kingdom and Ireland on February 6, but it would not be distributed <b>digitally</b> in the UK. The film became available for streaming on Netflix on January 24.|$|E
5|$|Lola VFX, {{who worked}} on the pre-serum Steve Rogers scenes in this film and Captain America: The First Avenger, also worked on shots {{featuring}} an elderly Peggy Carter. This involved <b>digitally</b> transposing the facial features of an elderly actress onto the face of actress Hayley Atwell who had performed her lines with no make-up and only a few tracking markers.|$|E
