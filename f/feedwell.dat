50|$|The jazz {{scene in}} Sydney slowed {{down a little}} towards {{the start of the}} 1980s when The Basement pursued a more {{commercial}} music policy after extending their premises by adding a large upstairs area. Around that same time Horst Liepolt left Australia, going on to a successful career in jazz production in New York, and this left a major gap in the area of jazz promotion in Sydney. However traditional and mainstream bands continued to do well in the pub scene and contemporary jazz could still be found in venues such as The Paradise at Kings Cross, Jenny's in the inner city and Morgan's <b>Feedwell</b> at Glebe.|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} balance (PB) –CFD {{model has been}} used to describe fluid flow, solids distribution, and aggregation/breakage kinetics of flocculation in gravity thickeners. The behaviour and transport of flocculated solids from the <b>feedwell</b> to various points in the settling zone below the <b>feedwell</b> and also the settling rate are governed by the hydrodynamics, turbulent mixing, and flocculation within the <b>feedwell.</b> The PB model, developed from an extensive range of experimental data and validated in pilot-scale thickener feedwells, describes simultaneous aggregation and breakage as a function of various process variables, such as fluid shear, flocculant dosage, primary particle size and solid fraction. The model {{has been used to}} investigate the fluid flow structure, distributions of feed solids and aggregation in a full-scale thickener at different flow conditions. The investigation has provided significant new insights into the performance and operation of a gravity thickener.

DSP {{was shown to}} form at the surface of hematite, impacting upon the extent, efficiency and mechanism of aggregation {{with a number of}} different polymer reagents. Real-time measurement of aggregate properties provided new insights on fines capture. The practical implications for full-scale <b>feedwell</b> flocculation were explored...|$|E
40|$|Sedimentation {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{wastewater}} treatment processes, and is used to separate solid particles from carrier fluid in settling tanks known as clarifiers. The clarifier, as the last major facility in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), can limit or define the performance of the overall WWTP. This paper presents a novel three-dimensional unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to improve the efficiency of an industrial clarifier that had been experiencing underperformance and reduction in wastewater handling capacity. We propose a numerical technique to address the transient process of removing sludge from the floor of clarifiers by using rotating rakes. The CFD model was first applied to analyzing the ramifications of the current clarifier geometry on performance. The results show that the root causes for underperformance are related to the unconventional top side feed design of the clarifier, which leads to significant asymmetry in the flow distribution. The CFD model was next used to investigate various design modifications with the goal of improving the clarifier performance. A few geometry modification ideas such as an inward baffle, dissipating inlets, and a submerged skirt were found to create a more uniform flow distribution in the clarifier, significantly reducing the backflow into the <b>feedwell</b> and the velocity of the flow exiting the <b>feedwell,</b> which helps the solid particles to settle in the clarifier. These three designs were found to reduce the effluent total suspended solids (TSS) by more than 80 % and thus significantly improve clarifier performance. It is believed that the CFD model developed in this study can become a computationally efficient tool for investigating the performance of industrial clarifiers with complex geometries and rotating rakes...|$|E
40|$|The AJ Parker Cooperative Research Centre for Hydrometallurgy {{carries out}} {{research}} on behalf of, and in collaboration with, the Australian mining industry. As might be expected, {{much of its}} research is directed towards improving the efficiency of alumina and gold processing plants. However, the Centre also carries out research of relevance to base and other metal producers. A key element in its work is the successful transfer of its technology to the companies with which it is working. In general, this is achieved in the following five steps: 1. definition of the problem through discussions with the company commissioning the research; 2. execution of the research; 3. assessment of the research findings; 4. testing of the research findings by pilot plant or on-site trials; and 5. implementation of the results on the full-scale. This pattern is exemplified by the work {{carried out by the}} Centre to improve the performance of gravity thickeners which are used throughout the minerals industry for solid-liquid separation. The research has focussed mainly on ways to optimise the use of flocculants (long chain polymers) to enhance thickener performance. It has been shown that the way the flocculant is mixed with the slurry is of profound importance. Computational fluid dynamics modelling of the <b>feedwell</b> region of thickeners and laboratory and plant flocculation studies have been used to determine better ways to contact the flocculant with the feed slurry. Implementation of these and other findings on the full-scale confirmed that improvements in thickener performance were indeed possible. As a result of this AMIRA funded thickener technology work, there have been considerable savings to a number of Australian mineral processing companies, through improved operation, higher throughputs and flocculant savings...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to describe the size and settling rate of aggregates formed by flocculation in thickeners/clarifiers used in the mineral processing industry. The aggregation process was simulated with a population balance model, which calculates the aggregate size distribution through time {{as a function of}} the competing processes of aggregation and breakage. The population balance was written specifically to describe aggregation by high molecular weight polymer flocculants that have now largely replaced coagulant salts in mineral processing operations, and the model includes terms to describe flocculant/slurry mixing and irreversible aggregate breakage (Table 1). The model was written to form part of a full computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a thickener/clarifier, allowing the eventual simulation and optimisation of the full-scale unit. In addition to the effects of fluid shear and residence time normally described by population balance models, additional process variables have been considered, with the model correctly accounting for changes in the flocculant dosage, primary particle size and solid fraction. The model has also been extended to describe the hindered settling rate under the same range of conditions, considerably increasing its usefulness by forming a link between the aggregation kinetics in the <b>feedwell</b> and the subsequent setting rate as the aggregates enter the settling zone of the thickener. The model was fitted to experimental data from a turbulent pipe reactor. A variety of pipe sizes, lengths, and flow rates were used to give a range of fluid shear rates and mean residence times, with the aggregate size distribution measured by an on-line sizing probe placed at the end of the pipe, immediately before a settling column. Experimental data was collected under a sparse matrix of experimental conditions, with the fluid shear rate (G), flocculant dosage (θf), primary particle size (dp) and solid fraction (φ) varied independently away from a common baseline. Additional data was collected from conditions in the gaps of the experimental matrix, and was used to check the predictivity of the model. The population balance model is based on the discretised balance by Hounslow et al. (1988) and Spicer and Pratsinis (1996), in this case using 35 channels covering the size 4 range: 0. 2 - 3500 μm. The aggregation rate is described by Saffman and Turner’s (1956) turbulent collision kernel, used in conjunction with a capture efficiency term. The capture efficiency is initially taken to be zero (no successful collisions) before flocculant addition, but increases to unity (all collisions successful) as described by a flocculant-suspension mixing term. The breakage rate is described {{as a function of the}} aggregate size, energy dissipation rate, suspension viscosity and effective flocculant surface coverage. The effective flocculant coverage is taken to decrease through time, reflecting the loss of flocculant activity caused by repeated aggregation/breakage. Aggregate porosity is also included, using fractal geometry, and is used to calculate the aggregate capture radius and effective suspension solid volume fraction. The solid volume fraction is used to determine the suspension viscosity, accounting for experimental data showing the pressure drop in the pipe is a function of the aggregate size. The model equations were solved numerically as an initial value problem with a commercial dynamic simulation package (gPROMS), which was also used to estimate the unknown model parameters. The model was found to be robust and stable, and gave good predictions of the additional experimental data sets. The extension of the model to also describe the hindered settling rate allowed a dynamic optimisation to give the maximum settling flux, and hence unit throughput. Various optimisation strategies were investigated, in particular the use of recycle to find the optimal feed solid fraction. The inclusion of the model within a full CFD simulation will allow further optimisation strategies to be investigated, in particular changes to the <b>feedwell</b> geometry to give good mixing but without subjecting fully formed aggregates to regions of destructive high fluid shear...|$|E
