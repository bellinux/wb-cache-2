5000|$|On 12 December 1884, {{five men}} descended the No.2 South shaft in a bowk to replace some byats. Just after the winding engine commenced, the [...] wide braided steel <b>flat</b> <b>rope</b> broke, sending four {{to their deaths}} {{at the bottom of}} the shaft [...] below. Thomas John Dobbs, who had been guiding the bowk down a guide rope, managed to slowly lowered himself to within hailing {{distance}} of pit bottom, and was rescued with nothing more than cuts and bruises. Following an accident investigation by HM Inspectorate of Mines, it was found that the rope had corroded, where it had been in contact with the Headframe sheave wheel. But as the rope was covered with a protective coating of tar, the corrosion had gone undetected. The sheave wheels on both the No.1 and No.2 shafts at Deep Navigation were unusual, in that they were constructed of different parts that had been riveted together, not a singular wheel that had been cast. The sheaves were not replaced at Deep Navigation until 1961 (No.2 South), and 1963 (No.1 North).|$|E
5000|$|Ride'em Squump Boy - When Under's Squump {{population}} {{gets too}} old and retires, the irritating Slaphappies move in, forcing Russel {{to go to the}} Argyle <b>Flats</b> and <b>rope</b> up another herd, a task only possible by subduing the biggest bull Squump. Bob Wire is also out to get the Squumps, and hires some local help to do it.|$|R
5000|$|In general, as with <b>flat</b> belts, <b>rope</b> drives {{were used}} for {{connections}} from stationary engines to the jack shafts and line shafts of mills, and sometimes from line shafts to driven machinery. Unlike leather belts, however, rope drives were sometimes used to transmit power over relatively long distances. Over long distances, intermediate sheaves were used to support the [...] "flying rope", and in the late 19th century, this was considered quite efficient.|$|R
50|$|A rider mounts a {{bull and}} grips a <b>flat</b> braided <b>rope.</b> After they secure a good {{grip on the}} rope, the rider nods to signal they are ready. The bucking chute (a small {{enclosure}} which opens from the side) is opened and the bull storms out into the arena. The rider must attempt {{to stay on the}} bull for at least eight seconds, while only touching the bull with their riding hand. The other hand must remain free {{for the duration of the}} ride. Originally, the rules required a 10-second ride, but that was changed to the current eight seconds.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the mussel seed {{collection}} in the various {{countries of the world}} shows that the dependence is on natural seed stock. 	 The rope culture technique for farming mussels appears to be universal although in countries like France and Philippines other 	 systems are followed to grow mussels in the tidal <b>flats.</b> Progress of' <b>rope</b> culture' technique adopted in India is given...|$|R
50|$|Probably, {{the most}} memorable of the rounds, in the {{original}} series, this pre-recorded segment involved the contestants racing to complete an army assault course located at Holcombe Moor in Bury, Greater Manchester. This round typically included 20 obstacles including vertical and <b>flat</b> cargo nets, <b>rope</b> swings, water jumps, Burma rope bridges, and a rope slide into water. Gordon Burns stated {{in some of the}} episodes that the contestants trained for the assault course in the Physical Ability round for up to five weeks in advance.|$|R
50|$|Halters may be {{classified}} into two broad categories, {{depending on whether}} the material used is flat or round. Materials include cured leather, rawhide, rope, and many different fibers, including nylon, polyester, cotton, and jute. Leather and rawhide may be flat or rolled. Fibers may be woven into flat webbing or twisted into round <b>rope.</b> <b>Flat</b> or round dictates the construction method: flat materials normally are sewn to buckles or rings at attachment points; round materials are knotted or spliced. Knotted halters often are made from a single piece of rope.|$|R
25|$|Like all planorbids, {{the shell}} of Biomphalaria glabrata is planispiral, in other words coiled <b>flat</b> like a <b>rope,</b> and the spire of the shell is sunken. Also, like all planorbids, this species has a sinistral shell, in other words, the coiling of the shell is left-handed. However, like all the snails in the {{subfamily}} Planobinae, this snail carries its coiled shell upside down, and thus the shell appears to be dextral in coiling. In other families of snails the spire is situated {{on top of the}} shell, here what shows on top of the shell is in fact the umbilicus.|$|R
50|$|On 11 August actual {{construction}} began; on 16 August Tritton {{decided to}} fit a wheeled tail to assist in steering. On 9 September the Number 1 Lincoln Machine, as the prototype was then known, made its first test run in the yard of the Wellington Foundry. It {{soon became clear that}} the track profiles were so flat that ground resistance during a turn was excessive. To solve this, the suspension was changed so that the bottom profile was more curved. Then the next problem showed up: when crossing a trench the track sagged and then would not fit the wheels again and jammed. The tracks were also not up to carrying the weight of the vehicle (about 16 tons). Tritton and Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson tried several types of alternative track design, including balat√° belting and <b>flat</b> wire <b>ropes.</b> Tritton, on 22 September, devised a robust but outwardly crude system using pressed steel plates riveted to cast links and incorporated guides to engage {{on the inside of the}} track frame. The track frames as a whole were connected to the main body by large spindles. This system was unsprung, as the tracks were held firmly in place, able to move in only one plane. This was a successful design and was used on all First World War British tanks up to the Mark VIII, although it limited speed.|$|R
