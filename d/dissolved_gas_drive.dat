40|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{intuitive}} methods to analyze the formation of oil and water saturation by sealed coring. But this method is affected by a variety of factors, such as pore volume change, fluid compression, and separation of dissolved gas. In view of the impact of such factors on sealed coring test saturation, there are four kinds of correlation methods currently, namely, comprehensive coefficient correction method, experiment correlation method, mathematical statistics method, and mathematical model correction method, with their own advantages and disadvantages. Based on the analysis of physical change during core lifting process, this paper proposes the mathematical model for dynamic correction of core saturation based on <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> <b>drive</b> filtration theory, multiphase flow fractional flow theory, and corresponding work flow. This method comprehensively considers the impact of relative permeability of three-phase fluid flow, elastic compression nature of fluid and rock, fluid viscosity, volume factor, solution GOR, and other high-pressure PVTs, so it features a wider adaptability, and the accuracy of model correction results satisfies the project requirements. This method provides a reliable basis for the true oil-water saturation of actual reservoir and has an important theoretical and practical significance...|$|E

Posiva has studied the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> content in deep groundwater at Olkiluoto since 1991.

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of gas flow in nanopores {{is one of}} the major focuses in shale reservoir research. The interaction between gas molecules and solid walls becomes so significant that we have to consider this effect on flow mechanisms. There are three types of gas stored in shale reservoirs: free gas (just like the gas in conventional reservoirs), adsorbed gas near the solid wall surfaces and <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> within the organic materials (kerogen). Each type of gas possesses different flow mechanisms. The <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> in kerogen is immovable and structured as the rock solid matrix. When the pressure decreases, <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> will release, leading to the shrinkage of the solid matrix and increment of porosity and permeability. There are lots of studies of this effect in coalbed methane reservoirs, but there are only limited studies for shale and the percentage of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> is questionable. Etminan et al. (2014) measured the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> in a shale sample using a pressure decay method and reported that the contribution of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> (methane) was about 22 % of the total gas in place at 4.5  MPa and the adsorbed gas contributed about 38 %. Jin and Firoozabadi (2016) adopted the solid-solution model for wax and asphaltene precipitation (Pan and Firoozabadi 1997; Won 1986) to model the gas dissolution in kerogen. The kerogen is believed to be similar to bitumen or solid heavy oil (Mehrabi et al. 2017; Jin and Firoozabadi 2016; Yang et al. 2016). According to Yang et al. (2016), <b>gas</b> <b>dissolves</b> into the organic matter just as natural <b>gas</b> <b>dissolves</b> into heavy oil and gas dissolution in the organic material (kerogen) delays the adsorption process. In Jin and Firoozabadi’s study, the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> contribution to the total sorbed gas (methane) was approximately 7 % at 4.5  MPa (Jin and Firoozabadi 2016), which is much smaller than the value reported by Etminan et al. (2014). They also reported an approximately linear relationship between the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> volume and pressure. Divided by the total organic content (TOC) values, the normalized <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> volume was obtained and the slopes of the normalized <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> volume with respect to pressure for different samples are the same. Mehrabi et al. (2017) fully reviewed the studies related to <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> and established a model for simulating gas flow in non-circular pores. Their results supported the significance of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> in shale reservoir production. Heller and Zoback (2014) measured the volumetric swelling strain due to sorption as a function of pressure. In their studies, the volumetric swelling strain is approximately linearly proportional to pressure, especially for methane. All in all, we assume the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> volume is approximately linearly proportional to pressure, which can be formulated by the Henry equation.|$|R

When one is suddenly wrecked or meets a tsunami, one is instantly drowned and cannot breathe under water. To avoid this crisis, when we meet waves, the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> separated from water by wave is used, while air can be used to breathe when we are about to escape from water. In this thesis, we investigated the separation characteristics of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> using the pipe type of hollow fiber membrane with polypropylene and the nude type of one with polysulfone. The hollow fiber membranes with good characteristics under water are used to separate the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas.</b> The hollow fiber membranes with good characteristics in an air are used to transfer air. The combination of membranes with good separation characteristics under water and good transferring one in an air is used to breathe instantly under water to be alive at crisis.

40|$|High spill volume at dams {{can create}} {{supersaturated}} <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> conditions {{that may have}} negative effects on fish. Water spilling over Columbia and Snake River dams during {{the spring and summer}} creates plumes with high <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> that extend downstream of dam spillways and throughout reservoirs and creates gas-supersaturated conditions throughout the water column. During {{the spring and summer of}} 2000, 228 adult Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were tagged at Bonneville Dam with archival radio data storage transmitters (RDSTs) that recorded depth and water temperature as the fish migrated through dams and reservoirs of the lower Columbia and Snake rivers. Swimming depths from 131 of the 228 adult spring and summer Chinook salmon tagged with RDSTs were used to estimate the potential for gas bubble formation given in-river <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> concentrations and hydrostatic compensation. We found that adult spring and summer Chinook salmon spent a majority of the time at depths that would have provided adequate hydrostatic compensation for in-river <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> conditions during this study, which were at or slightly below long-term averages.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Understanding the {{processes}} involved in the transport of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> plumes in groundwater aquifers is essential for comprehending the effect that these transport processes can have on site characterization and remedial design applications. Previous laboratory and field {{studies have indicated that}} <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> transport in groundwater can be greatly affected by the presence of even small amounts of trapped gas in the pore space of an aquifer. Recently, Fry et al. (1995) reported an increase in retardation factors R (where R=pore water velocity/dissolved <b>gas</b> velocity) for <b>dissolved</b> oxygen with increasing amounts of trapped gas. Fry showed that the retardation factor for a <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> can be predicted using a relationship between the dimensionless Henry's Law constant for the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas,</b> the volumetric gas content (i. e., the fraction of the total volume occupied by trapped gas), and the volumetric water content (i. e., the fraction of total volume occupied by water). In their experiments, Fry et al. (1995) found this relationship in an equilibrium model accurately predicted observed retardation factors for dissolved oxygen when the volumetric gas content was small, but underpredicted retardation factors for larger volumetric gas contents. Also, predicted breakthrough curves for dissolved oxygen obtained by incorporating this relationship into the advection-dispersion equation did not match the shape of experimentally observed breakthrough curves. The experimental curves were asymmetrical with long tails indicating that the local equilibrium assumption is inaccurate and suggesting that mass transfer of oxygen between the aqueous and trapped gas phases is diffusion limited. In an effort to gain further understanding of this process, a kinetic model was developed for <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> transport that includes a diffusion type expression for the rate of gas transfer between the mobile aqueous and trapped gas phases. The model was tested in a series of transport experiments conducted in sand packed columns with varying amounts and composition of trapped gas. The kinetic model was found to better fit the shape of dissolved oxygen breakthrough and elution curves than the equilibrium model of Fry et al. (1995). This model was then extended to the case of two-dimensions to simulate <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> transport in the presence of trapped gas under conditions that approximate injection and extraction wells used to distribute <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> in an aquifer (e. g. to promote in situ bioremediation processes or to perform a <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> tracer test). We then compared these predicted concentrations with measured concentrations obtained in a series of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> transport experiments in a large-scale physical aquifer model using two <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> (oxygen and hydrogen) with very different physical properties. The model could accurately fit the development and movement of these plumes providing that key parameters, the amount of trapped gas and the effective mass transfer coefficient, were adjusted between the injection and drift stages...|$|R
