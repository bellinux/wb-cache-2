Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil.

The selection of geometric shape and size of sinusoidal cores to meet given design requirements is critical in efficient applications of sandwich structures, and their <b>effective</b> transverse <b>shear</b> stiffness properties are important material properties in analysis and design.

5000|$|Vegetation {{influences}} {{slope stability}} by removing water through transpiration. Transpiration is the vaporisation of liquid water contained in plant tissue and the vapour removal to the air. Water is drawn {{up from the}} roots and transported through the plant up to the leaves. [...] The major effect of transpiration is the reduction of soil pore water pressures which counteracts the loss of strength which occurs through wetting, this is most readily seen as a loss of moisture around trees. However {{it is not easy}} to rely on tree and shrub roots to remove water from slopes and consequently help ensure slope stability. The ability to transpire in wet conditions is severely reduced and therefore any increase in soil strength previously gained in evaporation and transpiration will be lost or significantly reduced, consequently the effects of transpiration cannot be taken into account at these times. However it can be assumed that the chance of slope failure following saturation by storm event or periods of extended rainfall will be lessened as a result of transpiration. Moreover, although changes in moisture content will affect the undrained shear strength, the <b>effective</b> <b>shear</b> stress parameters as commonly used in routine slope stability analysis are not directly influenced by changing moisture content, although the water pressures (suctions) used in the analysis will change.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of an {{external magnetic field}} on the static shear strain and the <b>effective</b> <b>shear</b> modulus of a magnetoactive elastomer (MAE) is studied theoretically {{in the framework of}} a recently introduced approach to the single-particle magnetostriction mechanism [V. M. Kalita et al, Phys. Rev. E 93, 062503 (2016) ]. The planar problem of magnetostriction in an MAE with soft magnetic inclusions {{in the form of a}} thin disk (platelet) having the magnetic anisotropy in the plane of this disk is solved analytically. An external magnetic field acts with torques on magnetic filler particles, creates mechanical stresses in the vicinity of inclusions, induces shear strain and increases the <b>effective</b> <b>shear</b> modulus of these composite materials. It is shown that the largest effect of the magnetic field on the <b>effective</b> <b>shear</b> modulus should be expected in MAEs with soft elastomer matrices, where the shear modulus of the matrix is less than the magnetic anisotropy constant of inclusions. It is derived that the <b>effective</b> <b>shear</b> modulus is non-linearly dependent on the external magnetic field and approaches the saturation value in magnetic fields exceeding the field of particle anisotropy. It is shown that model calculations of the <b>effective</b> <b>shear</b> modulus correspond to a phenomenological definition of effective elastic moduli and magnetoelastic coupling constants. Obtained theoretical results compare well with known experimental data. Determination of effective elastic coefficients in MAEs and their dependence on magnetic field is discussed. The concentration dependence of the <b>effective</b> <b>shear</b> modulus at higher filler concentrations has been estimated using the method of Padé approximants, which correctly predicts that both the absolute and relative changes of the magnetic-field dependent <b>effective</b> <b>shear</b> modulus will significantly increase with the growing concentration of filler particles.

40|$|Roughness {{elements}} at {{the soil}} surface (e. g. crop residues, rock fragments, vegetation, geotextiles) strongly reduce the erosivity of overland flow (both interrill and concentrated overland flow) and hence soil detachment rates. Common methods for shear stress partitioning that allow the calculation of <b>effective</b> flow <b>shear</b> stress {{in the presence of}} roughness elements originate from river hydraulics but seem invalid for overland flow. An alternative method to estimate the <b>effective</b> flow <b>shear</b> stress {{in the presence of a}} soil surface cover has been presented and tested for soil detachment by concentrated runoff on soil surfaces covered by crop residues by Knapen et al., (2008). In this method, the estimation of <b>effective</b> flow <b>shear</b> stress is based on the recalculation of the hydraulic radius for covered soil surfaces using flow hydraulics on uncovered surfaces. However, the applicability of this method for roughness elements different from crop residues and under field conditions needs to be tested to confirm its validity. Therefore, runoff data from three experimental studies (conducted on geotextile and grassed-covered soil surfaces) are analysed in this study. The results show that <b>effective</b> flow <b>shear</b> stress, calculated using this method, is not only a good soil detachment predictor for soil surfaces covered with crop residues but also for the tested soil surfaces with a vegetation or geotextile cover. However, the geotextile experiments point to one of the shortcomings of the method. At high flow shear stress levels, vortex erosion due to flow turbulence is reported for the thickest geotextiles. These flow turbulences are not accounted for since the method is based on average flow characteristics. status: publishe...|$|R
