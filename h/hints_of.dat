5|$|Variations {{are known}} to occur; in north-west Africa, the uppersides of the forewing and hindwing are darker, with <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> greenish or greyish brown. Similarly-coloured races occur in Spain, Elba, Crete, and other eastern Mediterranean islands. T. acteon christi, endemic to the Canary Islands, {{displays}} colour variations, with the uppersides of the forewing showing defined yellow–orange markings.|$|E
5|$|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} rewrite {{of the abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E
5|$|After landfall, the cyclone {{accelerated}} in {{forward speed}} northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200UTC on October 12, Marco became an extra-tropical cyclone. It {{turned to the}} northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> the Fujiwhara effect, in which two tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other. The cold front that absorbed the weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13, though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.|$|E

5|$|Colbert dropped <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> a {{potential}} presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following {{the release of}} his book, I Am America (And So Can You!), which was rumored (invariably by Colbert himself) to {{be a sign that}} he was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the White House. Colbert staunchly refused to confirm or deny his candidacy, stating he had not yet made up his mind and must first talk the possibility over with his family.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{eagerness to}} start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> spring. He was ready to leave on 15October, but was held up by the weather {{for a few more}} days. On 19October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the glory of a historical event and attempted to convey <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited it rather than Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s. This pitched Odontogriphus {{into the middle of the}} debate about whether Wiwaxia was closer to the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in a frank exchange of views.|$|E
5|$|In Cold Blood is a 3D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a direct control interface, the player guides John Cord's movements with a keyboard or gamepad. Cord must collect objects {{that can be}} used with other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world to solve puzzles and progress in the game. Cord can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. Action scenes are also included.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{between the end of}} the Italo-Turkish War in 1912 and Italy's entry into the First World War in 1915, Amalfi is {{mentioned}} in several news accounts that offer <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> her peace-time activities. In June 1913, Amalfi escorted King Victor Emmanuel III and his wife, Queen Elena, on the royal yacht Trinacria to the annual regatta at Kiel, Germany. While there, Victor Emmanuel met with Kaiser Wilhelm II, to discuss—it was speculated in a contemporary news report—the ongoing Balkan War. After departing from Kiel, Amalfi escorted the King and Queen on Trinacria to their next stop at Stockholm.|$|E

5|$|NGC 821 is an E6 {{elliptical}} galaxy. It {{is unusual}} {{because it has}} <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> an early spiral structure, which is normally only found in lenticular and spiral galaxies. NGC 821 is 2.6 by 2.0 arcminutes and has a visual magnitude of 11.3. Its diameter is 61,000 light-years and it is 80 million light-years away. Another unusual galaxy in Aries is Segue 2. Segue 2 is a dwarf galaxy that is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, recently discovered to be a potential relic of the epoch of reionization.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation brought {{changes in}} outlook and artistic {{expression}} as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery {{was shown in}} a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background. Pieter Bruegel the Elder, {{one of the few}} who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his genre scenes were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> nationalism.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Diermot's {{movements and}} actions with a mouse or a gamepad. Diermot {{can pick up}} various objects; these can then be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. He can also engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> {{what needs to be}} done to solve the puzzles or progress the plot. A few simple action-oriented battle scenes are also included.|$|E

5|$|The story {{starts out}} as a fairly {{conventional}} adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange and hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from Jeremiah N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on the potential autobiographical elements as well as <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> racism and the symbolism in the final lines of the work.|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword: The Angel of Death uses both a {{point and}} click and direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's {{movements}} with a mouse or keyboard, and Nicole Collard {{is also a}} playable character in selected portions of the game. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in the first three Broken Sword games, the death of the player character is possible in The Angel of Death.|$|E
5|$|Designs for {{the asylum}} {{departed}} from comic interpretations {{of a large}} mansion and instead developed an entire island, with <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> Alcatraz prison, composed of multiple buildings to allow for greater variety and exploration. Each building was designed with a different architectural style to make the facility appear believable and to imbue each location with a history. The medical building was inspired by Victorian architecture and its metalwork structure was intended to inspire feelings of horror. The intensive treatment unit has a Gothic, industrial aesthetic. The catacombs beneath the facility, inspired by early twentieth-century brickwork and Victorian industry, were meant to feel oppressive. The maximum security area was designed to feel claustrophobic and was retrofitted like a bunker, and the Arkham mansion displays a High Gothic style. The designers integrated crooked lines into environmental objects, such as trees and drainpipes, where possible. 40 rooms, 34 corridors, 3 exterior areas, and 3 Scarecrow-induced hallucination areas were designed for the game.|$|E

5|$|Females {{have the}} same plumage pattern as males, though with {{somewhat}} duller colouration. The female has a grey head; buff supercilium, chin, and throat; black and warm brown upperparts; and off-white underparts. The bill of the female is pale yellow with the tip and cutting edge of mandible dusky. Juveniles are dull grey with a brown back, a pale yellow supercilium, and a pale horn bill. Females and juveniles have <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> chestnut on their supercilium, shoulders, and throat, by which they may be distinguished from other sparrows, such as the Kenya sparrow and the other rufous sparrows, which are common {{in much of the}} chestnut sparrow's range; or the house sparrow, which also occurs in parts of its range.|$|E
5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few <b>hints,</b> <b>of</b> which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).|$|E
5|$|Little {{evidence}} exists of Roman {{influence on the}} Quantock region beyond isolated finds and <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> transient forts. A Roman port was at Combwich, {{and it is possible}} that a Roman road ran from there to the Quantocks, because the names Nether Stowey and Over Stowey come from the Old English stan wey, meaning stone way. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th-century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century, and eight miliarense and 671siliqua dating to 337–367AD. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany and Rome.|$|E
