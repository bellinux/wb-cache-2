50|$|Organizations {{such as the}} Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation {{challenged}} the Clipper chip proposal, saying {{that it would have}} the effect not only of subjecting citizens to increased and possibly illegal government surveillance, but that the strength of the Clipper chip's encryption could not be evaluated by the public as its design was classified secret, and that therefore individuals and businesses might be hobbled with an insecure communications system. Further, it was pointed out that while American companies could be forced to use the Clipper chip in their encryption products, foreign companies could not, and presumably phones with strong data encryption would be manufactured abroad and spread throughout the world and into the United States, negating the point of the whole exercise, and, of course, materially <b>damaging</b> <b>U.S.</b> manufacturers en route.

Letting the bad guys know that we can eavesdrop on them, they don't know that?
