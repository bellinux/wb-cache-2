500|$|Gillian Anderson's {{character}} Dana Scully {{would not}} be available, since the writing staff had decided before the episode was written that she would spend {{most of her time}} in the hospital. As the writing staff had a hard time coming up with a story, Spotnitz saw {{this as an opportunity to}} further evolve Doggett, the new character introduced at the beginning of the eighth season. In order to fill Anderson's void, two recurring groups of characters were brought in: Walter Skinner and The Lone Gunmen. Spotnitz noted that, [...] "we were eager to get Skinner out from behind the desk, and we were always looking for opportunities to get him out of that office and get him into the field." [...] Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, was pleased with the final product. He later complimented the work of Robert Patrick, who played Doggett, saying, [...] "It was a big hole when Mulder was gone, but I thought that Robert came in and <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> job. He brought a really good energy to the set, and it was a lot of fun getting to know and work with him." [...] In addition, Spotnitz was also eager to use The Lone Gunmen in the episode, since this the episode would mark their first scene together with Doggett. [...] Robert Patrick called the episode his [...] "favorite episode," [...] because the writers saw a chance to really create a [...] "vulnerable" [...] moment for the his character, John Doggett.|$|E

[...] Susan Stark of The Detroit News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A fat green ogre with a grouchy disposition and worse manners, Shrek {{is the sort of}} unlikely hero that nobody could love -- except just about everyone who sees this hip and hilarious animated delight." [...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication." [...] Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it [...] "a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of Shrek." [...] William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating [...] "We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, 'What has Hollywood done to it?' But we loved it. We were afraid it would be too sickeningly cute and, instead, Bill just thought they <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful,</b> witty job of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once the game's {{tone and}} style was established, Schyman worked off {{specific}} requests from the audio director for individual pieces of music. Kamper recalled that [...] " [...] really, really <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> job" [...] with molding {{the music to}} fit Kamper and Thomas' intended mood and tones; the results, such as the music for the Pauper's Drop level, being different from {{anything else in the}} first game. [...] To test how the music worked for each part of the game, Kamper would send Schyman video footage of the game, which would then be appraised with the new score to see how well it fit. Kamper split some of Schyman's tracks to use as leitmotivs; the opening track of Eleanor and Delta together was split in later renditions, using the deeper cello for Delta's and the violin for Eleanor. The score was recorded with a 60-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at Capitol Studios.|$|E

Yates spoke {{of the decision to}} appoint him {{as the director of the}} final films, remarking that [...] "they wanted to do a Harry Potter that felt ... more grown up. What's smart about the studio and the producers is they have always wanted to push it a bit. Chris Columbus <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> job of casting and making this world incredibly popular. But rather than do more of the same, they said, 'Let's bring in Alfonso Cuarón and let him run with it. Then later, let's bring in David Yates, who's done all this hard-hitting stuff on TV.' It's a testament to their ambition to try to keep the franchise fresh. The bizarre thing is, I did one [...] and they asked me to stay for three more, so obviously they liked something." ...|$|E
