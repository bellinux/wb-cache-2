Thus, ~99% of Earth's internal heat loss at the surface is by conduction through the crust, and mantle convection is the dominant control on heat transport from deep within the Earth. Most of the heat flow from the thicker continental crust is attributed to internal radiogenic sources, in contrast the thinner oceanic crust has only 2% internal radiogenic heat. The remaining heat flow at the surface would be due to basal heating of the crust from mantle convection.

During typical German summer conditions with less than 160 hours outside air temperatures above 25 °C these buildings perform excellently during summer, even if the internal loads are rather high. If ambient air temperatures are significantly higher like in summer 2003 with more than 3 K higher average temperatures, nearly 10 % of all office hours are above 26 °C. Detailed measurements showed that the night discharging of heavy thermal masses such as concrete ceilings was not very effective under free convection conditions, although night air changes were always above 5 h- 1.

The <b>earth</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger installed at a low depth of 1. 2 Â m has an excellent electrical cooling coefficient of performance of 18, but with an average cooling power of about 1. 5 Â kW does not contribute significantly to cooling load removal. Mechanical night ventilation with 2 air changes also delivered cold at a good coefficient of performance of 6 with 14 Â kW maximum power.

40|$|AbstractQuantifying the emergy {{baseline}} of the Earth is {{a practical}} necessity for emergy evaluations, because {{it serves as a}} unified basis for determining transformities of the available energy storages and flows of the geobiosphere. The current debate over the value and significance of the planetary baseline has been in progress since 1998, when the author first brought new data on geopotential energy formation in the world oceans to H. T. Odum's attention. In this paper, past studies of the baseline were reviewed and errors in data translation and model formulation were found to be sufficient to justify a new calculation. A fundamental epistemological obstacle to establishing a unified planetary baseline (i. e., the production functions for deep <b>Earth</b> <b>heat</b> and tide as a function of solar radiation are unknown) is overcome by using the transitive property of equalities to estimate equivalences between solar radiation and Earth's deep heat exergy flows (4200 solar equivalent joules per joule, seJJ⿿ 1) and between the exergy of solar radiation and the tidal exergy dissipated in the oceans (35, 400 seJJ⿿ 1). At present, the planetary baseline for the Earth with its ice-covered, polar oceans is approximately 1. 16 ÿ 1025 seJy⿿ 1 and the distribution of the emergy or the organizing power of the inputs is: 1 / 3 solar radiation, 1 / 3 deep <b>Earth</b> <b>heat</b> and 1 / 3 tidal geopotential energy. In addition, the planetary baseline has been remarkably stable over the past 555, 000, 000 y (1. 00 ÿ 1025 ± 1. 13 ÿ 1024 seJy⿿ 1 or within ± 11 %). The tidal exergy dissipated in the world oceans over this time varies from 31 % to 155 % of its present value largely due to the changing efficiency of the Earth as a ⿿machine⿿ for generating tidal exergy. Close correspondence of the value and properties of this new baseline with the principles of Energy Systems Theory indicates that it should be preferred over prior determinations...|$|E
