5|$|Richard Wesley <b>Hamming</b> (February 11, 1915 – January 7, 1998) was an American {{mathematician}} {{whose work}} had many implications for computer engineering and telecommunications. His contributions include the <b>Hamming</b> code (which {{makes use of}} a <b>Hamming</b> matrix), the <b>Hamming</b> window, <b>Hamming</b> numbers, sphere-packing (or <b>Hamming</b> bound), and the <b>Hamming</b> distance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hamming</b> {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept {{of the number of}} positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the <b>Hamming</b> distance. <b>Hamming</b> thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called <b>Hamming</b> codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.|$|E

5|$|Returning to {{differential}} equations, <b>Hamming</b> studied {{means of}} numerically integrating them. A popular approach {{at the time}} was Milne's Method, attributed to Arthur Milne. This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions the result could be swamped by roundoff noise. <b>Hamming</b> developed an improved version, the <b>Hamming</b> predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method. He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the <b>Hamming</b> window, and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, Digital Filters (1977).|$|E
5|$|Richard Wesley <b>Hamming</b> {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, on February 11, 1915, the son of Richard J. <b>Hamming,</b> a credit manager,and Mabel G. Redfield. He grew up in Chicago, where he {{attended}} Crane Technical High School and Crane Junior College.|$|E

40|$|Influence of raw <b>ham</b> weight, {{trimming}} {{form and}} pressing on seasoning weight loss of Istrian dry-cured <b>hams</b> were studied. Swine thighs were shaped traditionally with skin and subcutaneous fat removed. The pelvis bones {{were left in}} the <b>ham</b> (B <b>hams)</b> or experimentally deboned (boneless or BL <b>hams).</b> After trimming the raw <b>hams</b> were weighted and classified into the weight classes. The <b>hams</b> were pressed after dry salting with different loads. High seasoning weight loss (46. 31 %) of Istrian <b>hams</b> was expected due to raw <b>ham</b> skinning. However, deboning had no influence on differences in seasoning weight loss. Significantly higher weight loss of light class <b>hams</b> suggest to use raw <b>hams</b> heavier than 10 kg and 9 kg after B and BL dressing, respectively. There was no significant press load effect on seasoning weight loss...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{questions}} of the present meat products market, meat products quality and the relevant legislation with focus on steamed <b>ham.</b> According to the present legislation <b>ham</b> {{is divided into three}} categories based on the content of pure muscle protein. The categories are as follows: top-grade quality <b>ham,</b> choice <b>ham</b> and standard <b>ham.</b> Use of starch, food colouring ingredients, fibrous additives, vegetable protein and different animal protein is not allowed with top-grade quality <b>ham</b> and choice <b>ham.</b> Within the practical part of the diploma work twenty samples of <b>ham</b> from all categories were examined. The tests showed that starch was not added to any top-grade quality <b>ham</b> or choice <b>ham.</b> Starch was found only in two samples of standard <b>ham,</b> in which starch addition is allowed by legislation...|$|R
50|$|The {{duration}} of the curing process varies {{by the type of}} <b>ham,</b> with Serrano <b>ham</b> curing in 9-12 months, Parma <b>hams</b> taking more than 12 months, and Iberian <b>ham</b> taking up to 2 years to reach the desired flavour characteristics. Some dry cured <b>hams,</b> such as the Jinhua <b>ham,</b> take approximately 8 to 10 months to complete.|$|R
5|$|There {{also exist}} {{algorithms}} for finding two satisfying assignments {{that have the}} maximal <b>Hamming</b> distance from each other.|$|E
5|$|In later life, <b>Hamming</b> became {{interested}} in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, {{when he left the}} Bell labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, the City College of New York, the University of California at Irvine and Princeton University. As a Young Turk, <b>Hamming</b> had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed {{in the first half of}} his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.|$|E
5|$|The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign awarded <b>Hamming</b> his Doctor of Philosophy in 1942, and {{he became}} an Instructor in Mathematics there. He married Wanda Little, a fellow student, on September 5, 1942, {{immediately}} after she was awarded her own Master of Arts in English literature. They would remain married until his death, but had no children. In 1944, he became an Assistant Professor at the J.B. Speed Scientific School at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|Turkey <b>ham</b> is {{produced}} from turkey meat such as cured turkey thigh meat and other {{meat from the}} animals, which can be machine-deboned. Contrary to the product's name, turkey <b>ham</b> products do not contain any <b>ham</b> or pork products. Some turkey <b>ham</b> products are manufactured with added water, which adds moisture and weight, and some include binders, which serves to bind the moisture and fat in the meat to improve texture. Turkey <b>ham</b> is sometimes flavored to resemble the flavor of <b>ham.</b> Turkey <b>ham</b> typically has a 5 percent fat content, and some turkey <b>hams</b> are produced as fat-free. Turkey <b>hams</b> are typically produced in two sizes, whole and half-sized.|$|R

25|$|In telecommunication, a <b>Hamming</b> code is {{a linear}} error-correcting code. <b>Hamming</b> codes can detect {{up to two}} {{simultaneous}} bit errors, and correct single-bit errors; thus, reliable communication is possible when the <b>Hamming</b> distance between the transmitted and received bit patterns is {{less than or equal}} to one. By contrast, the simple parity code cannot correct errors, and can only detect an odd number of errors. <b>Hamming</b> codes are of fundamental importance in coding theory and remain of practical use in modern computer design. <b>Hamming</b> codes were invented in 1950 by Richard <b>Hamming</b> at Bell Labs.|$|E

5000|$|Pigs {{are part}} of the mixed farming economy. Traditionally every farm kept a pig as part of the staple diet. During the winter, the main source of meat was cured <b>ham</b> and bacon from pigs raised on the farm. <b>Hams</b> were cured in the large {{chimneys}} of farm kitchens, which slowly dried the <b>ham</b> and bacon after it had been salted. This tradition has largely died out, but the remaining producers make <b>hams</b> which are similar to Bayonne, Serrano, or Parma <b>hams.</b> Freshly cured <b>ham</b> is sliced for grilling, older <b>ham</b> is boiled as a York <b>ham,</b> and <b>ham</b> cured for many months is sliced wafer thin, like Parma <b>ham.</b> Carmarthen <b>ham</b> has a similar delicious farmyard flavour. The hocks have the greatest flavour, and need to be boiled a long time to soften the meat. They make a good base for winter stew, or a summer ‘paysanne’ salad. Dry-cured Carmarthen <b>Ham</b> can be found at Carmarthen Market. Five generations of the Rees family have sold <b>ham</b> here [...] spanning 200 years. and their family were the first commercial producers of dry-cured <b>ham</b> in Britain. Carmarthen <b>Ham</b> is dry salt-cured and then air dried and sold whole boneless, or sliced thinly and vacuum packed. Legend has it that when the Romans settled in Carmarthen they stole the recipe and on their return to Italy called it Parma <b>Ham.</b> The <b>ham</b> is cut in thin wafers and is served like prosciutto or Parma <b>ham,</b> but is saltier. Carmarthen <b>Ham</b> production remains a cottage industry, in order to keep it a premium product. Carmarthen <b>Ham</b> is a particular favourite of the Prince of Wales. The Rees family also produce a short back and streaky bacon. This is dry-cured for one week and hung for a further three weeks. It is recommended that the bacon is blanched before frying to remove any excess salt. The Rees family have more than 80 <b>hams</b> curing at any one time, and it takes nine months to cure [...] they also have a mail order business and travel to the nearby markets of Brecon, Fishguard, Haverfordwest, Pembroke and Cardigan. Recipes for Carmarthen <b>ham</b> include: ‘Country <b>Ham</b> with Vegetable Stew’, ‘Pancakes stuffed with Carmarthen <b>Ham</b> and Wild Mushrooms with a savoury Custard’, and ‘Salad Paysanne with Carmarthen <b>Ham</b> and Lentils,’ and ‘Carmarthen <b>Ham</b> in Beer’ [...] Carmarthenshire <b>Ham</b> has featured on Rick Stein’s “Food Heroes” [...] The Welsh chef Dudley recommends pork wrapped in Carmarthenshire <b>ham</b> [...] At the Royal Welsh Show 2010, Carmarthenshire <b>Ham</b> was included in the new European Protected Food names initiative for Protective Geographical Indication (PGI) status, which would give European Union legal status to Carmarthenshire <b>Ham.</b>|$|R

The Tianjin Meat United Processing Factory in Tianjin, China, produces Yingbin brand <b>ham</b> sausage in contemporary times. G.A. Müller and Könecke are German companies that produce a <b>ham</b> sausage called Schinken Bockwurst (English: <b>ham</b> bockwurst) and other sausage products in contemporary times.

25|$|Sphere packing on {{the corners}} of a {{hypercube}} (with the spheres defined by <b>Hamming</b> distance) corresponds to designing error-correcting codes: if the spheres have radius t, then their centers are codewords of a (2t+1)-error-correcting code. Lattice packings correspond to linear codes. There are other, subtler relationships between Euclidean sphere packing and error-correcting codes. For example, the binary Golay code {{is closely related to}} the 24-dimensional Leech lattice.|$|E
25|$|There is {{more than}} one upper bound on the {{achievable}} code rate of linear block codes for multiple phased-burst correction (MPBC). One such bound is constrained to a maximum correctable cyclic burst length within every subblock, or equivalently a constraint on the minimum error free length or gap within every phased-burst. This bound, when reduced to the special case of a bound for single burst correction, is the Abramson bound (a corollary of the <b>Hamming</b> bound for burst-error correction) when the cyclic burst length is less than half the block length.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the James {{brothers}} {{joined with}} Cole Younger {{and his brothers}} John, Jim and Bob, as well as Clell Miller and other former Confederates, to form {{what came to be}} known as the James–Younger Gang.

40|$|MADS-box genes play an {{important}} role in plant ontogeny, particularly, in the regulation of floral organ induction and development. Eight full-length cDNAs of <b>HAM</b> genes (Helianthus annuus MADS) have been isolated from sunflower. They encode MADS-box transcription factors expressed in inflorescence tissues. In the frames of the ABCDE model, the <b>HAM</b> proteins were classified according to their structural homology to known MADS-box transcription factors. The <b>HAM</b> 45 and <b>HAM</b> 59 genes encode the homeotic C function and are involved in the control of the identity of pistil and stamens, while the <b>HAM</b> 75 and <b>HAM</b> 92 genes determine the A function and identity of floral and inflorescence meristems and petal identity. The <b>HAM</b> 31, <b>HAM</b> 2, <b>HAM</b> 63, and <b>HAM</b> 91 genes encode the B function and are involved in the formation of petals and stamens; and the <b>HAM</b> 137 gene encodes the E function.
