Wall, Commonwealth's Attorney for Harrison County, was the prosecutor, {{assisted}} by Fleming County Commonwealth's Attorney (and future Congressman) John Chambers and Martin P. Marshall. Rowan, {{who had just}} been elected to the U.S. Senate, was Desha's primary defense counsel, assisted by the governor's Secretary of State (and later U.S. Senator) William T. Barry, former Congressman William Brown, T. P. Taul, and James Crawford. It took two days to <b>empanel</b> a jury. Witness testimony consumed the next week, and Governor Desha attended each day of the trial. The closing statements of Rowan and Barry, both known as outstanding orators, took several days, and Chambers spoke last.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} the case led to accusations that coaches and school {{officials}} knew about the rape and failed to report it. For example, several texts entered into evidence during the trial implied that Steubenville head coach Reno Saccoccia was trying to cover for the players, which led to nationwide outrage after he received a new contract as the district's administrative services director. In response, shortly after the sentences were handed down Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced he would <b>empanel</b> a special grand jury to determine whether other crimes were committed—specifically, whether coaches and other school officials failed to report the rape even though Ohio law makes them mandated reporters.|$|E

500|$|On January 3, 1706, the Hills accused Grace Sherwood of witchcraft. [...] She {{failed to}} answer the charge in court, and on February 7, 1706, the court ordered her to appear {{on a charge of}} having bewitched Elizabeth Hill, causing a miscarriage. In March 1706 the Princess Anne County justices sought to <b>empanel</b> two juries, both made up of women. The first was ordered to search Sherwood's home for waxen or baked figures that might {{indicate}} she was a witch. The second was ordered to look for [...] "demon suckling teats" [...] by examining her. In both instances, reluctance {{on the part of the}} local residents made it difficult to form a jury and both juries refused to carry out the searches. On March 7, 1706, Sherwood was examined by a jury of 12 [...] "ancient and knowing women" [...] appointed to look for markings on her body that might be brands of the Devil. They discovered two [...] "marks not like theirs or like those of any other woman". The forewoman of this jury was the same Elizabeth Barnes who had previously accused Sherwood of witchcraft.|$|E

2500|$|On October 25, 2006, {{just two}} weeks before Election Day, The New York Times {{reported}} that federal authorities had opened an inquiry into the case.

2500|$|The {{government}}, in asserting eminent domain, {{must pay}} the owner the {{fair market value}} of that land. If the government takes {{only part of the}} property, it must pay both the value of the land that was taken, plus any decrease in the market value of the remaining portion (called the [...] "residue"). A person who contests the value assessed for such a taking is entitled to <b>empanel</b> a committee of jurors to determine the fair value. A resident can also seek compensation for damage to the value of real property arising out of government activity through an action for inverse condemnation. The immunity to suit generally enjoyed by local governments does not apply to such actions, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as incorporated by the Supreme Court.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, the tribunals {{themselves}} are {{modeled after the}} procedures—AR 190-8 Tribunals—the military uses to make determinations {{in compliance with the}} Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention (that states [...] "Should any doubt arise as to whether persons, having committed a belligerent act and having fallen {{into the hands of the}} enemy, belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.") This is most likely because, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, a plurality of the Supreme Court suggested the Department of Defense <b>empanel</b> tribunals similar to the AR 190 to make factual status determinations. The mandate of the CSRTs and the AR 190-8 Tribunals differed in that AR 190-8 Tribunals were authorized to determine that captives were civilians, who should be released, and [...] "lawful combatants", who the Geneva Conventions protect from prosecution.|$|E

The study is based on a primary survey of 1, 204 CGHS and 640 ECHS principal beneficiaries, 100 <b>empanelled</b> private healthcare providers and 100 officials of the schemes across 12 Indian cities. We have found that patients are reasonably well satisfied with the healthcare services of both <b>empanelled</b> private healthcare providers and the dispensaries-polyclinics but are relatively more satisfied with the former than the latter. We also found that beneficiaries are willing to pay more for better quality services. Though the schemes provide comprehensive healthcare services, the beneficiaries incur some out-of- pocket health expenditure while seeking healthcare. Furthermore, beneficiaries are not in favour of the recent proposal to replace the schemes with health insurance for several reasons. The <b>empanelled</b> private healthcare providers are dissatisfied with the terms and conditions of empanelment, especially the low tariffs for their services as compared to prevailing market rates and the delays in reimbursements from the schemes. We suggest that appropriate efforts be undertaken to enhance the quality of healthcare service provided in the dispensaries-polyclinics of the CGHS and ECHS as well as to address the issues and concerns of <b>empanelled</b> private healthcare providers to ensure better healthcare delivery and for a long-term, sustainable public-private partnership.
