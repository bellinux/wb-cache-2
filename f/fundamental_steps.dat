5|$|This Case further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the incandescent electric light bulb from the <b>fundamental</b> <b>steps</b> shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among these were some Diehl's induction lamps for use with alternating current. A description of how this technology worked is that of a secondary coil of wire was placed inside the bulb of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound {{on the outside of the}} glass bulb. This coil was connected to an alternating current electrical power supply. The secondary coil inside the bulb would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil and provide an electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of alternating current technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of the lamps that were in this display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>steps</b> in the fusion process, {{although}} {{each of these}} steps actually represents a complex sequence of events. First, the involved membranes must aggregate, approaching each other to within several nanometers. Second, the two bilayers must come into very close contact (within a few angstroms). To achieve this close contact, the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated, as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel at this distance. Third, a destabilization must develop at one point between the two bilayers, inducing a highly localized rearrangement of the two bilayers. Finally, as this point defect grows, {{the components of the}} two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact. Depending on whether hemifusion or full fusion occurs, the internal contents of the membranes may mix at this point as well.|$|E

500|$|There {{are four}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>steps</b> in the fusion process. First, the {{involved}} membranes must aggregate, approaching {{each other to}} within several nanometers. Second, the two bilayers must come into very close contact (within a few angstroms). To achieve this close contact, the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated, as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel. The presence of ions, in particular divalent cations like magnesium and calcium, strongly affects this step. One of the critical roles of calcium in the body is regulating membrane fusion. Third, a destabilization must form at one point between the two bilayers, locally distorting their structures. The exact nature of this distortion is not known. One theory is that a highly curved [...] "stalk" [...] must form between the two bilayers. Proponents of this theory believe that it explains why phosphatidylethanolamine, a highly curved lipid, promotes fusion. Finally, in the last step of fusion, this point defect grows and {{the components of the}} two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{institutional}} design of communism implemented by Joseph Stalin in the Eastern Bloc (see Stalinism), subsequent development varied across countries. [...] In satellite states, after peace treaties were initially concluded, opposition was essentially liquidated, <b>fundamental</b> <b>steps</b> toward socialism were enforced and Kremlin leaders sought to strengthen control therein. While communism {{came to power}} in the Soviet Union following a class civil war presumably won by the working class, of some embarrassment to the ruling regimes was that, {{in the rest of the}} Eastern Bloc, it came to power with the occupation of the Red Army. What emerged is what Hungarian communist László Rajk (who was later executed) called [...] "a dictatorship of the proletariat without the Soviet form," [...] a [...] "people's democracy." [...] The defining characteristic of communism implemented therein was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable spheres. [...] Initially, Stalin directed systems that rejected Western institutional characteristics of market economies, democratic governance (dubbed [...] "bourgeois democracy" [...] in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.
