He advises Kirk that Mitchell may have to be killed before his powers develop further, but Kirk angrily disagrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} impact of aviation in the United Kingdom is increasing due to the increasing demand for air travel in the country. In the past 25 years the UK air transport industry has seen sustained growth, {{and the demand for}} passenger air travel in particular is forecast to increase more than twofold, to 465 million passengers, by 2030. Two airports; London Heathrow Airport and London Gatwick Airport, are amongst the top ten busiest airports in the world for international passenger traffic. Whilst {{more than half of all}} passengers travelling by air in the UK currently travel via the five London area airports, regional airports <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> most growth in recent years, due to the success of 'no-frills' airlines over the last decade.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans, or children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E

Agoraphobia, as described in this manner, is actually a symptom professionals check when making a diagnosis of panic disorder. Other syndromes like obsessive compulsive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder can also cause agoraphobia.

The medusa population is reestablished by syphistomae strobilation when conditions are favorable for strobilation and medusae again.|$|E

25|$|Advaita also posits {{the fourth}} state of Turiya, which some {{describe}} as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness. Turiya {{is the state}} of liberation, where states Advaita school, one experiences the infinite (ananta) and non-different (advaita/abheda), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which ajativada, non-origination, is apprehended. According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all prevading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent in all things and transcendent. Those who <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> Turiya stage of self-consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with everyone and everything, for them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the Jivanmukta.|$|E
25|$|William M'Culloch (1691 – 18 December 1771) was Minister of Cambuslang {{during the}} {{extraordinary}} {{events of the}} Cambuslang Work (1742) when 30,000 people gathered in the hillsides near his church for preaching and communion. Many were there struck by their own depravity and horrified at the probable punishment after death. Trembling, wailing, great pain, nose-bleeding and other strange behaviour was followed in some cases by striking conversions when they suddenly felt accepted by Christ. This gave rise to great rejoicing and singing. It was later calculated that about 400 people had been converted, though many had backslided. The Reverend M’Culloch was a strange person {{to be at the}} centre of this phenomenon — one that was being repeated in the American Colonies at the time. He was a poor preacher and claimed never to <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> strong feelings of sin or conversion that so many others had reported.|$|E

His wife went insane, his family was shunned by friends and acquaintances, and his daughter died of breast cancer. Zagali later said that it was [...] "a painful and tragic fate not only for me and my family but for thousands and thousands of such families in Albania who <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> dictatorship of Enver Hoxha".

500|$|Travel {{literature}} {{changed in}} the 1840s as steam-powered ships and trains made Continental journeys accessible to the middle class. Guidebooks and handbooks were published for this new traveller, who was unfamiliar with {{the tradition of the}} Grand Tour. The most famous of these was John Murray's Handbook for Travellers on the Continent (1836). By 1848, Murray had published 60 such works, which [...] "emphasised comprehensiveness, presenting numerous possible itineraries and including information on geology, history, and art galleries". Whereas during the Romantic period, travel writers differentiated themselves from mere tourists through the spontaneity and exuberance of their reactions, during the Victorian period, travel writers attempted to legitimise their works through a [...] "discourse of authenticity". That is, they claimed to <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> true culture of an area and their reactions to it were specifically personal, as opposed to the writers of generic guidebooks, whose response was specifically impersonal.|$|E

Series producer Jason Herbison confirmed that the theme of music would tie into the character's return. It was later confirmed that Nina returns to Erinsborough after her relationship with Jack ends. Goodrem said she understood what her character was going through, saying [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> feelings Nina is going through. I've had those moments where you question where you are going and you have to look back to know where to move forward."

30|$|In effect, {{they felt}} that concern about flood {{mitigation}} information would prepare them to face the disaster that is a perennial occurrence.

50|$|Like Strict Observance, the Swedish Rite was {{a system}} of chivalric freemasonry created by the swede Carl Frederik Eckleff during the mid-1760s. Freemasons from the lodge Kosmos in Elsinore wanted to {{introduce}} the rituals in Denmark, <b>having</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> rituals themselves in Swedish. They attained the permission of King Frederick VII, acting as grand master, and began the practice in 1852.

500|$|Three {{locations}} between Spitak and Nalband (to the west) {{that were}} within several kilometers of the fault were examined for ground disturbances and each site was scrutinized {{for the effects}} of liquefaction. The first site was on the highway that linked the three most damaged cities and was adjacent to a tributary of the Pambak river where the water table was close to the surface. The highway's embankment failed, and though the site was repaired immediately, the resulting damage to the highway caused considerable delay in getting people and supplies {{into and out of the}} area following the disaster. Numerous sand boils were seen in the region northwest of Spitak including within [...] of the failed embankment. A second site that was close to the fault, also near the Pambak river and with similar soil deposits, did not experience liquefaction, though it would <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> same high peak ground accelerations as the failed highway embankment.|$|E

500|$|Tied with Angelou's {{theme of}} racism is her {{treatment}} of the struggle and hardships experienced by her race. Neubauer analyzes two poems in Diiie, [...] "Times-Square-Shoeshine-Composition" [...] and [...] "Harlem Hopscotch", that support her assertion that for Angelou, [...] "conditions must improve for the black race". Neubauer states, [...] "Both [...] ring with a lively, invincible beat that carries defeated figures into at least momentary triumph". In [...] "Times-Squares", the narrator of the poem, a shoeshiner, takes {{on the role of}} the trickster, a common character in Black folklore. He retains his pride despite the humiliation he experiences in his occupation. [...] "Harlem Hopscotch" [...] celebrates survival and the strength, resilience, and energy necessary to accomplish it. Neubauer states, [...] "These poems are the poet's own defense against the incredible odds in the game of life". [...] According to DeGout, Angelou creates [...] "a community of healing" [...] for her readers, many of whom <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>the</b> same trauma and pain as the subjects of her poems. DeGout calls the technique [...] "part of the blues mode in the Angelou canon", and considers Angelou's work as a precursor to the Black women writers of the 1970s, who used poetry to express liberation ideology and empowerment.|$|E
