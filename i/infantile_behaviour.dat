40|$|Mental {{illness of}} one or both parents is of {{etiological}} importance in child psychopathology. Data of 281 children referred to the Baby and Toddler Consultation at the Charité University Hospital {{between the ages of}} zero to 4. 9 years has been analysed. Of those children 112 had at least one mentally ill parent. These subjects constitute the index group where as the other 169 form the control group. The psychosocial situation of the children has been assessed via the parental education, the fifth axis of the Multiaxial Classification Scheme of the ICD 10, as well as the Family Adversity Index. Infantile emotional and behavioural disorders have been measured with the Clinical Assessment Scale of Child and Adolescent Psychopathology and the parents´ questionnaire, the Child Behavior Checklist 1 ½- 5 for preschool children. The children of the index and control group were significantly different in regards to age and diagnoses in DC: 0 - 3. The children of the index group are younger at first admission and more frequently, suffer from conduct disorders. In index families, lower educational levels of the parents, more psychosocial adversities and more familiar risk factors were found. Psychopathological symptoms were more intense, e. g. treatment-requiring, in index children. Parents rate <b>infantile</b> <b>behaviour</b> problems as noticeable rather than borderline. This study shows the need for preventive counselling of parent- child-dyads in specialised institution...|$|E
40|$|The hairy elbows {{syndrome}} (HES) {{is a rare}} congenital phenotype {{characterized by}} an abnormal increase in long hairs localized on the upper limbs extensor surfaces. This feature {{is often associated with}} short stature, facial asymmetry, dysmorphisms, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and mental and speech delay. We report a case with hypertricosis cubiti associated with <b>infantile</b> spasms, <b>behaviour</b> disorders and cerebral hemisphere asymmetry. Although these findings have not been previously described we are uncertain whether they are unusual or underestimated. However, it is likely that these neurological findings are strongly interrelated leading to a more severe phenotype of the syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Bestiality is {{a serious}} but less {{commonly}} reported form of animal cruelty occurring in a society. It is a punishable sexual offence in India. Bestiality has received little attention in recent psychiatric literature, and even though case reports have been published, an elaborate psychological assessment is often missing. This case report of 18 year old male presented here highlighted the importance of psychological assessment to emphasize on its implications for the further risk assessment of the person, family psycho-education and non-pharmacological intervention for bestialists. The overall assessment suggested of absence of any brain dysfunction and active psychopathology, average intelligence (IQ) and intact cognitive functioning. The findings portrayed physical and sexual inadequacies, emotional and sexual immaturity, difficulty in emotional attachment, internalized hostility, voyeuristic tendencies and <b>infantile</b> social <b>behaviour,</b> excitement seeker, inability to delay gratification of impulses, lacks empathy, poor self-discipline, less conscientiousness and less sensitive to criticism. The report also emphasized the role {{of child sexual abuse}} on sexual behavior later life. The importance of including the topic within the community health/sexual and reproductive health education programmes was highlighted...|$|R
50|$|The debut fifteen-minute segment {{took place}} on Saturday, 9 May 1981, {{conceptualized}} as a faux terrorist takeover of the radio station with the terrorists reading out their manifesto along {{with a list of}} demands. These included: more young bands on radio and television, return of Dom mladih (Youth Center) to those it nominally belongs to - the youth, removal of older radio executives from the station, more punk on the daily radio playlists, etc. Unbridled, raw, and unscripted, the debut segment done by Nele Karajlić, Zenit Đozić, Roki, Rizo Petranović, Zlaja Arslanagić, and Saša Kontić set the tone for what was to come: juvenile <b>behaviour,</b> <b>infantile</b> jokes, raucous street energy, with occasional cogent observation hinting at deeper social issues — all seldom heard prior on the buttoned-up state-run radio in communist Yugoslavia. The only adults in the mix were the Primus host and editor Boro Kontić and his sound engineer Husein Vladavić, both of whom were present behind the scenes during the segment tapings, but did not take part in them on the microphone.|$|R
