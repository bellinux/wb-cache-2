30|$|This {{field of}} {{research}} has shown again how valuable mobile phone data could be to save lives, and potentially monitor and limit epidemics of infectious diseases.

Another shortcoming of this area of research comes from the current difficulty of gaining access to those mobile phone datasets, especially to cross-border mobility. If modeling mobility in Africa could be useful to containing the current Ebola outbreak, cross-border mobility would be very valuable data, as discussed in [165]. However, gaining access to these data is more difficult as it involves getting the approval from more than one country for a single dataset. In [166], the authors suggest guidelines to share data for humanitarian use, while preserving the privacy of users.|$|E
40|$|First paragraph: Mainstream choice {{theory is}} based on a {{complete}} map of preferences and fully known income. This is extended into the future by invoking state-contingent preferences. Under these conditions there is only one possible ‘choice’. There is perfect knowledge or its stochastic equivalent, and therefore no uncertainty. The exercise of this ‘choice’ is seen as evidence of rationality. The identification of rationality with perfect knowledge goes back to the Greeks (Vercelli 1991), but the requirement of perfect knowledge {{flies in the face of}} rationality in the sense used in everyday life. Perfect knowledge of the present and past is beyond the capacity of any human brain, and the fact that certain knowledge of the future is impossible is acknowledged by all who are rational in the ordinary sense. Although perfect-knowledge rationality is used as the benchmark in mainstream evaluations of theory, to believe that we possess it is irrational in the extreme.

This paper investigates the problem of determining the origin of a DHCP packet in a network. We propose a practical method for adding a new option field that does not violate any RFC’s, which we believe should be a crucial requirement while proposing any related solution. The new DHCP option will contain the ingress port and the switch MAC address. We recommend that this new option be added at the edge {{so that we can}} use the recorded value for performing traceback. The computational overhead of our solution is low, and the related network management tasks are low as well. We also address issues related to securing the field in order to maintain privacy of switch MAC addresses, fragmentation of packets, and possible attack scenarios. Our study shows that the traceback scheme is effective and practical to use in most network environments. ...|$|E

A. Hickey, Radio was started in 1927 and by that time india had a huge media and was considered as an oldest and largest media of the world. Today satellite and cable televi-sion, interactive video and electronic games, personal computers with the internet are central to the lives of people and especially in the lives of children. The world has become a Global Village and everything has become ‘Glocal’. Out of 7 billion population in the world, more than two billion subscribe to internet and out of that 44 percent is from Asia. To make this more interesting out of the 7 billion population of the world, as at today over five billion have mobile phones.

40|$|Growing up in Chicago, I can't {{remember}} a time when I did not know that I was part Japanese American. My mother taught us about internment; we played with our "Japanese" dolls; and we ate our hot dogs and bologna cooked in shoyu (soy sauce). Although our hot dogs, like our home, were not "normal," to my sister Debbie and me, they were. When I first came to california to attend graduate school and began teaching in the Asian American Studies department, this notion of myself as Japanese American was seriously challenged for the time. Many of my students wanted to know my qualifications to teach Asian American studies. "You don't look Japanese so <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about raciam?" they would say. Clearly I was not Japanese American enough. Fron Chicago to Californiam the social context changed and with it my acceptance {{as a member of the}} Japanese American community. Other hapas (a Hawaiian term that has come to refer to mixed-race Asian Americans) in California invited me to attend a Hapa Issues Forum meeting, and I did, but with reservations. What I found was that this once indivdual and anecdotal experience was made collective within the Hapa Issues Forum organisation. No longer was being hapa an individual challenge, but one that was shared collectively-multiraciallity was and is moving from being an individual isolated expeerience to one that is increasingly collectively organized, not only with Japanese American hapas, but also in coalition with multiracial people of many different heritages. This chapter was born out of one such group, the Multiracial Alternatives Project, which sparked an intellectual dialogue about the mixed race-experience in comparative perspective...|$|E

30|$|Medical images pose many {{interesting}} and important perceptual and cognitive questions. How {{do you know}} if this irregular mass has changed size or just shape in the time intervening between two images (van Engeland, Snoeren, Karssemeijer, & Hendriks, 2003)? Why are 20 – 30  % of breast cancers missed in breast cancer screening (Hoff et al., 2012)? Why don’t computer-aided detection systems help as much as one might think they would (Nishikawa et al., 2012)? Though such questions are interesting, they are often quite hard to answer. Manipulating variables in the clinical setting is difficult for obvious ethical and practical reasons. Even arranging to passively collect data in the clinic can be hard. For instance, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> if a patient was “correctly” diagnosed? A false negative/miss error might walk out of the clinic, never to be seen again by the experimenter who would never know that an error had occurred. As experimental participants in laboratory tasks, radiologists are a scarce resource. They tend to be extremely busy and they do not tend to volunteer in studies on the promise of $ 10 /h or extra credit in an Introductory Psychology class. (That said, as a group, they tend to be very interested in perceptual questions and, in principle, would like to help.) Collecting the right stimuli is a challenge as well. Researchers who are not, themselves, experts in radiology will need one of those busy radiologists to cull a set of appropriate images for an experiment. A panel of radiologists may be needed to establish gold standard “truth” about those images by consensus. It is, for example, surprisingly hard to get a group of radiologists to agree that there is nothing clinically suspicious in a “normal” chest X-ray. Moreover, the experimenter does not have the control over the location and properties of a target (like a tumor) that would be typical in an experiment where the computer generates the stimuli.|$|E

Unfortunately, all those things seldom dictate {{the success or failure of}} the system. There are two keys that ultimately provide triumph or doom for the whole endeavor. These keys are Disease and Dimension. Metrics as a Disease… What is more dangerous than an untrained soldier without a gun? …an untrained soldier with a gun is much more dangerous. What is more devastating than a missed human resources review at your job? …a human resources review performed by a person with no understanding of human motivation based upon an HR policy that is built on a flawed philosophy of humanity is more devastating. (Try giving your spouse an HR review on your wedding anniversary. You will find out how effective that can be and how quiet an evening is when you spend it by yourself.) The normal corporate response to a “call for metrics ” is to panic, then paint the sky bright with an array of red, yellow, and green indicator boxes. Why do we treat metrics differently than we do a medication prescription? We never use that approach at a pharmacy. If we have a physical or emotional problem, we get a doctor to identify the source of the problem and request a specific medication from the pharmacy. The doctor never says, “Well, we have some problems, so I suggest ingesting about 80 different medications and trust that their net effect is a positive one. ” Taking medicine just because it is on the shelf is a recipe for health disaster. You have heard the phrase, “Paper will lay still for anything to be written on it. ” Unfortunately, metrics can be created the same way. The proliferation of metrics does not equal success.

40|$|Using the Sun?s rays Cue: Sun drying is {{the oldest}} method of drying {{agricultural}} produce. It?s free, and it?s effective. There are some disadvantages: the weather is not always hot, and roaming animals can sometimes get a juicy meal from your hard work. But, as Ismaila Senghore found out {{when he spoke to}} Peter Monnie, sun drying has its rewards. With some added salt, all kinds of fish can be preserved through sun drying - from skate to the unusual-looking ?guitar? fish. By putting them on a platform of stalks from the ?rhun? tree, which is like a palm tree, the fish are protected from scavenging animals. Once dried they can be sold. Ismaila went to one fishing community on the windy beaches of Banjul in The Gambia, to find out more. IN:	?The people here are mainly? OUT:	?Yes a glut. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 18 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Ismaila Senghore talking to Peter Monnie in the Gambia. Adding salt, together with the heat from the sun, can preserve all kinds of fish - and fruits and vegetables too. The market may not always be good. But sun dried foods have the advantage that they can be stored, and eaten when resources are scarce. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Monnie	The people here are mainly fishermen so our women too, they also have involved themselves in it. Senghore	Now let me know now the kind of fish that you dry here? Monnie	Skate, skate fish or guitar fish as their form looks like a guitar. So we have named it guitar fish. Senghore	The sea snails - you dry them here too? Monnie	Yes we have them also here. We also dry them here. We also get them from the fishermen and we get them, we crack then we dry them. So it is also part of the activities. Senghore	Now Peter, what are the procedures that you undertake in drying your fish? When you want to dry fish, where do you start from? Monnie	Yes, when we want to dry the fish at least we bring the fish from the seashore and you bring them to our site. Then we off scale them, we scale them off. We remove some of the items in the fish. Senghore	The intestines and so forth? Monnie	Yes. Senghore	And the gills? Monnie	Yes the gills and the intestines. As you can see them you see we remove them and then after you wash them. Then you put them on the platforms. Senghore	So in other words the only treatment that you apply is salting? Monnie	Yes it is only salt because salt is the natural treatment. Senghore	Now I have seen that you have various fish here spread on these platforms. Why do you have to put them on platforms, almost one metre high? Monnie	Yes, you have to do so because we have some animals around us, donkeys, cattle and it is not safe to dry them on the ground. Senghore	I can see that your platform seems to be very practical because it made of the stalks of rhun leaves and you have some tree cuttings that you have planted in the garden, you mounted your platform on these tree cuttings. Now you can see that there is space between the rhun sticks that allows some kind of air to blow from under through the fish. Now does that possibly help your drying, is it advantageous for the drying? Monnie	Yes it is very, very advantageous so that air can blow under it so that while the one that is facing the sun is drying, then the wind also is blowing under it so that they get dry at the same time. Senghore	Now {{how do you know that}} your fish is dry? Do you come to look at it from time to time? Monnie	Yes we are always at the site. When we dry them the next day we come and we turn them all around then it becomes fully dry. Senghore	Yes because the temperature may not be very hot from the sun. Sometimes you know it might not be very sunny. It means you have to come day by day to turn it over and over is it? Monnie	Yes that is why you turn them all around. Senghore	Ok, now that you come and inspect it every day to see whether it is dry now. When it is fully dry <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it is fully dry? Monnie	Yes because when it is dry the fish become very hard. When you break it you cannot, it cannot then everything becomes hard. Senghore	All right now if you would want to, for example, tell anybody to start this kind of venture anywhere in the Third World what kind of advice would you give them? Monnie	Yes the advice that I would give them is that it seems like tedious work but it is also helping our community. Senghore	Now Mr Monnie, when you come to selling your fish now where do you sell your fish and do you think it is lucrative business? Monnie	Yes after drying them we pack them, we wake up early in the morning around five o?clock and we send them to the roadside and then we take where we have the market there, then we sell. So we sell them locally. Senghore	And do you have a good revenue from it, is it lucrative like is it profitable? Monnie	Yes, sometimes it is profitable. If a lot of people in the market in a day, the market will not be all that impressive because a lot of the fish will be there. So sometimes you will sell? Senghore	There will be a glut? Monnie	Yes a glut. End of trackThe oldest method of drying has advantages and disadvantage...|$|E
