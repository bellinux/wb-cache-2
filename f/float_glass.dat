25|$|Surface quality {{measures}} the deviations from a perfect, ideal surface. Increasing the surface quality reduces distortion, artifacts, and aberration in images, and helps increase coherence, collimation, and reduce unwanted divergence in beams.

The surface quality is typically measured with items like interferometers or optical flats, and are usually measured in wavelengths of light (λ). A normal household-mirror made with <b>float</b> <b>glass</b> may have flatness tolerances as low as 9--14λ per inch, equating to a deviation of 5600 through 8800 nanometers from perfect flatness. Precision ground and polished mirrors intended for lasers or telescopes may have tolerances as high as λ/50 (1/50 of the wavelength of the light, or around 12 nm).|$|E

Elihu Thomson, born in Manchester who subsequently moved to America, formed Thomson-CSF which became Thales Group in 2000.

Henry Brunner from Liverpool would join with Ludwig Mond in the 1860s to form a chemical company which became ICI in 1926. Mossbay Steelworks in Workington, when opened in 1877, were the world's first large-scale steelworks; its austenitic manganese steel (mangalloy) was produced from 1877 until 1974, with Britain's railways converting from iron to steel by the 1880s. Track was made there for the UK's railways (exclusively from the 1970s onwards, with the steel made in Teesside) until August 2006; much of the rails made were exported (from 1882), with its main competitor being Voestalpine of Austria, and a plant (bought by British Steel in 1999) in Hayange, France, who make all of SNCF's railway tracks, and the Katowice Steelworks in Poland.

Reductions in bacterial population of log10 = 4.2 under visible light irradiation and log10 = 1.8 in darkness have been achieved, compared with log10 = 1.8 under visible light irradiation and no activity, for a purely fluorine-doped titania. Generation of reactive oxygen species from the photocatalytic coatings is the major factor that significantly reduces the bacterial growth on the glass surfaces."

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{fabrication}} of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) embedded in glasses and their applications for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Firstly, Ag NPs are produced in microscope slides and high iron <b>float</b> <b>glasses</b> by ion exchange with thermal treatment. These two kinds of glasses contain a different percentage of iron oxide, which acts as the reducing agent in a silver reduction process. The study shows that the iron content in the Fe 2 + form {{is more important than}} that in the Fe 3 + form for the silver reduction. It is also demonstrated that Ag NP aggregates embedded in high iron <b>float</b> <b>glasses</b> can make them as SERS-active substrates. Secondly, Ag NPs are formed in high quality Corning 0211 glasses by a masked ion exchange and a two-step ion exchange. Ag NPs are deposited just under the mask edge due to the electrolytic deposition taking place in the masked ion exchange process. They form into Ag NP patterns according to the mask pattern. With the two-step ion exchange, uniform nanoparticle clusters over large areas are embedded in glass due to the galvanic replacement reaction and the electrolytic deposition. When applying a photolithographic mask in either the first step of an Ag+ ion exchange or the second step of a K+ ion exchange process, the two-step ion exchange can also enable the patterning of areas with particles having desired shapes and sizes. The SERS performance of the particles formed by these two methods is also demonstrated. The presented methods based on ion exchange are simple and potentially low-cost processes for large scale fabrication of SERS-active substrates. Furthermore, the two methods used to fabricate Ag NPs in the high quality Corning 0211 glass are ideal options in the development of integrated sensor chips by combining optical waveguides and microfluidics with the formed nanoparticles...|$|R
