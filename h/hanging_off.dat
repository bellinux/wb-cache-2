Made of shiny, silvery material it consisted of boots that extended halfway up her thighs and a combined sleeveless shirt/short skirt with a plunging neckline. Gloves and a small hairband were also added, {{as well as a}} belt, with the handcuffs <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> of it. Her arm straps were removed, though the strap around her neck remained.|$|E
5|$|One of Parcells first {{decisions}} as coach was to replace Simms {{as the starting}} quarterback with Brunner. Simms asked to be traded after the benching, but his request was ignored. During the sixth game of the Giants' 1983 Season, Simms came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the Philadelphia Eagles. On his second drive, Simms suffered a season-ending injury when the thumb on his throwing hand hit a player's helmet on his follow-through. The injury was reported as a dislocation, {{but according to the}} book, Simms to McConkey, written by Phil McConkey, Simms, and Dick Schaap, the injury was much more severe, with the thumb literally <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> after impact, and the bone sticking out through the skin.|$|E
5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its front wheels <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of the}} north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E

5|$|Roberts' riding {{style in}} which he forced the motorcycle's rear wheel to break {{traction}} to steer around a corner, essentially riding on paved surfaces {{as if they were}} dirt tracks, changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. From 1983 to 1999, every 500cc world championship was won by a rider with a dirt track racing background. Roberts' cornering method of <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> the motorcycles with his knee extended forced him to use duct tape as knee pads, and eventually led to the introduction of purpose-built knee pucks used by all motorcycle road racers today. His battles with the Grand Prix establishment eventually led to the adoption of stricter safety standards for Grand Prix race organizers. He {{was one of the first}} riders to challenge the FIM over the way they treated competitors and helped improve prize money as well as the professionalism of the sport. It was not until Roberts planned his rival race series in 1980 that the FIM was forced to change the way in which they dealt with motorcycle racers.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving as}} regimental quartermaster, Grant yearned for a combat role; when finally allowed, {{he led a}} cavalry charge at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, demonstrating his equestrian ability at Monterrey by {{carrying}} a dispatch past snipers while <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> {{the side of his}} horse, keeping the animal between him and the enemy. Before leaving the city he stopped at a house occupied by wounded Americans, giving them assurance he would send for help. Polk, wary of Taylor's growing popularity, divided his forces, sending some troops (including Grant's unit) to form a new army under Major General Winfield Scott. Traveling by sea, Scott's army landed at Veracruz and advanced toward Mexico City. The army met the Mexican forces at the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec outside Mexico City. For his bravery at Molino del Rey, Grant was brevetted first lieutenant. At San Cosmé, men under Grant's direction dragged a disassembled howitzer into a church steeple, reassembled it, and bombarded nearby Mexican troops. His bravery and initiative earned him his second brevet promotion to captain. On September 14, 1847, Scott's army marched into the city; Mexico ceded the vast territory, including California, to the U.S. on February 2, 1848.|$|E

25|$|Production of {{agricultural}} machinery and implements had occurred since the 1930s, {{such as the}} 1933 number 22e Fordson farm tractor, and such offerings were maintained post-war. One interesting model was the odd Opperman 3-wheeled Motocart, a tilting flat-bed vehicle with engine <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> {{to the side of}} its large front wheel (Rixon 2005, pp.122–123).|$|E
25|$|Bumper boats: This {{ride was}} {{supposedly}} safer, but the engines often leaked gasoline, {{at least once}} requiring medical attention for one rider who got too much on his skin. Tall riders also often were unable to fit their legs on the small-sized boats, consequently resulting in them <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> of {{the sides of the}} boats and being fractured during collisions.|$|E
25|$|On {{the shrine}} grounds, {{there are several}} {{important}} religious structures. The shrine's haiden, Yasukuni's main prayer hall where worshipers come to pray, was originally built in 1901 in styles of Irimoya-zukuri, Hirairi, and Doubanbuki (copper roofing) {{in order to allow}} patrons to pay their respects and make offerings. This building's roof was renovated in 1989. The white screens <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> the ceiling are changed to purple ones on ceremonial occasions.|$|E

25|$|Aerodynamically, Shelby added a carbon-fiber {{up front}} diffuser, which is complemented {{in the rear}} by a larger carbon-fiber spoiler <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> the trunk lid. Below the wing there’s more carbon fiber used in the new rear diffuser, {{taillight}} panel, and rocker panels with side-skirt aero blades {{just in front of}} the rear wheels. The composite is also in place for the mirror covers. Finally, there’s the requisite Super Snake racing stripes and external badging.|$|E
25|$|Plantar flexion: One of {{the most}} popular lower leg muscle {{stretches}} is the step standing heel raises, which mainly involves the gastrocnemius, soleus, and the Achilles tendon. Standing heel raises allow the individual to activate their calf muscles by standing on a step with toes and forefoot, leaving the heel <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> the step, and plantar flexing the ankle joint by raising the heel. This exercise is easily modified by holding on to a nearby rail for balance and is generally repeated 5-10 times.|$|E
25|$|Alpha-carbon (α-carbon) {{is also a}} {{term that}} applies to {{proteins}} and amino acids. It is the backbone carbon before the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, reading along the backbone of a typical protein would give a sequence of –n– etc. (when reading in the N to C direction). The α-carbon is where the different substituents attach to each different amino acid. That is, the groups <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> the chain at the α-carbon are what give amino acids their diversity. These groups give the α-carbon its stereogenic properties for every amino acid except for glycine. Therefore, the α-carbon is a stereocenter for every amino acid except glycine. Glycine also {{does not have a}} β-carbon, while every other amino acid does.|$|E

5000|$|... “In {{contrast}} to the old-style Goth look, which was androgynous, the male 'Industrial look' was tough and military, with a sci-fi edge. The men wore … band T-shirts, black trousers or military cargo pants in black, military accessories, such as dog-tags, heavy boots … 'Industrial' women, who were fewer in number, tended to wear waist-cinching corsets, small tank tops or 'wife-beaters' t-shirts, trousers, and sometimes suspenders <b>hanging</b> down <b>off</b> the pants. They also … sometimes shaved their heads.”- Valerie Steele, fashion historian and director of MFIT, New York.|$|R
50|$|Trick riding {{refers to}} the act of {{performing}} stunts while riding a horse, such as the rider standing upright on a galloping horse. Other stunts might include <b>hanging</b> upside down <b>off</b> {{of the side of}} the horse while attached to a strap or jumping on and off a galloping horse.|$|R
25|$|Jewelry {{was also}} popular {{among those that}} could afford it. Necklaces were beaded gold or silver chains and worn in {{concentric}} circles reaching as far down as the waist. Ruffs also had a jewelry attachment such as glass beads, embroidery, gems, brooches or flowers. Belts were a surprising necessity: used either for fashion or more practical purposes. Lower classes wore them almost as tool belts with the upper classes using them as another place to add jewels and gems alike. Scarves, although not often mentioned, {{had a significant impact}} on the Elizabethan style by being a multipurpose piece of clothing. They could be worn on the head to protect desirable pale skin from the sun, warm the neck on a colder day, and accentuate the colour scheme of a gown or whole outfit. The upper class had silken scarves of every color to brighten up an outfit with the gold thread and tassels <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> of it.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{starship}} flying towards an island after being summoned by its local tribesmen. The island locals slowly awake as the craft passes overhead. The starship then beams a pink bikini-clad electric green-haired Minaj down onto the beach and she begins to sing. She is presumably being worshipped as a goddess as she is carried away through the jungle by the island locals wearing a pale pink bikini with strands <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> the bottom and short green hair, which is also worn during some kaleidoscope effects and in one scene of her on the beach singing. Minaj is then seen dancing in the mountains wearing a white, pink and black bodysuit behind a glass box {{while some of the}} male islanders run up to her. The scene then shifts towards the volcano top at nighttime where Minaj is sitting on top of the box with some of the locals dancing around her. In the final scene, a blonde-haired Minaj, wearing a white fringed strapless bikini splattered with paint, is partying with the islanders. Intercut scenes show Minaj singing with kaleidoscope effects on her in the second outfit and some more kaleidoscope effects in the same outfit but under blacklights. It ends with her singing the last line while looking directly into the camera.|$|E
500|$|The {{acclaimed}} Metal Gear series {{continued with}} [...] (PlayStation 2; 2001) which further evolved the stealth gameplay.

[...] Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty became the genre's best selling game with 7 million in sales, followed by Metal Gear Solid with 6 million in sales.|$|E
50|$|In filmmaking {{and video}} production, a bird's-eye shot {{refers to a}} shot looking {{directly}} down on the subject. The perspective is very foreshortened, making the subject appear short and squat. This shot {{can be used to}} give an overall establishing shot of a scene, or to emphasise the smallness or insignificance of the subjects. These shots are normally used for battle scenes or establishing where the character is. It is shot by lifting the camera up by hands or by <b>hanging</b> it <b>off</b> something strong enough to support it. When a scene needs a large area shot, it is a crane shot.|$|R

500|$|Inafune had {{originally}} {{planned to use}} this chibi-style in the original Mega Man, but could not due to the hardware constraints of the NES. Producer Tetsuya Kitabayashi stated that redesigning the character models {{was a result of}} the PSP's 16:9 widescreen ratio. The larger heads on the characters allowed the development team to create visible facial expressions. Character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa explained the concept of the design was [...] "toys" [...] and be [...] "Geared towards little kids ... the kinds of characters that you'd see <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> of keychains and such". He added that the design team made sure proportions and movements were accurately reflected on the models. As the size of the remake's stages are not proportional to those of the original, the widescreen ratio also presented the developers with more space to fill. The Robot Master Oil Man originally had black skin and pink lips, which GamesRadar identified as a [...] "1920's caricature." [...] The design was changed for the US release to blue skin and yellow lips to avoid controversy.|$|E
500|$|An {{enhanced}} remake titled Mega Man Powered Up — {{known as}} [...] in Japan — was released worldwide for the PSP in 2006. The game features a graphical overhaul with 3D chibi-style character models with large heads and small bodies. Inafune had originally planned to make Mega Man look this way, {{but could not}} due to the hardware constraints of the NES. Producer Tetsuya Kitabayashi stated that redesigning the character models {{was a result of}} the PSP's 16:9 widescreen ratio. The larger heads on the characters allowed the development team to create visible facial expressions. [...] "The concept for these designs was 'toys'. We wanted cute designs geared towards little kids ... the kinds of characters that you'd see <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> of keychains and such," [...] character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa explained. [...] "Not only that, I made sure to tell the designers not to skimp on any of the original Mega Man details. We wanted their proportions and movements to be accurately reflected in these designs as well." [...] As the size of the remake's stages are not proportional to those of the original, the widescreen ratio also presented the developers with more space to fill.|$|E
500|$|Asher told Barbara Avedon {{about the}} {{students}}' script, {{saying that it}} only needed a little reworking, and he asked if she would help the students with the rewrite. Avedon, who had written for The Donna Reed Show and been a regular writer for Bewitched, accepted his request. Avedon visited Jefferson High School and later said of the experience, [...] "I was horrified. Locker doors were <b>hanging</b> <b>off</b> their hinges. There wasn't a blade of grass in sight." [...] Avedon expressed amazement over the script the students produced and helped them revise it and expand its length so it would sustain a full half-hour episode. She promised the students that no changes would {{be made to the}} script unless they approved. It was because of her recommendation that the story was reformulated as a Christmas episode, which she suggested because the script [...] "was so imbued with the spirit." [...] She said that one of the students indicated a desire to write for Bewitched because the series deals with miscegenation by way of a marriage between a witch and a mortal. [...] The final script credited the teleplay to Avedon and Asher, and the story to all 26 students, who were listed on screen in alphabetical order.|$|E
30|$|Giving {{students}} a framework, starting with where they’re at, building {{the root of}} the tree and then <b>hanging</b> the branches <b>off</b> is more your job than giving them de novo information.

60|$|The {{shock of}} that sight must have paralysed within me {{the power of}} remembering what {{followed}} it; for I can recall nothing, after looking on the emptiness of the rock below, except that I crouched on the ledge under my feet, to save myself from falling off it--that there was an interval of oblivion--and that I seemed to awaken again, as it were, to the thundering {{of the water in}} the abyss. When I rose and looked around me, the seaward sky was lovely in its clearness; the foam of the leaping waves flashed gloriously in the sunlight: and all that remained of the mist was one great cloud of purple shadow, <b>hanging</b> afar <b>off</b> over the whole inland view.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the years}} the Owl has been stolen countless times. However, an odd feature has {{accompanied}} this thievery. Whenever it is stolen, the stealers must flaunt it at a [...] "showing," [...] where elaborate measures are taken to display the Owl while reducing the odds of it being re-stolen by a new group. Often the resulting fracas involves {{the majority of the}} student body. It is reported that the Owl was shown in a music video for the band Tears for Fears and was promptly stolen back from the band by Reed students. Other [...] "showings" [...] have included encasing it in ice, covering it in Vaseline while <b>hanging</b> it <b>off</b> the Blue Bridge, setting it on fire (using baking oil) and throwing it out the back of a speeding car.|$|R
