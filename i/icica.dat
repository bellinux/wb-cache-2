(<b>ICICA),</b> a private investigator's company owned by Posada, were raided. Weapons, {{explosives}} and a radio transmitter were found. Lozano was an employee of <b>ICICA</b> {{at the time of}} the attack, while Lugo worked as a photographer for the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2013, CBC {{announced}} that Radio-Canada's website {{was to be}} moved to <b>ICI.ca</b> in October 2013, as part of wide plan to re-brand all of CBC's French-language outlets under a common brand, replacing [...] "Radio-Canada" [...] with [...] "Ici" [...] as its main public-facing brand. However, following public backlash for its decision to drop the historic Radio-Canada name, the site has maintained its current domain name, but is branded in logos as ici.radio-canada.ca, and <b>Ici.ca</b> redirects to the site.|$|E
50|$|The word elemi {{has been}} used at various times to denote {{different}} resins. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the term usually denoted a resin from trees of the genus <b>Icica</b> in Brazil, and before that it meant the resin derived from Boswellia frereana. The word, like the older term animi, {{appears to have been}} derived from enhaemon (εναιμον): the name of a styptic medicine said by Pliny to contain tears exuded by the olive tree of Arabia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn Xenopus oocytes, Ca 2 + influx {{through an}} {{endogenous}} voltage-gated Ca 2 + channel activates a transient outward Cl− current (<b>ICI(Ca)),</b> which is potentiated by cAMP increase. The site of cAMP effect {{appears to be}} the Ca 2 + channel instead of the Ca 2 +-activated Cl− channel, because cAMP potentiates the Ba 2 + current through the Ca 2 + channel in a similar way to the ICl(Ca), and cAMP does not potentiate the Ca 2 +-dependent CI− current in cells treated with Ca 2 + ionophore. Using the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) and PKA inhibitors, it was shown that PKA is both necessary and sufficient for the cAMP effect on <b>ICI(Ca).</b> Furthermore, the cAMP/PKA-mediated potentiation of <b>IcI(Ca)</b> was inhibited by both type 1 and type 2 A protein phosphatases...|$|E

40|$|Remote sensing image {{classification}} {{can be performed}} {{in many different ways}} to extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge detection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact that these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object foreground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be combined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively select threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature selection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote sensing {{image classification}}. The feature selection method has to achieve three characteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection and reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics analysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction accuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding an image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of classification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of thresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of remote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive thresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our solution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image. Additionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective algorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for preprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable tool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the classification procedure.
