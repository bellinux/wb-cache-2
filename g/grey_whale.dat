5|$|Eschrichtiids {{have one}} living member: the <b>grey</b> <b>whale.</b> They are bottom feeders, mainly eating {{crustaceans}} and benthic invertebrates. They feed by turning {{on their sides}} and taking in water mixed with sediment, which is then expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. This is an efficient method of hunting, in which the whale has no major competitors.|$|E
5|$|Whales are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{diverse group of}} fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), {{are thought to have}} split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the <b>grey</b> <b>whale),</b> Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).|$|E
5|$|Once relentlessly {{hunted for}} their products, whales are now {{protected}} by international law. The North Atlantic right whales nearly became extinct {{in the twentieth}} century, with a population low of 450, and the North Pacific <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> population is ranked Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide, notably by the Inuit and the coastal peoples of Vietnam and Ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals. Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. Small whales, such as belugas, are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor and the animals often die {{within a few months}} of capture. Whale watching has become a form of tourism around the world.|$|E

25|$|Until recently, most {{researchers}} thought that right whales {{in the eastern}} North Pacific wintered off {{the west coast of}} North America, particularly along the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California. There have been few winter sightings in all these areas, particularly in California. A more detailed study argues that these single individuals were merely stragglers. Notwithstanding 7 days/week whale-watching operations in several parts of this range, there have been only 17 sightings between Baja and Washington state. The absence of calves from historic California stranding data suggests that this area was never an important calving or wintering ground. When a right whale was observed along the coast of La Jolla in 2017, the animal was initially misidentified as a <b>grey</b> <b>whale.</b>|$|E
500|$|Aquariums {{have tried}} housing {{other species of}} whales in captivity. The success of belugas turned {{attention}} to maintaining their relative, the narwhal, in captivity. However, in repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, all narwhals kept in captivity died within months. A pair of pygmy right whales were retained in an enclosed area (with nets); they were eventually released in South Africa. There was one attempt to keep a stranded Sowerby's beaked whale calf in captivity; the calf rammed into the tank wall, breaking its rostrum, which resulted in death. It was thought that Sowerby's beaked whale evolved to swim fast in a straight line, and a [...] tank was not big enough. There have been attempts to keep baleen whales in captivity. There were three attempts to keep grey whales in captivity. Gigi was a <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> calf that died in transport. Gigi II was another <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> calf that was captured in the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon, and was transported to SeaWorld. The [...] calf was a popular attraction, and behaved normally, despite being separated from his mother. A year later, the [...] whale grew too big to keep in captivity and was released; {{it was the first}} of two grey whales, the other being another <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> calf named JJ, to successfully be kept in captivity. There were three attempts to keep minke whales in captivity in Japan. They were kept in a tidal pool with a sea-gate at the Izu Mito Sea Paradise. Another, unsuccessful, attempt was made by the U.S. [...] One stranded humpback whale calf was kept in captivity for rehabilitation, but died days later.|$|E

500|$|All {{whales are}} {{carnivorous}} and predatory. Odontocetes, as a whole, mostly feed on fish and cephalopods, and then followed by crustaceans and bivalves. All species are generalist and opportunistic feeders. Mysticetes, as a whole, mostly feed on krill and plankton, followed by crustaceans and other invertebrates. A few are specialists. Examples include the blue whale, which eats almost exclusively krill, the minke whale, which eats mainly schooling fish, the sperm whale, which specialize on squid, and the <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> which feed on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. The elaborate baleen [...] "teeth" [...] of filter-feeding species, mysticetes, {{allow them to}} remove water before they swallow their planktonic food by using the teeth as a sieve. Usually whales hunt solitarily, but they do sometimes hunt cooperatively in small groups. The former behaviour is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. When large amounts of prey are available, whales such as certain mysticetes hunt cooperatively in small groups. Some cetaceans may forage with other kinds of animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gray whale}} (Eschrichtius robustus), {{also known as}} the <b>grey</b> <b>whale,</b> [...] gray back whale, Pacific gray whale, or California gray whale is a baleen whale that migrates between feeding and {{breeding}} grounds yearly.

[...] Gray whales were once called devil fish because of their fighting behavior when hunted. [...] The gray whale is the sole living species in the genus Eschrichtius, which in turn is the sole living genus in the family Eschrichtiidae. This mammal descended from filter-feeding whales that appeared {{at the beginning of the}} Oligocene, over 30 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|Pentewan {{was likely}} once the {{breeding}} {{site for the}} extinct in the Atlantic <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> (Eschrichtius robustus) as 2 of the 7 European <b>grey</b> <b>whale</b> fossils were found here.

Furthermore, there is no decent population of <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> existing outside of North Pacific as of 2014, therefore extents of interspecies competitions, if ever happened, or peaceful habitat sharing between these coastal species, prior to whaling, are unknown. A theory of humpback whales to invade and become a dominant species over Hawaiian islands, former wintering ground for right whales, in the past few centuries, corresponding with the timing of right whale hunts across the Pacific Ocean, had been claimed as well.|$|R

40|$|In {{the shallow}} water coastal area, {{visibility}} is comparatively restricted, yet marine mammals are still able to navigate, manoeuvre and find food without any noticeable difficulties. Our work has focused particularly on <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> (Eschrichtius robustus) due to their close association with {{the shallow water}} environment. One of their primary food sources is found in kelp beds, in a highly cluttered and acoustically active environment. Because the usefulness of vision {{is limited by the}} turbidity of the coastal submarine environment, it is logical to believe they rely heavily on their hearing. Unlike dolphins and porpoises, <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> do not appear to use active echolocation techniques. We propose therefore that they are making use of the ambient noise for passive acoustic characterisation of their environment. We are investigating what sounds are available to these animals in their feeding grounds and what types of visualisation techniques they might be employing. During the summer of 2006, ambient noise recordings were collected in two bays along the central coast of British Columbia, canada, where <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> are known to feed. The array used was a fixed 2 -hydrophone design, horizontally separated by a small distance, analogous to a set of ears, and was deployed from a kayak. The acoustic signals were recorded near the surface at a broadband frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz where the water column depths ranged from 3 m to 30 m approximately, and in several distinct environments (deeper water, shallow water with kelp bed, shallow water with bare seabed, surf zone). This paper examines the data collected and develops hypotheses based on Synthetic Aperture and Acoustic Daylight Imaging techniques as possible mechanisms available to these whales to interpret the nearshore sound field...|$|R

40|$|Eastern Pacific <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> (Eschrichtius robustus) {{thrive in}} shallow water environments where {{visibility}} is reduced but apparently do not actively echolocate. Along their migration route and in their feeding grounds these whales are exposed {{to high levels of}} ambient noise, highly turbid waters and many underwater obstacles. To test possible passive acoustic localization mechanisms (e. g. Acoustic Daylight Imaging and Passive Synthetic Aperture), we made extensive acoustic measurements during comprehensive field studies of these whales on their summer feeding grounds in British Columbia (Canada). In combination with visual observations of the whales and their behaviours, we investigated the acoustical sources available to the whales when navigating within a feeding bay. First, we measured ambient noise levels to construct the acoustic landscape around the whales. Second, we investigated how sound is altered when objects such as kelp beds and rocks are present. We also measured acoustic changes induced by direct, controlled modifications of the near-shore environment. The aim of this research is to understand how <b>grey</b> <b>whales</b> might be finding their way around, and what impact, if any, increased levels of ambient noise might have on the whales' ability to find food and navigate within the feeding grounds...|$|R
