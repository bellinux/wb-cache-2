40|$|The {{geophysical}} study of superficial deposits (mainly gravels) in ice-free areas near the seashore in the South Shetland Islands (Antarctica) allows establishing the possible existence of permafrost and buried ice bodies. In this work we {{have investigated the}} internal structure of Quaternary sediments using the resistivity method (vertical <b>electric</b> <b>sounding,</b> V. E. S.), {{with the purpose of}} establishing the resistivity values of the different materials and their geometry. We present here the results obtained from 1 7 vertical <b>electric</b> <b>soundings</b> carried out in Caleta Española, (north coast of Hurd Peninsula), and in the surroundings of Caleta del Glaciar Rocoso (south coast of Hurd Peninsula), both in Livingston Island. Vertical <b>electric</b> <b>soundings</b> interpretation has allowed us to characterise different units from the resistivity values (active layer, permafrost, buried ice, Quaternary deposits and their basement), and to establish the inter-phase between sea water and continental water. Moreover, with the resistivity method we have deduced the spatial distribution of some of these beds. In this way the permafrost (with resistivity values ranging between 13000 and 35000 Q*m), and the associated active layer, is restrained to shallow depths (60000 Q*m) and has been only found in the studied rock glacie...|$|R

40|$|A {{large scale}} deep {{vertical}} <b>electric</b> <b>sounding</b> survey in the north-western sedimentary lowland coast of Libya was carried out. The area is underlain by Cretaceous formations represented mainly by limestone, dolomite with some intercalation of clay and marl. Quaternary sediments (mainly fluvio-eolian and clay deposits) {{cover the entire}} area, sebkhas deposits are {{in the eastern part}} of this area. The geophysical survey also included drilling wells, some reflection of seismic profiles and field geology. The measurements were carried out to define the lithology, the structure and the general geometry of the water-bearing system in the area and some typical features of the geologic series and existing tectonics in the area were defined. Seismic reflections appeared more significant than <b>electric</b> <b>soundings</b> in delineating various geological formations especially deep ones. Hydrogeologic parameters such as porosity, salt content and thickness of some permeable layers have been determined using well logging data. In the study, a combination of forward, Maquardt inverse and Zohdy automatic algorithm have been utilized in the geoelectric modelling interpretation. Using modified results of the automatic inversion (Zohdy), as first parameters with corresponding geological constraints, would fasten upon the forward and Maquardt inversion (minimising number of iterations).
