5|$|Wesley, aware the Enterprise is in orbit, {{arranges}} for {{the children}} to passively resist. When the Aldeans request Picard's help to resolve the issue with the children, the crew <b>finds</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> beam through the shield, allowing Commander Riker and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) to sneak onto the planet. Data manages to disable the Custodian, disrupting the Aldean's transporter and planetary shield. Dr. Crusher explains to the Aldeans that their shield has weakened the ozone layer of their planet, exposing the inhabitants to ultraviolet radiation that has left them unable to bear children. The radiation would likely have the same effects on the children from the Enterprise. Without the planetary shield, the ozone layer will naturally return, allowing the Aldeans to reproduce again. The Aldeans recognize the error of their ways and return the children to the Enterprise. They accept Starfleet's help to correct their ancient systems and recognize that they will have to forgo their invisibility to continue their society.|$|E

An experiment by Dr. Bishop to link her to the dying John Scott's mind {{in order to learn}} what he knew about his condition results in Olivia gaining part of his consciousness, causing her mind to begin integrating and purging the foreign consciousness.

500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported an}} 80% approval rating {{with an average}} rating of 7.9/10 based on 15 reviews. The website's consensus reads, [...] "A move from New York to Hollywood gives Agent Carter new territory to explore, as the series continues {{to search for a}} storyline as dynamic as its heroine." [...] Mitchell Broussard at We Got This Covered graded the season premiere 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "Fantastic" [...] and positively comparing it to Marvel's Ant-Man by saying [...] "Agent Carter <b>finds</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make the smaller stakes of Peggy's noir sandbox as tense, credible, and addictively watchable as any other addition to the MCU." [...] Broussard highlighted the performances of Atwell and D'Arcy as well as the new casting additions, and called the season's pacing, due to the small episode order, [...] "exciting". He noted that [...] "some may be disappointed in the more restrained adultness of the show releasing so soon after Jessica Jones, but I think that’s the greatest thing about this world: each show feels different and its own thing, despite their close proximity." [...] Varietys Brian Lowry was less positive, praising the casting and performances but saying, [...] "Agent Carter feels too slavishly locked into the S.H.I.E.L.D. formula...it's sort of a shame Agent Carter isn’t more compelling, since the impeccable period trappings and costumes make the series a nice change of pace, at least visually." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{science fiction}} heroes have, Porter argues, [...] "grown greyer over time", Jack {{represents}} as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend, {{resulting in a}} full [...] "devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero". In Children of Earth, Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity; the actor says [...] "when I read all of the stuff he had to do, I {{had to look at}} it {{from the point of view}} of 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'." [...] For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him [...] "a benchmark for [...] grey heroes"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as [...] "villainous or downright monstrous." [...] Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and <b>finds</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he [...] "loved" [...] the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying [...] "He saved every single child in the world! If you would fail to do that then you’re the monster, frankly. It’s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get." [...] When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled [...] "Redemption", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial.|$|E

The same website included Jasmine rejecting traditional standards of marriage second on its list of [...] "27 Feminist Disney Moments That Unapologetically Smashed The Patriarchy".

Sonia Saraiya of Nerve ranked Jasmine fifth in her article [...] "Ranked: Disney Princesses From Least To Most Feminist". Saraiya praised her personality, likening her boldness, curiosity, and skepticism of marriage to that of Belle while commending her for [...] "falling for a completely inadequate 'street rat' and whisking him out of poverty, instead of the other way around." [...] However, Saraiya labeled Jasmine's use of sexuality her [...] "only power", criticizing her for sending a negative message to young girls.
