40|$|A {{sample of}} 65 men and 93 women {{attending}} eight Anglican churches in Wales completed a questionnaire concerned with beliefs, attitudes and practices.

Alongside conventional Christian behaviour, unconventional behaviour was assessed by eight <b>items</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> protection from bad luck or promotion of good luck. The data demonstrate how many churchgoers combine their conventional Christian beliefs about God with unconventional beliefs about good and bad luck.
