2500|$|The {{decision}} {{provoked a}} great debate, criticism abroad {{because of the}} violation of fundamental human rights but anger against Abu Zayd and death threats in Egypt. Abu Zayd himself lamented, [...] "it took one week for my name to be cursed all over Egypt. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> village they were saying I was teaching heresies to the students ...." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 7, 2007, Hopkins and Calzaghe met {{face to face}} in {{the media}} room {{set up for the}} Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Ricky Hatton fight. Hopkins and Calzaghe began {{shouting}} insults and taunting each other, with Hopkins shouting, [...] "You're not <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> league! I would never let a white boy beat me. I would never lose to a white boy. I couldn't go back to the projects if I let a white boy beat me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blackwell {{first became}} {{interested}} in music through the influence of her fourth grade teacher, Nancy Notargiacomo, who eventually became her voice and piano teacher when she was 10. She also credits her high school choral director for encouraging her to pursue a music career. In a 2003 interview Blackwell recalled, [...] "I {{did not come from}} a musical family. I had a fourth grade teacher that introduced me to music and I sang at the Catholic church. In high school I started doing musicals âˆ’ The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Oliver!, and so forth. I thought maybe this would be what I would pursue after high school, although <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{senior year in high school}} I had doubts. I wanted to go into history or fashion design. But, I had a wonderful choral director who said 'no, your calling is music,' and she convinced me." ...|$|E

5000|$|About her performances, Delorme said, [...] "In {{the morning}} or <b>in</b> the <b>evening,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bathroom, I reinvent myself, I become a woman, {{and that is not}} biological, it is more a {{question}} of belief.|$|R
6000|$|I sat one <b>evening</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> room, [...] <b>In</b> {{that sweet}} hour of {{twilight}} When blended thoughts, half light, half gloom, [...] Throng through the spirit's skylight; The flames by fits curled round the bars, [...] Or up the chimney crinkled, While embers dropped like falling stars, [...] And in the ashes tinkled.|$|R

[...] Hopkins would later explain his comments, saying that it was not meant to be taken as a racial slur or a reflection of his feelings on white fighters, but simply said to create some hype for his fight with Calzaghe. On January 23, 2008, the fight was officially announced to take place on April 19, 2008, at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas. Hopkins lost the fight.|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{graduated}} at 16 from Lubbock High School in Lubbock, Texas. He {{spent his}} childhood years {{with his sister}} Linda, living and working at the former College Courts, an efficiency apartment complex owned by his father, T. J. Davis, located {{at the intersection of}} College Avenue and 5th Street. Davis describes his father, who was divorced from Davis' mother, as [...] "very religious, very strict, and very stubborn". Though Davis was physically small, he had a penchant for getting into fistfights. [...] "In those days, it was all about football, rodeo, and fistfights. Oh, man, I got beat up so much while I was growing up in Lubbock," [...] Davis said in a March 2, 2008, interview with the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal newspaper. [...] "I was 5 feet, 9 inches, and weighed 125 pounds. I joined Golden Gloves, but didn't do good <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> (own) division." [...] After he finished high school, Davis moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where his mother lived, to get out of Lubbock.|$|E
2500|$|In Russia, Savchenko {{is portrayed}} {{extremely}} negatively in the media; according to BBC News [...] "Crude, {{and at times}} sexist, innuendo is used to demonise Ms Savchenko". The Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said that Savchenko {{is known as a}} [...] "killing machine in a skirt", and Tvoy Den called her [...] "Satan's daughter". Russian social media, however, tends to be more nuanced towards her with several anti-Kremlin users mocking perceived oddities in the Russian authorities' version of events, in particular their claim that she entered the country as a refugee. In March 2016, Russian composer Vladimir Nazarov wrote in an open letter to Putin saying that [...] "not <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> worst nightmare could I have imagined that I would have to ask you not to kill a woman." [...] In March 2016, Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny stated about Savchenko's trial, [...] "However you look at it, this doesn't benefit Russia". Navalny said that whoever planned to make Savchenko [...] "a trophy prisoner" [...] had miscalculated. He described the trial as such an [...] "obvious stitch-up" [...] you could [...] "see the threads".|$|E
5000|$|Verdi {{commented on}} the work, saying [...] "I've written a Quartet <b>in</b> <b>my</b> leisure moments <b>in</b> Naples. I had it {{performed}} one <b>evening</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> house, without attaching the least importance to it and without inviting anyone in particular. Only the seven or eight persons who usually come to visit me were present. I don't know whether the Quartet is beautiful or ugly, but I do know that it's a Quartet!" ...|$|R
2500|$|However, despite mostly {{rave reviews}} in the U.S. and many {{countries}} in Europe, biographer Spoto notes that during its various premiers overseas, [...] "it shocked many, angered some, disgusted others.

6000|$|... "I really don't know. Not {{the sort}} that always itches for a weapon, for I have never been anxious to use one in the quarrels that a man gets into in the most {{innocent}} way sometimes. The differences for which men murder each other are, like everything else they do, the most contemptible, the most pitiful things to look back upon. No, I've never killed a man or loved a woman--not <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> thoughts, not <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> dreams." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may be {{surprised}} that I should remember all this so well. What is a passing emotion or half-formed thought to last in {{so many years of}} a man's changing, inconsequential life? But what has fixed the emotion of that <b>evening</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> recollection so that the slightest shadows remain indelible was an event of strange finality, an event not likely to be forgotten in a life-time--as you shall see.|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall {{give me an}} <b>evening</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own apartment," [...] he continued; [...] "for I must soon {{lose the}} charms of {{literary}} society for the drudgery of commerce, and the coarse every-day avocations of the world. I repeat it, that my compliance with my father's wishes for the advantage of my family, is indeed a sacrifice, especially considering the calm and peaceful profession to which my education destined me." ...|$|R

60|$|BLENKINSOP [almost {{breaking}} down] I {{ought to}} keep it to myself, I know. I cant tell you, Ridgeon, how ashamed I am of dragging my miserable poverty to your dinner after all your kindness. It's not that you wont ask me again; but it's so humiliating.

6000|$|... "Love you, Madonna?" [...] I echoed, in a {{voice that}} was as unlike my own as was the mood that then possessed me. [...] "You are the air I breathe, the sun that lights my miserable world. You are dearer to me than honour, sweeter than life. You are the {{guardian}} angel of my existence, the saint to whom I have turned morning and <b>evening</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> prayers for grace. Do I love you, Madonna--?" ...|$|R
60|$|There was <b>even</b> more <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind than I expressed. My {{mistrust of}} Ramiro went further than I had explained, and {{concerning}} Madonna {{more closely than}} it did me.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} makes a rap of difference, except for one thing. I love you more. I've wanted you--always. I didn't dream, not <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> wildest dreaming, that--you might have any need of me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But," [...] I went on desperately, [...] "was it an accident? Were you thrown? Was it Chu Chu?"--for somehow, {{in spite}} of her languid posture and voice, I could not, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> fears, believe her seriously hurt.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is getting," [...] he remarked, [...] "a {{little like}} melodrama. I have no {{objection}} to being abused, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own garden, but there are limits to my patience. Come to the point, if you have one." ...|$|E
