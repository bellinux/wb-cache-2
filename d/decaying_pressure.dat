In nine isolated canine hearts, left ventricular ejection was controlled by patterns specially designed to isolate the ejection parameters most critical to isovolumic relaxation rate. When stroke volume was augmented by increases in end-diastolic volume (EDV) with end-systolic volume (ESV) held constant, isovolumic ventricular relaxation rate was unchanged, as gauged by the time constants of single-exponential fits to <b>decaying</b> <b>pressure.</b> In contrast, when ESV was decreased with EDV held constant, isovolumic relaxation time constants decreased significantly, from approximately 100 to 70 msec (protocol I). The important difference in these two situations might have been that the time of end ejection was delayed in the case with faster isovolumic relaxation. To rule out other parameters that may have influenced isovolumic relaxation, ejection velocity was varied in another protocol (protocol II) by either delays in time of the onset of ejection or advances in end-ejection time, always with constant ESV and EDV.

40|$|A two {{dimensional}} bi-disperse vibrofluidized granular mixture is {{studied in the}} rapid flow regime, where particle interactions occur due to instantaneous collisions. Both experiments and simulations are carried out, and these show the existence of two phenomena which have been observed only in very dense granular flows or in equilibrium systems. The Brazil nut phenomenon, which involves the rise of larger particles in a granular mixture upon vibration, has been observed in dense systems due to the percolation of small particles though the interstitial spaces between the large particles, or due to convection rolls. In the present case, where neither effect is present, {{it is observed that}} the fluidization of the smaller particles by vibration results in an exponentially decaying density profile, at heights large compared to the particle diameter, and there by a pressure field that decreases with height. The larger particles, suspended in this <b>decaying</b> <b>pressure</b> field, experience a larger pressure at the bottom and a smaller pressure on top, and they rise to a height where the net force caused by the decreasing pressure is balanced by the weight of the particle. An attractive force between the large particles, similar to the entropic attraction effect in mixtures of colloids and polymers, is also observed in this non equilibrium system, because when the distance between the large particles is less than the small particle diameter,the pressure between the large particles is smaller than that on the outside. Analytical results are derived for each of these effects, and these are in agreement with the experimental and simulation results...|$|E
40|$|When a {{detonation}} wave propagates through a piping system, {{it acts as}} a traveling pressure load to the pipe wall. The {{detonation wave}} must be followed by an expansion wave {{in order to bring}} the combustion products to zero velocity at the ignition end. When it reaches a closed end-wall, a reflected shock is formed which propagates back into the tube with a <b>decaying</b> <b>pressure.</b> The present study aims to develop predictive models for the stresses and strains produced in such a situation. To this end, two series of experiments are discussed. The first series used strain gauges and a laser vibrometer to measure the elastic response of the tube to the incident detonation in thin aluminum tubes. The second series used strain gauges and high speed video to measure the plastic response of steel tubes to incident detonations and reflected shocks. In these experiments a novel mode of plastic deformation was discovered in which the residual plastic deformation in the tube wall had a periodic sinusoidal pattern. A semi-empirical model of the pressure history was developed for use as a boundary condition in models of the mechanical response of the tube. This model was tested against experiment, and {{it was found that the}} pressure and arrival time could not be simultaneously predicted from the simple model. This and the general form of the pressure traces in the experiment seem to suggest an interaction between the reflected shock and the boundary layer behind the detonation resulting in a possible bifurcation in the reflected shock wave. With these considerations in mind, the model was applied to single degree of freedom and finite element models of the tube wall. The ripples observed in the experiment were present in the 1 -D single degree of freedom models, indicating that they are a result of the interaction of the reflected shock wave with the elastic oscillations set in motion by the detonation wave. Strain-rate hardening was found to be an important consideration under detonation loading conditions. With proper consideration of rate hardening, a single material model may be used to arrive at reasonable predictions the plastic strains resulting from detonations and reflections at initial pressures of 2 and 3 bar initial pressures...|$|E
40|$|A new {{analytical}} method is {{proposed for the}} study of flow through highly-loaded turbomachine stages. The technique is {{used in the present study}} in order to: (i) analyze the three-dimensional induced effects of the viscous blade wakes in an isolated rotor; and (ii) to study the effects of the passage of distorted flow through an axial compressor rotor or stator. In Part I (GT&PDL Report Number 141), it is found, in contrast with the more familiar situation behind aircraft wings, that the induced effects of the vorticity in the (viscous) wakes are important in practical axial turbomachinery; for example, the flow angles through highly-loaded rotors are modified to a significant extent by such wake effects. The induced disturbances grow in strength within a certain distance downstream of the blade row before beginning to decay inversely with such axial distance. In agreement with earlier predictions, pressure disturbances and vorticity disturbances cannot be decoupled in swirling flow. Similarly, in part II (GT&PDL Report Number 151), it is found that major differences arise on comparing two-dimensional with three-dimensional analyses, both for rectilinear and for annular configurations. Further, only the last of these three-dimensional analyses can adequately describe the true flow phenomena in highly-loaded turbomachines. This is because such a description properly includes both centrifugal effects together with two important distinct types of vorticity: the trailing vorticity and the vorticity associated with any stagnation pressure gradients present. Such an analysis predicts, a strongly persisting downstream pressure field which in many cases increases before again beginning to decay inversely with the axial distance downstream, both for free-vortex stators and rotors. By contrast, three-dimensional wheel flow analysis predicts indefinitely persisting downstream disturbances. Further, a purely two-dimensional theory indicates for a stator, the downstream static pressure to be uniform, while even a three-dimensional rectilinear cascade theory would predict only an exponentially <b>decaying</b> <b>pressure</b> field. The amplitude of the above persistent downstream disturbances decreases for free-vortex downstream flow as the number of significant circumferential harmonics of the inlet distortion increases. These analytical results agree well with available experimental data recently obtained in annular cascades. January, 1980 This is part 1.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an empirical method {{to calculate the}} bypass leakage mass flow rate along the tip seal in a scroll compressor. The leakage flows through small axial and radial clearances between the orbiting and fixed scrolls of scroll compressor were previously studied by Ishii et al. In these earlier studies, the <b>pressure</b> <b>decay</b> in the pressurized vessel due to leakage through the axial and radial clearances was measured using a maximum pressure of 3 MPa for CO 2 and 0. 6 MPa for R 22. The Darcy-Weisbach equation for incompressible, viscous fluid flow through the thin rectangular cross-section was applied to calculate the leakage mass flow rate that matched the <b>pressure</b> <b>decay</b> characteristics. The empirical friction factors were determined and plotted on a Moody diagram. As a result, the empirical friction factors for both axial and radial clearance leakage flows have been determined and shown to take on essentially the same value for both CO 2 and R 22, despite the significantly different working pressures. In contrast, the flow patterns in bypass leakage along the tip seal are so complicated that not even the leakage characteristics are known definitively. No method exists for calculating the bypass leakage mass flow rate. In the present study, a bypass leakage model was constructed, compatible with a production-type scroll compressor with a large cooling capacity. A similar test of the <b>pressure</b> <b>decay</b> in the pressurized vessel due to bypass leakages were conducted with the refrigerant gas R 410 A. The measured <b>pressure</b> <b>decay</b> characteristics were then simulated by the Darcy-Weisbach equation with the empirical friction factors from our previous study for the leakage flow through the axial clearance. In the present simulations of the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>decay,</b> the complicated flow patterns through bypass clearances were classified into two representative rectangular thin cross-section leakage passes, one with an equivalent width {{and the other with}} an equivalent length. Empirical friction factor values for the equivalent pass width and length were determined to match the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>decays.</b> As a result, the calculation of the bypass leakage flow rate along the tip seal in scroll compressors can be accomplished using a simple scheme in terms of the equivalent pass width and equivalent pass length for two representative leakage passes forming a thin rectangular cross-section and applying empirically determined friction factors,...|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} {{design for a}} kettle reboiler is dependent on fitness for purpose while reducing costs. Thus, accurate information concerning two-phase flow behaviour within it is important. Experimental and numerical studies {{have been carried out}} in this research to gain a more detailed understanding of the phenomena associated with two-phase flow in a thin-slice kettle reboiler. The kettle reboiler contained 241 electrically heated tubes arranged as 17 rows of 17 columns in an in-line layout with an outside diameter of 19 mm and a pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1. 34. The working fluids used in this investigation were pentane and the refrigerant R 113. They were boiled at atmospheric pressure at uniform heat fluxes in the range of 10 to 40 kW/m 2. The patterns of flow inside the kettle reboiler were investigated experimentally using ordinary and high speed cameras. Visual observation of the flow patterns showed that the flow in the tube bundle was two-dimensional at heat fluxes of 20 kW/m 2 and above. The quantity of foam and recirculation above the tube bundle were found to depend on both the heat flux and the working fluid used. Observations of the two-phase flow pattern in the shell indicated that the movement of fluid from the centre column of the bundle was affected by the down flow into the top of the tube bundle. Two flow patterns in the tube bundle were identified: bubbly and intermittent. At low heat fluxes, bubbly flow dominated, then, with increasing heat flux, bubble coalescence {{led to the development of}} vapour slugs and intermittent flow was observed. Pressure drop measurements were made in three columns within the tube bundle. The results showed that at heat fluxes below 20 kW/m 2, the pressure drop remained nearly constant and equal to the all-liquid value. At a heat flux of 20 kW/m 2 and above, the pressure drop was found to increasingly fall below the all-liquid value as the bundle row number increased. This effect was especially evident in the centre of the bundle. A change in the flow pattern caused the pressure distribution up the tube bundle to change from roughly constant to decaying with height. Based on a number of assumptions, the two-fluid model has been applied. The two-fluid model’s drag coefficient and tube resistance were deduced from a one-dimensional model. The two-fluid model predictions show good agreement with the experimental results for the pressure distribution and flow distribution. Grid sizes of 10, 8 and 4 mm for the bundle and the pool were considered. It was found that the predicted bundle results were not affected by changing the grid size. However, in the pool region, a small grid size was needed. A grid size of 10 mm was used in the bundle while 4 mm was used in the pool. The pool velocity predictions compared well with measured values available in the open literature. The results indicated that the bundle flow is not significantly affected by the pool flow. This allows the two-fluid model to be further refined: simplifying it and reducing the computational time. A bundle-only two fluid model has been developed to accurately predict two-phase flow behaviour in the kettle reboiler tube bundle. Information available from earlier studies has been used to develop this model because of the difficulties associated with measuring the void fraction and velocities within the tube bundle. The model uses two different boundary conditions: (1) static liquid pressure in the pool and (2) variation of pressure in the pool based on the flow pattern transition. The results predicted by the model have been compared with experimental data and with one and two-fluid models at different heat fluxes. Boundary condition (1) was found to be in good agreement with experimental data and the one and two-fluid models at a heat flux of 10 kW/m 2. This was because the transition flow pattern was not achieved and the bundle was surrounded by a static pool. Boundary condition (2) is based on the Kutateladze number (Ku), which sets the transition point from bubbly to intermittent flow at a certain height in the bundle. For Ku ≤ 1. 09, the bundle flow would be surrounded by liquid, and if Ku > 1. 09, the bundle flow would be surrounded by two-phase flow. At heat fluxes of 20 kW/m 2 and above, boundary condition (2) has been found to be in good agreement with experimental data and the values predicted from the one and two-fluid models for liquid velocities, vertical mass flux and void fraction. The bundle-only model accurately predicts the trend line of constant and <b>decaying</b> <b>pressure</b> drop measured at low and high heat fluxes, respectively, and the observed flow phenomena in the kettle reboiler. The key feature of the model presented is that it allows two-phase flow in the kettle reboiler to be simulated by only modelling the tube bundle. Thus the model is simplified and less computational time is required. A central column model was developed using the minimum pressure gradient approach. The predicted results from this model were compared with experimental data and the values predicted by the two-fluid model and the bundle-only model. Reasonable agreement was obtained indicating that the flow distribution may be linked to the minimum pressure gradient...|$|E

This study provides additional evidence that LV isovolumic pressure fall in the normal intact heart in response to certain interventions is not adequately described by a model of monoexponential decay and that its relationship to filling is complex. Methods and results: To gain further insight into the {{relationship between}} LV relaxation and early rapid filling we measured LV isovolumic relaxation rate, peak. early filling velocity E, LV volumes, and transmitral pressures at baseline {{and in the first}} postextrasystolic beat after a short-coupled extrasystole in 9 anesthetized dogs. Postextrasystolic isovolumic relaxation rate was slowed as measured by 3 commonly used time constants, while E was increased 32 %. LV contractility and peak pressure were also increased, while LV end-systolic volume was decreased. LV minimum pressure was deceased, while the early diastolic transmitral pressure gradient was increased. Although all relaxation time constants measured over the entire isovolumic relaxation phase indicated slowed relaxation, direct measurement of isovolumic relaxation time indicated no change in relaxation rate. Calculation of the time constants and direct measurement of isovolumic relaxation time during early isovolumic <b>pressure</b> <b>decay</b> indicated slowed postextrasystolic <b>pressure</b> <b>decay</b> rate compared with baseline, while calculation of time constants and direct measurement of isovolumic relaxation time during late isovolumic relaxation indicated augmented postextrasystolic <b>pressure</b> <b>decay</b> rate versus baseline.

These jets diffuse {{in the surrounding}} atmosphere {{by the process of}} air entrainment and this contributes to the spreading of the jet and subsequent <b>decay</b> of <b>pressure.</b> Estimation of this <b>pressure</b> <b>decay</b> and subsequent placement of the cleaning object is of paramount importance in manufacturing and material processing industries. Also, the pressure distribution on the cleaning surface needs to be assessed in order to understand and optimize the material removal process. In an industrial setting, experimental study is performed to formulate the pressure characteristics. It has shown that the <b>decay</b> of stagnation <b>pressure</b> along the axial direction is linear. It also revealed that no cleaning is possible at radial locations greater than 1. 68 D from the centerline. Numerical simulations are performed to capture the process of air entrainment in the jet and the subsequent pressure characteristics. The simulation results are found to correctly predict the experimental data. Moreover, a theoretical model for evaluating the optimal and critical stand-off distances has also been derived. Based on our results, we found that the optimal stand-off distance in cleaning operations is ~ 5 D and the jet looses its cleaning ability at axial distances greater than ~ 26 D.

40|$|The {{pressure}} probe {{was used}} to conduct in vivo creep and in vivo stress relaxation experiments on the sporangiophores of Phycomyces blakesleeanus. The in vivo creep and in vivo stress relaxation methods are compared {{with respect to their}} utility for determining the irreversible wall extensibility and the yield threshold. The results of the in vivo stress relaxation experiments demonstrate that the growth usually does not cease when the external water supply is removed, and the turgor <b>pressure</b> does not <b>decay</b> for hours afterwards. A successful stress relaxation experiment requires that the cell enlargement rate (growth rate) be zero during the turgor <b>pressure</b> <b>decay.</b> In a few experiments, the growth rate was zero during the turgor <b>pressure</b> <b>decay.</b> However, in general only the yield threshold could be determined...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the effects of}} ventricular asynchrony with of without myocardial ischemia on the time constant of left ventricular <b>pressure</b> <b>decay</b> and asymptote, that is, the level to which pressure would decrease if isovolumic pressure decrease continued infinitely, left ventriculography and pressure measurements were investigated in 14 normal subjects and 25 patients with coronary artery disease. Ventricular asynchrony was quantitated by the segmental area-time curve. This study consisted of two parts. 1) After a right atrial pacing stress test, the time constant and asymptote remained unchanged in eight normal subjects. In 18 patients with coronary artery disease and pacing-induced angina, asynchrony increased, the time constant was prolonged (64 ± 13 to 94 ± 17 ms, p < 0. 01) and the asymptote decreased (− 22 ± 10 to − 46 ± 20 mm Hg, p < 0. 01) after the pacing. 2) During right ventricular pacing at 80, 100 and 120 beats/min in the patients, asynchrony increased and the time constant was prolonged (55 ± 7 versus 70 ± 10, 47 ± 11 versus 66 ± 19, 36 ± 7 versus 53 ± 13 ms, respectively, p < 0. 01 versus right atrial pacing), whereas the asymptote was unchanged in six normal subjects compared with the value during right atrial pacing at each pacing rate. In seven patients with coronary artery disease, right ventricular pacing at 80, 100 and 120 beats/min also produced {{an increase in the}} time constant, while the asymptote was unchanged. Thus, prolongation of the time constant of left ventricular <b>pressure</b> <b>decay</b> may result from ventricular asynchrony {{even in the absence of}} myocardial ischemia. In contrast, the asymptote (extrapolated pressure at infinity of left ventricular <b>pressure</b> <b>decay)</b> may decrease during myocardial ischemia irrespective of ventricular asynchrony. The nature of left ventricular <b>pressure</b> <b>decay</b> can be characterized not only by time constant but also by the asymptote...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} the {{calculation}} of wall interference corrections are based on boundary conditions which require a knowledge of ventilated wall porosity parameters, and which are unsuitable for deformed walls. The method described uses a simple exponential <b>decay</b> of <b>pressure</b> distribution beyond the most upstream and downstream limits in order to evaluate Mach number and incidence corrections given by the method proposed by Papelier et al. (1978). It is found that, while the upstream contribution to incidence correction is significant, the upstream and downstream contributions to Mach number correction are negligible...|$|R
500|$|Three main factors {{determine}} {{the quality of}} preserved material in a coal ball: the mineral constituents, {{the speed of the}} burial process, and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation. Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little <b>decay</b> and <b>pressure</b> are better preserved, although plant remains in most coal balls almost always show differing signs of decay and collapse. Coal balls containing quantities of iron sulfide have far lower preservation than coal balls permineralised by magnesium or calcium carbonate, which has earned iron sulfide the title [...] "chief curse of the coal ball hunter".|$|R
