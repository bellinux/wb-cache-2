5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine that <b>evolution</b> <b>has</b> a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists may act {{as an obstacle to}} students when learning about natural selection. Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective.|$|E

5|$|Critics of {{evolution}} commonly appeal to past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man forgery. It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects {{of evolution}}, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for <b>evolution</b> <b>has</b> {{been accused of being}} fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, peppered moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; these claims have been subsequently refuted.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{reconstruction}} and ancestral state reconstruction proceed by assuming that <b>evolution</b> <b>has</b> occurred without convergence. Convergent patterns may, however, appear {{at higher levels}} in a phylogenetic reconstruction, and are sometimes explicitly sought by investigators. The methods applied to infer convergent evolution depend on whether pattern-based or process-based convergence is expected. Pattern-based convergence is the broader term, for when two or more lineages independently evolve patterns of similar traits. Process-based convergence is when the convergence is due to similar forces of natural selection.|$|E

5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} have argued in response that no scientist's claims {{are treated as}} sacrosanct, {{as shown by the}} aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years to form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis. The claim that evolution relies on faith is likewise rejected on the grounds that <b>evolution</b> <b>has</b> strong supporting evidence, and therefore does not require faith.|$|E
5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that <b>evolution</b> <b>has</b> never been observed. Challenges to such {{objections}} often {{come down to}} debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Due to Madagascar's highly {{seasonal}} climate, lemur <b>evolution</b> <b>has</b> produced {{a level of}} species diversity rivaling {{that of any other}} primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male gorilla. Today, there are nearly 100 species of lemurs, and most of those species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used. Even the higher-level taxonomy is disputed, with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the infraorder Lemuriformes, while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in the superfamily Lemuroidea and all lorises and galagos in the superfamily Lorisoidea.|$|E

25|$|From {{the reports}} of discussions {{published}} by the society, {{it would appear that}} the majority of the members accepted that <b>evolution</b> <b>had</b> occurred. However the discussions rarely mentioned Darwin's most original contribution, his proposed mechanism of natural selection; Darwin's ideas were considered as an extension to those of Lamarck. In contrast, even the possibility that <b>evolution</b> <b>had</b> occurred was rarely mentioned in the discussions of other learned societies such as the Société Botanique, the Société Zoologique, the Société Géologique and the Académie des Sciences.|$|R

5|$|Evolutionary {{developmental}} biology ('Evo Devo') has assembled evidence from embryology and genetics {{to show how}} <b>evolution</b> <b>has</b> acted at all scales from the whole organism down to individual genes, proteins and genetic switches. In the case of countershaded mammals with dark (often brownish) upper parts and lighter (often buff or whitish) under parts, {{such as in the}} house mouse, it is the Agouti gene which creates the difference in shading. Agouti encodes for a protein, the Agouti signalling peptide (ASP), which specifically inhibits the action of the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). In the absence of the Agouti protein, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone stimulates the cells bearing MC1R, melanocytes, to produce dark eumelanin, colouring the skin and fur dark brown or black. In the presence of the Agouti protein, the same system produces the lighter-coloured, yellow or red phaeomelanin. A genetic switch active in the cells of the embryo that will become the belly skin causes the Agouti gene to become active there, creating the countershading seen in adult mammals.|$|E
5|$|Later {{chapters}} {{provide evidence}} that <b>evolution</b> <b>has</b> occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternate concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true cause) if three things could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, {{and its ability to}} explain a wide range of observations.|$|E
5|$|Michael Shermer {{argued in}} Scientific American in October 2006 that {{evolution}} supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes {{and the rule}} of law. He goes on to suggest that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist charges that <b>evolution</b> <b>has</b> led to moral relativism and the Holocaust yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect. Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust {{are more likely to be}} found in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in evolution.|$|E

5|$|Tuatara {{have been}} {{referred}} to as living fossils, which means they retain many basal characteristics from {{around the time of the}} squamate – rhynchocephalian split (220 MYA). However, taxonomic work on Sphenodontia has shown this group has undergone a variety of changes throughout the Mesozoic, and a March 2008 molecular study showed their rate of molecular <b>evolution</b> <b>has</b> been the fastest of any animal yet examined. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There was even a successful group of aquatic sphenodontians known as pleurosaurs, which differed markedly from living tuatara. Tuatara show cold weather adaptations that allow them to thrive on the islands of New Zealand; these adaptations may be unique to tuatara since their sphenodontian ancestors lived in the much warmer climates of the Mesozoic. For instance, Palaeopleurosaurus appears to have had a much shorter lifespan compared to the modern tuatara.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{asserts that}} there is a clear {{continuity}} from the earlier apes of five million years ago to the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and chimpanzees. He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor to a change in their ecological niche; the ancestors of chimpanzees remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution {{can be attributed to the}} physical environment, he also believes that one of the major forces shaping <b>evolution</b> <b>has</b> been the nature of human society itself.|$|E
