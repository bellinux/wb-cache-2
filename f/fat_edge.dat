40|$|INTRODUCTION We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for growing fat graphs. Traditionally, graph drawing algorithms represent vertices as circles and edges as closed curves connecting the vertices. The thickness of an edge {{is often used}} as a visualization cue, to indicate importance, or to convey some additional information. We show how to grow <b>fat</b> graphs with <b>edges</b> of variable thickness. For {{the purpose of the}} demonstration we focus on a restricted class of graphs that occur in VLSI wire routing. This class corresponds to planar, max-degree- 1 graphs. The underlying algorithm also extends to general planar graphs as shown in [2]. In VLSI wire routing it is often desirable to maximize the distance between di#erent wires. Maximizing the distance between wires is equivalent to finding the drawing in which the edges are drawn as thick as possible, i. e., allowing the graph to grow as fat as possible. The continuous homotopic routing problem [1, 3, 5] is a classic VLSI problem. The input is an initial s...|$|R
40|$|A quantum {{time-dependent}} spectrum analysis, or simply, quantum {{spectral analysis}} (QuSA) {{is presented in}} this work, and {{it is based on}} Schrodinger equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes how the quantum state of a non-relativistic physical system changes with time. In classic world is named frequency at time (FAT), which is presented here in opposition and as a complement of traditional spectral analysis frequency-dependent based on Fourier theory. Besides, FAT is a metric, which assesses the impact of the flanks of a signal on its frequency spectrum, which is not taken into account by Fourier theory and even less in real time. Even more, and unlike all derived tools from Fourier Theory (i. e., continuous, discrete, fast, short-time, fractional and quantum Fourier Transform, as well as, Gabor) FAT has the following advantages: a) compact support with excellent energy output treatment, b) low computational cost, O(N) for signals and O(N 2) for images, c) it does not have phase uncertainties (indeterminate phase for magnitude = 0) as Discrete and Fast Fourier Transform (DFT, FFT, respectively), d) among others. In fact, FAT constitutes one side of a triangle (which from now on is closed) and it consists of the original signal in time, spectral analysis based on Fourier Theory and FAT. Thus a toolbox is completed, which it is essential for all applications of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Digital Image Processing (DIP); and, even, in the latter, <b>FAT</b> allows <b>edge</b> detection (which is called flank detection in case of signals), denoising, despeckling, compression, and superresolution of still images. Such applications include signals intelligence and imagery intelligence. On the other hand, we will present other DIP tools, which are also derived from the Schrodinger equation.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{conventional}} fat-suppressed MR {{images of}} the breast to images derived from high spectral and spatial resolution MR data. Image quality {{and the level of}} fat suppression are compared qualitatively and quantitatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women with suspicious breast lesions found on X-ray mammography were imaged on 1. 5 Tesla GE SIGNA scanners. High spectral and spatial resolution (HiSS) data were acquired using echo-planar spectroscopic imaging. Images with intensity proportional to the water signal peak height in each voxel were synthesized. Conventional fat-suppressed images were acquired using a frequency selective inversion method. The experimental (HiSS) and conventional images were compared by experienced radiologists to evaluate the quality of fat suppression. In addition, fat suppression and image quality were evaluated quantitatively. RESULTS: <b>Fat</b> suppression, tumor <b>edge</b> delineation, lesion conspicuity, and image texture were improved in the peak height images derived from HiSS data. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that the water peak height images obtained from HiSS data potentially could improve the quality of fat suppression, detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. HiSS allowed detection of lesions and evaluation of lesion morphology prior to contrast media injection. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2006. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a solution to}} the Hello World case study [2] using GROOVE. We provide and explain the grammar that we used to solve the case study. Every requested question of the case study was solved by a single rule application. 1 GROOVE GROOVE 1 [1] is a general purpose graph transformation tool set that uses simple labelled graphs. The core functionality of GROOVE is to recursively apply all rules from a predefined set (the graph production system – GPS) to a given start graph, and to all graphs generated by such applications. This results in a state space consisting of the generated graphs. The main component of the GROOVE tool set is the Simulator, a graphical tool that integrates (among others) the functionalities of rule and host graph editing, and of interactive or automatic state space exploration. 1. 1 Host Graphs In GROOVE, the host graphs, i. e., the graphs to be transformed, are simple graphs with nodes and directed labelled edges. In simple graphs, edges do not have an identity, and therefore parallel edges (i. e., edges with same label, and source and target nodes) are not allowed. Also, for the same reason, edges may not have attributes. In the graphical representation, nodes are depicted as rectangles and edges as binary arrows between two nodes. Node labels can be either node types or flags. Node types [resp. flags] are displayed in bold [resp. italic] inside a node rectangle. 1. 2 Rules The transformation rules in GROOVE are represented by a single graph and colours and shapes are used to distinguish different elements. Figure 1 shows a small example rule. • Readers. The black (continuous thin) nodes and edges must be present in the host graph for the rule to be applicable and are preserved by the rule application; • Embargoes. The red (dashed <b>fat)</b> nodes and <b>edges</b> must be absent in the host graph for the rule to be applicable...|$|R
