5|$|Another fleet {{operation}} {{took place}} on 18–19 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four König-class battleships remained in III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships, including Friedrich der <b>Grosse,</b> were transferred to IV Squadron. In March 1917 the new battleship , built to serve as fleet flagship, entered service; on the 17th, Scheer hauled down his flag from Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> and transferred it to Baden. On 4–5 July, crewmen aboard Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> staged a hunger strike in protest over the poor quality and insufficient quantity of the food they were given. The ship's officers relented, fed the crew a meal of groat soup and agreed to form a Menagekommission, a council that gave the enlisted men a voice in their ration selection and preparation. Further insubordination on several vessels followed on 11 July, and the ringleaders were arrested and put on trial. Max Reichpietsch, a stoker from Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> {{was sentenced to death}} and executed by firing squad on 5 September in Cologne.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> {{participated in}} the {{ceremonial}} transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control {{in the summer of}} 1890. She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel. The II Division, including Friedrich der <b>Grosse,</b> served as the training squadron in the winter of 1890–1891. The squadron again cruised the Mediterranean, under the command of Rear Admiral Wilhelm Schröder. Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> again saw service in the II Division in the winter of 1891–1892 and the 1892 maneuvers, under the command of Rear Admiral Hans Koester.|$|E
5|$|Preussen and Friedrich der <b>Grosse,</b> {{which were}} {{laid down in}} 1870 and 1869, respectively, were {{completed}} {{much more quickly than}} Grosser Kurfürst. Preussen was launched on 22 November 1873, while Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> was launched on 20 September 1874. The former was completed by July 1876 and commissioned into the fleet on 4 July, and the latter joined the fleet 22 November 1877. Preussens construction process, six years long, was much shorter than either of her sisters; Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> required eight years to complete, while work Grosser Kurfürst lasted for a decade. The delays associated with redesigning Grosser Kurfürst contributed to the significantly longer construction process, though this was compounded by the shipbuilders assigned to each ship. Grosser Kurfürst and Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> were built by recently created Imperial shipyards, while Preussen was built by an established dockyard.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} until 1896, though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted {{with the exception of}} the mid-1880s, when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels. She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, often escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on official state visits. The ship was removed from active service in 1896, after which she was used in secondary roles until 1919, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold to a scrapyard. Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> was broken up for scrap the following year.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel; her keel was laid in 1871 under {{construction}} number 1. The ship was launched on 20 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 22 November 1877. Although laid down a year before her sister , Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> was not completed until a year after; this was because she was built at a newly established and inexperienced Imperial Dockyard, while Preussen was built by AG Vulcan, an experienced private shipbuilder. The ship cost the German government 7,303,000gold marks.|$|E
5|$|In January and February 1905, Kaiser Karl der <b>Grosse</b> served {{briefly as}} the {{flagship}} of the squadron. During this period, she {{took part in}} a pair of training cruises with the I Squadron during 9–19 January and 27 February– 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. While on the cruise on 18 July, Kaiser Karl der <b>Grosse</b> was detached to visit Antwerp to represent Germany during the celebrations for the 75th anniversary of the Belgian Revolution. The rest of the fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm; Kaiser Karl der <b>Grosse</b> rejoined them on 3 August in Karlskrona. The summer cruise ended on 9 August, though the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month.|$|E
5|$|Ordered {{under the}} {{contract}} name Ersatz Heimdall {{as a replacement}} for the obsolete coastal defense ship , Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> was laid down at the AG Vulcan dockyard in Hamburg on 26 January 1910. She was launched on 10 June 1911, after which AG Vulcan conducted builder's trials. At her launching ceremony, Princess Alexandra Victoria performed the christening and Field Marshal Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz gave a speech. She was then transferred to Wilhelmshaven and commissioned into the fleet on 15 October 1912. Exercises in the Baltic Sea followed; Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> then went to Kiel for final fitting-out work. On 22 January 1913, the ship was finally ready for active service. She cost the German government 45,802,000marks.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} the morning of 12 October, when Moltke and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on Ösel. The coastal artillery in both locations were quickly silenced by the battleships' heavy guns. On the morning of the 14th, Friedrich der <b>Grosse,</b> Kaiserin, and König Albert were detached to support German troops advancing toward Anseküll. The three ships fired on the battery at Zerel for an hour, which prompted most of the Russian gun crews to flee their posts.|$|E
5|$|After Germany's {{defeat in}} {{the war and the}} signing of the Armistice in November 1918, Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the British Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were {{disarmed}} and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated {{the final version of the}} Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> was raised in 1936 and broken up for scrap metal. Her bell was returned to Germany in 1965 and is now located at the Fleet Headquarters in Glücksburg.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of night engagements between the I Squadron battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; five of the I Squadron battleships took up {{defensive}} positions in the outer roadstead, and Kaiser, Kaiserin, Prinzregent Luitpold, and Kronprinz stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The rest of the fleet entered Wilhelmshaven, where Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> and the other ships still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. In {{the course of the}} battle, Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> had fired 72 main battery shells and 151 rounds from her secondary guns. She emerged from the battle completely undamaged.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1910, {{the ships}} {{of the class}} were heavily rebuilt, with the {{exception}} of Kaiser Karl der <b>Grosse.</b> During the modernization, the ships had their superstructures cut down. Four 15cm guns and one torpedo tube were also removed. The ships' 8.8cm guns were repositioned to the upper decks where the 15cm guns had been located. Also, the smoke stacks were lengthened.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Kaiser {{had fired}} 224 heavy battery and 41 {{secondary}} battery shells; Kaiserin fired 160 and 135 respectively, Prinzregent Luitpold fired 169 and 106 respectively, and Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> fired 72 and 151 shells, respectively. Kaiser was hit twice by heavy-caliber shells during the battle, the only ship {{of the class}} to have been hit; however the ship only suffered a single wounded casualty.|$|E
5|$|Preussen and Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> {{remained}} in the armored squadron for the training cruises starting in 1879 through 1883, when they were put into reserve and replaced by newer vessels, including the four s. The two ships were reactivated in 1889 to participate in cruises following the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II. These included a state visit to Great Britain in August 1889 and {{a tour of the}} Mediterranean in the winter of 1889–1890. The two ships resumed their duties in the training cycles into the early 1890s. Although Preussen was withdrawn from active service in 1891, Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> continued to serve until the end of 1894. Upon leaving active duty, both ships were used in secondary roles as harbor ships and later as coal hulks for torpedo boats. They were both ultimately sold for scrapping in 1919 following the end of World War I. Both vessels were broken up by 1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} the morning of 12 October, when Moltke and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while König Albert and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on Ösel. The coastal artillery in both locations were quickly silenced by the battleships' heavy guns. On the morning of the 14th, König Albert, Friedrich der <b>Grosse,</b> and Kaiserin were detached to support German troops advancing toward Anseküll. König Albert and Kaiserin were assigned to suppress a Russian battery at Zerel, though heavy fog delayed them from engaging the target. The Russians opened fire first, which was quickly returned by the two ships. Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> came to the two ships' assistance and the three battleships fired a total of 120 large-caliber shells at the battery at Zerel over the span of an hour. The battleships' gunfire prompted most of the Russian gun crews to flee their posts.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Kaiser Karl der <b>Grosse</b> and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914. The ships were prepared for war very slowly, and they were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August. They were initially tasked with coastal defense, though they served in this capacity for a short time. In mid-September, the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic, under the command of Prince Heinrich. He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on Windau, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, the V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. Kaiser Karl der <b>Grosse</b> and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. Before the end of the year, the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|Best {{remembered the}} Indra {{as being a}} {{depressing}} place that {{was filled with a}} few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller, a club also owned by Koschmider and located nearby at 36 <b>Grosse</b> Freiheit. After the closure of the Indra because of complaints about the noise, the Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller, starting on 4 October 1960.|$|E
5|$|By 20 October, the {{fighting}} on the islands was winding down; Moon, Ösel, and Dagö were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions {{and the return of}} the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On 27 October, Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> was detached from the Baltic and returned to the North Sea. Upon her return, she resumed guard duties. The ship participated in the fruitless advance to Norway on 23–25 April 1918. Afterward, she went into drydock for extensive maintenance, which lasted from 26 July to 28 September.|$|E
5|$|Ferrell {{was married}} to Ruth Virginia Wilson from 1941 until her death in 1968. Together they had four children, two sons and two daughters. His family first lived in Greensboro, then later in <b>Grosse</b> Pointe, Michigan. He lived in Troy, Michigan for the {{remaining}} 18 years of his life, until he was admitted into a nursing home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. It was here that he died of arrhythmia on July 27, 1995, and is interred at New Garden Cemetery in Greensboro, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{was lost}} in 1878 during {{maneuvers}} shortly after her commissioning, when a pair of small sailing boats crossed the bows of Grosser Kurfürst and , which caused both ships to undertake emergency maneuvers. In the confusion, König Wilhelm collided with Grosser Kurfürst, causing the latter to sink. Both Preussen and Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> served in the fleet until the 1890s, when they were relegated to secondary duties, including serving as harbor ships, and later as coal hulks. The ships were eventually scrapped {{following the end of}} World War I, in 1919 and 1920, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser Wilhelm der <b>Grosse</b> {{served in}} the main fleet—the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet) and later the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet)—for the first seven years of her career. She participated {{in several of the}} fleet's {{training}} cruises and maneuvers, primarily in the North and Baltic Seas. Her peacetime career was relatively uneventful and she suffered no accidents. She was decommissioned for a major reconstruction in 1908–10, after which she was assigned to the Reserve Division with her four sister ships.|$|E
5|$|M-102 {{was first}} {{designated}} along 8Mile Road from US10 (Woodward Avenue, now M-1) to US25 (Gratiot Avenue, now M-3) in late 1928 or early 1929. In 1939, the eastern terminus was moved as M-102 was extended along 8Mile and Vernier Roads {{to end in}} <b>Grosse</b> Pointe Shores at M-29 (Jefferson Avenue). The highway was extended in the early 1940s from Woodward westward to US16 (Grand River Avenue, now M-5).|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer {{replaced}} von Pohl, who {{was suffering}} from liver cancer. A week later on the 18th, Scheer hoisted his flag aboard Friedrich der <b>Grosse.</b> Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5–7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the Hoofden. On 25–26 March, Scheer attempted to attack British forces that had raided Tondern, but failed to locate them. Another advance to Horns Reef followed on 21–22 April.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles arrived {{very early}} in the morning of 17 August 1960, but had no trouble finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg, as it was so infamous. Unfortunately the Indra Club (64 <b>Grosse</b> Freiheit) was closed, so a manager from a {{neighbouring}} club found someone to open it up, and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves. The group played at the club on the same night, but were told they could sleep in a small cinema's storeroom, which was cold and in very poor condition, the Bambi Kino (33 Paul-Roosen Strasse).|$|E
5|$|The {{record was}} {{produced}} by Marilyn Manson and Sköld, with co-production from Ben <b>Grosse.</b> Musically, it is less metallic as the band's earlier work, instead being more electronic and beat-driven. This was done to avoid creating music similar to nu metal, a then-predominant genre of hard rock which the vocalist considered cliché. Manson collaborated with artist Gottfried Helnwein to create several projects associated with the album, including Doppelherz, a 25-minute surrealist short film which was released on limited edition units of the record as a bonus DVD. The Golden Age of Grotesque was also {{the title of the}} Manson's first art exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The {{two sides}} commemorated their dead in very {{different}} ways. Various mostly unofficial memorials were {{set up on the}} western side by people seeking to commemorate victims of the border. West Germans such as Michael Gartenschläger and Kurt Lichtenstein were commemorated with signs and memorials, some of which were supported by the government. The death of East German Heinz-Josef <b>Große</b> in 1982 was commemorated annually by demonstrations on the Western side of the border. After the policy of détente was initiated in the 1970s, this became politically inconvenient and state support for border memorials largely ceased.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{nationalism}} and secularism {{were two of}} the six founding principles of the Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the leader of {{the early decades of the}} Republic, aimed to create a nation state (Turkish: Ulus) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. During the first three decades of the Republic, efforts to Turkify geographical names were a recurring theme. Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia, Kurdistan, or Lazistan (the official name of the province of Rize until 1921) were prohibited (as was the case with Der <b>Grosse</b> Weltatlas, a map published in Leipzig).|$|E
5|$|American Tragedy is {{the second}} studio album by American rap rock band Hollywood Undead. Production for the album began {{following}} the induction of Daniel Murillo into the band in early 2010 and lasted until December. Don Gilmore and Ben <b>Grosse,</b> who helped produce the band's debut album, Swan Songs (2008), also returned to produce the album along with several other producers including Kevin Rudolf, Sam Hollander, Dave Katz, Griffin Boice, Jeff Halavacs, and Jacob Kasher. The album is musically heavier and features darker lyrical content than the band's previous effort. Originally set to release in March, American Tragedy was released on April5, 2011 in the United States and was released on various other dates that month in other countries. A remix of the album, American Tragedy Redux, was released on November 21, 2011.|$|E
5|$|At Columbia, John R. Dunning {{believed}} {{that this was the}} case, but Fermi was not so sure. The only way to settle this was to obtain a sample of uranium 235 and test it. He got Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota to prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, 235 and 238 using a mass spectrometer. These were ready in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von <b>Grosse</b> then carried out a series of experiments. They demonstrated that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, the battleship and her sisters were placed back in active service as the V Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet and tasked with coastal defense in the North Sea. They were also deployed briefly to the Baltic but saw no action. In 1915, the ships were again withdrawn from service and relegated to secondary duties. Kaiser Wilhelm der <b>Grosse</b> {{was used as a}} depot ship in Kiel and eventually a torpedo target ship. After the war, the Treaty of Versailles greatly reduced the size of the German Navy. The vessel was sold for scrapping to a German company and broken up in 1920.|$|E
5|$|By May 1878, {{all three}} Preussen-class ships {{were ready for}} the annual summer {{maneuvers}} of the armored squadron. The three ships were joined by the large armored frigate , and operated {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Batsch. Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> missed the maneuvers after running aground off Nyborg, leaving Batsch just three vessels. While steaming in the English Channel on 31 May, König Wilhelm accidentally rammed Grosser Kurfürst; the latter quickly sank with the loss of between 269 and 276 men. Her loss spurred a series of investigations into the circumstances of the collision, which ultimately resulted in the acquittal of both Rear Admiral Carl Ferdinand Batsch, the squadron commander, and Count Alexander von Monts, the captain of Grosser Kurfürst. Political infighting over the affair led to ouster of Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner from the navy.|$|E
5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{was lost}} in 1878 during {{maneuvers}} shortly after her commissioning, when a pair of small sailing boats crossed the bows of Grosser Kurfürst and König Wilhelm, which caused both ships to undertake emergency maneuvers. In the confusion, König Wilhelm collided with Grosser Kurfürst, causing the latter to sink. Over two hundred men {{were killed in the}} sinking, which resulted in tremendous political infighting in the Navy and the eventual forced retirement of Admiral Reinhold von Werner. Both Preussen and Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> served in the fleet until the 1890s, when they were relegated to secondary duties, including serving as harbor ships, and later as coal hulks. The ships were eventually scrapped following the end of World War I, in 1919 and 1920, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In May 1888, Kaiser {{represented}} Germany at Barcelona's World Fair, {{which held}} a naval review. During {{the summer of}} 1889, Kaiser joined the fleet that steamed to Great Britain to celebrate the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II; the ship joined her sister Deutschland and the turret ships Preussen and Friedrich der <b>Grosse</b> in the II Division. The fleet then held training maneuvers in the North Sea under command of Rear Admiral Friedrich Hollmann. Kaiser {{and the rest of}} the II Division became the training squadron for the fleet in 1889–1890, the first year the Kaiserliche Marine maintained a year-round ironclad force. The squadron escorted Wilhelm II's imperial yacht to the Mediterranean; the voyage included state visits to Italy and the Ottoman Empire. The squadron remained in the Mediterranean until April 1890, when it returned to Germany.|$|E
