40|$|BACKGROUND: Colorectal {{cancer is}} (CRC) {{one of the}} commonest cancers and its therapy is still based on few drugs. Currently, no {{biological}} criteria are used to choose the most effective of the established drugs for treatment. METHODS: A panel of 77 CRC cell lines was tested for sensitivity to 5 -fluorouracil (5 FU) using the SRB assay. The responses were grouped into three categories and correlated with genetic changes in the cell lines. RESULTS: The strongest and most clearcut correlation was between 5 -fluorouracil response and replication <b>error</b> <b>status</b> (mismatch repair deficiency). All the other significant correlations (loss of heterozygosity for DCC and mutations in TGFbIIR) are secondary to the association with replication <b>error</b> <b>status.</b> INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings validate previous analyses based mainly on clinical data, and indicate that replication <b>error</b> <b>status</b> could be a useful guide to 5 -fluorouracil-based CRC therapy. Essentially, all previously described correlations with 5 FU response are secondary to the association with replication <b>error</b> <b>status...</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the aesthetic and pedagogical potential of error as it emerges in the poetry and criticism of Anne Carson. At stake is <b>error's</b> <b>status</b> {{as a viable}} alternative to irony, which I argue is an ethically problematic stance employed both in literary practice and the classroom. Carson's obsession with mistakes makes available a mode of engagement with texts and students that refuses the cool distance of ironic detachment. Irony is a dialectical strategy that allows speakers not to commit to critical stances or emotional positions. It puts readers and students on their guard. Invoking error, on the other hand, allows us to discuss a wider range of cognitive, ethical, and emotional events in which we commit or invest in ways generally considered wrong. This thesis has two chapters. The first argues that Carson's poetry engages such phenomena as impersonation, mistranslation, and catachresis in order to stage a poetics of error. The second moves from rhetorical to relational concerns, foregrounding Carson's status as a professor of the humanities in order to draw out the pedagogical consequences spurred by her poetics...|$|R

30|$|The Go {{run-time}} {{system has}} been changed to modify error handling in channels. As described early in this paper, Clive channels can be closed with an error indication and may be closed both by senders and receivers. This suffices to let the programs use channels that are bridged through external devices like pipes and network connections. A few primitives {{were added to the}} runtime to support sending with a boolean return status, calling close with an optional error argument, and retrieving the <b>error</b> <b>status</b> for a channel. Also, the implementation for send, receive, and select had to change to disregard sends and receives on closed channels, without panicking, and returning an error in the case of sends.|$|E
50|$|One use of {{feedback}} {{is to make}} a system (say T) self-regulating to minimize the effect of a disturbance (say D). Using a negative feedback loop, a measurement of some variable (for example, a process variable, say E) is subtracted from a required value (the 'set point') to estimate an operational <b>error</b> in system <b>status,</b> which is then used by a regulator (say R) to reduce the gap between the measurement and the required value. The regulator modifies the input to the system T according to its interpretation of the <b>error</b> in the <b>status</b> of the system. This error may be introduced by a variety of possible disturbances or 'upsets', some slow and some rapid. The regulation in such systems can range from a simple 'on-off' control to a more complex processing of the error signal.|$|R

This paper focuses on the VHDL implementation of UART with status register which supports asynchronous serial communication. The paper presents the architecture of UART which indicates, during reception of data, parity error, framing error, overrun error and break <b>error</b> using <b>status</b> register.

30|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a closed-form {{analytical}} framework to assess LMP change {{in response to}} line <b>status</b> <b>error</b> when a single transmission line is congested. The developed framework provides system operators with a computationally efficient analysis tool because it requires only local information related to the congested line, such as marginal cost and GSF. Using this framework, system operators quickly evaluate the sensitivity of LMP to changes in marginal cost and GSF in an online manner. Simulation results provide insights into {{the identification of the}} most (or least) influential transmission line on LMP change and the most (or least) economically sensitive bus to any line <b>status</b> <b>error</b> in an entire power system. The proposed framework can be primarily used as an offline tool using historical data to quantify and predict the impact of topology data attacks on LMP, as well as provide guidelines for robust generation company’s bidding strategy/network planning and the prioritization of sensor upgrade against topology data attacks.|$|R
30|$|In {{wireline}} networks, FFQ and PFQ provide delay bound, minimum throughput, and fairness. Packet {{losses in}} wireline networks are very rare. In contrast, there are location-dependent channel errors in wireless networks. This {{is due to}} the distance between the transmitter and receiver, and users' move causes fading, interference, and shadowing phenomenon. When the packet is transmitted in <b>error</b> <b>status,</b> the transmission fails and wastes the system's resource. The prediction mechanism can predict the next channel state. If the flow will be fallen into error state, the system swaps the flow with another error-free flow. It happens that the backlogged flow is unable to transmit due to channel error. This causes unfairness problem. Thus, the wireless fair queueing must compensate the lost service for the flow.|$|E

Hence, here we propose a distributed algorithm in that helps finding out the erroneous nodes and removing them from the network so as to prevent faulty data from entering the network. This algorithm is implemented in stages, i. e. first the node readings are compared to its previous values to check consistency of data and then it is disseminate to its neighboring nodes to check their <b>error</b> <b>status</b> and subsequently remove them from the network...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple overmodulation method employed in direct torque control (DTC) -constant switching frequency (CSF) controller of induction machines.

It will be shown that the overmodulation operation using the DTC-CSF scheme can be established by controlling the stator flux locus from circular to the hexagonal shape. This is achieved by modifying the flux <b>error</b> <b>status</b> produced from flux hysteresis controller, before it is being fed to the look-up table.

40|$|Abstract [...] - Exchange rate {{prediction}} is a challenging {{topic in the}} recent decade. Various {{studies have been done}} to improve the prediction regarding the accuracy in terms of level <b>error</b> and directional <b>status</b> <b>error.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} introduce a methodology that uses KNN (K-nearest neighbors) and DTW (dynamic time warping) to improve the fluctuation prediction and to have better evaluation parameters in the literature of financial market forecasting, comparing to other researches. The study is done with USD/JPY(United States Dollar/Japanese Yen) exchange rate time series and the results show improvement of prediction regarding the direction of time series. USD/JPY exchange rates are gathered from 1971 to 2012 and are partitioned into 30 element segments regarding the monthly cyclic behavior of the time series. Then two different set of these 30 element segments are divided with 7 : 3 ratio and the KNN is used to find out the 3 nearest neighbors regarding the DTW as similarity function. By a chosen function introduced also in this research, the directional status of the last element is predicted and the prediction result is then compared with other results in the literature of exchange rate prediction...|$|R
