50|$|Between 2000 and 2003, the Rhaetian Railway radically modernised the Gem 4/4s, which, in {{more than}} just their {{external}} appearance, had become noticeably affected by many years of hard use. During their rebuilding, both locomotives were fitted with new Cummins diesel engines, each with an output of , and they also received new <b>drivers</b> <b>cabs</b> and computerised control electronics.|$|E
50|$|From 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet {{was further}} updated, with the {{introduction}} of Zürich's variant of the Tram 2000 design used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without <b>drivers</b> <b>cabs</b> that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} body {{consisted of}} single bridging slab. On this slab the - partly dismountable - body parts were fixed with screws.The bridging slab {{laid on the}} bogies using pivot bearings located under the <b>drivers</b> <b>cabs.</b> Beside those two spring-loaded bearings were mounted at the outer part of the body. Additionally bearings with rolls were located inside of the body behind the motors.On the bogies - {{in front of the}} cabs - cabinets were mounted. Those cabinets were separated by a center gangway. This gangway - as the crossover-plate and the front door - were considered as necessary to access the locomotive from the train at that time.For the ventilation of the motors two - from both cabs -pneumatically controlled blinds were mounted at both sides of the body.|$|E
50|$|The {{front of}} the <b>driver's</b> <b>cabs</b> are made from 4 mm thick steel plate. The front window panes can be {{utilised}} {{on either side of}} the locomotive, and are simply glued into the body without window frame. The roof of the <b>driver's</b> <b>cab</b> is part of the body, not the roof. The four doors on the sides lead directly into the <b>driver's</b> <b>cabs</b> and are made of light alloy.|$|R

50|$|The cars {{featured}} {{two small}} <b>driver's</b> <b>cabs</b> at both ends, which housed the vertical engines and transmission groups. The two platforms behind the <b>driver's</b> <b>cabs</b> were not identical; the first one, giving {{access to a}} small lavatory, was bigger and fitted with some folding seats; {{the one on the}} opposite side had a small luggage compartment. Both could be accessed by one door {{on each side of the}} car, giving access in turn to the <b>driver's</b> <b>cab</b> and the main passenger compartment.|$|R
50|$|The C20F has air {{conditioning}} {{in both the}} <b>driver's</b> <b>cab</b> and the passenger compartments, whereas the C20 has {{air conditioning}} in the <b>driver's</b> <b>cab</b> only. The exterior of the C20F differs by having smooth trolley sub-frames instead of the corrugated trolley sub-frames present in the C20.|$|R
50|$|On {{the roof}} of the each <b>driver's</b> <b>cab</b> are two {{whistles}}, which produce warning sounds of 370 and 660 Hz. These whistles are activated via a pressure valve located {{on the floor of the}} <b>cab</b> near the <b>driver's</b> feet, or via pneumatic pushbuttons located around the <b>driver's</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>driver's</b> <b>cab</b> was {{initially}} built with a tapered front and conical smokebox doors {{in order to}} reduce wind resistance. An unfortunate side effect of the streamlined <b>driver's</b> <b>cab,</b> however, was that the engine crew were dazzled at night by reflexions from the diagonally oriented front window panes. From 1908/1909 the cab was built with a flat front.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} variants were procured: C4ymg-51 (later Bylb 421), BC4yg (later ABylb 411), CPwymg-51, a {{large number}} of which were fitted with <b>driver's</b> <b>cabs</b> for push-pull operations and designated as CPwygmf (later BDylbf 456). The <b>driver's</b> <b>cab</b> end of the coach had an inset entrance located one compartment-length from the end {{to make room for the}} cab.|$|R
50|$|The first 44 {{locomotives}} had no side tanks. Water was {{stored in}} a well tank, and coal in the <b>driver's</b> <b>cab.</b> The last nine locomotives, on the other hand, had short tanks on either side, {{in front of the}} <b>driver's</b> <b>cab.</b> That increased water capacity from 1.8 to 2.3 m2 and coal capacity from 0.5 to 0.8 t.|$|R
