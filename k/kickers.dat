The <b>kicker</b> modulator was upgraded and installed in August 1995. Since then, the <b>kicker</b> modulator has shown very reliable and stable performance. The <b>kicker</b> modulator specifications are ~ 6. 0 µs full width, ~ 24 kA peak current, and 10 Hz repetition rate. Output current waveform is a half sinusoid. Two thyratron switches (EEV CX- 1536 AX) {{are used in the}} <b>kicker</b> modulator. Total accumulated thyratron heater run time is about 14, 000 hours as of February 1998.

He also set a league record with 6 touchdowns on special teams.|$|E

5|$|The first {{sporting}} {{event at the}} stadium was a double-header on July 28, 2002, that included both the Sounders Select Women and the men's Seattle Sounders of the USL team. The women defeated the Vancouver Breakers 4–3, while the men beat the Vancouver Whitecaps 4–1 in front of 25,515 people. The USL team began using the facility regularly as their home field in 2003. Although team management was concerned with the high rent and the underused seating capacity, they were drawn by the sponsorship opportunities and location. The Sounders increased their average attendance from 2,583 at Seattle's Memorial Stadium in 2002 to 3,452 at the new stadium in 2003. In 2005, the Sounders beat the Richmond <b>Kickers</b> 2–1 in a penalty shootout for the USL championship in front of 8,011. Scott Jenkins scored the final goal and announced his retirement after the game.|$|E
5000|$|In {{gridiron}} football, roughing the <b>kicker</b> is {{an action}} {{in which a}} defender, having missed an attempt to block a kick, tackles the <b>kicker</b> or otherwise runs into the <b>kicker</b> {{in a way that}} might injure the <b>kicker</b> or his vulnerable extended kicking leg.

50|$|In {{the sports}} of American {{football}} or Canadian football, {{the act of}} icing the <b>kicker</b> or freezing the <b>kicker</b> is a tactic employed by defending teams to disrupt the process of kicking a field goal {{just prior to the}} snap. Typically, either a player or a coach on the defending team will call time out just as the <b>kicker</b> is about to attempt a game-tying or game-winning field goal. This is intended to either stop the kick immediately as the <b>kicker</b> is mentally prepared, or allow for the <b>kicker</b> to kick immediately after the timeout so that the initial kick does not count, in an attempt to mentally disrupt the <b>kicker</b> for the actual kick.|$|R

5|$|Cardiff won {{the coin}} toss and elected to kick first. Ben Blair and Julien Dupuy, the goal-kickers {{used during the}} match {{were the first to}} attempt kicks for their {{respective}} sides, were both successful. The teams then nominated other players on their team who had experience at goal-kicking, both teams being successful with their second and third kicks. Cardiff's fourth player Ceri Sweeney, was also an experienced goal-kicker and was successful; however, Leicester selected Johne Murphy, who was not a regular kicker, and he missed to make the score 4–3 after four of the five rounds. This meant if Cardiff were successful with their next kick, they would have an unassailable lead and would win the match. With no more experienced goal <b>kickers</b> to choose from, winger Tom James stepped up to take the kick, but missed, allowing Leicester the chance to draw level. Scott Hamilton scored with his kick to bring the scores to 4–4 after five kicks and take the shoot-out to sudden death. The teams were both successful with their next two kicks, including Craig Newby for Leicester who was the first forward to take a kick in the shoot-out. With all seven backs having already attempted a kick, Cardiff were required to select a forward player for their eighth kick, and chose flanker Martyn Williams. He missed, giving Leicester the chance to win the match if they were successful with their eighth kick. Number 8 Jordan Crane was selected for the attempt and was successful, resulting in Leicester winning the shoot-out 7–6 and advancing to the 2009 Heineken Cup Final.|$|E
