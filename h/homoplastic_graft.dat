40|$|The article (the {{first one}} of five) {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the 1 st and 2 nd chapters from V. P. Demikhov's monograph "Transplantation of vital organs in experiment" (MedGIz Publisher, Moscow, 1960), the chapters presenting a brief literature review and methodological background of the problem. In his review, the author reported the available literature data on the subject of his research, and focused his attention rather on substantiating the ways of biological regulation of the transplant immunity in <b>homoplastic</b> <b>graft</b> transplantations than on the technical aspects of homoplastic organ and tissue transplantation that were a passed stage for him. The study of the methodological approaches used by V. P. Demikhov has shown that he well-mastered all previously developed methods of organ transplantation considering the views of contemporary immunology, and also offered his own scientific and practical solutions for various aspects of vascular suture, the ways to overcome the biological tissue incompatibility, the issues of cardiac anesthesiology and cardiac critical care. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Homoplastic</b> <b>grafts</b> of re-orientated unsegmented {{paraxial}} mesoderm transplanted from stage 20 Xenopus embryos into host embryos of {{the same}} age resulted in segmentation and the formation of somites in the same axis {{as if they had been}} left in situ. Because grafts transplanted with various orientations came under the stretching effect of the notochord in different directions but never the less maintained their original pattern and direction of segmentation, it would appear that the notochord has no effect on somite formation which thus emerges as an autonomous process independent of the elongation of the embryo. The re-alignment of cells which occurs as the somites are formed and which, in normal unimpeded development, results in the long axis of the cells lying parallel to that of the notochord, is considered in the light of the evolution of sinusoid locomotion and it is suggested that it may be the primary process with the formation of somite blocks as one of its consequences...|$|R
40|$|The writers {{describe}} {{the technique of}} posterior hemiresection in parosteal osteosarcoma of the distal femur by means of two incisions, medial and lateral. In not previously operated cases, this operation permits wide excision and offers a good guarantee of cure. The stability and mobility of the knee remain intact. The strength of the remaining bone can be increased by autoplastic and <b>homoplastic</b> bone <b>grafts...</b>|$|R
40|$|After {{an average}} follow up of six years, the writers {{reviewed}} {{the results of}} ninety operations for idiopathic flat foot treated by Grice's operation combined with reconstruction of the glenoid ligament and anterior transposition of the tibialis posterior. Eleven parameters (clinical, plantographic and radiographic) were used for objective assessment of the initial and residual deformity, a numerical code being given to each. The results were excellent or good in 88 per cent of the patients. The initial severity of the condition {{and the presence of}} ligamentous laxity either generalised or localised to the ankle joint, had an adverse effect on the results. The technique of Grice's operation is extremely important. The results are always excellent or good when the sinus tarsi is widely opened up and the bone graft correctly placed. Anterior transposition of the tibialis posterior improved the results in 26 per cent of cases: elongation of the Achilles tendon was only rarely necessary. The type of graft had no effect on the results: <b>homoplastic</b> <b>grafts</b> are therefore preferable since they cause less inconvenience. Surgical intervention before the age of four years is a mistake: the best results are obtained between nine and thirteen years...|$|R
40|$|During the {{treatment}} of 372 basicervical, pertrochanteric and su-trochanteric fractures which were ostheosynthesized using a DBP nail-plate, the Authors diagnosed 13 cases of pseudoarthrosis. They therefore propose {{the use of a}} new form of osteosynthesis in marked valgism, possibly in association with subtrochanteric osteotomy and with the application of autoplastic and 7 or <b>homoplastic</b> refrigerated bone <b>grafts...</b>|$|R
40|$|In autoplastic transplanted nerves a {{degenerative}} process occurs which {{resembles the}} ordinary Wallerian degeneration, but appears {{a little more}} slowly than the latter. The cells of Schwann are in a condition of survival and are capable of multiplication after the transplantation. In homoplastic transplanted nerves I have found a degenerative process resembling a Wallerian degeneration, somewhat delayed. The cells of Schwann multiply, and for some time at least are in a condition of survival. After twelve to fourteen days an abundant and increasing immigration of lymphocytes is observed, and from the eighteenth day the cells of Schwann develop a necrobiotic appearance. In heteroplastic transplanted nerves numerous myelin ovoids are formed during the first four to five days, {{but there is no}} proliferation of the cells of Schwann, and no Wallerian degeneration is seen. The graft becomes necrotic within about two weeks. The formation of ovoids that occurs during the first four to five days after the performance of the heteroplastic transplantation does not reveal the condition {{of the life of the}} graft. This formation of myelin ovoids is found in the nerve fibers when they have been kept in an incubator for twenty-four hours in Ringer solution (Nageotte 12) or in homologous or heterologous serum, but it is not found in the fibers after their incubation in isotonic salt solution (Nageotte), the presence of calcium being necessary for the occurrence of ovoid formation. Heteroplastic transplanted nerves become necrotic. They are unsuitable for bridges in cases of nerve defects, and my results explain the failure of the attempts at heteroplastic transplantation of nerves in human beings. If we wish to bridge a nerve defect by implantation we must use autoplastic or <b>homoplastic</b> <b>grafts.</b> The occurrence of a Wallerian degeneration in these grafts during the first two to three weeks after the transplantation should make bridging a promising operation; for in this period the grafts resemble the peripheral part of a divided nerve and must be assumed to be capable of regeneration, and thus are very different from dead material. I have studied the process of regeneration, and shall communicate in a future article my results of bridging defects, which are encouraging as far as the function is concerned. My results with homoplastic transplantation of nerves have a bearing on the homoplastic transplantation of limbs, which has been successfully performed in dogs by Carrel. None of his dogs lived long enough to show any function of the transplanted leg. The practical value of this operation is dependent, of course, upon the return of function, and especially on the regeneration of the nerves in the transplanted leg. The results with homoplastic transplantation of nerves seem to indicate the possibility of a regeneration of the nerves in a homoplastic transplanted leg...|$|R
