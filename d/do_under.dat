25|$|Mechanical {{acceleration}} including vibration, centrifugation and agitation {{are sometimes}} used. They subject {{the product to}} different forces that pushes the particles / droplets against one another, hence helping in the film drainage. However, some emulsions would never coalesce in normal gravity, while they <b>do</b> <b>under</b> artificial gravity. Moreover, segregation of different populations of particles have been highlighted when using centrifugation and vibration.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main types of orchiectomy: simple, subcapsular, and inguinal. The first two types are usually <b>done</b> <b>under</b> local or {{epidural}} anesthesia, and take about 30 minutes to perform. An inguinal orchiectomy is sometimes <b>done</b> <b>under</b> general anesthesia, and takes from 30 {{minutes to an}} hour to complete.|$|R

25|$|Expression {{profiling}} provides {{new information}} about what genes <b>do</b> <b>under</b> various conditions. Overall, microarray technology produces reliable expression profiles. From this information one can generate new hypotheses about biology or test existing ones. However, the size and complexity of these experiments often results {{in a wide variety}} of possible interpretations. In many cases, analyzing expression profiling results takes far more effort than performing the initial experiments.|$|E

25|$|Karma is {{a concept}} in Hinduism which {{explains}} causality through a system where beneficial effects are derived from past beneficial actions and harmful effects from past harmful actions, creating a system of actions and reactions throughout a soul's (Atman's) reincarnated lives forming a cycle of rebirth.

25|$|Although {{a monster}} movie, {{the central theme}} explores what {{ordinary}} people will be driven to <b>do</b> <b>under</b> extraordinary circumstances. The plot revolves around members of {{the small town of}} Bridgton, Maine who, after a severe thunderstorm causes the power to go out the night before, meet in a supermarket to pick up supplies. While they struggle to survive an unnatural mist which envelops the town and conceals vicious, Lovecraftian monsters, extreme tensions rise among the survivors.|$|E
25|$|For a {{young or}} green (inexperienced) horse, longeing {{is used to}} teach a horse to respond to voice {{commands}} and the trainer's body language, to accustom them to {{the feel of a}} saddle and bridle, and to begin their introduction to the feel of reins and bit pressure. In many training stables, a horse is first introduced on the longe to nearly everything {{it is going to be}} asked to <b>do</b> <b>under</b> saddle, including movement at all gaits, response to hand and voice commands (called riding aids), and remaining calm in unusual or stressful situations.|$|E

25|$|While {{ecotourism}} agencies {{claim to}} help in exposing the plight of indigenous people, many Akha {{feel that they are}} being put on display for ecotourist groups, as they are encouraged or forced to wear their most elaborate ethnic clothing and perform ceremonies and rituals that have no meaning for them out of context. The Akha also participate in the regular tourist industry through the sale of their handicrafts and goods to local tourists, which they must often <b>do</b> <b>under</b> financial duress. Many of the Akha people do not see the tourism as halting the Westernizing and globalizing pressures but, rather, as a coercive commercialization and commodification of their culture.|$|E
25|$|Application {{services}} are offered through a single program known officially as the Cooperative Macintosh Toolbox environment, but are universally {{referred to as}} the Blue Box. The Blue Box encapsulates an existing System 7 operating system inside a single process and address space. Mac programs run inside the Blue Box much as they <b>do</b> <b>under</b> System 7, as cooperative tasks that use the non-reentrant Toolbox calls. A worst-case scenario is that an application in the Blue Box crashes, taking down the entire Blue Box instance with it. This does not result in the system as a whole going down, however, and the Blue Box can be restarted.|$|E
25|$|A large, barnacle-like aquatic creature, up to 3 miles long, {{appearing}} in , of which only seven specimens remain. They are often mistaken for islands, like the Kraken of myth, however they lack tentacles and are docile. Kraken shed their shell usually {{only once in}} their lifetime, but when they <b>do,</b> <b>under</b> the shell is {{a huge amount of}} methane which is set ablaze, creating an explosion, and propelling the shell off. Although it is thought that Kraken shed their shells only once during their lives, one, known as 'Shelly' by the Kraken Watch and the oldest of the seven specimens still alive, blasts its shell off a second time while Holly is checking a red-lining sensor on it. The Fairy people initially believe only 6 remain alive, although Artemis personally discovers a seventh that avoided Foaly's detection, which was attracted to the coast of Ireland by the magical residue of Hybras.|$|E

25|$|For {{the time}} being, Manuel's policy {{was not without}} merit as the emperor {{established}} peaceful co-existence with the Sultan and initiated measures such as allowing Turkmen to pay for pasture on Byzantine land, which were clearly meant to deter raiding. The establishment of the theme of Neokastra on {{the northern part of}} the Aegean coast near Pergamon was also praised by Choniates. However, when Kilij Arslan refused to hand over the city of Sivas, which he was bound to <b>do</b> <b>under</b> an earlier agreement with Manuel, the emperor declared war in 1176 and led a very large army estimated at around 30,000 men into Seljuq territory with the intent of taking its capital Iconium. However, the Byzantine force was ambushed in a mountain pass with consequent heavy losses to both sides. This battle, the Battle of Myriokephalon, resulted in the Byzantine campaign of conquest being abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{was quoted}} before the battle as saying Meade [...] "would commit no blunders on my front and if I make one ... will make haste to take {{advantage}} of it." [...] That prediction proved to be correct at Gettysburg. Stephen Sears wrote, [...] "The {{fact of the matter is}} that George G. Meade, unexpectedly and against all odds, thoroughly outgeneraled Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg." [...] Edwin B. Coddington wrote that the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac received a [...] "sense of triumph which grew into an imperishable faith in [...] The men knew what they could <b>do</b> <b>under</b> an extremely competent general; one of lesser ability and courage could well have lost the battle." ...|$|E
500|$|During the evening, Elliot and Smith {{discussed}} {{destroying the}} three junks and deploying men {{to attack the}} battery the next day, but Smith acceded to Elliot's recommendation not to do so. Elliot stated that an attack would destroy the village and cause [...] "great injury and irritation" [...] to the inhabitants. In a letter to trader James Matheson on 5 September, Elliot felt {{that it would be}} unbecoming of a British warship to shoot to death the Chinese junks, which his [...] "poor Cutter" [...] could <b>do</b> <b>under</b> their batteries. He wrote: [...] "Perhaps I ought not to have fired at all but every man's patience has limits and mine has been sorely tried.

500|$|The {{film was}} set up as an {{independent}} production for Morgan Creek Productions which would release the film through Warner Bros. in the United States under an existing distribution agreement. Travolta's company JTP Films was also involved, and Travolta invested $5million {{of his own money}} in the production. Warner Bros. allocated $20million for the film's marketing and distribution. Franchise retained the foreign rights, licensing the European distribution rights to the German group Intertainment AG in exchange for 47% of the production costs which were set at $75million. The Intertainment deal later became the focus of a legal action that bankrupted Franchise. Samaha forecast that the film would be a hit: [...] "My projected numbers on Battlefield Earth are really conservative. I'm already covered internationally, and there's no way I'm going to lose if the movie does $35million domestically. And Travolta has never had an action movie <b>do</b> <b>under</b> $35million." ...|$|E
500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can <b>do</b> <b>under</b> any other circumstances." [...] At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier stepped forward, and he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.|$|E
500|$|On June 26, 1996, Clinger's Government Reform and Oversight Committee held {{hearings}} on the matter. [...] Livingstone, who announced his resignation {{at the start of}} his testimony that day, and his assistant, Anthony Marceca, insisted during the committee's hearings that the mishandled files were a result of a bureaucratic mixup and that no improper motivations were behind it. [...] They said that when the George H. W. Bush administrative staff left the White House in January 1993, they had taken all the files of the Office of Personnel Security with them for use in the Bush Library, as they were permitted to <b>do</b> <b>under</b> law. [...] The OPS staff were trying to rebuild these records to include those of permanent White House employees who remained to work in the Clinton administration; Marceca, a civilian investigator for the Army, had been hired for this task. In doing so, they received an outdated list from the Secret Service of White House employees, which included many names who were no longer employees. This list was then given to the FBI and the personnel background files returned as a result. [...] Lisa Wetzl, another assistant, testified that she discovered the mistake in mid-1994 and destroyed the request list.|$|E
