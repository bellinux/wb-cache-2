2500|$|In Sud, Hurricane Matthew {{severely}} damaged 15 of the 18communes. The storm destroyed 95% of all shelters {{and at least}} 29,000homes, along with most ports and fishing <b>equipment.</b> <b>Damage</b> was most significant in Les Cayes, capital of Sud. Ten hours of high wind gusts destroyed the roofs of most houses, shops, and service stations, including the main cathedral, injuring over 3,000people. About 7080% of the houses in the city lost their roof or were flooded, of which around 20% had collapsed walls. Several businesses were washed away in Les Cayes. Île-à-Vache, an island adjacent to Les Cayes, reported floods up to [...] deep. Livestock were killed when farms [...] "disappeared", according {{to a member of}} Heifer International. All crops in the city were damaged, and over 90% of the crops wrecked throughout the department.|$|E

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of electronic <b>equipment</b> to <b>damage</b> by carbon fibers released from burning aircraft type structural composite materials was investigated. Tests {{were conducted on}} commercially available stereo power amplifiers which showed that the <b>equipment</b> was <b>damaged</b> by fire released carbon fibers but not by the composite resin residue, soot and products of combustion of the fuel associated with burning the carbon fiber composites. Results indicate that the failure rates of the equipment exposed to the fire released fiber were consistent with predictions based on tests using virgin fibers...|$|R
