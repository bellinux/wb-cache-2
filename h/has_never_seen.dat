Reyes and Doggett head to the mine from which they believe the dust originated. Doggett finds the skeleton of a sheriff who killed himself in 1909.|$|E

Henry has a rare genetic disorder, which comes {{to be known as}} Chrono-Impairment, that causes him to involuntarily travel through time.

5|$|Impa {{says that}} the mark on Link's hand means {{that he is the}} hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest {{containing}} six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, even though he <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill Link, as sprinkling his blood on Ganon’s ashes will bring Ganon back to life.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season {{with a sense of}} optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a Monday Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says he <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jaime {{talks with}} Edmure Tully, {{trying to win}} his {{cooperation}} by tempting him with seeing his newborn son, whom he <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen,</b> and offering to send {{him and his family}} to Casterly Rock, away from the Freys. Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how he wants to take Riverrun to be back with Cersei, and he is willing to do anything to achieve it, even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the Blackfish. Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle. Edmure then orders his men to surrender Riverrun, and also orders the Blackfish's capture. The Blackfish helps Brienne and Podrick escape, but stays behind to fight to the end.|$|E

Just as when one finds a watch, one reasonable infers that it was designed and constructed by an intelligent being, although one <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the designer, when one observes the complexity and intricacy of life, one may reasonably infer that it was designed and constructed by God, although one <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> God.|$|E

While Nancy does become a bit frustrated with the lizards' intellectual limitations, she becomes increasingly annoyed with Charlie's condescending attitude toward them. Yet, when the lizards want to go back—after Charlie drives Sarah to tears, and Leslie beats him up—Nancy wants them to stay and offers them help. This experience has given Nancy the excitement she craves, and she ensures that it continues.|$|E
