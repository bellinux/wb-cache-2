5000|$|Thai silk is {{produced}} from the cocoons of Thai silkworms. Thailand's silkworm farmers cultivate {{both types of}} the <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworms</b> that produce commercial silk: Samia ricini, {{commonly known as the}} eri silkworm, which produces [...] Eri silk, and the Bombyx mori, producer of the better known, glossy mulberry silk. The latter is by far the larger silk producer of the two.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are more}} than 500 species of wild {{silkworms}} in the world, although only a few are used to produce cloth. They usually produce a tougher and rougher silk than that from <b>domesticated</b> Bombyx mori <b>silkworms.</b> Wild silks are usually harvested after the moths have left the cocoons, cutting the threads in the process, {{so that there is}} not one long thread, as with <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworms.</b> [...] Wild silks are more difficult to bleach and dye than silk from Bombyx mori, but most have naturally attractive colours, particularly the rich golden sheen of the silk produced by the muga silkworm from Assam, often known as Assam silk.|$|R
25|$|Sericulture, the {{practice}} of breeding silkworms {{for the production of}} raw silk, has been under way for at least 5,000 years in China, from where it spread to Korea and Japan, India and later the West. The <b>silkworm</b> was <b>domesticated</b> from the wild silkmoth Bombyx mandarina, which has a range from northern India to northern China, Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of Russia. The <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though most}} {{butterflies}} and moths affect the economy negatively, some species are a valuable economic resource. The most prominent example {{is that of the}} <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> moth (Bombyx mori), the larvae of which make their cocoons out of silk, which can be spun into cloth. Silk is and has been an important economic resource throughout history. The species Bombyx mori has been domesticated {{to the point where it}} is completely dependent on mankind for survival. A number of wild moths such as Bombyx mandarina, and Antheraea species, besides others, provide commercially important silks.|$|R
50|$|Like the <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm,</b> {{this species}} is {{susceptible}} to pébrine, a disease caused by microsporidian fungi in the genus Nosema. It is lethal to the larvae. It is also commonly infected with the Antheraea mylitta cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (AmCPV), a reovirus which {{has been reported to}} destroy around 20% of each silk crop by inducing diarrhea in the larvae, leading to a condition known as grasserie. Natural enemies of this silkworm include the uzi fly (Blepharipa zebina), which is a parasitoid that uses the silkworm larvae as a food source for its maggots.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there have been}} several reports showing the {{advantageous}} adaptation caused by TEs. In the research done with silkworms, An Adaptive Transposable Element insertion in the Regulatory Region of the EO Gene in the <b>Domesticated</b> <b>Silkworm,</b> a TE insertion was observed in the cis-regulatory region of the EO gene, which regulates molting hormone 20E, and enhanced expression was recorded. While populations without the TE insert are often unable to effectively regulate hormone 20E under starvation conditions, those with the insert had a more stable development, which resulted in higher developmental uniformity.|$|R
40|$|A single-base pair {{resolution}} silkworm {{genetic variation}} map was constructed from 40 <b>domesticated</b> and wild <b>silkworms,</b> each sequenced to approximately threefold coverage, representing 99. 88 % of the genome.

We {{find that the}} <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworms</b> are clearly genetically differentiated from the wild ones, but they have maintained large levels of genetic variability, suggesting a short domestication event involving {{a large number of}} individuals. We also identified signals of selection at 354 candidate genes that may have been important during domestication, some of which have enriched expression in the silk gland, midgut, and testis.

40|$|The wild {{silkworm}} Bombyx mandarina {{is widely}} believed to be an ancestor of the <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm,</b> Bombyx mori. Silkworms are often used {{as a model for}} studying the mechanism of species domestication. Here, we performed transcriptome sequencing of the wild silkworm using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. We produced 100, 004, 078 high-quality reads and assembled them into 50, 773 contigs with an N 50 length of 1764 bp and a mean length of 941. 62 bp. A total of 33, 759 unigenes were identified, with 12, 805 annotated in the Nr database, 8273 in the Pfam database, and 9093 in the Swiss-Prot database. Expression profile analysis found significant differential expression of 1308 unigenes between the middle silk gland (MSG) and posterior silk gland (PSG). Three sericin genes (sericin 1, sericin 2, and sericin 3) were expressed specifically in the MSG and three fibroin genes (fibroin-H, fibroin-L, and fibroin/P 25) were expressed specifically in the PSG. In addition, 32, 297 Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 361 insertion-deletions (INDELs) were detected. Comparison with the <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> p 50 /Dazao identified 5, 295 orthologous genes, among which 400 might have experienced or to be experiencing positive selection by Ka/Ks analysis. These data and analyses presented here provide insights into silkworm domestication and an invaluable resource for wild silkworm genomics research...|$|R

Fragments of primitive looms are also seen from the sites of Hemudu culture in Yuyao, Zhejiang, dated to about 4000 BC. Scraps of silk were found in a Liangzhu culture site at Qianshanyang in Huzhou, Zhejiang, dating back to 2700 BC. Other fragments have been recovered from royal tombs in the Dynasty (c. 1600 - c. 1046 BC).|$|R

30|$|The <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm,</b> Bombyx mori, spins silk with {{distinctive}} properties. An insoluble protein, silk fibroin and glue-like protein, sericin, {{combined to}} form the silk. It is composed of three components: heavy (H) chain fibroin (350  kDa), light (L) chain fibroin (25  kDa) and P- 25 protein in a molar ratio of 6 : 6 : 1, respectively. Structural analysis of the H-chain possesses two types of molecular conformations being α- and β-helix. The former is non-crystalline and soluble in water while the later is highly stable organized and insoluble in water (Motta et al. 2002). Silk I is mainly formed of α-helix sheets, while that containing {{a higher percentage of}} β-helix is termed silk II (Inoue et al. 2000).|$|R
50|$|Antheraea mylitta is {{a species}} of moth in the family Saturniidae known {{commonly}} as the tasar silkworm and vanya silkworm. It is actually {{one of a number}} of tasar silkworms, species that produce Tussar silk, a kind of wild silk that is made from the products of saturniid silkworms instead of the <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> (Bombyx mori). This species is native to India.This species is variable, with at least 44 identified ecoraces, populations adapted to varied ecological conditions and food plants. Ten ecoraces are used for silk production and have been studied to obtain data about their life cycles and silk characteristics. Some ecoraces are so well differentiated that they do not interbreed in nature, though they are not genetically distinct and can be bred in captivity.|$|R
40|$|Serial {{analysis}} of gene expression (SAGE) {{was used to}} examine the profile of expressed genes during embryonic development in the <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm,</b> Bombyx mori, after irradiation with Cobalt- 60. A comparison of the SAGE sequence tags derived from irradiated embryos with those from normal embryos revealed 673 differentially expressed genes (P < 0. 01 and at least three folds change). Of these, 292 genes were highly expressed in normal embryos and 381 genes were highly expressed in irradiated embryos. These results provide valuable information for understanding the mechanisms of radiation-induced changes in gene expression. In addition, it was noted that the generation of longer cDNA fragments from SAGE tags is an efficient way to identify genes, thereby facilitating the {{analysis of}} large numbers of unknown genes...|$|R
5000|$|Thailand's {{silkworm}} farmers cultivate {{both types}} of the <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworms</b> that produce commercial silk: Samia ricini, {{commonly known as the}} [...] "eri silkworm", and Bombyx mori, the [...] "mulberry silkworm". The latter, used for most Thai silk, is by far the larger silk producer of the two. The Queen Sirikit Department of Sericulture estimates that in 2013, 71,630 small landholders raised mulberry silkworms on 39,570 rai, producing 287,771 kg of silk cocoons. Another 2,552 farmers grew mulberry silkworms on an industrial scale, producing 145,072 kg of silk on 15,520 rai of land. Eri silk, on the other hand, produces only a fraction of these quantities, grown by a small network of 600 families scattered throughout 28 provinces in north, northeast, and central Thailand.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} explore the genetic {{diversity}} and systematic differentiation pattern among silkworm varieties, aiming to guide hybridization breeding, we sequenced a total of 72 Bmamy 2 gene fragments from local silkworm varieties. The analysis of nucleotide sequence diversity and systematic differentiation {{indicated that there was}} rich genovariation in the sequencing region of Bmamy 2 gene, and the base mutation rate is 5. 6 – 8. 2 %, the haplotype diversity is 0. 8294, and the nucleotide diversity is 0. 0236 ± 0. 00122, suggesting Bmamy 2 being a better marking gene with rich nucleotide sequence diversity, based on which the genetic diversity among different local silkworm varieties can be identified. The same heredity population structure is proclaimed by several analysis methods that every clade consisting of varieties from different geosystems and ecological types, while the varieties from the same geosystem and ecotype belong to different clades in the phylogeny. There is no population structure pattern that different varieties claded together according to geosystem or ecotype. It can be speculated that the silkworm origins from mixture of kinds of several voltinism mulberry silkworm, Bombyx mandarina, while the domestication events took place in several regions, from which the <b>domesticated</b> mulberry <b>silkworms</b> are all devoting to the <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> population of today...|$|R
5000|$|Eri silk (এৰি ৰেচম) {{comes from}} the {{caterpillar}} of Samia cynthia ricini, found in northeast Nepal and some parts of China, Japan, and Thailand. The name [...] "eri" [...] {{is derived from the}} Assamese word [...] "era", which means [...] "castor", as the silkworm feeds on castor plants. One of the common names, the [...] "Ailanthus silk moth", refers to the host plant. Eri silk is also known as endi or errandi in India. The woolly white silk {{is often referred to as}} the fabric of peace when it is processed without killing the silkworm. This process results in a silk called Ahimsa silk. Moths leave the cocoon and then the cocoons are harvested to be spun. The eri silkworm is the only completely <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> other than Bombyx mori.|$|R
40|$|The <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm,</b> Bombyx mori {{serves as}} an ideal {{representative}} of lepidopteran species {{for a variety of}} scientific studies.

Of these, four main databases are important for store nucleotide information in the form of genomic data, ESTs and microsatelites. These databases also store data related to other lepidoptera and important insects, which help in insect biological research. Though a considerable amount of nucleotide data is currently available, there is a paucity of data related to silkworm and other lepidopteran proteins.

40|$|Variability in silk's {{rheology}} {{is often}} {{regarded as an}} impediment to understanding or successfully copying the natural spinning process. We have previously reported such variability in unspun native silk extracted straight from the gland of the <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> Bombyx mori and discounted classical explanations such as differences in molecular weight and concentration. We now report that variability in oscillatory measurements can be reduced onto a simple master-curve through normalizing {{with respect to the}} crossover. This remarkable result suggests that differences between silk feedstocks are rheologically simple and not as complex as originally thought. By comparison, solutions of poly(ethylene-oxide) and hydroxypropyl-methyl-cellulose showed similar normalization behavior; however, the resulting curves were broader than for silk, suggesting greater polydispersity in the (semi) synthetic materials. Thus, we conclude Nature may in fact produce polymer feedstocks that are more consistent than typical man-made counterparts as a model for future rheological investigations...|$|R
40|$|The <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> Bombyx mori L. has {{important}} roles in basic biological research and applied science. To explore the practical use of transgenic technology in agricultural silkworm varieties, we fused the neomycin-resistance gene (NeoR) and the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) into the piggyBac-based transposon vector and transduced it into silkworms by sperm-mediated gene transfer (SMGT). Fluores-cence observation indicated the positive rate of G 0 egg-batches is 72. 7 %. After screening against the antibiotic G 418, develop-ment of individual larvae in the same brood showed significant size differences. PCR detection indicated the existence of gfp and NeoR and confirmed the positive rate of transgenesis as 0. 47 %.

The Bombyx mori (Latin: [...] "silkworm of the mulberry tree"), The practice of breeding silkworms {{for the production of}} raw silk, also known as Sericulture, has been underway for at least 5,000 years in China. It is dependent on humans for its reproduction and does not occur naturally in the wild.

40|$|Abstract: While fibroin {{isolated}} from the cocoons of <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> Bombyx mori supports growth of human corneal limbal epithelial (HLE) cells, the mechanism of cell attachment remains unclear. In the present study we sought to enhance the attachment of HLE cells to membranes of Bombyx mori silk fibroin (BMSF) through surface functionalization with an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) -containing peptide. Moreover, we have examined the response of HLE cells to BMSF when blended with the fibroin produced by a wild silkworm, Antheraea pernyi, which is known to contain RGD sequences within its primary structure. A procedure to isolate A. pernyi silk fibroin (APSF) J. Funct. Biomater. 2013, 4 75 from the cocoons was established, and blends of the two fibroins were prepared at five different BMSF/APSF ratios. In another experiment, BMSF surface was modified by binding chemically the GRGDSPC peptide using a water-soluble carbodiimide.

50|$|Together, the {{two species}} {{constitute}} the genus Bombyx, the true or mulberry silkmoths. The origin of the domesticated silkmoth is enigmatic. It {{has been suggested that}} it is the survivor of an extinct species which diverged from the ancestors of Bombyx mandarina millions of years ago. However, this is based on an untenable molecular clock hypothesis that assumes that wild and domestic silkmoths evolved equally fast after their lineages diverged. Rather, the effects of artificial selection have accelerated evolution in the domestic form to a point where it is hard to trace the origin of the numerous breeds of domestic silkworms even with the most modern molecular phylogeny methods. Conceivably, today's <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworms</b> are all descended from an initial stock of B. mandarina collected as late as 5000 years ago. While wild silk could have been collected and used as threads, etc., since much earlier, the technology to breed and use <b>silkworms</b> from a <b>domesticated</b> stock did not exist before the late Neolithic.|$|R
40|$|Mulberry {{has been}} used as an {{economically}} important food crop for the <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> for thousands of years, resulting in {{one of the oldest and}} well-known plant-herbivore interactions. The genome of Morus notabilis has now been sequenced and there is an opportunity to mine the transposable element (TE) data. To better understand the roles of TEs in structural, functional and evolutionary dynamics of the mulberry gen-ome, a specific, comprehensive and user-friendly web-based database, MnTEdb, was constructed. It was built based on a detailed and accurate identification of all TEs in mul-berry. A total of 5925 TEs belonging to 13 superfamilies and 1062 families were de-posited in this database. MnTEdb enables users to search, browse and download the mulberry TE sequences. Meanwhile, data mining tools, including BLAST, GetORF, HMMER, Sequence Extractor and JBrowse were also integrated into MnTEdb.

We presently extend this promising avenue of research by directly comparing the attachment, morphology and phenotype of primary HLE cell cultures grown on fibroin to that observed on donor amniotic membrane (AM), the current clinical standard substrate for HLE transplantation. Fibroin membranes measuring 6. 3 ± 0. 5 μm (mean ± sd) in thickness and permeable to FITC dextran of a molecular weight up to 70 kDa, were used. Attachment of HLE cells to fibroin {{was similar to that}} supported by tissue culture plastic but approximately 6 -fold less than that observed on AM. Nevertheless, epithelia constructed from HLE on fibroin maintained evidence of corneal phenotype (K 3 /K 12 expression) and displayed a comparable number and distribution of ΔNp 63 + progenitor cells to that seen in cultures grown on AM. These results support the suitability of membranes constructed from Bombyx mori silk fibroin as substrata for HLE cultivation and encourage progression to studies of efficacy in preclinical models...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the molecular phylogeny, laboratory rearing, and karyotype of a bombycid moth, Trilocha varians (F.

Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that T. varians belongs to the subfamily Bombycinae, thus showing a close relationship to the <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> Bombyx mori (L.), a lepidopteran model insect. A laboratory method was developed for rearing T. varians and the time required for development from the embryo to adult was determined. From oviposition to adult emergence, the developmental zero was 10. 47 °C and total effective temperature was 531. 2 day–degrees, i. e., approximately 30 days for one generation when reared at 28 °C. The haploid of T. varians consisted of n = 26 chromosomes. In highly polyploid somatic nuclei, females showed a large heterochromatin body, indicating that the sex chromosome system in T. varians is WZ/ZZ (female/male).

40|$|The <b>Domesticated</b> <b>silkworm,</b> Bombyx mori, an {{economically}} important insect {{has been used}} as a lepidopteran molecular model next only to Drosophila. Compared to the genomic information in silkworm, the protein-protein interaction data are limited. Therefore experimentally identified PPI maps from five model organisms such as E. coli, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae were used to infer the PPI network of silkworm using the well-recognized Interlog based method. Among the 14623 silkworm proteins, 7736 protein-protein interaction pairs were predicted which include 2700 unique proteins of the silkworms. Using the iPfam interaction domains and the gene expression data, these predictions were validated. In that 625 PPI pairs of predicted network were associated with the iPfam domain-domain interactions and the random network has average of 9. In the gene expression method, the average PCC value of the predicted network and random network was 0. 29 and 0. 23100 ± 0. 00042 respectively. It reveals that the predicted PPI networks of silkworm are highly significant and reliable.

M. de Quatrefages (10/9. 'Etudes sur les Maladies actuelles du Ver a Soie' 1859 page 321.) briefly describes six kinds cultivated in one valley in France: of these the AMOUROUSO produces excellent leaves, but is rapidly being abandoned because it produces much fruit mingled with the leaves: the ANTOFINO yields deeply cut leaves of the finest quality, but not in great quantity: the CLARO is much sought for because the leaves can be easily collected: lastly, the ROSO bears strong hardy leaves, produced in large quantity, but with the one inconvenience, that they are best adapted for the worms after their fourth moult. MM. Jacquemet-Bonnefont, of Lyon, however, remark in their catalogue (1862) that two sub-varieties have been confounded under the name of the roso, one having leaves too thick for the caterpillars, the other being valuable because the leaves can easily be gathered from the branches without the bark being torn.|$|R
40|$|Membranes were {{prepared}} from fibroin, a protein {{isolated from the}} <b>domesticated</b> <b>silkworm</b> (Bombyx mori) silk, and evaluated as a potential substratum for corneal limbal epithelial cells. These membranes (i. e., B. mori silk fibroin [BMSF] membranes) were cast from dialyzed solutions of fibroin protein (4 % w/v) dispensed into 35 -mm-diameter culture dishes and dried at room temperature (23 – 24 °C). The resulting material was transparent, easy to handle, and supported levels of human limbal epithelial (HLE) cell growth comparable to that observed on tissue culture plastic. Remarkably, these results were obtained utilizing a commercial serum-free medium (CnT- 20) designed for the ex vivo expansion of corneal epithelial progenitor cells. The potential benefits of serum proteins on this culture system were examined through addition of fetal bovine serum (FBS) either to fibroin stocks prior to membrane casting or by supplementation of the CnT- 20 medium. Membranes cast {{in the presence of}} FBS displayed increasing opacity and induced little change in HLE growth. Supplementation of CnT- 20 medium with FBS deterred cell growth on all substrata, including tissue culture plastic control substrata.
