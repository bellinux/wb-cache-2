5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing {{that people have}} a basic desire to <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the self. Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like things more if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts {{that are associated with}} the self, such as their name. They called this unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.|$|E
500|$|Quotes in {{the film}} aided its popularity. Titanic catchphrase [...] "I'm {{the king of the}} world!" [...] became one of the film industry's more popular quotations. According to Richard Harris, a {{psychology}} professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. [...] "People are doing it to <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves,</b> to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh", he said.|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{the above}} {{distinction}} on resilience, {{research has also}} been devoted to discovering the individual differences in resilience. Self-esteem, ego-control, and ego-resiliency are related to behavioral adaptation. For example, maltreated children who <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> may process risk situations differently by attributing different reasons to the environments they experience and, thereby, avoid producing negative internalized self-perceptions. Ego-control is [...] "the threshold or operating characteristics of an individual {{with regard to the}} expression or containment" [...] of their impulses, feelings, and desires. Ego-resilience refers to [...] "dynamic capacity, to modify his or her model level of ego-control, in either direction, {{as a function of the}} demand characteristics of the environmental context" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{study of}} casual sex among adolescents, many girls {{believed}} {{they could have a}} purely sexual experience with no emotional ties, and they believed it was sexist to assume otherwise. [...] However, the study found that both the girls and the boys who were hooking up often were depressed and didn't <b>feel</b> very <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There were public {{relations}} campaigns [...] "to {{try to make}} people <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> again <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> and <b>about</b> Alexandria," [...] said Mrs. Randolph. A former city council member, Marion Chaney, who works for an Alexandria architectural firm, said, [...] "It {{was time for a}} change" [...] by 1986. [...] "I wouldn't say Alexandria was a laughing stock, but it definitely needed a change." ...|$|R
50|$|Other {{things seem}} to be more likely to make people <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> work and <b>themselves</b> once the basics are OK at work. Challenging work (not too little, not too much) can make them <b>feel</b> <b>good.</b> Similarly, {{opportunities}} for career progression and using their abilities can contribute to someone's quality of working life.|$|R
2500|$|Studies {{have also}} been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by {{the needs of others}} has {{conversely}} negative effects on health and happiness. For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant). Additionally, while generous acts make people <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves,</b> it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that [...] "a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being.". Psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others, doing good and subsequently feeling good as [...] "the helper's high".|$|E
2500|$|Germany's Left Party {{brought up}} the {{discussion}} about affirmative action. According to Stefan Zillich, quotas should be [...] "a possibility" [...] to help working class children who did not {{do well in school}} gain access to a Gymnasium. Headmasters of Gymnasien have objected, saying that this type of policy would [...] "be a disservice" [...] to poor children, {{that they would not be}} able to academically keep up with their classmates and that they would not feel welcome at a Gymnasium. Wolfgang Harnischfeger, headmaster of a well known Berlin Gymnasium, stated: [...] "It can be noticed in children as young as kindergarten-age, that children take after their parents. They emulate their language, their way of dressing, their way of spending their freetime. Children from Neukölln (a poor neighbourhood) would not <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> if they had to attend that type of school that mainly serves pupils from social classes different from their own. They will not be able to integrate. Every field-day, every school party will show that very soon." [...] He also said that [...] "this kind of policy would weaken the Gymnasium" [...] and that this would be dangerous, because [...] "German society could not afford to do without the truly educated adults the Gymnasium produces". Stefan Zillich has answered to this, saying that [...] "German society can not afford having only so few adults who were truly educated". While affirmative action laws were not passed (status: January 2010) sought after schools have been guaranteed the right to employ their own quotas since the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Are {{religious}} people psychologically {{better or worse}} adjusted than their non-religious counterparts? Hundreds of studies have reported a positive relation between religiosity and psychological adjustment. Recently, however, a comparatively small number of cross-cultural studies has questioned this staple of religiosity research. The latter studies find that religious adjustment benefits are restricted to religious cultures. Gebauer, Sedikides, and Neberich (2012 b) suggested the religiosity-as-social-value hypothesis (RASV) as one explanation for those cross-cultural differences. RASV states that, in religious cultures, religiosity possesses much social value, and, as such, {{religious people}} will <b>feel</b> particularly <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves.</b> In secular cultures, however, religiosity possesses limited social value, and, as such, religious people will <b>feel</b> less <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves,</b> if at all. Yet, previous evidence has been inconclusive regarding RASV and regarding cross-cultural differences in religious adjustment benefits more generally. To clarify matters, we conducted three replication studies. We examined the relation between religiosity and self-esteem (the most direct and appropriate adjustment indicator, according to RASV) in a self-report study across 65 countries (N = 2, 195, 301), an informant-report study across 36 countries (N = 560, 264), and another self-report study across 1, 932 urban areas from 243 federal states in 18 countries (N = 1, 188, 536). Moreover, we scrutinized our results against seven, previously untested, alternative explanations. Our results fully and firmly replicated and extended prior evidence for cross-cultural differences in religious adjustment benefits. These cross-cultural differences were best explained by the RASV hypothesis...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "a {{performance}} {{did take}} place" [...] ("做咗") generations of performers known, per Yuen, as <b>feel</b> too <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> (Chinese: 自我感覺過份良好), would {{not bother to}} even study the script meticulously, scripts generally agreed to have all needed information from Tang, before going on stage in roles been legendary since 1950s. Instead of preparing for the task ahead by being fluent in a classic novel, they, the bottle blonde (靠黐二代), just ask for story time to attain connotations. Once upon a time, performers were illiterate and had no access to novels or other publications so readily available today. Why would contemporary performers bother? Story time is just another coat of garlic paint on top of layers of such garlic body-paint {{for a decade or}} so already. That is not bold (大膽) but plain hubris (斗膽) for someone who had been told-off getting involved in Loong's productions from the beginning other than as investor and to provide supports in areas like promotion and stage production techniques, no matter how accommodating Loong has been with the poor choices made in many other aspects. Were there any hostage situation, such individual is also another dark soul in Cantonese opera community with nothing but a gravy train in mind.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} provide a {{rationale}} for further researching the everyday events that keep teachers motivated or that discourage them. We put forward the idea that routine Affect Triggering Incidents (ATIs) are an important area for researchers to investigate {{in terms of how}} they impact teacher motivation and resilience. Two groups of participants in separate consecutive studies kept weekly diaries of incidents that made them <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> or bad <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> in their work as teachers (Study 1) and added weekly inventories of their commitment to teaching as well as measures of self-efficacy and self-esteem (Study 2). An analysis of the ATIs in these diaries revealed that student engagement and student achievement are major factors in incidents triggering regular positive feelings while students’ behaviour and perceived difficulties around home influences are major factors in regular dissatisfaction. These everyday ATIs are important {{in the sense that they}} correlate significantly with measures of commitment to teaching, especially in the case of positive ATIs...|$|R
