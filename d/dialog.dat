5|$|GameSpot and GameSpy {{called the}} <b>dialog</b> sharply written, with many memorable lines. Eurogamer {{noted that the}} characters' {{frequent}} use of vulgar language worked; written as real people, such language fit their character rather than giving the game an adult veneer. The website appreciated the breadth of <b>dialog</b> options, allowing the player greater control of how to play their character. PC Zone opined that the quantity of well-written <b>dialog</b> did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation's outcome, and the best response was often the most obvious. The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality {{and the amount of}} voice work, due to the many <b>dialog</b> options.|$|E
5|$|The player's clan {{affects their}} skills and powers. Although the {{attractive}} Toreadors receive bonuses for seduction and persuasion, opening additional <b>dialog</b> options, they are physically weak; the Nosferatu are forced to travel in the shadows or through sewers to avoid alerting humans, but receive bonuses to their intelligence and computer skills, which enables access to more information. The Malkavians have separate <b>dialog</b> options, reflecting their inherent insanity. Upgrading some skills provides additional <b>dialog</b> options; attractive and charismatic characters seduce to get their way, aggressive characters threaten, and others persuade their targets to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{was one of}} {{the first}} games {{concurrently}} released on CD-ROM and floppy disk. A floppy disk version was created to accommodate consumers that had yet to purchase CD-ROM drives. The CD-ROM format afforded the addition of audible <b>dialog.</b> The capacity difference between the two formats necessitated alterations to the floppy disk version. Grossman spent several weeks reducing files sizes and removing files such as the audio <b>dialog</b> to fit the game onto six diskettes.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} {{to the concept of}} sociochemical norms, our group recently used the term sociochemical <b>dialogs</b> to better characterize the <b>dialogs</b> regulated by class-established sociochemical norms as envisioned by Becker and colleagues (Warfa et al. 2014). In our view, sociochemical <b>dialogs</b> occur in chemistry classrooms that are often regulated by discipline-specific norms and discourse. Thus, in this paper, we refer to the <b>dialogs</b> occurring in the classroom we observed as sociochemical <b>dialogs.</b>|$|R
40|$|We are {{interested}} in the problem of understanding human conversation structure in the context of human-machine and human-human interaction. We present a statistical methodol-ogy for detecting the structure of spoken <b>dialogs</b> based on a generative model learned using decision trees. To evaluate our approach we have used the LUNA corpora, collected from real users engaged in problem solving tasks. The results of the evaluation show that automatic segmentation of spoken <b>dialogs</b> is very effective not only with models built using separately human-machine <b>dialogs</b> or human-human <b>dialogs,</b> but it is also possible to infer the task-related structure of human-human di-alogs with a model learned using only human-machine <b>dialogs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Computer <b>dialogs</b> {{communicate}} important security messages, {{but their}} excessive use has produced habituation: a strong tendency by computer users to ignore security <b>dialogs.</b> Unlike physical warnings, whose design and use is regulated by law {{and based on}} years of research, computer security <b>dialogs</b> are often designed in an arbitrary manner. We need scientific solutions to produce <b>dialogs</b> that users will heed and understand. Currently, we lack {{an understanding of the}} factors that drive users’ attention to security <b>dialogs,</b> and how to counteract habituation. Studying computer security behavior is difficult because a) users are more likely to expose themselves to risk in a lab experiment than in daily life, b) the size of observed effects is usually very small, which makes it necessary to collect many observations, and c) it is complex to balance research interests and the ethical duty not to harm. My thesis makes two contributions: a novel methodology to study behavioral responses to security <b>dialogs</b> in a realistic, ethical way with high levels of ecological validity, and a novel technique to increase and retain attention to security <b>dialogs,</b> even in the presence of habituation...|$|R
40|$|Context-sensitive {{guidance}} (CSG) {{can help}} users make better security decisions. Applications with CSG ask {{the user to}} provide relevant context information. Based on such information, these applications then decide or suggest an appropriate course of action. However, users often deem security <b>dialogs</b> irrelevant to the tasks they are performing and try to evade them. This paper contributes two new techniques for hardening CSG against automatic and false user answers. Polymorphic <b>dialogs</b> continuously change the form of required user inputs and intentionally delay the latter, forcing users {{to pay attention to}} security decisions. Audited <b>dialogs</b> thwart false user answers by (1) warning users that their answers will be forwarded to auditors, and (2) allowing auditors to quarantine users who provide unjustified answers. We implemented CSG against email-borne viruses on the Thunderbird email agent. One version, CSG-PD, includes CSG and polymorphic <b>dialogs.</b> Another version, CSG-PAD, includes CSG and both polymorphic and audited <b>dialogs.</b> In user studies, we found that untrained users accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PD than with conventional <b>dialogs.</b> Moreover, they accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PAD than with CSG-PD. CSG-PD and CSG-PAD have insignificant effect on acceptance of justified risks...|$|R
50|$|The game {{inherited}} {{its engine}} from Private Moon’s AGON series, with some enhancements. It features an Inventory for collecting items {{that will be}} used later. All <b>dialogs</b> are logged in a separate notebook for reference. This is useful as <b>dialogs</b> are not repeated.|$|R
5|$|Additionally, NATO cooperates and {{discusses}} its activities with numerous other non-NATO members. The Mediterranean Dialogue {{was established in}} 1994 to coordinate {{in a similar way}} with Israel and countries in North Africa. The Istanbul Cooperation Initiative was announced in 2004 as a <b>dialog</b> forum for the Middle East along the same lines as the Mediterranean Dialogue. The four participants are also linked through the Gulf Cooperation Council.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington became increasingly aware of this arrangement during 19661967, they declined to overtly interfere due to the political ramifications of conducting military operations against a neutral country and the wishes of Sihanouk. Washington still had hopes of reopening a <b>dialog</b> with Sihanouk, and refrained from any actions that might alienate him further.|$|E
5|$|Angelou {{does not}} begin to create her own {{narrative}} until The Heart of a Woman, which depends less upon the conventions of fiction than her previous books. For example, there is less <b>dialog</b> and fewer dramatic episodes. The Heart of a Woman is more uplifting than its predecessors due to Angelou's resolution of her conflict between her duties as {{a mother and her}} success as a performer.|$|E

This document consists of instructions for annotating the temporal information in scheduling <b>dialogs,</b> <b>dialogs</b> in which the participants schedule a meeting with one another. Task-oriented <b>dialogs,</b> such as these are, would arise in many useful applications, for instance, automated information providers and automated phone operators.

50|$|The text is {{centered}} around {{a sequence of}} <b>dialogs</b> and grammar drills, which are practiced and memorized, and detailed linguistic analysis of Japanese grammar. Vocabulary is taught {{in the context of}} these <b>dialogs,</b> rather than as isolated lists. This approach - <b>dialogs</b> and pattern practice - is heavily influenced by the audio-lingual method (ALM), which has since fallen out of favor, though the text is not strictly speaking an ALM text, providing grammar explanations rather than only memorization, for instance.|$|R

The primary aim is for the teachers {{to understand the nature of}} a scientific model, in this case the model of the phases of the moon, through a Socratic interaction with the computer. The <b>dialogs</b> are also being used by other university students. (Author/SK) ...|$|R
5|$|However, {{the game}} was noted to have some flaws. The game was criticized for its uneven {{difficulty}}. Reviewers have also noted some difficulty in getting the game to recognize the correct Celestial Brush patterns, as well as excessive amounts of <b>dialog,</b> particularly at the introduction, which was also hampered by the computer-generated voices used instead of voice acting.|$|E
5|$|Kym Gynell (Keith Faure), Alex Dimitriades (Victor Brincat) and Ian Bliss (Thomas Hentschel) are now fully {{credited}} in {{the episodes}} {{in which they}} starred, with the textual explanation given that their characters could not be named {{at the time of}} production but can now be named as of 2011, due to the end of their related trials. They are still unnamed in the <b>dialog</b> of each episode.|$|E
5|$|Much of the play's Protestant tones {{derive from}} its setting in Denmark—both {{then and now}} a {{predominantly}} Protestant country, though {{it is unclear whether}} the fictional Denmark of the play is intended to portray this implicit fact. <b>Dialog</b> refers explicitly to Wittenberg, where Hamlet, Horatio, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attend university, implying where Martin Luther in 1517 first proposed his 95 theses and thereby initiated the Protestant Reformation.|$|E

5|$|Nolan North, {{the voice}} actor who played Drake, {{had a large}} role in {{defining}} the character's physical and vocal reactions. In the Uncharted series, the actors were used for motion capture, and acted as if performing in a movie. Motion capture was done on a soundstage, and the <b>dialog</b> recorded during this process was used in the game. North was allowed to ad-lib <b>dialog</b> and insert aspects of his own personality into the character. In naming the character, the development team considered many different choices, including Ethan, Samuel, and John. Matthew Drake was seriously contemplated, but received a poor reaction from those it was presented to. Eventually, Naughty Dog settled on the name Nathan for its ability to be shortened to Nate, and the perception that it sounded historical. Drake's character design changed little between Drake's Fortune and Among Thieves.|$|E
5|$|Sam & Max Save the World is a 3D graphic {{adventure}} game {{in which}} the player controls the character of Sam. The player has Sam explore the environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Depending on the type of in-game entity a player selects using the cursor, the player can have Sam walk around an area, look at and comment on objects, pick up certain items or otherwise try to use them. Sam may also engage in conversation with non-player characters; when this occurs, the game presents a <b>dialog</b> tree with several subjects to pick from. Topics of conversation may directly involve the story or provide assistance with the game's puzzles, while others may be entirely unconnected. In some cases, the player may be able to choose <b>dialog</b> for Max to speak as well.|$|E
5|$|Single-purpose {{characters}} {{needed a}} distinctive personality trait to quickly establish {{them with the}} player, rather than serving as a disposable item, while major characters had to reflect the player's progression and actions through the game. Mitsoda wrote the characters by thinking about who each character was, assigning them motivations determining why they were where they were, what they thought about the player and what they wanted from them. In accordance with a suggestion by fellow writer Chad Moore, the Malkavian player character has a <b>dialog</b> script distinct {{from that of the}} other eight clans; Mitsoda said {{it was one of the}} simpler aspects of the development cycle. He wrote the Malkavian script last, with time running out on development, and the overwork and lack of sleep contributed to what Mitsoda considered an unhealthy state of mind, ideal for writing insane <b>dialog.</b> He wanted to highlight their madness, without making it comical. Since the story is set during the Camarilla's takeover of Los Angeles, the team simplified the plot by only allowing the player to belong to one of the LA-based clans.|$|E

5|$|The game {{featured}} a large cast for voice {{acting in the}} game's <b>dialog</b> and cutscenes, employing many Latino actors {{to help with the}} Spanish slang. Voice actors included Tony Plana as Manny, Maria Canals-Barrera as Meche, Alan Blumenfeld as Glottis, and Jim Ward as Hector. Schafer credits Plana for helping to deepen the character of Manny, as the voice actor was a native Spanish speaker and suggested alternate <b>dialog</b> for the game that was more natural for casual Spanish conversations. The game's music, a mix of an orchestral score, South American folk music, jazz, swing and big band sounds, was composed at LucasArts by Peter McConnell and inspired by the likes of Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman as well as film composers Max Steiner and Adolph Deutsch. The score featured live musicians that McConnell knew or made contact with in San Francisco's Mission District, including a mariachi band. The soundtrack was released as a CD in 1998.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} levels of {{difficulty}} in campaign mode: Easy, Normal, Heroic, and Legendary. An increase in difficulty {{will result in}} an increase in the number, rank, health, damage, and accuracy of enemies; a reduction of duration and an increase in recharge time for the Arbiter's active camouflage; a decrease in the player's health and shields; and occasional changes in <b>dialog.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Gilbert wrote {{much of the}} {{foundational}} code for Maniac Mansion, {{the majority of the}} game's events were programmed by Lucasfilm employee David Fox. Fox was between projects and planned to work on the game only for a month, but he remained with the team for six months. With Gilbert, he wrote the characters' <b>dialog</b> and choreographed the action. Winnick's concept art inspired him to add new elements to the game: for example, Fox allowed the player to place a hamster inside the kitchen's microwave.|$|E
