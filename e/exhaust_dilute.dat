40|$|Recently {{concerns}} about possible increases in emissions of ultrafine and nanoparticles and their environmental impact have been voiced. A major problem with assessing {{the significance of}} such emissions is that, unlike the carbonaceous soot particles associated with older Diesel engines, many of these particles are not formed in the engine but instead by gas-to-particle conversion processes from vapor phase particle precursors as the <b>exhaust</b> <b>dilutes</b> and cools in the atmosphere. These processes are extremely non-linear and difficult to simulate in the laboratory. Recent measurements of such particles and problems associated with their measurement are described. The final measure of merit of a dilution and sampling system is whether it forms exhaust particle size distributions {{that are similar to}} those produced by atmospheric dilution. A sampling and dilution scheme capable of simulating atmospheric dilution has not yet been identified. In fact, it may not be possible {{to come up with a}} single robust approach that is appropriate to all situations. Current engine particulate emission standards are mass based. Recently, however, interest in other measures, i. e., size, number, or surface area, has increased. This is the result of increased awareness of the influence of particle size on the environmental impact of particulate matter (PM). Several factors have led to this awareness.

The instruments used during the intercomparison allowed online measurements of these compounds directly from the <b>diluted</b> <b>exhaust.</b> Measurements were done either in real time or immediately after the test. The measurement and analysis of exhaust emissions over the world-harmonized light-duty vehicle test cycle was done by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-Qi-ToF-MS), photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) and gas chromatography (GC).

Aerosol fallout from the exhaust clouds was measured with time by monitoring HCl concentrations and aerosol distributions 100 m below the cloud as it drifted away from the launch site.

The <b>exhaust</b> was <b>diluted</b> utilising a full-flow continuous volume sampling system and passed through a thermodenuder at controlled temperature. Particle number concentration and size distribution were measured with a condensation particle counter and a scanning mobility particle sizer, respectively. We show that, while almost all the particles emitted by the CNG buses were in the nanoparticle size range, at least 85 % and 98 % were removed at 100 ºC and 250 ºC, respectively. Closer analysis of the volatility of particles emitted during transient cycles showed that volatilisation began at around 40 °C with the majority occurring by 80 °C. Particles produced during hard acceleration from rest exhibited lower volatility than that produced during other times of the cycle. Based on our results and the observation of ash deposits {{on the walls of}} the tailpipes, we suggest that these non-volatile particles were composed mostly of ash from lubricating oil.

40|$|A state-of-the-science {{thermodynamic}} model describing gas-particle absorption processes {{was used to}} predict the gas-particle partitioning of mixtures of approximately 60 carbonyl compounds emitted from low-emission gasoline-powered vehicles, three-way catalyst gasoline-powered vehicles, heavy-duty diesel vehicles under the idle-creep condition (HDDV idle), and heavy-duty diesel vehicles under the five-mode test (HDDV 5 -mode). <b>Exhaust</b> was <b>diluted</b> {{by a factor of}} 120 - 580 with a residence time of approximately 43 sec. The predicted equilibrium absorption partitioning coefficients differed from the measured partitioning coefficients by several orders of magnitude. Time scales to reach equilibrium in the dilution sampling system were close to the actual residence time during the HDDV 5 -mode test and much longer than the actual residence time during the other vehicle tests. It appears that insufficient residence time in the sampling system cannot uniformly explain the failure of the absorption mechanism to explain the measured partitioning. Other gas-particle partitioning mechanisms (e. g., heterogeneous reactions, capillary adsorption) beyond the simple absorption theory are needed to explain the discrepancy between calculated carbonyl partitioning coefficients and observed partitioning. Both of these alternative partitioning mechanisms imply great challenges for the measurement and modeling of semi-volatile primary organic aerosol (POA) species from motor vehicles. Furthermore, as emitted particle concentrations from newer vehicles approach atmospheric background levels, dilution sampling systems must fundamentally change their approach so that they use realistic particle concentrations in the dilution air to approximately represent real-world conditions. Samples collected with particle-free dilution air yielding total particulate matter concentrations below typical ambient concentrations will not provide a realistic picture of partitioning for semi-volatile compounds...|$|R
40|$|Particulate {{emissions}} cause {{adverse health}} effects {{and for this reason}} they are regulated since the 80 s. Vehicle regulations cover particulate emission measurements of a model before its sale, known as type approval or homologation. For heavy-duty engines the emissions are measured on an engine dynamometer with steady state points and transient cycles. For light-duty vehicles (i. e. the full power train) the particulate emissions are assessed on a chassis dynamometer. The measurement of particulate emissions is conducted either by <b>diluting</b> the whole <b>exhaust</b> in a dilution tunnel with constant volume sampling or by extracting a small proportional part of the <b>exhaust</b> gas and <b>diluting</b> it. Particulate emissions are measured by passing part of the <b>diluted</b> <b>exhaust</b> aerosol through a filter paper. The increase of the weight of the filter is used to calculate the particulate matter mass (PM) emissions. Vehicles are also checked during the course of their lives, i. e. those pulled over by authorities for roadside checks or the mandatory periodic inspection in a garage. In this case smoke is assessed with free acceleration tests. However, all these tests do not give any relevant information about the emissions of the vehicles during real driving conditions. This was only recently regulated. The particulate emissions on the road are measured with portable emission measurement systems (PEMS). The particulate emissions of newer vehicles decreased by more than two orders of magnitude since the 80 s. The particulate measurement methods reached their detection limit and for this reason the particle number (PN) concentration was introduced in the European Union legislation as a new metric. In this paper a short summary of the particulate emission legislation of vehicles over the years is given. Then the instrumentation that has been used and is currently being used, like gravimetric filter measurement, is explained. In addition, other popular methods and instruments are analyzed, like chemical analysis of filters, light extinction, scattering and absorption instruments, electrical mobility and particle counting instruments. Correlation of the different instruments is discussed for different vehicle emission levels. Predictions for future instruments for low emission vehicles are given. JRC.

A promising alternative to conventional flame combustion in gas turbines is catalytic combustion, which can result in ultralow emission levels of NOx, CO and unburned hydrocarbons. The work presented in this thesis concerns the development of methane oxidation catalysts for gas turbine combustors. The application of catalytic combustion to different combustor concepts is addressed in particular. The {{first part of the}} thesis (Paper I) reports on catalyst development for fuel-lean methane combustion. Supported Pd-based catalysts were investigated at atmospheric pressure. The effect on catalytic activity of diluting the reaction mixture with water and/or carbon dioxide was studied in order to simulate a combustion process with exhaust gas recirculation. The catalytic activity was found to decrease significantly in the presence of water and CO 2. However, modifying the catalyst by changing support material can have a considerable impact on the performance. In the second part of this thesis (Papers II-IV), the development of rhodium catalysts for fuel-rich methane combustion is addressed. The effect of catalyst composition, oxygen-to-fuel ratio and catalyst pre-treatment on the methane conversion and the product gas composition was studied. An experimental investigation at elevated pressures of partial oxidation of methane/oxygen mixtures in exhaust gas-rich environments was also conducted. The most suitable catalyst identified for fuel-rich catalytic combustion of methane, i. e. Rh/Ce-ZrO 2, showed benefits such as low light-off temperature, high activity and enhanced hydrogen selectivity.

The present study was undertaken to further clarify the effects of diesel exhaust on bronchoalveolar cells and soluble components in normal healthy subjects. The study was also designed to evaluate whether a ceramic particle trap {{at the end of the}} tail pipe, from an idling engine, would reduce indices of airway inflammation. METHODS: The study comprised three exposures in all 10 healthy never smoking subjects; air, <b>diluted</b> diesel <b>exhaust,</b> and <b>diluted</b> diesel <b>exhaust</b> filtered with a ceramic particle trap. The exposures were given for 1 hour in randomised order about 3 weeks apart. The diesel exhaust exposure apperatus has previously been carefully developed and evaluated. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 24 hours after exposures and the lavage fluids from the bronchial and bronchoalveolar region were analysed for cells and soluble components. RESULTS: The particle trap reduced the mean steady state number of particles by 50 %, but the concentrations of the other measured compounds were almost unchanged. It was found that diesel exhaust caused an increase in neutrophils in airway lavage, together with an adverse influence on the phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, the diesel exhaust was found to be able to induce a migration of alveolar macrophages into the airspaces, together with reduction in CD 3 +CD 25 + cells. (CD = cluster of differentiation) The use of the specific ceramic particle trap at the end of the tail pipe was not sufficient to completely abolish these effects when interacting with the exhaust from an idling vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that exposure to diesel exhaust may induce neutrophil and alveolar macrophage recruitment into the airways and suppress alveolar macrophage function. The particle trap did not cause significant reduction of effects induced by diesel exhaust compared with unfiltered diesel exhaust.

The diesel particles were collected from <b>diluted</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas and an ultrasonic extraction method was used for obtaining the TEM samples. The TEM images reveal that primary particle size and nanostructure depend on the engine operating conditions. The mean diameter of the primary particles is in the range 23. 8 - 28. 5. nm, depending on the engine speed and engine load. The nanostructure could reflect the particle formation processes. The larger primary particles are formed at low engine speed and high engine load. They have irregular shape and distinguishable trace of pre-formed particle, indicating the combined effect of particle coalescence and surface growth. Primary particles with core-shell structure are common at high engine load with different engine speeds. The particles exhibit disorder structure at low engine load and high engine speed due to lower in-cylinder gas temperature and shorter combustion duration.

Based on the measured gaseous sulfuric acid (GSA) and non-volatile core and soot particle number concentrations of the raw exhaust, the model simulations showed that the best agreement between model predictions and measurements in terms of particle number size distribution was obtained by barrier-free heteromolecular homogeneous nucleation between the GSA and a semi-volatile organic vapour combined with the homogeneous nucleation of GSA alone. Major growth of the particles was predicted to occur due to the similar organic vapour at concentrations of (1 - 2) x 10 (12) cm(- 3). The pre-existing core and soot mode concentrations had an opposite trend on the NUP formation, and the maximum NUP formation was predicted if a diesel particle filter (DPF) was used. On the other hand, the model predicted that the NUP formation ceased if the GSA concentration in the raw exhaust was less than 10 (10) cm(- 3), which was the case when biofuel was used...|$|R
40|$|Perfluorocompounds (PFCs) {{are highly}} stable {{chemical}} compounds used in two integral steps of semiconductor manufacturing: {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) chambers and etch chambers. Unfortunately, PFCs are also greenhouse gases linked to global warming. This, combined with their long atmospheric lifetimes gives them global warming potentials much higher than C 02 the principal greenhouse gas. In a series of voluntary agreements with the United States and other national governments, the worldwide semiconductor industry has {{set a goal of}} reducing PFC emissions to 90 % of their 1995 levels. To reach this goal, researchers have explored four main methods of reduction: substitution of PFCs, recovery and recycling of PFCs, tool optimization, and exhaust abatement. While the first three methods have successfully reduced emissions in the CVD chambers, they have proven too costly for or inapplicable to etch chambers. Therefore, it has become apparent that further reductions must be achieved through the abatement of etch chamber exhaust. Herein, we compare three commercially available abatement systems representative of the three techniques currently used to abate PFCs. All three systems are categorized as either downstream systems, which receive <b>diluted</b> <b>exhaust</b> from multiple etch chambers, or point-of-use (POU) systems, which receive concentrated exhaust from a single etch chamber. Though both downstream and POU configurations are equally effective in destroying PFCs, they differ in cost depending on the number of etch chambers in use and the dilution rate per chamber. Given these numbers, our Microsoft Excel-based cost model computes the total cost of each of the three commercial systems, allowing the user to determine which system is most economical for a specific factory setting...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{evaluations}} of air quality impacts from vehicle emissions {{are based on}} the assumptions that all the important reactive species in the exhaust have been identified and quantified, and that the air quality models accurately represent how their atmospheric reactions affect ozone production. To provide data to test this, environmental chamber experiments were carried out with exhaust from ten different fuelvehicle combinations. These include exhausts from vehicles fueled by LPG, M 100, M 85, CNG, and diesel, and from five vehicles employing Phase 2 reformulated gasoline (RFG), representing a range of mileages, types, and pollution levels. Baseline FTP tests and speciation analyses were carried out for all vehicles studied but diesel, and the conditions of the environmental chamber experiments were characterized so their data could be used for model evaluation. The chamber experiments consisted of irradiations of the exhausts themselves, "incremental reactivity" experiments with the exhaust added to two different surrogate VOC - NO x mixtures simulating conditions of photochemical smog, and irradiations of synthetic exhaust mixtures designed to simulate the experiments with the actual exhausts. Two different methods were used to transfer the <b>diluted</b> <b>exhausts</b> from the vehicle to the chamber, one using a mini-diluter system with a long sample line, and the other using a Teflon transfer bag. The transfer bag was used for most of this project because of evidence for formaldehyde loss when the long sample lines were employed. Although some characterization problems and model discrepancies were observed, the results of most of the experiments with LPG, M 100, M 85, CNG and RFG exhausts were consistent with results of experiments using synthetic exhausts derived to represe [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{types of}} engine exhaust contain {{moisture}} {{that must be}} maintained in gaseous state when sampling particulates to prevent potential destruction of the particles or damage to the measurement apparatus. This is normally achieved by diluting the sample {{in order to reduce}} the partial pressure, thus avoiding condensation. When measuring size distributions of particulates emitted from a gasoline engine, a dilution ratio of at least 5 : 1 is recommended. However, in some operating modes (e. g. lean homogenous modes) or measurement locations (e. g. downstream of a particulate filter) this ratio can be too high for high-resolution measurements due to the low levels of particulates. The presented study investigates the potential for using a nafion dryer to remove water from the <b>exhaust</b> instead of <b>diluting</b> the sample. An electrical mobility measurement device, a Cambustion DMS 500 mk II, was operated without <b>diluting</b> the <b>exhaust</b> gases but with a nafion dryer to remove water from the exhaust. These dryers are commonly used for measuring particulates in airborne aerosols, but no information has been found in the open literature on their application in engine research. The sampling system was connected to a four cylinder SGDI-engine operating in modes that generate small amount of particulates. Samples were taken in four operating conditions, downstream of the catalyst. Overall losses in the complete system and components of the system were determined by tests with an artificially generated aerosol. Factors such as particulate losses, system performance and sample manipulation are discussed. Particulate size distributions were successfully recorded in operating regimes in which they are difficult to measure with conventional sampling systems using the required dilution. Particulate losses were found to be small in the nafion dryer but large in the heated hose prior to the nafion dryer...|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticles (Dp < 50 nm), {{which are}} formed as diesel engine <b>exhaust</b> cools and <b>dilutes,</b> {{constitute}} minority of total particle mass but majority of total particle number. There are several different theories {{to explain the}} nucleation of nanoparticles from diesel ex-haust. The two main theories are homogeneous binary nucleation of sulfuric acid and water, and ion-induced nucleation. This study examined the ion-induced nucleation theory. In order to test the ionic nucleation theory, the charged fraction of the diesel particles were measured {{as a function of}} particle size using regular diesel fuel in this study. A very small amount of charge was found for the diesel nanoparticles in the nuclei mode, whereas there was a large charged fraction for the diesel particles in the accumulation mode. If ion-induced nucleation were the dominant mechanism for the nucleation of nanoparticles from diesel exhaust, one would expect a significant charge on the nuclei mode particles. The results from this study suggest that ion-induced binary nucleation is at least not a dominant mechanism for the nucleation of diesel exhaust when using regular diesel fuel. This study also examined the influence of metal additives on nucleation and particle charging. The metal additives examined are of the type used to enhance particle oxidation in diesel par-ticulate filters. When used, the additives led to a large increase in the concentration of solid particles in the nuclei mode, and signif-icantly raised the level of particle charge for particles of all sizes. When additives were used, some of the solid particles in the nuclei mode carried a charge. We believe that these metal related particles form early enough in the combustion process to be charged by ions present during and shortly after combustion...|$|R

MethodsAtherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE−/−) mice were exposed by inhalation to <b>diluted</b> <b>exhaust</b> (1. 7 mg/m 3, 20, 60 or 180 min, 5 day/week, for 4 weeks), from an engine using standard diesel fuel (DE) or the same diesel fuel containing 9 ppm cerium oxide nanoparticles (DCeE). Changes in hematological indices, clinical chemistry, atherosclerotic burden, tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines and pathology of the major organs were assessed. ResultsAddition of CeO 2 to fuel resulted in a reduction of the number (30 %) and surface area (10 %) of the particles in the exhaust, whereas the gaseous co-pollutants were increased (6 – 8 %). There was, however, a trend towards an increased size and complexity of the atherosclerotic plaques following DE exposure, which was not evident in the DCeE group. There were no clear signs of altered hematological or pathological changes induced by either treatment. However, levels of proinflammatory cytokines were modulated in a brain region and liver following DCeE exposure. ConclusionsThese results imply that addition of CeO 2 nanoparticles to fuel decreases the number of particles in exhaust and may reduce atherosclerotic burden associated with exposure to standard diesel fuel. From the extensive assessment of biological parameters performed, the only concerning effect of cerium addition was a slightly raised level of cytokines in a region of the central nervous system. Overall, the use of cerium as a fuel additive may be a potentially useful way to limit the health effects of vehicle exhaust. However, further testing is required to ensure that such an approach is not associated with a chronic inflammatory response which may eventually cause long-term health effects...|$|R
