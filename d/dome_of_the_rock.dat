5|$|The Fountain of Qasim Pasha, {{built by}} the Ottomans in 1526 and located north of the mosque on the {{platform}} of the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock,</b> was used by worshipers for ablution and for drinking until the 1940s. Today, it stands as a monumental structure.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Creswell, while {{referring}} to the Aphrodito Papyri, claims that Abd al-Malik's son, al-Walid I, reconstructed the Aqsa Mosque {{over a period of}} six months to a year, using workers from Damascus. Most scholars agree that the mosque's reconstruction was started by Abd al-Malik, but that al-Walid oversaw its completion. In 713–14, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt during al-Walid's rule. In order to finance its reconstruction, al-Walid had gold from the <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> minted to use as money to purchase the material. The Umayyad-built al-Aqsa Mosque most likely measured 112 x 39 meters.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied a}} large debris-avalanche deposit of Pleistocene {{age in the}} Tenteniguada Basin, Gran Canaria Island, Spain. This deposit, which is well {{preserved}} because it is mostly covered by basanite lava flows, has distinctive matrix and block facies, hummocky topography, and internal structures typical of debris avalanches. However, neither syneruptive lavas nor some characteristic features of volcanic debris-avalanche deposits, such as a stratovolcano edifice or a horseshoe-shaped crater, are present. <b>The</b> occurrence <b>of</b> internal features characteristic of volcanic avalanche deposits {{could be attributed to}} the volcanic materials involved in the movement, rather than to <b>the</b> triggering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> avalanche during a volcanic eruption. The conditioning factors are shown to be associated with specific structural and hydrological conditions, such as <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> old volcanic <b>domes,</b> strength reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks,</b> effective stress decrease, active gully erosion, and water table rise during Pleistocene humid episodes. We finally suggest that the possible triggering factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> avalanche was a neighbouring volcanic or tectonic earthquake. JRC. H. 7 -Land management and natural hazard...|$|R
5|$|More {{than half}} a century after the capture of Jerusalem, in 691, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik {{commissioned}} the construction of the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> over a large outcropping of bedrock on the Temple Mount. The 10th-century historian al-Muqaddasi wrote that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to compete in grandeur with the city's Christian churches. Whatever the intention, the impressive splendor and scale of the shrine is seen as having helped significantly in solidifying the attachment of Jerusalem to the early Muslim faith.|$|E
5|$|Palestine was conquered by the Islamic Caliphate, {{beginning}} in 634 CE. In 636, the Battle of Yarmouk during the Muslim {{conquest of the}} Levant marked the start of Muslim hegemony over the region, which became known as Jund Filastin within the province of Bilâd al-Shâm (Greater Syria). In 661, with the Assassination of Ali, Muawiyah I became the Caliph of the Islamic world after being crowned in Jerusalem. The <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock,</b> completed in 691, was the world's first great work of Islamic architecture.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the Temple Mount. Saladin ordered all the inner walls and pillars of the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> to be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The Dome of the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E

25|$|Ukko's origins are {{probably}} in Baltic Perkons {{and the older}} Finnish sky god Ilmarinen. Also Thor is related to Perkons. While Ukko took Ilmarinen's position as the Sky God, Ilmarinen's destiny was {{to turn into a}} smith-hero, or <b>the</b> god <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rock.</b> In <b>the</b> epic poetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kalevala, Ilmarinen is credited with forging the stars on <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky and <b>the</b> magic mill <b>of</b> plenty, <b>the</b> Sampo.|$|R
5000|$|In {{historical}} records, the Katskhi pillar {{is first}} mentioned by the 18th-century Georgian scholar Prince Vakhushti, who reports in his Geographic Description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> Georgia: [...] "There is a <b>rock</b> within <b>the</b> ravine standing like a pillar, considerably high. There {{is a small}} church on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rock,</b> but nobody is able to ascend it; nor know they how to do that." [...] No other written accounts of monastic life or ascents survive. A number of local legends surround <b>the</b> pillar. One <b>of</b> them has it that <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rock</b> was connected by a long iron chain to <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Katskhi church, located {{at a distance of}} around 1.5 km from the pillar.|$|R
5|$|The mosque's main {{ablution}} fountain, {{known as}} al-Kas ("the Cup"), is located {{north of the}} mosque {{between it and the}} <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock.</b> It is used by worshipers to perform wudu, a ritual washing of the hands, arms, legs, feet, and face before entry into the mosque. It was first built in 709 by the Umayyads, but in 1327–28 Governor Tankiz enlarged it to accommodate more worshipers. Although originally supplied with water from Solomon's Pools near Bethlehem, it currently receives water from pipes connected to Jerusalem's water supply. In the 20th-century, al-Kas was provided taps and stone seating.|$|E
5|$|During the {{periodic}} renovations undertaken, the various ruling dynasties of the Islamic Caliphate constructed {{additions to the}} mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, facade, its minbar, minarets and the interior structure. When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they used the mosque as a palace and the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> as a church, but its function as a mosque was restored after its recapture by Saladin in 1187. More renovations, repairs and additions were undertaken in the later centuries by the Ayyubids, Mamluks, Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council, and Jordan. Today, the Old City is under Israeli control, but the mosque remains under {{the administration of the}} Jordanian/Palestinian-led Islamic Waqf.|$|E
5|$|In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as {{the sole}} remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, {{as it is the}} closest {{permitted}} accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock.</b> Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E
5|$|The glass {{industry}} in Hebron was established during Roman rule in Palestine (63 BCE-330 CE). As the ancient Phoenician {{glass industry}} shrank from the exposed cities {{along the eastern}} Mediterranean coastline, the industry migrated inland, to Hebron in particular. Glass artifacts from Hebron dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found, and are on exhibit {{as part of the}} Drake Collection. Stained glass windows made of Hebron glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the Cave of Machpelah, which served as a church during the Crusader era in Palestine. Another example of stained glass windows produced in Hebron are those adorning the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> in the Old City of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|With Central Europe {{now under}} the Empire's dominance, Barbarossa turns his {{attention}} to Italy, namely Milan and the Pope. The rise of the Holy Roman Empire has challenged {{the power of the}} Pope in Europe, hence why Barbarossa must be able to subjugate the Italian realms who plot against him. Once again, Henry the Lion betrays Barbarossa, only this time he is stripped of his titles and forced into exile whilst Barbarossa is able to ascertain his superiority in Italy. The Third Crusade begins in the Middle East, and Barbarossa pledges his Empire's support to the coming campaign. But the Holy Roman Empire's army is far too strong for any Navy to carry, forcing Barbarossa to march his troops through hostile Constantinople and Anatolia, which is crawling with Seljuk Turks. During this march, Barbarossa drowns by the weight of his armour in a river current, leaving his army to continue to the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> in Jerusalem with their dead Emperor to fulfil his wishes.|$|E

5|$|Although Kennedy Martin's notion for {{the serial}} was {{influenced}} by real political events, he had {{for a long time}} railed against naturalism in television drama – most notably in a 1964 article for the theatre magazine Encore, titled “Nats Go Home. First Statement of a New Drama for Television”, in which he sought “to free the camera from photographing dialogue, to free the structure from natural time and to exploit the total and absolute objectivity of the television camera”. Edge of Darkness producer Michael Wearing has noted that “there is a mystical dimension to Troy's imagination. His instincts are visual and non-naturalistic”. Kennedy Martin, therefore, crafted a serial that on the one hand placed its events squarely within the real, present day world but on the other also placed itself within the realm of the mystical and the mythic. Realism and authenticity was provided by the appearances of real life television presenter Sue Cook and Labour MP Michael Meacher. There was also use of contemporary stock footage, such as Robin Day's interview with Margaret Thatcher and references to real persons like Michael Heseltine and places such as Sellafield, alongside the references to fictitious characters and places contained in the plot. The mystical dimension is provided by Emma's ghost while the mythic is provided by Craven himself and by Jedburgh and Grogan. Kennedy Martin, influenced by John Darragh's The Real Camelot (Thames and Hudson, 1981) which examined the pagan origins of the Arthurian legend, saw Craven as a modern-day Green Man who would confront the threats to the Earth on behalf of Gaia. Jedburgh was conceived by Kennedy Martin as a Knight of the Marches, one of the Teutonic Knights who defended the borders of Eastern Europe, opposed to Grogan, who Kennedy Martin saw as a descendant of the Knights Templar who, according to legend, had guarded a special wisdom in the Temple of the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> in Jerusalem. These aspects would reach their apotheosis in the serial's conclusion in which Kennedy Martin envisaged that Craven, having found the plutonium stolen by Jedburgh, would be shot by a sniper and would be transformed into a tree.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> is {{regarded}} as occupying the actual space where the Second Temple once stood, but some scholars disagree and instead claim that the temple was located either {{just north of the}} <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock,</b> or about 200 meters south of it, with access to the Gihon fresh water spring, or perhaps between the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> and the Al Aqsa Mosque.|$|E

25|$|According to American {{fundamentalist}} Protestant author Hal Lindsey, the Third Temple {{could be}} built {{right next to the}} <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock.</b> He believes, based on the theory of Dr. Asher Kaufman regarding the location of the Eastern Gate, that the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> was built on what the Bible refers to as the Court of the Gentiles. He states that according to Revelation 11:1–2, the rebuilding of the Third Temple was not to include the section of the temple mount known as The Court of the Gentiles. Therefore, he believes that the Third Temple and the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> could stand side by side.|$|E
