Despite {{restoration of}} epicardial flow during primary PCI in STEMI, microvascular obstruction may persist {{as a result of}} both atheromatous and thrombotic embolization and vasospasm. We are presenting our experience with <b>use</b> of <b>intracoronary</b> abciximab <b>using</b> local drug delivery catheter in STEMI patients.

40|$|Background Inefficacy of {{systemic}} drug administration for restenosis prevention may partially relate to insufficient local drug concentration. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} acute feasibility and long-term outcome of using an infusion-perfusion coil balloon, Dispatch. Methods and Results In 22 patients after balloon angioplasty, the coil balloon was studied for (1) feasibility of local heparin delivery, (2) symptoms and signs of ischemia during prolonged deployment compared with angioplasty balloon occlusion, (3) coronary pressure and flow distal to the inflated device, and (4) long-term clinical and angiographic results. During prolonged intracoronary deployment of the coil balloon (29 ± 8 minutes), 5 of 22 patients developed mild chest pain versus 20 of 22 during angioplasty (275 ± 283 seconds). Neither hemodynamic nor vectorcardiographic signs of ischemia were detected, in contrast to angioplasty balloon occlusion. Baseline flow across the coil balloon was 44 ± 31 mL/min, increasing {{by a factor of}} 1. 8 ± 0. 7 during pharmacologically induced hyperemia. A mean volume of 14. 2 ± 6. 1 mL containing 1416 ± 608 IU of heparin was infused locally at a pressure of 122 ± 54 mm Hg. At 7 ± 1 -month follow-up, 1 asymptomatic patient had died, and of the remaining 21, 17 (81 %) were asymptomatic. Angiographic follow-up was obtained in 15 of 21 patients (71 %), including all 4 symptomatic patients. Mean minimal luminal diameter after the procedure was 2. 16 ± 0. 49 mm and at follow-up, 1. 89 ± 0. 45 mm, which corresponds to a restenosis rate (diameter stenosis 50 %) of 7 % (1 / 15). Conclusions <b>Intracoronary</b> <b>use</b> of the coil balloon after balloon angioplasty proved to be feasible and subjectively as well as objectively well tolerated during prolonged deployment by virtue of its perfusion properties.

It {{has been suggested that}} the hyperemic effect of the conventionally used hyperemic stimulus, adenosine, could be submaximal in patients who have microvascular dysfunction and that adding α-blocking agents could augment the hyperemic response in these patients. We studied the effect of the nonselective α-blocking agent phentolamine, which was administered in addition to adenosine after achieving hyperemia, in patients who had microvascular disease and those who did not. Thirty patients who were referred for percutaneous coronary intervention were selected. Of these 30 patients, 15 had strong indications for microvascular disease and 15 did not. FFR was measured <b>using</b> <b>intracoronary</b> adenosine, intravenous adenosine, and intracoronary papaverine before and after intracoronary administration of the nonselective α blocker phentolamine. In patients who did not have microvascular disease, no differences in hyperemic response to adenosine were noted, whether or not α blockade was given before adenosine administration; FFR levels before and after phentolamine were 0. 76 and 0. 75, respectively, <b>using</b> <b>intracoronary</b> adenosine (p = 0. 10) and 0. 75 and 0. 74, respectively, using intravenous adenosine (p = 0. 20).

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} whether myocardial contrast echocardiography {{can be used}} to quantify collateral derived myocardial flow in humans.  METHODS—In 25  patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, a collateral flow index (CFI) was determined <b>using</b> <b>intracoronary</b> wedge pressure distal to the stenosis to be dilated, with simultaneous mean aortic pressure measurements. During balloon occlusion, echo contrast was injected into both main coronary arteries simultaneously. Echocardiography of the collateral receiving myocardial area was performed. The time course of myocardial contrast enhancement in images acquired at end diastole was quantified by measuring pixel intensities (256  grey units) within a region of interest. Perfusion variables, such as background subtracted peak pixel intensity and contrast transit rate, were obtained from a fitted γ variate curve.  RESULTS— 16 patients had a left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis, four had a left circumflex coronary artery stenosis, and five had a right coronary artery stenosis. The mean (SD) CFI was 19  (12) % (range 0 - 47 %). Mean contrast transit rate was 11  (8) seconds. In 17  patients, a significant collateral contrast effect was observed (defined as peak pixel intensity more than the mean +  2  SD of background).

We studied the effects of intracoronary gamma-radiation therapy versus placebo on the clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients with in-stent restenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients with in-stent restenosis underwent successful coronary intervention and were then blindly randomized to receive either intracoronary gamma-radiation with (192) Ir (15 Gy) or placebo. Four independent core laboratories blinded to the treatment protocol analyzed the angiographic and intravascular ultrasound end points of restenosis. Procedural success and in-hospital and 30 -day complications were similar among the groups. At 6 months, patients assigned to radiation therapy required less target lesion revascularization and target vessel revascularization (9 [13. 8 %] and 17 [26. 2 %], respectively) compared with patients assigned to placebo (41 [63. 1 %, P= 0. 0001] and 44 [67. 7 %, P= 0. 0001], respectively).

The ratio of mean distal pressure to average peak blood flow velocity was used as an index for the microvascular resistance (MRv).

Such improvements could be beneficial for cardiovascular MR. However, <b>intracoronary</b> stents <b>used</b> for treatment of coronary artery disease are currently considered to be contra-indications for UHF-MR. The antenna effect induced by a stent together with RF wavelength shortening could increase local radiofrequency (RF) power deposition at 7. 0 T and bears the potential to induce local heating, which might cause tissue damage. Realizing these constraints, this work examines RF heating effects of stents using electro-magnetic field (EMF) simulations and phantoms with properties that mimic myocardium. For this purpose, RF power deposition that exceeds the clinical limits was induced by a dedicated birdcage coil. Fiber optic probes and MR thermometry were applied for temperature monitoring using agarose phantoms containing copper tubes or coronary stents.

In the first study consistently applying this principle in the human coronary circulation, Nakatani et all used 20 -MHz Doppler catheters with a pulse repetition frequency of 62. 5 kHz. 2 With this system, however, they were unable to record flow velocities> 115 cm/sec because of the development of frequency aliasing. As a result of this technical limitation, all the flow velocity measurements were obtained in mild to moderate coronary stenosis, with a percent cross-sectional area reduction < 75 % (diameter stenosis < 50 %). In patients with significant cor-onary stenosis undergoing coronary balloon angioplasty, we exten-sively <b>used</b> <b>intracoronary</b> catheters with the same end-mounte...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{characterize}} the long-term outcomes of patients undergoing <b>intracoronary</b> brachytherapy <b>using</b> Beta- irradiation (Beta-BT). BACKGROUND: Beta-BT is effective in reducing angiographic restenosis as well as target vessel revascularization (TVR) in patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) after bare-metal stenting (BMS). METHODS: 81 consecutive patients undergoing Beta-BT for ISR (irradiated length 32 [32 - 54] mm) after BMS in native vessels (n = 79) or saphenous vein grafts (n = 2) between 2001 and 2003 were followed. Major cardiac events (MACE), including cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and TVR occurring < 1 year or < 1 year were assessed 5. 2 (4. 4 - 5. 6) years after the index procedure. RESULTS: During the entire follow-up period, the total MACE rate was 49. 4 %. Within {{the first year and}} at < 1 year, MACE rates were 25. 9 % and 23. 5 %, cardiac death occurred in 2. 4 % and 6. 2 %, and nonfatal MI in 6. 2 % and 12. 3 % for annual cardiac death/MI rates of 8. 7 % at 32 mm (odds ratio [OR] 2. 73, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 10 - 6. 78; p = 0. 03). The best, albeit not statistically significant, predictor of MACE occurring at < 1 year was the presence of diabetes mellitus (OR 2. 49, 95 % CI 0. 94 - 6. 57; p = 0. 07). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing Beta-BT for ISR after BMS carry a substantial risk of MACE also beyond the first year, with annual cardiac death and nonfatal MI rates of 1. 5 % and 2. 9 % up to 5 years postprocedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{relations between}} serum creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) release {{and the final}} infarct size estimated by myocardial emission computed tomography with thallium- 201 was assessed in 37 patients with a first acute transmural myocardial infarction who underwent <b>intracoronary</b> thrombolysis <b>using</b> urokinase 4. 6 ± 1. 9 hours after the onset of symptoms. Serial CK-MB determinations were {{used to calculate the}} accumulated release of CK-MB (ΣCK-MB). Myocardial emission tomography with thallium- 201 was performed 4 weeks after the onset, and infarct volume was measured from reconstructed tomographic images by computerized planimetry. The results are presented for two groups of patients: 11 patients with unsuccessful thrombolysis (group A) and 26 patients with successful thrombolysis (group B). An excellent linear relation was found for group A (ΣCK-MB = 6. 4 x infarct volume + 47. 7, r = 0. 91), whereas a different linear relation was observed for group B (ΣCK-MB = 10. 5 x infarct volume + 89. 1, r = 0. 80). Moreover, serum CK-MB activity reached a peak at 21. 1 ± 2. 2 hours after the onset in group A and reached an earlier peak at 12. 5 ± 2. 9 hours in group B (p < 0. 001). These data suggest that acute coronary recanalization alters the kinetics of CK-MB release, resulting in greater CK-MB release into the serum for equivalent infarct volume estimated by myocardial emission tomography with thallium- 201. Thus, serum CK-MB time-activity curves after acute myocardial infarction may be influenced considerably by acute reperfusion, which is an important factor that should be incorporated in the interpretation of enzymatic estimates of infarct size in human patients...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{different}} modalities {{and treatment}} {{options for the}} treatment and prevention of coronary restenosis are discussed. All studied during the past 10 years in the clinical setting of the coronary catheterization laboratories in Utrecht. At first the initial results <b>using</b> <b>intracoronary</b> brachtytherapy with a liquid filled balloon are presented, {{as well as an}} in vitro study on the behaviour of platelets after brachytherapy. Secondly a comparison between direct and delayed brachytherapy is discussed. Thirdly a comparison between beta and gamma radiation and the first generation drug eluting stent is presented. Thereafter two chapters are dedicated to the incidence and risk of acute and sub acute stent thrombosis. A novel and revolutionary drug eluting stent design with in-situ customizable length and biodegradable polymer is presented in chapter 9. In two further chapters modified and new techniques in the treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions are discussed. And finally the results of a large retrospective local database analysis on a new thin strut cobalt chromium stent design and a decision tree for the indication of a bare metal stent in Utrecht are presented...|$|R
40|$|Myocardial {{contrast}} echocardiography is {{a technique}} used in experimental and clinical settings in order to visualize the pattern of intramyocardial perfusion. In the acute phase of myocardial infarction, regional absence of flow during myocardial contrast echocardiography delineates the area at risk of necrosis, while the definitive non-perfused area expresses infarct size. Reopening the infarct-related artery, which may be achieved spontaneously by thrombolysis or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, is not a reliable indicator of intramyocardial reperfusion. If myocardial ischaemia due to coronary occlusion has been sufficiently prolonged and severe, not only myocyte viability, but also microvascular integrity is lost. Myocardial contrast echocardiography, <b>using</b> <b>intracoronary</b> injection of sonicated contrast medium, gives information about microvascular integrity and the effective presence of intramyocardial reflow. Anatomical integrity of microvasculature does not necessarily imply preserved function, and thus the microvessel vasodilating reserve may also be impaired. Myocardial contrast echocardiography {{has the potential to}} assess alterations in microvascular function, showing, in the myocardial area with reduced coronary reserve, a relatively reduced increase in echocontrast signal intensity when an intravenous vasodilator agent is administered...|$|R
40|$|Intracoronary optical {{frequency}} domain imaging (OFDI) provides high resolution, three-dimensional views of coronary artery microstructure, but requires a non-occlusive saline/contrast purge to displace blood for clear artery views. Recent studies utilized manual pullback initiation/termination based on real-time image observation. Automated pullback initiation/termination by real-time OFDI signal analysis would enable more efficient data acquisition. We evaluate {{the use of}} simple imaging parameters to automatically and robustly differentiate between diagnostic-quality clear artery wall (CAW) versus blood-obstructed fields (BOF). Algorithms are tested <b>using</b> <b>intracoronary</b> OCT human data retrospectively and intracoronary OFDI swine and human data prospectively. In prospective analysis of OFDI swine data, the sensitivity and specificity of the ratio of second and first moments (contrast parameter) were 99. 6 % and 97. 2 %, respectively. In prospective analysis of OFDI clinical data, the contrast parameter yielded 96. 0 % sensitivity and 94. 5 % specificity. Accuracy improved further by analyzing sequential frames. These results indicate the algorithm may be utilized with intracoronary OFDI for initiating and terminating automated pullback and digital data recording...|$|R
40|$|<b>Intracoronary</b> {{papaverine}} is <b>used</b> as a {{means to}} induce a strong and short-lasting hyperemia in several recently developed methods to measure coronary flow reserve. Changes in stenosis geometry from papaverine would influence the measured coronary flow reserve. Therefore, we investigated the influence of intracoronary papaverine on stenosis geometry with quantitative analysis of the coronary angiogram and assessed the influence of papaverine on pressure-flow characteristics of the stenosis and coronary flow reserve. The cross-sectional areas (mean +/- SD) of the stenosis increased 18 % +/- 7 % after papaverine. The normal proximal and distal parts of the coronary artery dilated 5 % +/- 2 % after papaverine. This results in a decrease of the calculated pressure drop over the stenosis varying from 20 % to 30 %. Coronary flow reserve of a flow-limiting epicardial stenosis is overestimated by 16 % when papaverine is used to induce hyperemia. These papaverine-induced changes can nevertheless be circumvented by maximal vasodilation of the major epicardial coronary artery with 3 mg intracoronary isosorbidedinitrate prior to the investigation of the coronary flow reserve with papaverine...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the safety as well as the clinical and technical effectiveness of robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention. BackgroundRobotic systems have been suggested to enhance the performance of cardiovascular procedures, as well as to provide protection from the occupational hazards that are associated with interventional practice. MethodsPatients with coronary artery disease and clinical indications for percutaneous intervention were enrolled. The coronary intervention was performed with the CorPath 200 robotic system, which consists of a remote interventional cockpit and a bedside disposable cassette that enables the operator to advance, retract, and rotate guidewires and catheters. The primary endpoints were clinical procedural success, defined as < 30 % residual stenosis at the completion of the robotic-assisted procedure without major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 days, and device technical success, defined as the successful manipulation of the <b>intracoronary</b> devices <b>using</b> the robotic system only. ResultsA total of 164 patients were enrolled at 9 sites. Percutaneous coronary intervention was completed successfully without conversion to manual operation, and device technical success was achieved in 162 of 164 patients (98. 8 %). There were no device-related complications. Clinical procedural success was achieved in 160 of 164 patients (97. 6 %), whereas 4 (2. 4 %) had periprocedural non–Q-wave myocardial infarctions. No deaths, strokes, Q-wave myocardial infarctions, or revascularization occurred in the 30 days after the procedures. Radiation exposure for the primary operator was 95. 2 % lower than the levels found at the traditional table position. ConclusionsThis pivotal multicenter study with a robotic-enhanced coronary intervention system demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the system. The robotic remote-control procedure met the expected technical and clinical performance, with significantly lower radiation exposure to the operator.

40|$|Myocardial {{contrast}} echocardiography (intracoronary application) {{has emerged}} as an accurate method to detect the “no-reflow phenomenon. ” To investigate the diagnostic value of harmonic angiography after intravenous infusion of Levovist in assessing “no-reflow,” both intracoronary and intravenous contrast injections were performed {{in a group of}} patients with acute myocardial infarction. Seventeen consecutive patients with a successfully reperfused acute myocardial infarction within 6 hours of symptom onset were selected for this study. All patients underwent contrast echocardiography with harmonic angiography with Levovist (400 mg/mL, intravenous pump infusion, trigger intervals 1 : 4 to 1 : 8) and sonicated albumin (0. 5 to 1 mL, intracoronary bolus) on day 1 after the achievement of a sustained coronary reflow. Myocardial perfusion was qualitatively assessed with a 12 -segment model. The endocardial length of the residual contrast defect after reflow was also calculated. Forty-four of 204 segments were not analyzed after intravenous contrast echocardiography and 37 after intracoronary contrast echocardiography because of artifacts. Intracoronary and intravenous injections showed a perfusion defect in 31 (19 %) segments, with a concordance of 89 % (κ coefficient, 0. 72). Concordance in anteroseptal, anterolateral, and inferolateral segments was 95 % (κ = 0. 92), 88 % (κ = 0. 66), and 83 % (κ = 0. 57), respectively. With <b>intracoronary</b> injection <b>used</b> as the reference method, intravenous injection had a sensitivity of 74 % and a specificity of 93 % for diagnosing contrast defects. The endocardial extent of no-reflow was 18 ± 19 after intravenous and 21 ± 17 after intracoronary contrast echocardiography (P = not significant). Intravenous contrast echocardiography with Levovist reliably identifies the no-reflow phenomenon after successful reperfusion, especially in acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
