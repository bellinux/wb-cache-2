40|$|Retrofits of {{hydraulic}} {{and mechanical}} <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>presses</b> often {{stop with the}} exchange of the electrical and the hydraulic parts. But that is only half the job. The use of high definition control electronics, faster CPUs and more dynamic hydraulic actuators, offers the opportunity of redesigning the already existing control concepts of the press. In this paper we present how {{the performance of the}} press, i. e. the control quality, can be increased for hydraulic ram and cushion axes. The improvement in control quality is achieved through the use of intelligent closed-loop and open-loopcontrol algorithms. Therefore, creasing and crack formation can be reduced, since enhancements in control quality have direct influence {{on the quality of the}} forming process. Results will be shown for hydraulic drawing cushion control, i. e. pressure control, as well as for hydraulic ram control, i. e. position, velocity and parallelism control. We present findings for hydraulic cushion control of a mechanical press type Arisa S- 4 - 1600 - 470 - 230 -LDE (link-drive press with 10 hydraulic cushions) and for ram- / cushion-control of hydraulic press type Müller-Weingarten ZE 2100 (multi-curve press with 8 -point cushion) ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an example of}} a link-drive mechanism for a <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> mechanical <b>press.</b> Because of its characteristics such a drive is much more appropriate than conventional crankshaft or eccentric drive. The existing design of the drive has proved unsatisfactory and does not meet all the demands and constraints, which are ideal for <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> process. Optimization of the drive is therefore necessary. The intention is to achieve the required velocity characteristics in a defined area of movement. Firstly, the drive is analyzed and a mathematical model is made and prepared for optimization procedure. The process is time-dependent, so it cannot be used directly in the optimization algorithm. Mathematical model is transformed intoa form suitable for the standard non-linear optimization procedure and then optimization is carried out. The method used is sequential quadratic programming. The final objective of the optimization process is to find such dimensions of link-drive members that the given requirements are satisfied in the best possible manner...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{power train}} {{of a modern}} servo-screw press with low {{rotational}} moment of inertia provides higher dynamics and {{a new kind of}} flexibility in forming and stamping processes compared to conventional servo presses. In this paper a new technology for <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> on servo-screw <b>presses</b> called cushion-ram pulsation is described. It uses superimposed low-frequency vibrations between 10 Hz and 50 Hz at the cushion and the <b>press</b> ram. For <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> operations, the high tensile stresses in the frame of cylindrical cup usually lead to a reduction of material thickness. Thus, and {{due to the lack of}} work hardening, fractures frequently occur in the punch radius. The process developed here shifts critical loads to higher drawing ratios by decoupling the drawing operation and the prevention of wrinkles. A high frequency of the cushion-ram pulsation is necessary to allow high productivity. Technological results will be increasingly determined by the machine...|$|R

40|$|During forming, the <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>press</b> {{and tools}} undergo large loads, {{and even though}} they are {{extremely}} sturdy structures, deformations occur. This causes changes in the geometry of the tool surface and the gap width between the tools. The deep drawing process can be very sensitive to these deformations. Tool and press deformations can be split into two categories. The deflection of the press bed-plate or slide and global deformation in the deep drawing tools are referred to as macro press deformation. Micro-deformation occurs directly at the surfaces of the forming tools and is one or two orders lower in magnitude. The goal is to include tool deformation in a FE forming simulation. This is not principally problematic, however, the FE meshes become very large, causing an extremely large increase in numerical effort. In this paper, various methods are discussed to include tool elasticity phenomena with acceptable cost. For macro deformation, modal methods or ’deformable rigid bodies’ provide interesting possibilities. Static condensation is also a well known method {{to reduce the number of}} DOFs, however the increasing bandwidth of the stiffness matrix limits this method severely, and decreased calculation times are not expected. At the moment, modeling Micro-deformation remains unfeasible. Theoretically, it can be taken into account, but the results may not be reliable due to the limited size of the tool meshes and due to approximations in the contact algorithms...|$|E

The process {{is a combination of}} deep drawing, injection moulding and media based forming in one die. The project is splited into two phases. In the first phase 2013 - 2014 the technical basis will be created and tested on a cup with a polymer injected plastic inner part. Aluminum, steel and hybrid laminates will be used as sheet materials and PA 6 as plastic component. In the second phase 2015 - 2017 the process should be transferred to a production orientated part.

In all technologies the metal or sheet parts where produced separately from the plastic parts. The injection moulding process is only used for forming the plastic parts and for joining the parts. The "Merge" process is divided into two steps. First operation is the deep drawing process to generate the preform of the metal part. Then the injection moulding process takes place. The plastic melt will be used for the injection moulding and also as an active media for metal forming. A real deep drawing process with blank holder and die cushion should be realized.

40|$|Stamping dies {{are used}} in the Sheet Metal Forming (SMF) process for {{manufacturing}} of car body parts. The lead time for design and manufacturing of a stamping die is long, and therefore costly. In the final step of the manufacturing process, manual rework is performed to reach a desired pressure distribution on the forming surfaces in order to achieve a robust process and an approved part within tolerance. The main purpose for this work is to study and further develop a Virtual Rework Method that alters the shape of the forming surfaces of a die to compensate for the displacements of a stamping press that occur during stamping. Measurements were performed to obtain the displacements that occur in the stamping press during stamping. These measurements were performed on a double action <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>press</b> of the brand Danly, located at Volvo Cars Tool & Die department in Olofström, Sweden. The measurement yields information of how the stamping press is deflecting and deforming during operation. The measurements are recorded with a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system that records the displacements of the press during stamping. The displacements obtained in the measurements are then used as constraints to inverse FE- model a press table with topology optimization. This optimized press table is used in the Virtual Rework Method to be able to simulate both the deformations of the press and the internal deformations that occur in the die. Pre-simulations were performed before the measurements to ensure that the blank holder plate used in the measurements would withstand the applied blank holder force. These simulations also yield if the displacements were large enough for the ARAMIS DIC system to capture. The FE-model used in this work consisted of a die, blank holder, blank holder plate, outer ram and the optimized press table. The Virtual Rework Method was applied on the FE-model, where the result concludes that the altered shape of the deformed forming surfaces is almost identical to the shape of the nominal forming surfaces. However, an inversed modelled structure that represents the behavior of the outer ram is required to apply the Virtual Rework Method on the blank holder. This inversed modelled structure could be created from the displacements obtained in the measurements. To apply the Virtual Rework method on the punch, further measurements are required, where the position of the ARAMIS DIC system is altered, or an additional ARAMIS DIC system is used.  Pressverktyg används i plåtformningsprocessen vid tillverkning av karossdelar.

30|$|Microridge punches were {{designed}} to decrease the number of stages in the multistage <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> process of the high aspect ratio cylindrical cups {{with the aid of}} the finite element method. Explicit rigid-plastic finite element analysis with 2 D axisymmetric solid elements was performed to calculate the thickness difference percentage in the initial design during the <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> process. Guideline of the process design modification was proposed {{to reduce the number of}} <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> stages at similar thickness difference percentages. The modified design proposed that a two-stage <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> using two microridge-free punches was replaced with a single-stage <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> using a microridge punch. The deep-drawing process used microridge punches evenly distributed throughout the drawing stages to decrease the indent in the final product. The design parameters of the microridge punches were set based on the comparison of the simulated results with those of the original designs. The modified design was examined by the simulated and experimental results.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Semi-ball bottom {{cylindrical}} <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> {{is different}} from the traditional <b>deep</b> <b>drawing,</b> since it is not only characteristics of traditional drawing, but also of bulging. According to the semi-ball bottom cylindrical <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> features, the stress conditions of the sheet in different regions have been analyzed by a mathematical modelling. In addition, the effects of processing parameters on the forming limit of the sheet in semi-ball bottom cylindrical <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> have been investigated by experimental method and simulation based on dynaform, respectively. It is found that the experimental results are consistent to that in simulation and the results show that the formability of the sheet is influenced greatly by the blank holder force, friction coefficient and thickness. With the blank holder force and friction coefficient decreasing and the thickness increasing, the bulging area can be expanded, which is beneficial to the improvement of the forming limit height of the semi-ball bottom cylindrical <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> parts...|$|R
