5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in {{it as part of}} an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> new very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E
5|$|The {{second set}} of colonists disembarked from the Kennersley Castle in late March 1823. Their {{optimism}} was quickly extinguished. Hall returned in April with disheartening news: he had found no ship that could help and, far from considering them any responsibility of his, King George Frederic Augustus had not even been aware of their presence. The Kennersley Castle having sailed, MacGregor's victims could count on no assistance in the near future. The emigrants had brought ample provisions with them, including medicines, and had two doctors among them, so they were not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> hopeless situation, but apart from Hall none of the military officers, government officials or civil servants appointed by MacGregor made any serious attempt to organise the party.|$|E

25|$|Swapping of {{the wing}} men: Sometimes, a team with two {{flexible}} (position wise) wide men {{will allow them to}} interchange as the game progresses. The aim of this is to confuse the defenders who are assigned to mark them, thus maybe leading to opportunities as the defender tries to find their man in set pieces (corners, free kicks etc., where the man may be <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> different position and thus evade his grasp). Also, if the wingers are different types of player (one favouring crossing from deep positions whilst the other is prone to trying to dribble past their marker for example), then it might be to exploit a weakness in the opposing defender.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> {{different}} sense, polarization encoding {{has become}} the leading (but not sole) method for delivering separate images {{to the left and}} right eye in stereoscopic displays used for 3D movies. This involves separate images intended for each eye either projected from two different projectors with orthogonally oriented polarizing filters or, more typically, from a single projector with time multiplexed polarization (a fast alternating polarization device for successive frames). Polarized 3D glasses with suitable polarizing filters ensure that each eye receives only the intended image. Historically such systems used linear polarization encoding because it was inexpensive and offered good separation. However circular polarization makes separation of the two images insensitive to tilting of the head, and is widely used in 3-D movie exhibition today, such as the system from RealD. Projecting such images requires screens that maintain the polarization of the projected light when viewed in reflection (such as silver screens); a normal diffuse white projection screen causes depolarization of the projected images, making it unsuitable for this application.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, French scholars, such as E. G. Rey, Gaston Dodu, and René Grousset {{believed}} that the crusaders and the native Muslims and Christians lived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> integrated society. Ronnie Ellenblum claims this view was influenced by French imperialism and colonialism; if medieval French crusaders could integrate themselves into local society, then certainly modern French colonies in the Levant could thrive. In the mid-20th century, scholars such as Joshua Prawer, R. C. Smail, Meron Benvenisti, and Claude Cahen argued instead that the crusaders lived totally segregated from the native inhabitants, who were thoroughly Arabicized and/or Islamicized and were a constant threat to the foreign crusaders. Prawer argued further that the kingdom was an early attempt at colonization, in which the crusaders were a small ruling class, who were dependent on the native population for survival but {{made no attempt to}} integrate with them. For this reason, the rural European society to which the crusaders were accustomed was replaced by a more secure urban society in the pre-existing cities of the Levant.|$|E
25|$|After {{experiencing}} {{a decade of}} warfare with an increasingly higher profile, the FARC needed another conference to establish a more sophisticated military plan for its future operations. The conference was held in late 1970s {{under the leadership of}} Manuel Marulanda and Jacobo Arenas, which by then were the FARC's key leaders. According to some historical reports about the FARC in the 1970s, they then decided to form a military academy similar to the ones in existing socialist countries, like those in the Soviet Union, Cuba, and also like those employed by its enemies, like the United States and the United Kingdom. The FARC identified several difficulties that made the situation increasingly complex due to the growing threat of the enemy, and decided to take a step forward in a different form, through maintaining a policy of advanced military training. FARC had built a training structure <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> different way, not directly comparable with those of orthodox military organizations, as each level of training had to end with a period of combat experience in real life warfare, before progressing to the next level.|$|E
500|$|The {{surprise}} {{success of}} Guitar Hero readily {{led to the}} development of a sequel for the game. According to developer John Tam, the team felt they [...] "hit the sweet spot" [...] of genres and decades within the set list and wanted to maintain that for the sequel. [...] The costs of obtaining licensing rights for music from [...] "big bands" [...] such as AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, and Metallica, in addition to the lack of understanding of how the music would be used prevented these groups from being used in Guitar Hero. [...] However, Tam notes that with the success of Guitar Hero, [...] "They understand that we're not going to embarrass their music, we're going to actually pay homage to their music and get it to the point where people are going to fall in love with their music and understand their music <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> different way than they've ever experienced it before."

500|$|The writer David Kimbell {{states that}} in Luisa Miller and Stiffelio (the {{earliest}} operas of this period) {{there appears to}} be a [...] "growing freedom in the large scale structure...and an acute attention to fine detail." [...] Others echo those feelings. Julian Budden expresses the impact of Rigoletto and its place in Verdi's output as follows: [...] "Just after 1850 at the age of 38, Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with Rigoletto. The so-called ottocento in music is finished. Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> new spirit." [...] One example of Verdi's wish to move away from [...] "standard forms" [...] appears in his feelings about the structure of Il trovatore. To his librettist, Cammarano, Verdi plainly states in a letter of April 1851 that if there were no standard forms—"cavatinas, duets, trios, choruses, finales, etc. ... and if you could avoid beginning with an opening chorus....", he would be quite happy.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, producer Mikkel S.

In {{an interview}} with MTV, Rihanna explained that {{while she was in}} Paris, Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and The-Dream played a few songs for her, which included [...] "Hard". Rihanna decided to record the song because it was different from her normal creative output. Stewart, in {{an interview with}} Rap-Up, spoke about the song before its title or any details were released, describing the song as [...] "edgy" [...] and a [...] "club banger". When asked if the song was bigger than Rihanna's commercially successful song [...] "Umbrella", he said, [...] "No, it's different. It's a superstar taking a step <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> different direction." [...] "Hard" [...] is the first song for which Jeezy was credited thus, instead of under his enduring stage name [...] "Young Jeezy".|$|E

On behalf of Rolling Stone, Daniel Kreps stated that [...] "Aguilera assumes no less than a dozen different guises, all scantily clad, ranging from carbon copies of Lady Gaga (borrowing heavily from her unique wardrobe), Madonna, Beyoncé, Gwen Stefani, the girls from Robert Palmer's [...] "Simply Irresistible" [...] video and Michelle Pfeiffer's S Catwoman from Batman Returns.

500|$|Meshuggah {{has become}} known for its {{innovative}} musical style that evolves between each release and pushes heavy metal into new territory, and for its technical prowess. Hagström comments: [...] "We try never to repeat ourselves." [...] Rockdetector stated about Destroy Erase Improve: [...] "he band...stripped Metal down to the bare essentials before completely rebuilding it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> abstract form". The official Meshuggah biography comments on Chaosphere by noting that [...] "Some fans felt that Meshuggah had left their dynamic and progressive elements behind; while others thought they were only progressing naturally and focusing on their original sound." [...] The band's website also describes Nothing as displaying [...] "a very mature and convincing Meshuggah, now focusing on groove and sound...Meshuggah once again divided their fans into the 'ecstatic' and the 'slightly disappointed'". The polyrhythms can make the music sound cacophonous, like band members are playing different songs simultaneously.

500|$|Responsible for the film's {{production}} design was Rick Heinrichs, who Burton {{intended to use}} on Superman Lives. While the production crew {{was always going to}} build a substantial number of sets, the decision was taken early on that to fulfill Burton's vision best would necessitate shooting Sleepy Hollow <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> controlled environment at Leavesden Film Studios. The {{production design}} was influenced [...] by Burton's love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. Heinrichs was also influenced by American colonial architecture, German Expressionism, Dr. Seuss illustrations, and Hammer's Dracula Has Risen from the Grave. One sound stage at Leavesden was dedicated to the [...] "Forest to Field" [...] set, for the scene in which the Headless Horseman races out of the woods and into a field. This stage was then transformed into, variously, a graveyard, a corn field, a field of harvested wheat, a churchyard, and a snowy battlefield. In addition, a small backlot area was devoted to a New York City street and waterfront tank.|$|E

[...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E
