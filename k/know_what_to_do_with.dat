For instance, we like Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set {{if we get a}} chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.|$|E

When Henderson asks Grandpa why he owed twenty-four years of back income tax, Grandpa states he never believed in it, {{and that the government}} wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the money if he did pay it.

Henderson spots Grandpa's snakes, and runs out of the house in fear, but not before promising Grandpa that he will hear, one way or another, from the United States government.|$|E

Once a very successful businessman, he left his job 35 years prior for no reason other than to just relax. He lives his life by the philosophy 'don't do anything that you're not going to enjoy doing'. He goes to circuses, commencements, throws darts, and collects stamps.|$|E

25|$|When {{large-scale}} excavations of Pompeii were {{undertaken in}} the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the Romans came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the Roman Empire. They did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the frank depictions of sexuality, and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper-class scholars. The movable objects were locked away in the Secret Museum in Naples, and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off so as to not corrupt the sensibilities of women, children and the working class. England's (and the world's) first laws criminalising pornography were enacted {{with the passage of}} the Obscene Publications Act of 1857. Despite their occasional repression, depictions of erotic themes have been common for millennia.|$|E

25|$|According to Goenner, the {{contributions}} to the book are a mixture of mathematical–physical incompetence, hubris, and {{the feelings of the}} critics of being suppressed by contemporary physicists advocating for the new theory. The compilation of the authors show, Goenner continues, {{that this was not a}} reaction within the physics community—only one physicist (Karl Strehl) and three mathematicians (Jean-Marie Le Roux, Emanuel Lasker and Hjalmar Mellin) were present—but a reaction of an inadequately educated academic citizenship, which didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> relativity. As regards the average age of the authors: 57% were substantially older than Einstein, one third was around the same age, and only two persons were substantially younger. Two authors (Reuterdahl, von Mitis) were antisemitic and four others were possibly connected to the Nazi movement. On the other hand, no antisemitic expression can be found in the book, and it also included contributions of some authors of Jewish ancestry (Salomo Friedländer, Ludwig Goldschmidt, Hans Israel, Emanuel Lasker, Oskar Kraus, Menyhért Palágyi).|$|E

25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

But I think the characters that are there, each of our moments that we have, are key to the storytelling, which is how it should be." ...|$|E
