The technical development of COPERT is financed by the European Environment Agency (EEA), {{in the framework of}} the activities of the <b>European</b> <b>Topic</b> <b>Centre</b> on Air and Climate Change. Since 2007, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre has been coordinating the further scientific development of the model. In principle, COPERT has been developed for use from the National Experts to estimate emissions from road transport to be included in official annual national inventories. The COPERT methodology is also part of the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook. The Guidebook, developed by the UNECE Task Force on Emissions Inventories and Projections, is intended to support reporting under the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the EU directive on national emission limits. The COPERT methodology is fully consistent with the Road Transport chapter of the Guidebook. The use of a software tool to calculate road transport emissions allows for a transparent and standardized, hence consistent and comparable data collecting and emissions reporting procedure, in accordance with the requirements of international conventions and protocols and EU legislation.|$|E

A second novel aspect is the interim step of formulating a set of policy questions to which an indicator set can provide answers. In practice, this entails that the indicator set becomes forward looking and not limited by current data availability. A final novel element is the integration of indicator communication and evaluation directly into the framework.

40|$|The {{environmental}} policy of EU, acknowledged by the Economics Ministers in June 2001 meeting, establishes {{a set of}} priorities. The present paper deals with urgent demands in these fields, with attention on pollution decreasing/removal. A survey of <b>European</b> <b>Topic</b> <b>Centre</b> on Waste, based on partial data only, points out the risk of sewage and leachate contamination of subsoil and waterbed for 13500 landfills. The European Council, in the Directive 97 /C _ 76 / 01, requests the member states to take the necessary measures to ensure, to fullest practicable extent, that old-landfills and polluting-sites should be rehabilitated. This request is specifically addressed, with the Microdrainage project, EVK 4 -CT- 2002 - 30012, successfully achieved building the robotic prototype, properly operative from mid 2005. The paper presents the innovative developments undertaken by the project. A new drilling equipment is built, suited for autonomous operation, with fully automatic effectors and rods feeding and with multi-function boring/drilling head, to comply with complex work-task schedules. The mechanical architecture needs proper sophistication, to deal with rods supplying along the micro-tunnel, local buffering to complete the lay-down of a draining line, and mast feeding by the purposely designed arm. The system implementation, thereafter, tackles with the severe technical specifications for the micro-tunnel surroundings, and exacting performance requirements in rig levelling, mast attitude accuracy and work-task sequencing.

The main cropping areas of oilseed rape are located in northeast Germany {{as well as in the}} Alsace in France. In these regions, oilseed rape is cultivated on up to 25 % of the arable land. Due to the increased cultivation of energy plants, it can be assumed that the cultivation of maize (biogas) and oilseed rape (biodiesel) will be intensified in the future. For Germany, it can be stated that in 2007, there was an increase in maize cultivation of 9.6 % and of 8.8 % for oilseed rape cultivation compared to those in 2006.|$|E
