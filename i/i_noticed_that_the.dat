500|$|Just as the {{aircraft}} hit takeoff speed, the No.1 Engine and its pylon assembly {{separated from the}} left wing, ripping away a [...] section of the leading edge with it. The combined unit flipped {{over the top of}} the wing and landed on the runway. Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated: [...] "As {{the aircraft}} got closer, I noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> No. 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit and just about the time the aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation, the engine came off, went up {{over the top of the}} wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And at that point, I thought he was going to come back to the airport." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{a recent}} trip to Sydney, Australia, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city has placed hotel-style {{ashtrays}} filled with sand on sidewalks throughout the central business district and the historic area called [...] "the Rocks." [...] Smokers obviously use them; I almost never saw cigarette butts crushed out on the streets or sidewalks in this delightfully clean and friendly city.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1952, I {{was flying}} down south {{with my wife}} Hope, and we left a bit later than usual {{and by the time}} we got over the Hamersley Ranges, the clouds had formed and the ceiling got lower and lower. I got into the Turner River, knowing full well if I {{followed}} it through, I would come out into the Ashburton. [...] On going through a gorge in the Turner River, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> walls looked to me to be solid iron and was particularly alerted by the rusty looking colour of it, it showed to me to be oxidised iron.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{greatest}} changes observable {{were with}} the women, not the men. I saw men whom thirty years had changed but slightly; but their wives had grown old. These were good women; it is very wearing to be good.|$|E

30|$|Yang et al. (2007) and Bang and Jhun (2014) {{proposed}} the weighted {{support vector machine}} and the weighted KM-SVM to improve accuracy {{in the context of}} the outlier sensitivity problem (i.e., WSVM-outlier). The primary idea is to assign weights to each data sample, which manipulates relative importance. It is proved <b>that</b> WSVM-outlier reduces <b>the</b> effect of outliers, and yields higher classification rates. Yet <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> WSVM-outlier solely adopts outlier-sensitive algorithms (e.g., a robust fuzzy clustering, kernel-based possibilistic c-means), that are only well-suited to adjusting outlier effects, but not always guarantees to perform best in general cases. It is, therefore, interesting to add other weight schemes applicable to general scenarios.|$|R

60|$|Three {{weeks later}} <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boy {{was in the}} habit of cooking Naboth's mid-day meal for him, and Naboth was {{beginning}} to grow a stomach. He had hacked away more of my shrubbery and owned another and a fatter account-book.|$|E
