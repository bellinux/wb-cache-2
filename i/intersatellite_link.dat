All the algorithms considered {{are based on the}} open-shop model. The open-shop model is suitably represented or modified to exploit some existing algorithms to solve the satellite communication problem. In the first two algorithms, namely pre-emptive scheduling with no <b>intersatellite</b> <b>links</b> and greedy heuristics with two <b>intersatellite</b> <b>links,</b> a (traffic) matrix representation of the open-shop model is used to get a near optimal schedule. In the next two algorithms, generalized heuristic algorithm and the branch and bound algorithm, the open-shop model is modified to accommodate the inter-satellite link and this modified open-shop model is used to solve for a near optimal schedule. The basic methodology of all the algorithms are briefly described and their performance was evaluated through extensive simulations. The performance criteria to evaluate the algorithms are - run time of the algorithms, schedule lengths, and optimality of the algorithm against theoretical bounds. Three of the above-mentioned algorithms are evaluated by comparing the performance criteria under similar conditions. Optimal branch and bound algorithm is not evaluated due to its high complexity. The general heuristic algorithm is found to give a good trade off between computation time and optimality.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} {{of various kinds}} of aerospace application systems requires the appropriate high-accuracy time and frequency standard. This problem can be effectively solved by establishing suitable time and frequency standard in aerospace. Based on the establishment of aerospace satellite visual model, the simulation of satellite visual time on 3 -layer satellite networks, including GEO satellite(Geostationary Earth Orbit), IGSO (Inclined GeoSynchronous Orbit) satellites and MEO(Medium Earth Orbit) satellites, has been conducted. The visual features of this satellite network have been gained. Combining with the major influencing factors of satellite clock correction error, an aerospace time synchronization architecture {{on the basis of}} layering has been proposed. Furthermore, <b>intersatellite</b> <b>links</b> performance analysis is the basis for establishing aerospace layering time synchronization architecture. The 3 -layer satellite networks is used as an example to simulate the variation range of distance interlayer satellites of the 3 -layer satellite networks and to analyze the performance of GEO-IGSO, GEO-MEO, and IGSO-MEO links in S-band and Ka-band under the preset <b>intersatellite</b> transmission system, <b>link</b> parameters, transmission loss and without regard to the error of the intersatellite pointing accuracy. The results show that at the maximum intersatellite distance, if the S-band transmission rate is in excess of 2 Mbps,when the antenna is 1 m in diameter, the transmitting power needed is about 50 W. In the Ka-band, 1 m antennas only need 1 W transmitting power to provide an intersatellite data transmission rate higher than 2 Mbps.
