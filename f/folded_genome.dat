Here, we discuss functional genomics studies that uncover and characterize these sequences across the mammalian genome. The picture emerging is of a genome being a complex regulatory landscape. We explore the principles that underlie the wiring of regulatory DNA sequences and genes. We argue transcriptional control over distance can be understood when considering action {{in the context of}} the <b>folded</b> <b>genome.</b> Genome topology is expected to differ between individual cells, and this may cause variegated expression.

40|$|The genetic {{information}} is encoded on double-stranded DNA, a long linear polymer chain. Among the central themes of Nucleus {{will be the}} advancement of {{our understanding of how}} those chains are folded so that they fit into the cell nucleus, {{and at the same time}} their information can be read off efficiently. In fact, a quantitative description of the structure of the <b>folded</b> <b>genome</b> is one of the most challenging problems in structural biology, and poses a much more formidable problem than—for instance—the folding of a protein. There are three main reasons for this: first, the genomic DNA is by orders of magnitude the largest biomolecule in the cell; second, it cannot be defined by a single spatial structure because of its flexibility; and third, even if the ‘fold’ of the genome were more or less defined in any one cell, variations among individual cells may be very large, for the same reasons of flexibility...|$|E

40|$|We review fold usage on {{completed}} genomes {{to explore}} protein structure evolution. The patterns of {{presence or absence}} of <b>folds</b> on <b>genomes</b> gives us insights into the relationships between folds, the age of different folds and how we have arrived at the set of folds we see today. We examine the relationships between different measures which describe protein fold usage, such as the number of copies of a <b>fold</b> per <b>genome,</b> the number of families per fold, and the number of <b>genomes</b> a <b>fold</b> occurs on. We obtained these measures of fold usage by searching for the structural domains on 157 completed genome sequences from all three kingdoms of life. In our comparisons of these measures we found that bacteria have relatively more distinct <b>folds</b> on their <b>genomes</b> than archaea. Eukaryotes were found to have many more copies of a <b>fold</b> on their <b>genomes.</b> If we separate out the different fold classes, the alpha/beta class has relatively fewer distinct <b>folds</b> on large <b>genomes,</b> more copies of a fold on bacteria and more folds occurring in all three kingdoms simultaneously. These results possibly indicate that most alpha/beta folds originated earlier than other folds. The expected power law distribution is observed for copies of a <b>fold</b> per <b>genome</b> and we found a similar distribution for the number of families per fold. However, a more complicated distribution appears for <b>fold</b> occurrence across <b>genomes,</b> which strongly depends on fold class and kingdom. We also show {{that there is not a}} clear relationship between the three measures of fold usage. A fold which occurs on many genomes does not necessarily have many copies on each <b>genome.</b> Similarly, <b>folds</b> with many copies do not necessarily have many families or vice versa...|$|R

40|$|Insulators {{were first}} {{identified}} as genomic elements either blocking communication between promoters and enhancers (enhancerblocking activity) or restricting heterochromatin spreading (barrier activity). There are {{several types of}} insulators in Drosophila which utilize different proteins. All insulators identified in vertebrates work {{with the help of}} the multifunctional transcription factor CTCF. Biological functions of vertebrate insulators are not clear yet. They are supposed to separate chromatin domains albeit there is almost none direct evidence of this fact. The most significant is the participation of insulators in maintenance of centers of imprinting (imprinting choice regions). The results of a number of recently published articles indicate that isolation of a gene by placement of this gene into a separate topological domain (loop) is crucial to establishing imprinting. In this particular case as well as in many other cases insulators serve as architectural elements supporting the three-dimensional structure of genome.

50|$|Debates {{regarding}} the potential functions {{of these elements}} have been long standing. Controversial references to ‘junk’ or ‘selfish’ DNA were put forward early on, implying that repetitive DNA segments are remainders from past evolution or autonomous self-replicating sequences hacking the cell machinery to proliferate.Originally discovered by Barbara McClintock, dispersed repeats have been increasingly recognized as a potential source of genetic variation and regulation. Together with these regulatory roles, a structural role of repeated DNA in shaping the 3D <b>folding</b> of <b>genomes</b> has also been proposed. This hypothesis is only supported by a limited set of experimental evidence. For instance in human, mouse and fly, several classes of repetitive elements present a high tendency for co-localization within the nuclear space, suggesting that DNA repeats positions {{can be used by}} the cell as a <b>genome</b> <b>folding</b> map.|$|R

P. triticina <b>genome</b> with two <b>fold</b> <b>genome</b> size {{as compared to}} P. graminis tritici has lower relative abundance and SSR density.

40|$|Genetic and {{epigenetic}} inheritance through mitosis {{is critical}} for dividing cells to maintain their state. This process occurs {{in the context of}} large-scale re-organization of chromosome conformation during prophase leading to the formation of mitotic chromosomes, and during the reformation of the interphase nucleus during telophase and early G 1. This review highlights how recent studies over the last 5 years employing chromosome conformation capture combined with classical models of chromosome organization based on decades of microscopic observations, are providing new insights into the three-dimensional organization of chromatin inside the interphase nucleus and within mitotic chromosomes. One striking observation is that interphase genome organization displays cell type-specific features that are related to cell type-specific gene expression, whereas mitotic chromosome folding appears universal and tissue invariant. This {{raises the question of whether}} or not there is a need for an epigenetic memory for <b>genome</b> <b>folding.</b> Herein, the two different folding states of mammalian genomes are reviewed and then models are discussed wherein instructions for cell type-specific <b>genome</b> <b>folding</b> are locally encoded in the linear genome and transmitted through mitosis, e. g., as open chromatin sites with or without continuous binding of transcription factors. In the next cell cycle these instructions are used to re-assemble protein complexes on regulatory elements which then drive three-dimensional <b>folding</b> of the <b>genome</b> from the bottom up through local action and self-assembly into higher order levels of cell type-specific organization.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the three-dimensional (3 D) {{architecture of the}} Caulobacter crescentus genome by combining genome-wide chromatin interaction detection, live-cell imaging, and computational modeling. Using chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5 C), we derive 13 kb resolution 3 D models of the Caulobacter genome. The resulting models illustrate that the genome is ellipsoidal with periodically arranged arms. The parS sites, a pair of short contiguous sequence elements known {{to be involved in}} chromosome segregation, are positioned at one pole, where they anchor the chromosome to the cell and contribute to the formation of a compact chromatin conformation. Repositioning these elements resulted in rotations of the chromosome that changed the subcellular positions of most genes. Such rotations did not lead to large-scale changes in gene expression, indicating that <b>genome</b> <b>folding</b> does not strongly affect gene regulation. Collectively, our data suggest that <b>genome</b> <b>folding</b> is globally dictated by the parS sites and chromosome segregation...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial genomes are {{functionally}} organized. This {{organization is}} dynamic and globally changing throughout the cell cycle. Upon initiation of replication of the chromosome, the two origins segregate and move towards their new location taking along the newly replicated genome. Caulobacter crescentus employs a dedicated active partitioning (Par) system to move one {{copy of the}} parS centromere to the distal pole, while the other stays at the stalked pole. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Hong and McAdams describe studies on the speed of segregation of parS and regions up to 150 kb away. They show clear differences in segregation rates between parS and 50 kb flanking regions versus regions further away. To assess segregation rates the authors track fluorescent markers during movement using time-lapse microscopy.

A mutant of phage T 4 has been isolated which fails to induce this early unfolding of the host nucleoids. This mutant has been termed "unfoldase deficient" (unf-) {{despite the fact that the}} function of the gene product defective in this strain is not yet known. Mapping experiments indicate that the unf- mutation is located near gene 63 between genes 31 and 63. The <b>folded</b> <b>genomes</b> of E. coli S/ 6 / 5 cells remain essentially intact (2, 000 - 3, 000 S) at 5 min after infection with unfoldase-, nuclear disruption-, and host DNA degradation-deficient T 4 phage.

The presence of the unfoldase mutation causes a slight delay in host DNA degradation in the presence of nuclear disruption but has no effect on the rate of host DNA degradation in the absence of nuclear disruption. Its presence in nuclear disruption- and host DNA degradation-deficient multiple mutants does not alter the shutoff to host DNA or protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{recent years}} it has become evident that {{functional}} RNAs in living organisms are not just curious remnants from a primoridal RNA world but an ubiquitous phenomenon complementing protein enzyme based activity. Functional RNAs, just like proteins, depend in many cases upon their well-defined and evolutionarily conserved three-dimensional structure. In contrast to protein folds, however, RNA molecules have a biophysically important coarse-grained representation: their secondary structure. At this level of resolution at least, RNA structures can be efficiently predicted given only the sequence information. As a consequence, computational studies of RNA routinely incorporate structural information explicitly.

40|$|We review fold usage on {{completed}} genomes {{in order}} to explore protein structure evolution and assess the evolutionary relevance of current structural classification systems (SCOP and CATH). We assign folds {{on a set of}} 150 completed <b>genomes</b> using <b>fold</b> recognition methods (PSI-BLAST, SUPERFAMILY and Gene 3 D). The patterns of presence or absence of <b>folds</b> on <b>genomes</b> gives us insights into the relationships between folds and how we have arrived at the set of folds we see today. In particular, we develop a technique to estimate the relative ages of a protein fold based on genomic occurrence patterns in a phylogeny. We find that SCOP's `alpha/beta' class has relatively fewer distinct <b>folds</b> on large <b>genomes,</b> and that <b>folds</b> of this class tend to be older; folds of SCOP's `small protein' class follow opposite trends. Usage patterns show that folds with many copies on a genome are generally old, but that old folds do not necessarily have many copies. In addition, longer domains tend to be older and hydrophobic amino acids have high propensities for older folds whereas, polar - but non-charged - amino acids are associated with younger folds. Generally domains with stabilising features tend to be older. We also show that the reliability of fold recognition methods may be assessed using occurrence patterns. We develop a method, that detects false positives by identifying isolated occurrences in a phylogeny of species, and is able to improve <b>genome</b> wide <b>fold</b> recognition assignment sets. We use a structural fragment library to investigate evolutionary links between protein folds. We show that 'older' folds have relatively more such links than 'younger' folds.

We consider that protein sequences and folds constitute an information theoretic channel and computed the most efficient distribution of sequences that code all protein folds. The identified distributions of sequences and folds are found to follow a power law, consistent with those observed for proteins in nature. Importantly, the skewed distributions of sequences and folds are suggested to have different origins: the skewed distribution of sequences is due to evolutionary pressure to achieve efficient coding of necessary folds, whereas that of folds is based on the thermodynamic stability of folds.

We have developed powerful molecular approaches, based on our Chromosome Conformation Capture technology, to determine the <b>folding</b> of <b>genomes</b> at unprecedented resolution (Kb) and scale (genome-wide). We have applied these methods to determine the spatial folding of 1 % {{of the human genome}} (the ENCODE pilot regions) across a panel of cell lines.

These results start to place genes and regulatory elements, that are often separated by large genomic distances, in three-dimensional context to reveal their functional relationships. Our analysis of chromosome folding also revealed that chromosomes are compartmentalized in a series of “Topological Association Domains” (TADs) that are hundreds of Kb in size. Loci located within a TAD mingle freely, but interact far less frequently with loci located outside their TAD. TADs appear involved in gene expression, as we found that genes located within the same TAD tend to be co-expressed, but the mechanism(s) by which these domains affect gene regulation is still unknown.

As these proteins exhibit different binding behaviour depending on their DNA binding stoichiometry, altered levels of expression in the cell can be exploited to drive changes in local <b>genome</b> <b>folding,</b> which may operate to modulate transcription...|$|R
