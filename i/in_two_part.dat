In an earlier development in 1954 called [...] "locks for jet thrust reversers", the design for thrust reversal also contain a flap device to help decelerate and the main purpose of the thrust reverser was to block airflow rather than provide reverse thrust. Dated back to 1945, the first invented thrust reversal device intended to [...] "provide a deflecting device", which can be identified as the first concept for target-type thrust reverser.|$|E
