40|$|The author {{constructs}} {{a formal}} analytic framework {{to simulate the}} impact of various economic shocks on the household debt-service ratio, {{using data from the}} Canadian <b>Financial</b> <b>Monitor</b> (CFM) survey. The impact of these shocks on individual households depends on the socio-economic characteristics of the latter. The framework also allows consideration of both symmetric and asymmetric shocks to incomes. The author's work is original in several respects: it captures the heterogeneity of the impact of these shocks on households, it uses cross-sectional data to estimate credit-growth equations, and it determines household credit growth based on income, interest rates, and housing prices. To illustrate the usefulness of his approach, the author provides income, debt, and interest rate scenarios, and then simulates his model over twelve periods. This methodology can, of course, be used with other microdata. Econometric and statistical methods; Financial stability...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{consolidated}} Canadian micro data on household balance sheets and expenditures {{has been an}} important impediment to empirical research into real-financial linkages in the Canadian household sector. Our paper attempts to fill this data gap by merging household balance sheet data from the Canadian <b>Financial</b> <b>Monitor</b> survey with household expenditure data from the Survey of Household Spending. The merge process uses a categorical matching framework aimed at preserving the heterogeneity in the underlying datasets. The resulting combined dataset is a novel source of Canadian micro data on household finances and spending patterns. The dataset covers the period 1999 till 2005 and contains roughly 11, 000 observations (households) for each year. We plan to use these combined data to test key real-financial linkages (like those between house prices, debt and household expenditures) for the Canadian household sector.
