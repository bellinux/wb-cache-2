50|$|The {{sense of}} taste is {{considered}} to be the most intimate one because we can't taste anything from a distance. It is also believed to be the most distinctly emotional sense. <b>Our</b> <b>taste</b> is also dependent on our saliva and differs on each different person. People who prefer saltier foods are used to a higher concentration of sodium and therefore have a saltier saliva. In fact, 78% <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>taste</b> preferences are dependent on one's genes. Taste also has a social aspect attached to it, we rarely seek to enjoy food by ourselves since eating usually facilitates social interaction between people. Business meetings and home dinners are almost all of the time in company of others and companies need to take this into consideration.|$|R

5000|$|Bessa {{discovered}} the five types of taste buds {{in the oral}} cavity. She found 100 to 600 epithelial cells arranged {{in the shape of}} an onion peel; [...] "sour", [...] "spicy", [...] "strong", [...] "pleasant" [...] and [...] "unpleasant". She showed that {{the presence or absence of}} receptors do not alter the experience of the taster. Perceived taste is driven by retro nasal olfaction. The aromas released in the mouth by chewing diffuse to the nasal cavity and stimulate nerve cells in the nose. Smell through direct and retro-nasal diffusion is responsible for 68% <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>taste</b> sensation.|$|R
60|$|It {{is a fact}} {{familiar}} to all travellers, that savages frequently capture young animals of various kinds, and rear them as favourites, and sell or present them as curiosities. Human nature is generally akin: savages may be brutal, {{but they are not}} on that account devoid <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>taste</b> for taming and caressing young animals; nay, it is not improbable that some races may possess it in a more marked degree than ourselves, because it is a childish taste with us; and the motives of an adult barbarian are very similar to those of a civilised child.|$|R
30|$|In addition, in this paper, we only {{considered}} robust estimators for the {{one dimensional}} diffusion process; in fact, the basic <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> methodology hold for the case of multidimensional diffusion processes and situations.|$|R

Adam Jackson has stated it was named Portraits for two reasons: [...] "Firstly, the title track {{is based on the}} story of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, a cautionary tale of the beauty and frailty of life. Secondly, Portraits depicts a person or character frozen in time as they were at a given moment. This is how we see this album - it's a reflection <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>tastes,</b> loves, hates, losses and gains. It's a memory in musical form, the first glimpse of the picture that is Bury Tomorrow.” ...|$|R
