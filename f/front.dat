On 22 July, army commander Major general Nikolai Trufanov was relieved of command. As part of the Stalingrad <b>Front</b> (from 1–5 August), then briefly with the Southeast <b>Front</b> (from 6 August until 27 September), and then back with the Stalingrad <b>Front</b> it {{took part in the}} Battle of Stalingrad. On 31 July when it came under Stalingrad <b>Front</b> control it was so worn down by its previous rough handling that it was only 3,000 men strong. It was attacked on the same day by the 4th Panzer Army, which was able to break through. During Operation Uranus, the counterattack from Stalingrad, the 4th Mechanized Corps began its attack from the 51st Army's sector. In early December, 51st Army was deployed to cover the Kotelnikovo approaches against German relief attempts by the LVII. Panzerkorps. On 24–25 December 1942, the commander of 51st Army, Major-General N.I. Trufanov, organized a local offensive operation on the right flank with the forces of three rifle divisions, and moved to the north bank of the Aksav River, {{on the eve of the}} Kotelnikovo offensive operation, which eventually defeated the German efforts made as part of Operation Winter Storm to relieve the Sixth Army in Stalingrad. On 30 January 1943, the Luftwaffe's Kampfgeschwader 51 destroyed the 51st Army's Headquarters, near Salsk. Dropping 100– 250kg bombs, a wave of Junkers Ju 88s and Heinkel He 111s destroyed the communications center, working offices of the chief-of-staff, the operational headquarters and the offices of the operational duty officer. Up to 20 buildings and personnel billets were also destroyed. Casualties among personnel were also very high.|$|E

5|$|An {{occluded}} <b>front</b> {{is formed}} {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold <b>front</b> overtakes a warm <b>front.</b> The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm <b>front</b> is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm <b>front,</b> and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm <b>front</b> is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm <b>front,</b> and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded <b>front,</b> with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E

Furthermore, we prove that there exists a solution oscillating permanently between two time periodic V-shaped traveling <b>fronts,</b> which implies that time periodic V-shaped traveling <b>fronts</b> are not always asymptotically stable under general bounded perturbations.

30|$|Following Halliday’s (2004) {{classification}} of marked Themes in English, marked Themes in Arabic {{can be classified}} into three main types starting from the least towards the most marked: <b>fronted</b> Theme, predicated Theme and identifying Theme.
