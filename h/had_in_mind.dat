5|$|This episode, {{inspired}} by the 1982 horror film The Entity, was written due to insistence that the creators write more episodes where Mulder and Scully help people. This allowed the writers some space to create other episodes they <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper studies a {{decision}} maker who for each choice set selects {{a subset of}} (at most) two alternatives. We axiomatize three types of procedures: (i) The top two: the decision maker <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> an ordering and chooses the two maximal alternatives. (ii) The two extremes: the decision maker <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> an ordering and chooses the maximal and the minimal alternatives. (iii) The top and the top: the decision maker <b>has</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> two orderings and he chooses the maximal element from each...|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Hajime Tabata, with Tetsuya Nomura serving as character designer. Before development, the Square Enix staff initially planned to make a PlayStation Portable port of the mobile phone game , but after discussion, they decided {{to create a new}} game. The plot is based on a scenario Kazushige Nojima <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> when working on Final Fantasy VII. Crisis Core enjoyed strong sales, selling over three million units worldwide. Critical reception was generally positive.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode was}} created on Fox's {{insistence that the}} creators write more episodes where Mulder and Scully help people. This episode was written to {{accomplish}} that, and to allow the writers some space to create other episodes they <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Co-writer Glen Morgan claims the episode {{was inspired by the}} movie The Entity. The name Tom Braidwood, the show's assistant director who later played Lone Gunmen member Melvin Frohike, is used in the scene where the parking lot attendant paints over the name of Howard Graves. The episode featured guest appearances by Barry Primus, Lisa Waltz, Lorena Gale and Veena Sood.|$|E

5|$|After the {{departure}} of Bligh's launch, Christian turned Bounty eastward {{in search of a}} remote haven on which he and the mutineers could settle. He <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the island of Tubuai, 300miles south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to help establish the settlement. As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{qualified}} {{nature of}} this comment, the operation Beatty <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> was both important and potentially dangerous. On 6 February 1918, Battleship Division Nine stood out of Scapa Flow to guard the high value Scandinavian Convoy to and from Norway. Twice in the previous year, this convoy—with its essential cargos of iron ore, nitrates, and other chemicals—had been raided by German cruisers and destroyers, {{with the loss of}} 15 allied freighters. To avoid a repeat of these attacks, the British had taken to escorting the convoys with dreadnought squadrons. Still, the possibility existed that the Germans would send out their entire fleet to cut off and annihilate the overmatched battleship squadron, with severe strategic effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Beecham was {{approached}} by the rising young conductor Malcolm Sargent with a proposal {{to set up a}} permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent's patrons, the Courtauld family. Originally Sargent and Beecham <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> a reorganised version of the LSO, but the orchestra baulked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch. The London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), as it was named, consisted of 106 players including a few young musicians straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO's leading members.|$|E

5|$|Kỳ {{specifically}} said {{nine or ten}} {{other officers}} should be dismissed for involvement in the coup, but refused to identify who he <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Some observers accused Kỳ and Thi of deliberately orchestrating or allowing the plot to develop before putting it down in order to embarrass Khánh and allow themselves to gain prominence and prestige on the political stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based in the northern town of Da Nang, claimed that during a meeting with Kỳ and Thi {{a few days before}} the coup, the officers had discussed their plans for overthrowing Khánh. Another conspiracy claim was propagated by General Trần Văn Đôn, who conjectured that Khánh had tried to provoke or bait rival generals, such as Khiêm, into revolting against him so he could defeat and remove them from the scene, thereby strengthening himself and boosting his political image.|$|E
5|$|Leith {{remarked that}} {{recording}} {{the album was}} an exciting but nerve-racking experience. He recorded his music at Sony BMG's recording studio in East Sydney. His producers already <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally acoustic. Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol, {{he knew that it}} was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it was very different from the records produced by the previous Idol contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat pop songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.|$|E
5|$|Matthews was {{appointed}} general manager at Stoke's rivals Port Vale in July 1965, alongside good friend Jackie Mudie; Matthews was unpaid, though was given expenses. The pair {{had a plan}} of bringing through talented schoolboys and selling one or two off every so often to improve the club's bleak financial picture, whilst {{at the same time}} advancing through the leagues; in his autobiography he said that what Dario Gradi later achieved at Crewe Alexandra is what he <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> for the Vale. Matthews concentrated his search in North East England and Central Scotland, where he discovered talented striker Mick Cullerton, though overlooked a teenage Ray Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|Once interested, Soichiro Honda began {{developing}} the Super Cub {{on his return}} to Japan. The following year Honda displayed a mockup to Fujisawa that finally matched what he <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> Fujisawa declaring the annual sales would be 30,000 per month, half again as many as the entire monthly two-wheeler market in Japan. His goal was to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan, when most companies' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies. Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service and spare parts distribution in a large country like the United States. To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959. In 1961 a sales network was established in Germany, then in Belgium and the UK in 1962, and then France in 1964.|$|E
5|$|To {{transport}} the raiders to the island, two tugs, Vulcan and Nuneaton, {{were provided by}} the Governor of Nigeria, Sir Bernard Bourdillon. The raiding force would consist of 32 men, four SOE agents, 11 commandos from the SSRF and 17 men recruited from the local population to crew the two tugs. The mission suffered a blow when the British General Officer Commanding (GOC) West Africa Command, General Sir George Giffard refused to support the mission and would not release the 17 men required, stating it would compromise some unnamed plans he <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> and the act of piracy would have repercussions. Responding {{to the concerns of}} the GOC West Africa, the Admiralty suspended the operation. The Foreign Office was also not in favour of the operation, and neither was the British Embassy in Madrid, which was concerned about the possible reactions of the Spanish government. The final go ahead, eventually supported by the Foreign Office, was not given until 6 January 1942, on the grounds that suspicion of British involvement in the raid was inevitable; what counted was the avoidance of any tangible proof. As a safeguard the Admiralty also dispatched , a , to intercept the vessels at sea, which would provide the cover story that they had been intercepted while trying to make their way home to Europe.|$|E
5|$|To {{understand}} why the Chinese made such reports, Waley explained that any military action, whether successful or not, {{was followed by a}} scramble to get mentioned in the official report to the throne as an incentive for receiving a decoration, promotion, or other reward. The number of alleged casualties inflicted on the enemy was often based on what officers thought would entitle them to the reward they <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Although Lin forwarded Lai's concocted reports to the Daoguang Emperor, Waley noted that it is unclear to what extent, if any, that Lin was aware of the fabrications, especially since he was regarded as a man of unusually high integrity by the British and Chinese. This was {{the first in a series}} of reports in which the emperor became aware in 1841 that the Canton authorities had been systematically deceiving him about events during the war. The emperor ordered the Governor of Guangxi, Liang Chang-chü, to send him clear accounts of the events at Canton, noting that since Guangxi was a neighbouring province, Liang must be receiving independent accounts. He warned Liang that he would be able to verify his information by secret inquiries from other places.|$|E

5|$|When the United States {{took over}} the Philippine Islands from the Spanish in 1898 after the Spanish–American War, President William McKinley began Americanizing the former Spanish colony. In 1900 he {{appointed}} William Howard Taft to head the Philippine Commission to evaluate {{the needs of the}} new territory. Taft, who later became the Philippines' first civilian Governor-General, decided that Manila, the capital, should be a planned town. He hired as his architect and city planner Daniel Hudson Burnham, who had built Union Station and the Postal Square Building in Washington. In Manila, Burnham <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> a long wide, tree-lined boulevard along the bay, beginning at a park area dominated by a magnificent hotel. To execute Burnham's plans, Taft hired William E. Parsons, a New York City architect, who envisioned an impressive, comfortable hotel along the lines of a California mission but grander. The original design was an H-shaped plan that focused on well-ventilated rooms on two wings, providing grand vistas of the harbor, the Luneta, and Intramuros. The top floor was, in fact, a large viewing deck that was used for various functions, including watching the American navy steam into the harbor.|$|E
