Jackman noted how Wolverine driving the plot {{in spite of}} his gruff personality made for interesting story choices, as [...] "if you want someone to go back to take someone’s head off, fantastic, but he’s really <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and almost act in parts as inspiration, as mentor, as guide, because he can’t do it all on his own, which is always his preferred method".|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us because we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E
2500|$|During her Janet World Tour, Jackson {{experienced}} an emotional breakdown, stemming from self-hatred, childhood humiliation, self-harm, and distorted body image. She stated, [...] "I was very, very sad. Very down. I couldn't get up sometimes. There {{were times when}} I felt very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls were kind of closing in on me...like you can't escape". She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by {{the demands of the}} entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to that world'". Jackson expressed concern for how she could portray an object of fantasy, feeling as if she could no longer fulfill her own desires.|$|E

6000|$|Fountain, {{going on}} thoughtfully: [...] "It's the cap-sheaf {{of the social}} barbarism we live in, the hideous hypocrisy. It's no use {{to put it on}} religion. The Jews keep Christmas, too, and we know what they think of Christianity as a belief. No, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> further <b>back,</b> <b>to</b> the Pagan Saturnalia-- Well, I renounce the whole affair, here and now.

50|$|The {{programme}} endeavours {{to track}} school {{life on a}} typical day. The show's approach to establish how schools are run and how children are taught focuses on finding out what children think of school and what teachers think of them. Filming was carried out at Ayasofia School, Swiss Cottage School, Tawhid Boys School, The Village School, Berrymede Junior School and Almuntada School where the presenter <b>got</b> a chance <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> school and discover new technology and ways of teaching as well as getting involved with the children's activities.|$|R

60|$|Jordan {{went out}} with her, and, though {{he had a good}} deal to do, was not sorry when he failed to find Forster and it became {{necessary}} for him to drive her back to the ranch. Eleanor, however, said very little to him during the journey, and he had sense enough to confine his attention to his team. He had also little time to think of anything that did not concern his business {{when he returned to the}} city, for the Shasta had <b>to</b> be <b>got</b> ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> sea, and the Adelaide arrived early on the following day. The skipper <b>went</b> with him <b>to</b> interview Merril's trustee, and the latter announced that no steps would be taken to contest the salvage claim when he heard what he had to say. However, he added dryly that it would probably be advisable for the Shasta Company to consider the compromise proposition he would shortly make. Jordan, who fancied he was right in this, went away without having found it necessary to hand him the engineer's confession, and was glad he had not offered to produce it when he ransacked his office for it a few days later.|$|R
5000|$|Book Burner {{was also}} written as a {{reaction}} to Phantom Limb, which Scott Hull described as [...] "really written as kind of an experiment to explore longer songs and song structures, things that were catchier and thrashier and that had repeats and structures that were pretty standard." [...] Hull revealed that this approach was driven, in part, by Harvey's changing musical interests: [...] "towards the end, {{it was very difficult to}} do anything like that fast songs, it was easier to do the mid-pace stuff. But with Adam, we <b>got</b> really inspired <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> those roots where we just wanted to blast and play really super fast the whole time, so there's a lot of that on Book Burner. It wasn't like we felt like we needed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Prowler in the Yard or Terrifyer intentionally, we just felt like, 'Hey, we can do this again now!'" ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I {{think for}} now we’re still content. It is … a ball-and-strike call. We’ve <b>got</b> the ability <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{and look at}} video, which we do, {{and in this case}} made the call and moved on from it. It’s still one that we want to leave in the drivers’ hands. If we have to get {{involved}} and make those calls with more video, I think we’ll do that, but we’d still like to see it play out the way it does through the final 10. It’s one of those areas that any advantage that a team can try to get on a restart, they’re {{going to try to do}} that and put a call in our hands, but that’s our job to make the call during the race.” Steve O'Donnell, NASCAR executive vice-president and chief racing development officer, speaking on The Morning Drive on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio.|$|R
6000|$|... "She may be {{miles from}} here by this time," [...] said Dick, with almost a groan. [...] "There is no help for it, Tom, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and break the news as best we can." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The top of {{the morning}} to you thin, Father Marty," [...] said Fred, trying to assume an Irish brogue. Nothing could be more {{friendly}} than the greeting. The old priest {{took off his hat}} to Kate, and made a low bow, as though he should say,--to the future Countess of Scroope I owe a very especial respect. Mrs. O'Hara held her future son-in-law's hand for a moment, as though she might preserve him for her daughter by some show of affection on her own part. [...] "And now, Misthress O'Hara," [...] said the priest, [...] "as I've <b>got</b> a companion <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> wid me, I'm thinking I'll not go up the hill any further." [...] Then they parted, and Kate looked as though she were being robbed of her due because her lover could not give her one farewell kiss in the priest's presence.|$|R
5000|$|Martin said: [...] "I {{had already}} started my first solo album Back Where I Belong so when I <b>got</b> the call <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> I was {{committed}} by that point. And {{in fact it was}} {{just a couple of months}} after they had started the thing with Ronnie James Dio. I was determined to finish my solo thing and so turned them down at that point. We did keep in touch though and I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> some shows. Ronnie wasn’t too pleased, but eventually they had enough and asked me to rejoin again later so it felt like I hadn’t actually left. In fact, I was never formally fired, the phone just stopped ringing. Ian Gillan Purple singer, also another ex-Black Sabbath lead singer asked me once if I had actually been fired and I said, [...] "No." [...] He said, [...] "Neither have I." [...] We should just turn up one day and walk on stage!" ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, Marlens and Black {{departed}} from the show. Although they never gave a reason for their sudden departure, it may have been due to Black's pregnancy. She hinted at it in an interview in April 1988, saying [...] "We have secret plans to leave Los Angeles before our kids reach the age of cognizance." [...] One challenge for the cast and crew was filming around a child actor, meaning that the show had to obey child labor laws. Savage at the time explained, [...] "You have to get at least three hours of school in every day. So whenever I'm on a break, I <b>go</b> <b>to</b> school. It's really intense because I have to get a lot done in short periods. And it's hard because if they need you back on the set, they pull you away every twenty minutes. If you're writing an essay and suddenly get inspired, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> stop and <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{waited for}} you since five o'clock, and I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> now. Ciccio! Ciccio! I wanted so badly to see you. I shall never see thee again, brother, my brother!" [...] cried Gigi, and a sob shook him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> with me," [...] {{says the}} young man. [...] "I've come two {{thousand}} miles for you. Aren't you {{tired of it}} yet. Bess? You've kept all of us waiting so long. Haven't you found out yet what is best?" ...|$|E

6000|$|As {{he arrived}} at the long line of iron picket fence {{surrounding}} Grimsby Hill, he saw Mrs. Carter's motor enter the gate. It seemed to be a good omen. He hurried to the gate, peered in, then passed on. He couldn't go and swagger past that exclusive-looking gate-house and intrude on that sweep of rhododendron-lined private driveway. He walked shyly along the iron fence for {{a quarter of a mile}} before he <b>got</b> up courage <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> rush through the towering iron gateway and past the gate-house, into the sacred estate. He expected to hear a voice--it would be a cockney servant's voice--demanding, [...] "'Ere you, wot do you want?" [...] But no one stopped him; no one spoke to him; he was safe among the rhododendrons. He clumped along as though he had important business, secretly patting his tie into shape and smoothing his hair. Just let anybody try to stop him! He knew what he was about! But he really didn't know what he was about; he hadn't the slightest notion as to whether he would go up and invite their dear cribbage-companion Mrs. Carter to come and see them or tack up a [...] "T Room" [...] advertisement on the porch.|$|R
5000|$|The group {{released}} their 2nd mini album, Time to Rock Da Show, on 16 November 2011. The {{music video}} for its title track, [...] "Pop Pop Pop", written by Brave Brothers, was revealed four days later. Joy suddenly went on hiatus at this time, which DR Music claimed was because her parents' {{house had been}} affected in the flood which occurred in Thailand {{at the time of}} the release, and later left RaNia in June 2012. In a series of now-deleted tweets, she wrote [...] "To everyone, I’m sorry I let you guys down so many times, but I’ve been thinking about it for months.

5000|$|The {{record was}} {{originally}} {{to be done}} with drummer Cozy Powell, then Black Sabbath's current drummer, but he was immobilised by a broken pelvic bone he had sustained in a horse riding accident. Dio initially wanted to replace Powell with Simon Wright, from AC/DC and his own band, but Butler and Iommi rejected him. They subsequently recruited Vinny Appice, who had served as Black Sabbath's drummer during most of Dio's previous tenure with the band, from 1980-1982. During the recording session for the album, Tony Martin made a short comeback when invited by the band members to try the songs out but stayed just {{for a couple of days}} and the band then continued with Dio. Tony Martin stated: [...] "I had already started my first solo album Back Where I Belong so when I <b>got</b> the call <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> I was committed by that point.
