25|$|Women may sexually stimulate a man's anus by <b>fingering</b> <b>the</b> {{exterior}} or interior {{areas of}} the anus; they may also stimulate the perineum (which, for males, is between {{the base of the}} scrotum and the anus), massage the prostate or engage in anilingus. Sex toys, such as a dildo, may also be used. The practice of a woman penetrating a man's anus with a strap-on dildo for sexual activity is called pegging.|$|E
25|$|Anal sex or anal {{intercourse}} is generally the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into a person's anus, or anus and rectum, for sexual pleasure. Other forms of anal sex include <b>fingering,</b> <b>the</b> use of sex toys for anal penetration, oral sex {{performed on the}} anus (anilingus), and pegging. Although the term anal sex most commonly means penile-anal penetration, sources sometimes use the term {{anal intercourse}} to refer exclusively to penile-anal penetration, and anal sex to refer to any form of anal sexual activity, especially between pairings as opposed to anal masturbation.|$|E
25|$|The {{euphonium}} {{is part of}} {{the family}} of brass instruments. It is sometimes confused with the baritone horn. The euphonium and the baritone differ in that the bore size of the baritone horn is typically smaller than that of the euphonium, and the baritone is primarily cylindrical bore, whereas the euphonium is predominantly conical bore. The two instruments are easily interchangeable to the player, with some modification of breath and embouchure, since the two have identical range and essentially identical <b>fingering.</b> <b>The</b> cylindrical baritone offers a brighter sound and the conical euphonium offers a mellower sound.|$|E
5000|$|In this example, {{there are}} 5 [...] "bottom" [...] <b>fingers</b> (<b>the</b> left index, middle, ring, and little <b>fingers,</b> plus <b>the</b> right little <b>finger),</b> 1 left [...] "top" [...] <b>finger</b> (<b>the</b> left thumb), and 4 right [...] "top" [...] <b>fingers</b> (<b>the</b> right thumb, index finger, middle finger, and ring <b>finger).</b> So <b>the</b> {{computation}} goes as follows: 9 &times; 6 = (10 &times; 5) + (1 &times; 4) = 54.|$|R
50|$|The palmar {{interosseous}} muscles adduct <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> towards <b>the</b> middle <b>finger.</b> This is {{in contrast}} to the dorsal interossei, which abduct <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> away from <b>the</b> middle finger.In addition (like dorsal interossei) they flex <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> at <b>the</b> metacarpo-phalangeal joint and extend <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> at <b>the</b> interphalangeal joint and thus assist the lumbricals.|$|R
500|$|The {{arms were}} short and stout with very large hands. There were no skin folds on the wrists, though a {{scalloped}} fringe of skin was present from the elbows to {{just below the}} discs on <b>the</b> fourth <b>fingers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fingers</b> were all relatively short with large flattened discs on the tips. The discs on the second, third, and fourth <b>fingers</b> were about <b>the</b> same diameter as the tympana. Small protrusions known as tubercles were present {{on the underside of}} the hands. On <b>the</b> first <b>finger,</b> <b>the</b> tubercles on the tipmost joints were elliptical in shape. On the second and third <b>fingers,</b> <b>the</b> tubercles below <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> joints (subarticular tubercles) were smaller than that on <b>the</b> fourth <b>fingers.</b> Therewere no tubercles on the palms of the hands though elongated flat tubercles were present behind the bases of <b>the</b> inner <b>fingers</b> (<b>the</b> [...] "thumbs"). Numerous small and round tubercles were also present in between the joints of <b>the</b> <b>fingers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fingers</b> were more or less fully webbed.|$|R
25|$|Wind {{controllers}} (and wind synthesizers) are {{convenient for}} woodwind and brass players, being designed to imitate those instruments. These are usually either analog or MIDI controllers, and sometimes include their own built-in sound modules (synthesizers). In {{addition to the}} follow of key arrangements and <b>fingering,</b> <b>the</b> controllers have breath-operated pressure transducers, and may have gate extractors, velocity sensors, and bite sensors. Saxophone-style controllers have included the Lyricon, and products by Yamaha, Akai, and Casio. The mouthpieces range from alto clarinet to alto saxophone sizes. The Eigenharp, a controller similar in style to a bassoon, was released by Eigenlabs in 2009. Melodica and recorder-style controllers have included the Martinetta (1975) and Variophon (1980), and Joseph Zawinul's custom Korg Pepe. A harmonica-style interface was the Millionizer 2000 (c. 1983).|$|E
25|$|The lyra {{depicted}} on the Byzantine ivory casket of Museo Nazionale, Florence (900 – 1100 AD) has two strings and pear-shaped body with long and narrow neck. The soundboard is depicted without soundholes {{and as a}} distinct and attached piece, however this {{might be due to}} stylistic abstraction. The lyras of Novgorod (1190 AD) are closer morphologically to the present bowed lyras (see gallery): they were pear-shaped and 40cm long; they had semi-circular soundholes and provision for three strings. The middle string served as a drone while <b>fingering</b> <b>the</b> others by finger or fingernail alone, downwards or sidewards against the string, for there was no fingerboard to press them against: a method which gives the notes as clearly as the violin and remains normal in lyras both in Asia as well as on present bowed instruments in post-Byzantine regions such as the Cretan lyra.|$|E
25|$|The shorter-necked, tenor banjo, with 17 ("short scale") or 19 frets, is also {{typically}} {{played with}} a plectrum. It became a popular instrument after about 1910. Early models used for melodic picking typically had 17 frets on the neck and a scale length of 19½ to 21½inches. By the mid-1920s, when the instrument was used primarily for strummed chordal accompaniment, 19-fret necks with a scale length of 21¾ to 23inches became standard. The usual tuning is the all-fifths tuning C3 G3 D4 A4, {{in which there are}} exactly seven semitones (a perfect fifth) between the open notes of consecutive strings. Other players (particularly in Irish traditional music) tune the banjo G2 D3 A3 E4 like an octave mandolin, which lets the banjoist duplicate fiddle and mandolin <b>fingering.</b> <b>The</b> popularisation of this tuning was usually attributed to the late Barney McKenna, banjoist with The Dubliners. Fingerstyle on tenor banjo retuned to open G tuning dgd'g' or lower open D tuning Adad' (three finger picking, frailing) have been explored by Mirek Patek.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fingering</b> of <b>the</b> chanter {{is usually}} semi-closed for high pitched instruments, {{which means that}} <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of <b>the</b> lower hand (which is usually the right hand) are placed on their holes when {{removing}} <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of <b>the</b> upper hand. Chanters of 20 inches or greater are generally played with open fingering.|$|R
50|$|The {{modern style}} Morin Khuur is played with nearly natural finger positions. That means, the {{distance}} between two <b>fingers</b> usually make <b>the</b> distance of a half tone on the lower section of the instrument. On the tune F / B <b>the</b> index <b>finger</b> hits on <b>the</b> low (F) string the G, <b>the</b> middle <b>finger</b> hits <b>the</b> G, <b>the</b> ring <b>finger</b> hits <b>the</b> A, <b>the</b> little <b>finger</b> <b>the</b> B flat. Identical positions are on the high strings - C, C, D, D. <b>The</b> little <b>finger</b> tips <b>the</b> B strings under the F string, while all other <b>fingers</b> touch <b>the</b> strings from the top.|$|R

500|$|Beiderbecke plays piano on his {{recordings}} [...] "Big Boy" [...] (October 8, 1924), [...] "For No Reason at All in C" [...] (May 13, 1927), [...] "Wringin' and Twistin'" [...] (September 17, 1927)—all with ensembles—and {{his only}} solo recorded work, [...] "In a Mist" [...] (September 8, 1927). Critic Frank Murphy argues {{that many of}} the same characteristics that mark Beiderbecke on the cornet mark him on the keyboard: the uncharacteristic <b>fingering,</b> <b>the</b> emphasis on inventive harmonies, and the correlated choruses. Those inventive harmonies, on both cornet and piano, eventually helped point the way to bebop, which abandoned melody almost entirely.|$|E
500|$|For {{guitar and}} bass players, {{the players are}} given the {{opportunity}} to play single notes or chords, both as single notes or sustained, during which the players must continue to hold down the fret button(s) for the extent of the sustain. Some charts provide the ability to hold down one sustained note via its fret button while strumming additional notes. Warriors of Rock also provides simulated hammer-ons and pull-offs, where, after striking one note, specifically marked notes can be played by <b>fingering</b> <b>the</b> correct buttons but without strumming. There are also note portions of some songs where notes appear semi-transparent relative to normal notes; these notes, introduced in Guitar Hero World Tour, can be played simply by tapping the correct buttons on the controller without strumming or using a touch-sensitive [...] "slider bar" [...] below the fret buttons, if the player is using a World Tour controller. [...] Bass players can play open chords by strumming without holding any fret buttons. Warriors of Rock introduces sustained open chords for bass players, although unlike other sustainable notes, does not require you to hold down the button required to execute the note initially. Drum players, when using velocity-sensitive drum kits, may be presented with both ghosted notes or notes with a shield icon over them; these represents drum notes that should be struck softer or harder than normal, respectively, to score more points. Drum players can also attach a second bass drum pedal, necessary for certain songs in the [...] "Expert+" [...] difficulty.|$|E
500|$|Birmingham's Black Sabbath had {{developed}} a particularly heavy sound {{in part due to}} an industrial accident guitarist Tony Iommi suffered before cofounding the band. Unable to play normally, Iommi had to tune his guitar down for easier fretting and rely on power chords with their relatively simple <b>fingering.</b> <b>The</b> bleak, industrial, working class environment of Birmingham, a manufacturing city full of noisy factories and metalworking, has itself been credited with influencing Black Sabbath's heavy, chugging, metallic sound and the sound of heavy metal in general. Deep Purple had fluctuated between styles in its early years, but by 1969 vocalist Ian Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had led the band toward the developing heavy metal style. In 1970, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple scored major UK chart hits with [...] "Paranoid" [...] and [...] "Black Night", respectively. That same year, two other British bands released debut albums in a heavy metal mode: Uriah Heep with Very 'Eavy... Very 'Umble and UFO with UFO 1. Bloodrock released their self-titled debut album, containing a collection of heavy guitar riffs, gruff style vocals and sadistic and macabre lyrics. The influential Budgie brought the new metal sound into a power trio context, creating some of the heaviest music of the time. The occult lyrics and imagery employed by Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep would prove particularly influential; Led Zeppelin also began foregrounding such elements with its fourth album, released in 1971. In 1973, Deep Purple released the song Smoke on the Water, with the iconic riff that's usually considered as the most recognizable one in [...] "heavy rock" [...] history, as a single of the classic live album Made in Japan.|$|E
50|$|A second {{common cause}} of negligent {{discharges}} is when the gun-handler places their <b>finger</b> on <b>the</b> trigger before they have decided to shoot. With <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> so positioned, many activities may cause <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> to compress <b>the</b> trigger unintentionally. For example, if one attempts to holster <b>the</b> firearm with <b>finger</b> on trigger, <b>the</b> holster edge will drive <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> onto <b>the</b> trigger, and discharge is likely. If one stumbles or struggles (with an adversary) with <b>finger</b> on trigger, <b>the</b> grasping motion of both hands will likely cause <b>the</b> trigger <b>finger</b> to compress <b>the</b> trigger.|$|R

40|$|Viscous fingers {{have been}} {{produced}} in the lifting Hele-Shaw cell (LHSC), with concentric circular grooves etched onto the lower plate. The invading fluid (air) enters the defending newtonian fluid-olive oil, as fingers proceeding radially inwards towards <b>the</b> centre. <b>The</b> <b>fingers</b> are interrupted at the circular groove, and reform as secondary <b>fingers.</b> <b>The</b> effect of the grooves is to speed up <b>the</b> <b>fingering</b> process considerably and <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> now reach <b>the</b> centre much faster. We explain this by comparing the variation with time, in velocity of <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> in <b>the</b> normal LHSC and the grooved cells. In the normal lifting HS cell <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> move fastest on initial formation and slow down later. Since in case of the grooved plate, <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> reform and receive a boost in their speed each time they encounter a groove, <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> proceed to <b>the</b> centre faster.
