40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to characterise the {{resinous}} material formed during the acid catalysed hydrolysis of m-phenylenediamine (MPDA) to resorcinol, and to establish a reaction mechanism that could explain the formation of both resorcinol and the resinous materials in the reaction. A further objective was to determine reaction conditions that would lead to reduced formation of the resins during the hydrolysis reaction. The number of compounds present in a sample taken during the course of the hydrolysis reaction was determined by HPLC fitted with a photodiode array detector. Five main components were detected. These compounds were identified as mphenylenediamine, m-aminophenol, resorcinol, 3, 3 ’-aminodiphenylamine and 3 - amino- 3 ’-hydroxydiphenylamine by means of GC-MS. 3, 3 ’-Diaminodiphenylamine is formed by self-condensation of MPDA and 3 -amino- 3 ’-hydroxydiphenylamine is formed by the reaction of MPDA with resorcinol. The degree of formation of these intermediates is substantially reduced when MPDA is added dose-wise to phosphoric acid at a reaction temperature of 220 oC. The reaction mechanism of the hydrolysis reaction was investigated by isotopic lable incorporation, followed by analysis by NMR. This was done by hydrolysing MPDA using deuterated phosphoric acid (D 3 PO 4). D 3 PO 4 was generated by dissolving phosphorus pentoxide in deuterium oxide. The resorcinol product obtained from the hydrolysis using D 3 PO 4 was found to be deuterated on the C- 2, C- 4 and C- 6 positions. This suggests that the hydrolysis reaction involves protonation of MPDA on these positions, and this results in the formation of an iminium ion as one of the resonance forms. Hydrolysis then occurs on the positively charged carbon of this species. <b>Fertiliser</b> <b>grade</b> phosphoric acid can be used in the hydrolysis reaction, provided sulphates are removed before the acid is used in the hydrolysis reaction. The hydrolysis reaction using either ammonium sulphate or sulphuric acid produces resorcinol in yields lower than 60 % if the hydrolysis is conducted in one pass. If these catalysts are used in the hydrolysis reaction, the reaction mixture needs to be re-heated after removal of resorcinol in order to increase the yield. Hydrolysis of MPDA using zirconium phosphate as catalyst gave resorcinol yields in excess of 90 % over 24 hours. These reactions were carried out at very low concentrations of MPDA (0. 3 %). The mode of catalysis in these reactions is unclear. There is a possibility that the reaction is catalysed by phosphoric acid that leaches out of zirconium phosphate at high temperatures. The reaction might therefore not differ mechanistically from the phosphoric acid catalysed reaction. Further studies are required to clarify this point...|$|E

40|$|By {{treating}} organic wastes as a resource, {{and applying}} a different method of waste management, organic wastes could {{contribute significantly to}} global energy needs. The ethanol distillation process waste product, stillage, is a soup-like waste stream that contains substantial organic content. By digesting this material three resources are recovered – biogas (80 per cent methane), biosolids (high in nutrients equivalent to high <b>grade</b> <b>fertiliser)</b> and recyclable water. Current waste treatment in ethanol production focuses on drying the stillage waste and using the resultant material as mulch to be spread over crops. This is an energy intensive, low-benefit, process that increases production cost. If a waste treatment process could convert the waste into a recoverable resource, this would {{reduce the cost of}} ethanol production and would ensure all externalities are valued. For example, methane could be re-used as a source of energy in distillation and production. Unless an economic advantage can be established, there is no true benefit of this type of waste treatment – this is how the economy currently works. All industry and business decisions relate to the bottom line and whether the project will make money (profitability). When a value is put on externalities, it is possible to show whether a project will be profitable. This is so even when considering the impact on the environment and society, not just the economy. Ultimately, when all externalities can be quantified, valued and shown to be positive, the project is sustainable. This research has been carried out to establish the importance of valuing externalities in relation to the triple bottom line of ethanol production. By using waste treatment to recover resources in ethanol distillation, and using those resources directly in operation, process and production, {{while at the same time}} valuing foregone and used externalities, the cost of production should decrease Values for the externalities can be derived from various references, such as current market value. Carbon now has a value per tonne of emissions established in several markets around the world – these values can be attributed directly to energy use.

40|$|This {{research}} {{has been carried out}} to establish; the importance of valuing externalities in relating decision making to the triple bottom line of ethanol production. By treating organic wastes as a resource and applying a different method of waste management, organic wastes could contribute significantly to global energy needs. The ethanol distillation process has a waste product - stillage; a soup like waste stream that contains substantial organic content. By digesting this material to optimum efficiency there are three resources recovered – biogas (80 % methane), biosolids (high in nutrients equivalent to high <b>grade</b> <b>fertiliser)</b> and recyclable water. Current waste treatment in the ethanol production industry focuses on drying the stillage waste and using the resultant material as mulch to be spread over crops; energy intensive, has little benefit and increases the cost of production. Therefore if a waste treatment process could convert the waste into recoverable resources; such as methane; then the subsequent methane utilised back in the distillation / production process as a source of energy, this would essentially reduce the cost of producing ethanol in accordance with the true costs being considered – in other words making sure all externalities are valued. Unless an economic advantage can be established, the true benefit of valuing this type of waste treatment is redundant. This relates to the current way in which the economy works. Ultimately all decisions of business and industry relate to the bottom line, the profitability of a project, will the project make money. By putting a value on externalities associated with a project or process it can be shown whether a project will be profitable, even when considering the impact on the environment and society, not just the economy. Ultimately, when all externalities can be quantified and valued and shown to be positive - the project is inherently sustainable Values for the externalities can be derived from various references such as: current market value. Carbon now has a value per tonne of emissions established in several markets around the world – these values can be attributed directly to energy use. The value of water has been established through research and can also be attributed to water use. The total economic value (TEV) of water, can be broken down into three components: the direct use-value (used or potentially useable by humans); the ecological support value (value to the environment), and the option value (value to society from having the resource available at some time in the future to be used). Ecosystem support value is associated with the assumed contributions of the resource cycles in their naturally-occurring states, or in some similar state, to provide flows to the ecosphere of the area – such as carbon, water and nitrogen. To the degree that the water is removed from the area, as with the industrial uses, for instance, this value is lost. Use value is triggered explicitly by the removal of the water from the aquifer, and its delivery to a specified user, or its storage in a location where it is available for use, in some way, by humans. Therefore, this research aims to show that within ethanol distillation, by utilising waste treatment to recover resources, using those resources directly in the operation / process / production, valuing all externalities associated both foregone and utilised; the cost of production should decrease when scrutinised from an environmental economic perspective. ...|$|R
