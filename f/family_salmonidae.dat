500|$|The {{cutthroat}} trout [...] is a fish {{species of the}} <b>family</b> <b>Salmonidae</b> native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean, Rocky Mountains, and Great Basin in North America. As {{a member of the}} genus Oncorhynchus, {{it is one of the}} Pacific trout, a group that includes the widely distributed rainbow trout. Cutthroat trout are popular gamefish, especially among anglers who enjoy fly fishing. The common name [...] "cutthroat" [...] refers to the distinctive red coloration on the underside of the lower jaw. The specific name clarkii was given to honor explorer William Clark, coleader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.|$|E

40|$|Salmonids are a {{heterogeneous}} group of fish classified in one <b>family</b> – <b>Salmonidae.</b> These species are natives {{of the northern}} hemisphere, but currently have been introduced in many countries {{all over the world}} for sport fishing and aquaculture. Despite the considerable importance of salmonids, their evolutive history is still a controversial issue. The aim of the current study is to infer the phylogeny within the <b>Salmonidae</b> <b>family</b> using as phylogenetic marker the D-loop region. For this purpose, an PCR amplification of D-loop region, followed by direct sequencing and phylogenetic analysis have been performed in four salmonids species from Romanian fauna - Salmo trutta fario, Salvelinus fontinalis, Thymallus thymallus and Oncorhynchus mykiss. For a more accurate phylogenetic classification of these species within <b>Salmonidae</b> <b>family</b> the analysis included similar sequences from GenBank belonging to 17 salmonid species and an osmerid species used as outgroup. The the phylogenetic trees illustrating the evolutive relationships within Salmonidae were constructed by using Neighbor Joining and Maximum Parsimony methodologies implemented in MEGA 5. The phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial control region as marker has allowed an overview about the positions occupied by Romanian salmonids within the <b>Salmonidae</b> <b>family...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Vectors are {{organisms that}} {{transmit}} parasites from one host to another. Juga plicifera stream snails are biological vectors for a larval stage of N. salmincola. Salmonid and some non-salmonid fish are vectors of the metacercariae of N. salmincola. Both fresh and ocean water fish can be parasitic vectors. Fish {{that act as}} second intermediate hosts are different species of the <b>families</b> <b>Salmonidae,</b> Cottidae, and Cyprinidae. Among the thirty-four natural and experimental secondary hosts found in scientific literature are the coastal cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, coho salmon, chum salmon, and kokanee salmon. [...] More infection occurs in salmonid fish, rather than non-salmonid fish. In particular, salmonid fish of the genera Salmo, Oncorhynchus, and Salvelinus {{play a significant role}} in the N. salmincola life cycle.The parasite itself is a vector for Neorickettsia helminthoeca.|$|R

40|$|In most animals, {{physical}} or chemical stressors usually elicit {{an increase in}} metabolic rate and consequently an increase in cardiac output and {{one or both of}} its components, heart rate and stroke volume. While mammals and birds primarily increase cardiac output through the elevation of heart rate (frequency modulation), fish are generally thought to increase cardiac output principally through changes in stroke volume (volume modulation). It has even been suggested that among vertebrates there is an evolutionary trend from volume-modulated to frequency-modulated cardiac output. Within fish, only a few species have been regarded as frequency-modulators including the highly active tuna and the Antarctic nototheniids. In an effort to expand our comprehension of cardiac function in fish, we collected data on several species from two common <b>families,</b> <b>Salmonidae</b> and Centrarchidae, under various conditions. Our preliminary findings indicate that frequency modulation is more prevalent than previously thought especially among centrarchids. 8...|$|R
