5|$|A tile setter, Anthony Cacchio Sr., {{rented the}} {{building}} in 1949 and converted it <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> theater; it opened on February18, 1949 with a screening of the film Blood on the Moon. Cacchio owned the building outright by the mid-1950s. During this time, a severe flood damaged the Theatre's interior, and all the equipment had to be replaced. In its early years, the Theatre showed about 300 different movies each year, making it unpopular with film distributors. Denied easy access to first run films, the Theatre turned to independent movies and art films, and eventually began exhibiting live performances. Cacchio's entire family helped run the Theatre; his wife Fannie sold tickets and determined the Theatre's movie selection, while their sons Anthony Jr. and Rocco, and grandson Michael, ran the projector and eventually managed the day-to-day operation of the business.|$|E
