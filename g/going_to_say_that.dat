500|$|On May 1, 1991, Henderson {{stole his}} 939th base to pass Lou Brock {{and became the}} sport's all-time stolen base leader. Henderson's speech (at right) after {{breaking}} Brock's record {{was similar to the}} standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words [...] "greatest of all time." [...] These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant, although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer [...] "had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> day." [...] On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, [...] "He spoke from his heart." [...] Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981. Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, [...] "How are we gonna break it?" ...|$|E
500|$|Playing {{opposite}} Cagney in Maggie the Magnificent was Joan Blondell, {{who starred}} again {{with him a}} few months later in Marie Baumer's new play Penny Arcade. While the critics panned Penny Arcade, they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled Sinners' Holiday, the film was released in 1930. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract. In the film, he portrays Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer, but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic [...] "bad" [...] guy was a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of Sinners' Holiday, he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his work attitude. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: [...] "There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother's breast... was 'I'm your baby, ain't I?' I refused to say it. Adolfi said 'I'm going to tell Zanuck.' I said 'I don't give a shit what you tell him, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> line.'" [...] They took the line out.|$|E

2500|$|On October 26, 1981, {{after two}} firebombs damaged the Egyptian tourist office at Rockefeller Center, JDL Chairman Meir Kahane {{said at a}} press conference: [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the JDL bombed that office. There are laws against that in this country. But I'm {{not going to say}} I mourn for it either." [...] The next day, after an {{anonymous}} caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the JDL, the group's spokesman later denied his group's involvement, but said, [...] "we support the act." [...] JDL members had often been suspected of involvement in attacks against neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and antisemites.|$|E

However, Herodotus will at time arbitrate between varying accounts: [...] "I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> these events happened {{one way or the}} other. Rather, I will point out the man who I know for a fact began the wrong-doing against the Greeks." [...] Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: [...] "I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Milano auditioned for nearly every film role in her age bracket, {{including}} B movies, and finally tried to shed her [...] "nice girl" [...] image by appearing nude in several erotic films targeted at adults, such as Embrace of the Vampire, Deadly Sins and [...] She said the nude appearances {{taught her to}} begin requiring a nudity clause in her contracts giving her [...] "full control" [...] over all her nude scenes. In a 1995 interview, she explained her motivation for some explicit scenes in Embrace of the Vampire: [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I was manipulated into doing things that I didn't want to do. I did {{it because it was}} a woman director and I felt protected. And I learned a lot as far as knowing where the camera is and what coverage they need so that it's not all explicit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Back at his hotel, Kennedy complained at 2:55a.m. to {{the hotel}} owner {{that he had been}} awakened by a noisy party. By 7:30a.m., he was talking [...] "casually" [...] to the winner of the {{previous}} day's sailing race and gave no indication that anything was amiss. At 8:00a.m., Gargan and Markham joined Kennedy at his hotel where they had a [...] "heated conversation." [...] According to Kennedy's testimony, the two men asked why he had not reported the crash. Kennedy responded by telling them [...] "about my own thoughts and feelings as I swam across that channel... that somehow when they arrived in the morning that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Mary Jo was still alive." [...] The three men subsequently crossed back to Chappaquiddick Island on the ferry, where Kennedy made a series of telephone calls from a pay telephone near the crossing. He made the phone calls to his friends for advice. Again, Kennedy did not report the crash to authorities.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, after {{unsuccessful}} {{efforts to}} persuade Washington state {{government officials to}} provide funding to update KeyArena, the Basketball Club of Seattle LLP, led by Howard Schultz, sold the team to the Professional Basketball Club LLC (PBC), an investment group headed by Oklahoma City businessman Clay Bennett. The purchase, at US$350 million, also included the Seattle Storm WNBA franchise. Schultz sold the franchise to Bennett's group because they thought that Bennett would not move the franchise to Oklahoma City but instead keep it in Seattle. Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett was quoted as saying, [...] "I think it's presumptuous to assume that Clay Bennett and his ownership group won't own that Seattle team for a long, long time in Seattle or somewhere else. It's presumptuous to assume they're going to move that franchise to Oklahoma City", Cornett said. [...] "I understand that people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{seems to be a}} likely scenario, but that's just speculation." ...|$|E

5000|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable reviews.

Jim Farber of Daily News also gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, noting that [...] "Cole's assertions of sweetness and light hardly prove as seamless, or simple, as her songs declare". He declares that [...] "her makeover feels less like a day at the spa than a night at the shrink", <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> [...] "instead of seeming harrowing or dark", the album's result is [...] "soulful and fulfilling". The Boston Globe said that [...] "Cole emphatically dares to be different—and pretty great".

2500|$|Stan Lee {{appears as}} an {{informant}} to the Watchers, discussing previous adventures that include his cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions {{his time as}} a FedEx delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in [...] This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos, with Gunn noting that [...] "people thought Stan Lee is [...] and {{that all of these}} cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU." [...] Feige added that Lee [...] "clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in Guardians…really says, so wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?" [...] Lee filmed several different versions of the scene, including an alternative where he references his role in Deadpool, which would have been the first acknowledgment of the X-Men film series by an MCU film. Gunn later admitted that the Civil War reference is a continuity error, given Vol. 2 is set before the events of Civil War, saying, [...] "I screwed up; I wasn't thinking. But I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> probably Stan Lee used the guise of a Fed Ex guy more than one time." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Meiji {{government}} {{endeavored to}} assimilate Western ideas, {{technological advances and}} ways of warfare. By the late 19th century, Japan had transformed itself into a modernized industrial state. The Japanese wanted {{to be recognized as}} equal with the Western powers. The Meiji restoration had always been intended to make Japan a modernized state, not a Westernized one, and Japan was always an imperialist power, looking towards overseas expansionism. In the years 1869–73, the Seikanron ("Conquer Korea Argument") had bitterly divided the Japanese elite between one faction that wanted to conquer Korea immediately vs. another that wanted to wait until Japan was more modernized before embarking on a war to conquer Korea; significantly no-one in the Japanese elite ever accepted the idea that the Koreans had the right to be independent, with only the question of timing dividing the two factions. In {{much the same way that}} Europeans used the backwardness of Africa and Asia as a reason for why they had to conquer nations of Africa and Asia, for the Japanese elite the backwardness of China and Korea was proof of the inferiority of those nations, thus giving the Japanese the [...] "right" [...] to conquer them. Inouye Kaoru, the Foreign Minister gave a speech in 1887 saying [...] "What we must do is to transform our empire and our people, make the empire like the countries of Europe and our people like the peoples of Europe", <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Chinese and Koreans had essentially forfeited their right to be independent by not modernizing. Much of the pressure for an aggressive foreign policy in Japan came from below, with the advocates of [...] "people's rights" [...] movement calling for an elected parliament also favoring an ultra-nationalist line that took it for granted the Japanese had the [...] "right" [...] to annex Korea, as the [...] "people's right" [...] movement was led by those who favored invading Korea in the years 1869–73. As part of the modernization process in Japan, Social Darwinian ideas about the [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] were common in Japan from the 1880s onward and many ordinary Japanese resented the heavy taxes imposed by the government to modernize Japan, demanding something tangible like an overseas colony as a reward for their sacrifices. Furthermore, the educational system of Meiji Japan was meant to train the schoolboys to be soldiers when they grew up, and as such, Japanese schools indoctrinated their students into Bushido ("the spirit of the warriors"), the fierce code of the samurai. Having indoctrinated the younger generations into Bushido, the Meiji elite found themselves faced with a people who clamored for war, and regarded diplomacy as a weakness. The British Japanologist Richard Storry wrote the biggest misconception about Japan in the West was that the Japanese people were the [...] "docile" [...] instruments of the elite, when in fact much of the pressure for Japan's wars from 1894 to 1941 came from below, as ordinary people demanded a [...] "tough" [...] foreign policy, and tended to engage in riots and assassination when foreign policy was perceived to be pusillanimous. Though the Meiji oligarchy refused to allow democracy, they did seek to appropriate some of the demands of the [...] "people's rights" [...] movement by allowing an elected Diet in 1890 (with limited powers and an equally limited franchise) and by pursuing an aggressive foreign policy towards Korea.|$|E
