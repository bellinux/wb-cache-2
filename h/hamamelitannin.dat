40|$|Staphylococci are a {{major health}} threat because of {{increasing}} resistance to antibiotics. An alternative to antibiotic treatment is preventing virulence by inhibition of bacterial cell-to-cell com-munication using the quorum-sensing inhibitor RNAIII-inhibiting peptide (RIP). In this work, we identified 2, 5 -di-O-galloyl-D-hamamelose (<b>hamamelitannin)</b> as a nonpeptide analog of RIP by virtual screening of a RIP-based pharmacophore against a database of commercially available small-molecule com-pounds. <b>Hamamelitannin</b> is a natural product found in the bark of Hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel), and it {{has no effect on}} staphylococcal growth in vitro; but like RIP, it does inhibit the quorum-sensing regulator RNAIII. In a rat graft model, hama-melitannin prevented device-associated infections in vivo, in-cluding infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{colonization}} of indwelling medical devices and subsequent biofilm formation represents a global challenge since it promotes {{the persistence of}} infection and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the antimicrobial activity of cerium, chitosan and <b>hamamelitannin</b> against usual microbial colonizers and to assess their efficacy regarding biofilm formation on polyurethane (PUR) -like catheters. Methods: The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effect of cerium nitrate, low molecular weight chitosan (LMWC) and <b>hamamelitannin</b> was tested against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans strains. Biofilm formation was assessed with PUR-like catheter segments and the metabolic activity was quantified by colorimetry with a tetrazolium reduction assay. Results: Cerium nitrate and LMWC inhibited the microbial growth of all microbial strains tested; hamamelitan-nin showed no inhibition. Regarding biofilm formation on PUR-like catheters, with subinhibitory concentrations: cerium nitrate significantly inhibited the metabolic activity of C. albicans; LMWC reduced the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and C. albicans; and <b>hamamelitannin</b> decreased the metabolic activity of all tested bacteria, but not of yeasts. Conclusions: The microbicidal activity of cerium nitrate and LMWC was clearly demonstrated in this study, a...|$|E
40|$|A {{library of}} 52 <b>hamamelitannin</b> analogues was {{synthesized}} and investigated {{for its ability}} to potentiate the effect of vancomycin toward Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Several compounds were found to effectively increase the susceptibility of staphylococcal biofilms toward this glycopeptide. The most active analogue identified in this study showed an EC 50 value of 0. 26 mu M...|$|E

40|$|The {{modulation}} {{of bacterial}} communication to potentiate {{the effect of}} existing antimicrobial drugs is a promising alternative {{to the development of}} novel antibiotics. In the present study, we synthesized 58 analogues of <b>hamamelitannin</b> (HAM), a quorum sensing inhibitor and antimicrobial potentiator. These efforts resulted in the identification of an analogue that increases the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus towards antibiotics in vitro, in Caenorhabditis elegans, and in a mouse mammary gland infection model, without showing cytotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid density-functional {{calculations}} {{were carried}} out to corroborate the identity of phenoxyl radicals observed by EPR spectroscopy after oxidation of selected mono- and polyphenols with horseradish peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide or after alkaline autoxidation. Whereas quantitative correlations of experimental and theoretical coupling constants were less satisfactory, we could confirm formation of a biradical after initial oxidation of 2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenol, the mesomeric structures of gallate ester aroxyl radicals and identify the radical site of a model gallotannin, <b>hamamelitannin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Phenolic {{extracts}} from witch hazel, Hamamelis virginiana, are efficient antioxidants against fish lipid peroxidation. The impact of fish thermal processes on the hydrolyzable polyphenols from this source was studied. H. virginiana polyphenols included 80 % of hydrolyzable tannins, {{characterized by a}} mixture of glucose gallates containing from 5 to 10 units of gallic acid, <b>hamamelitannin,</b> and 20 % of proanthocyanidins. Structural modifications of the polyphenols during thermal processes were determined by HPLC-MS. Changes in their reducing and free radical scavenging capacities {{as a result of}} high temperatures were also determined. Thermal processes triggered a significant breakdown of hydrolyzable tannins with 6 âˆ’ 10 galloyl units to give pentagalloyl glucose (PGG). The release of high concentrations of free gallic acid especially in long-term thermally processed samples leads to an increase of the antioxidant ability of heated H. virginiana extracts. Such an increase was evidenced by an increment in the reducing and radical scavenging capacities as well as an improvement in the antioxidant effectiveness for inhibiting lipid oxidation of processed fatty fish muscle. This work was performed within the research projects AGL 2006 - 12210 -C 03 - 01 and - 02. The financing of this work by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology is gratefully acknowledged.

40|$|Although {{the exact}} role of quorum sensing (QS) {{in various stages}} of biofilm formation, maturation, and {{dispersal}} and in biofilm resistance is not entirely clear, the use of QS inhibitors (QSI) has been proposed as a potential antibiofilm strategy. We have investigated whether QSI enhance the susceptibility of bacterial biofilms to treatment with conventional antimicrobial agents. The QSI used in our study target the acyl-homoserine lactone-based QS system present in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex organisms (baicalin hydrate, cinnamaldehyde) or the peptide-based system present in Staphylococcus aureus (<b>hamamelitannin).</b> The effect of tobramycin (P. aeruginosa, B. cepacia complex) and clindamycin or vancomycin (S. aureus), alone or in combination with QSI, was evaluated in various in vitro and in vivo biofilm model systems, including two invertebrate models and one mouse pulmonary infection model. In vitro the combined use of an antibiotic and a QSI generally resulted in increased killing compared to killing by an antibiotic alone, although reductions were strain and model dependent. A significantly higher fraction of infected Galleria mellonella larvae and Caenorhabditis elegans survived infection following combined treatment, compared to treatment with an antibiotic alone. Finally, the combined use of tobramycin and baicalin hydrate reduced the microbial load in the lungs of BALB/c mice infected with Burkholderia cenocepacia more than tobramycin treatment alone. Our data suggest that QSI may increase the success of antibiotic treatment by increasing th...|$|E
40|$|Antiviral {{activity}} {{has been demonstrated}} for different tannin-rich plant extracts. Since tannins of different classes and molecular weights are often found together in plant extracts and may differ in their antiviral activity, we have compared the effect against influenza A virus (IAV) of Hamamelis virginiana L. bark extract, fractions enriched in tannins of different molecular weights and individual tannins of defined structures, including pseudotannins. We demonstrate antiviral activity of the bark extract against different IAV strains, including the recently emerged H 7 N 9, and show {{for the first time}} that a tannin-rich extract inhibits human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 infection. As the best performing antiviral candidate, we identified a highly potent fraction against both IAV and HPV, enriched in high molecular weight condensed tannins by ultrafiltration, a simple, reproducible and easily upscalable method. This ultrafiltration concentrate and the bark extract inhibited early and, to a minor extent, later steps in the IAV life cycle and tannin-dependently inhibited HPV attachment. We observed interesting mechanistic differences between tannin structures: High molecular weight tannin containing extracts and tannic acid (1702 g/mol) inhibited both IAV receptor binding and neuraminidase activity. In contrast, low molecular weight compounds (, 500 g/mol) such as gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate or <b>hamamelitannin</b> inhibited neuraminidase but not hemagglutination. Average molecular weight of the compounds seemed to positively correlate with receptor binding (but not neuraminidase) inhibition. In general, neuraminidase inhibition seemed to contribute little to the antivira...|$|E
