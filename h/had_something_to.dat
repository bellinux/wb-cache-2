5|$|Back on the ward, {{a father}} and his two daughters have been brought in, one with a stab wound and one badly burnt. The father only has minor {{injuries}} but the police seem to believe he <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the incident. Maddy tries {{to find out what}} is happening from the father, who is not talking to the police. She seems to have some connection with him but can't seem to put her finger on what it is.|$|E
5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought it <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with naval guns.|$|E
5|$|High {{school student}} Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris, France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition {{that the plane}} will suffer a catastrophic engine failure, causing the plane to explode mid-air and kill {{everyone}} on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics and a fight breaks out between Alex and his rival, Carter Horton. This leads to several passengers being removed from the plane, including Alex; Carter; Alex's best friend, Tod Waggner; Carter's girlfriend, Terry Chaney; teacher Valerie Lewton; and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of the passengers, except for Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off, killing the remaining passengers on board. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, who believe that Alex <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the explosion.|$|E

How mankind ever came to be afflicted with wiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a pit of it, I don't know; so it is." ...|$|R

5|$|Manning's {{father took}} a job as an {{information}} technology (IT) manager for a rental car agency, which required travel. The family lived several miles out of town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 2004, Shaftesbury's Nice-based lawyer, Thierry Bensaude {{reported}} him missing, {{after being}} contacted by his girlfriend, Orche. The peer divided {{his time between}} the Riviera and a home in Hove, East Sussex. He had been due to return home on 10 November. After not hearing from Shaftesbury in a week, they remained concerned when he failed {{to return to his}} rented flat in Adelaide Crescent, Hove. Bensaude and Orche both expressed fears for his safety. Shaftesbury had been taking legal action in relation to the theft of some family antiques and artwork. Some friends and acquaintances mentioned that he had complained of money problems, so they surmised that his disappearance may have <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the theft and financial loss.|$|E

25|$|When police {{knocked on}} Einem's door and enquired {{about whether they}} could ask him a few questions, his {{immediate}} reaction was {{to say that he}} wouldn't answer anything without speaking to his lawyer first. This made police suspect that he <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide.|$|E
25|$|The Palmyrene {{rebellion}} in Egypt had probably reduced the grain supply to Rome, thus disaffecting {{the population to}} the emperor. This rebellion also {{had the support of}} some senators, probably those who had supported the election of Quintillus, and thus <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> fear from Aurelian.|$|E

25|$|Annie Proulx {{wrote an}} essay expressing her extreme {{disappointment}} {{in the film}} not winning the Best Picture Award. She intimated that Scientologists <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with it, and that Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting required less skill than that required of the actors in Brokeback Mountain.|$|E
25|$|Socrates and {{his company}} of disputants <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say on many subjects, {{including}} politics and art, religion and science, justice and medicine, virtue and vice, crime and punishment, pleasure and pain, rhetoric and rhapsody, human nature and sexuality, as well as love and wisdom.|$|E
25|$|Maclean also criticised Dalyell for reiterating the programme's unfounded {{claims that}} the British or American {{security}} services may have <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with Fletcher's death. He concluded by saying it was the Libyan nationals in the bureau who should be co-operating with the investigation into her murder.|$|E

25|$|In the sequel, , Lois {{helps the}} Kents create Kal-El's 'Clark' disguise- albeit naming him 'Carl' on impulse- {{to give him}} a chance at a normal life outside of his role as Superman, {{reasoning}} that the simplicity of the glasses will stop people paying too much attention to him, while their original plan to completely cover him with a false beard would make people suspect that Kal-El <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide.|$|E
25|$|These {{materials}} are evidence both of specialization {{of labor and}} commerce. The flint used came from southern Poland; the obsidian came from the Bükk and Tatra mountains. Settlements in those regions specialized in mining and manufacture. The products were exported {{to all the other}} LBK regions, which must have <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> trade. This commerce is a strong argument for an ethnic unity between the scattered pockets of the culture.|$|E
25|$|As desired and expected, news of {{a contest}} of such {{distance}} evoked strong enthusiasm both within and without the motorsport community. Newspaper and trade magazine articles used ever-new superlatives for the challenges expected to soon face both drivers and engineers, and continuing discussion throughout the spring and winter kept the race as the primary conversation piece of the average citizen. Everyone, it seemed, <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say about it.|$|E

25|$|In 1972 the BBC {{terminated}} Bernard Braden's {{late night}} show, On the Braden Beat, {{replacing it with}} a similar programme, That's Life!, introduced by Esther Rantzen, who had worked with Braden. The reasons seem a little complicated and may have <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with Braden's contract to advertise margarine on ITV. However, although Braden himself was publicly circumspect about the decision, Kelly was forthright in condemning it and was plainly hostile towards Rantzen.|$|E
25|$|Dutch {{physicists}} Hendrik Casimir and Dirk Polder at Philips Research Labs {{proposed the}} existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947, this special form is called the Casimir–Polder force. After a conversation with Niels Bohr, who suggested it <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948 which is called the Casimir effect in the narrow sense.|$|E
25|$|Politically, however, Giolitti did {{not survive}} the scandal. He had been Finance Minister in the {{government}} that had suppressed the original 1889 report. As Prime Minister he had borrowed from the Banca Romana for governmental purposes in August 1892, had nominated the bank's governor, Tanlongo, to the Senate, and had resisted a parliamentary enquiry, encouraging suspicions that he <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide. Tanlongo and the Banca Romana's tried to defame Giolitti, calculating that a change of government {{would result in the}} release of the defendants.|$|E
