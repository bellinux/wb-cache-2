40|$|Owing to the {{fluctuation}} {{of financial}} markets from time to time, some financial variables can always be observed with perturbations and be expected in the imprecise sense. Therefore, this paper starts from the fuzzy environments of <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> markets, introduces fuzzy techniques, and gives a fuzzy <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> pricing model. By turning exchange rate, interest rates and volatility into triangular fuzzy numbers, the <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> price will turn into a fuzzy number. This makes the financial investors who can pick any <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> price with an acceptable belief degree for their later use. In order to obtain the belief degree, an optimization procedure has been applied. An empirical study is performed based on daily foreign exchange market data.

40|$|Credit {{derivative}} mispricing {{is one of}} {{the fundamental}} causes of the recent Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Heavy speculation of Credit Default Swaps (CDS), unregulated over-thecounter (OTC) derivatives and unsupervised nonbank derivativesdealer activities are the key issues for credit derivativemispricing. <b>Currency</b> <b>option</b> derivatives have been used as a popular speculation and hedging tool for the last three decades. Since all kind of derivatives are analogous in the context of managing financial risk, we are also concerned about the pricing of the major <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> during the GFC. This study therefore examines the efficiency of the <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> market from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2011 and 1 January 2012 to 31 January 2012, covering the GFC and post-GFC periods, respectively. The options on the Australian dollar (AUD), the British pound (BP), the Canadian dollar (CAD), the Euro (EUR), the Japanese yen (JPY) and the Swiss franc (SF) are used as samples in this study. We found that the <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> market was inefficient in the GFC period, leading to the major <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> being mispriced. However, these <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> were priced accurately after the GFC period. The implication of the results is that <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> would not be appropriate to manage foreign exchange (FX) exposure when the market is experiencing a poor or crisis period.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the Israeli <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> market, which {{includes}} <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and (non-tradable) Bank of Israel <b>currency</b> <b>options.</b> The three aims of this study are: (a) To examine the null hypothesis that the Israeli <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> market is efficient, {{an issue that has}} not yet been thoroughly investigated. Ex-post tests of arbitrage and dominance conditions do not permit rejection of the null hypothesis, except for very-nearmaturity, deep-in-the-money (ITM) options. (b) To test the validity of the Black and Scholes (B-S) model as a native option-pricing model for the case of an exchange-rate target zone. We find that although we cannot reject the weakly efficient market hypothesis (except for very-near-maturity deep-ITM options), we can reject the strongly efficient market and/or the B-S model validity hypotheses. The banking sector could have utilized arbitrage opportunities, notably for out-ofthe-money, at-the-money, and far-from-maturity options, especially when employing inter-temporal weighted-average implied standard deviation. (c) To address the issue of the liquidity premium evaluation; this (rather surprisingly) is found to be negative for some options. This study extends previous studies of options by examining the efficiency of <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> markets and the validity of the Black and Scholes model under a target zone exchange rate regime.

40|$|The {{log-normal}} Garman and Kohlhagen (1983) <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> model usually creates pricing biases when {{matched with}} the market prices. The observed price bias pattern is generally consistent with the mixed jump-diffusion distribution for exchange rates. Various studies have provided evidence of jump risks in exchange rate movements. This paper argues that the jump risk in the exchange rates may be correlated {{with the market}}. Thus an equilibrium framework is needed to price the systematic jump components in <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> prices. I propose an equilibrium model to investigate {{the dynamics of the}} exchange rate in a small open monetary economy with stochastic jump-diffusion processes for both the money supply and aggregate dividend. It is shown that the exchange rate is affected by government monetary policies, aggregate dividends and the level of investment in foreign assets. As a result, the exchange rate exhibits more discontinuities than stock prices as empirically documented. Since the jump in the exchange rate is correlated with aggregate consumption, the jump risk in the exchange rate derived from aggregate dividend must be priced for <b>currency</b> <b>options.</b> I further derive the foreign agents' risk-neutral valuation of the European <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> and provide restrictions to ensure the parity conditions in <b>currency</b> <b>option</b> market. In general, these restrictions depend on the agent's risk preference. Exchange rates, Systematic jumps, <b>Currency</b> <b>options,</b> Open economy, Equilibrium...|$|R

This asymmetry varies greatly over time and often switch directions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal bidding and hedging decisions of a risk-averse contractor for a construction project abroad. We show that <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> play no {{role as a}} hedging instrument when the contractor has a quadratic utility function. However, if the contractor is prudent, <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> are used for hedging purposes. Prudence thus generates a hedging demand for <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> when foreign exchange exposure is uncertain. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we show that currency hedging may have perverse effects on the contractor's bidding behavior. In a canonical example with negative exponential utility functions, we demonstrate that the possibilities for the contractor to bid more aggressively {{in the absence of}} currency hedging are not factitious. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|Option pricing was {{introduced}} by Black-Scholes in 1973 [1]. In a work by Garman and Kohlhagen (GK) [2], the Black-Scholes model was developed in order to evaluate European <b>currency</b> <b>option.</b> However, some researchers (see [3]) pointed to the evidences, which reflect the mispriced <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> by the GK model. The significant causes of why this model is not suitable for stock markets are {{due to the fact}} that the currencies are different from the stocks in main respects, and geometric Brownian motion is unable to resolve the conduct of the currency return [4, 5]. Since then, in order to tackle these problems, many systems for pricing <b>currency</b> <b>options</b> have been proposed using the extensions of the GK model [6 – 9]. Since fractional Brownian motion (FBM) includes two prominent properties: long-range correlation and self-similarity, it can get the typical tail behavior from stock markets.|$|R
