60|$|To furnish {{the most}} unremitted excitements of this kind, and to urge man {{to further the}} gracious designs of Providence by the <b>full</b> <b>cultivation</b> of the earth, it has been ordained that {{population}} should increase much faster than food. This general law (as it {{has appeared in the}} former parts of this Essay) undoubtedly produces much partial evil, but a little reflection may, perhaps, satisfy us, that it produces a great overbalance of good. Strong excitements seem necessary to create exertion, and to direct this exertion, and form the reasoning faculty, it seems absolutely necessary, that the Supreme Being should act always according to general laws. The constancy of the laws of nature, or the certainty with which we may expect the same effects from the same causes, is the foundation of the faculty of reason. If in the ordinary course of things, the finger of God were frequently visible, or to speak more correctly, if God were frequently to change his purpose (for the finger of God is, indeed, visible in every blade of grass that we see), a general and fatal torpor of the human faculties would probably ensue; even the bodily wants of mankind would cease to stimulate them to exertion, could they not reasonably expect that if their efforts were well directed they would be crowned with success. The constancy of the laws of nature is the foundation of the industry and foresight of the husbandman, the indefatigable ingenuity of the artificer, the skilful researches of the physician and anatomist, and the watchful observation and patient investigation of the natural philosopher. To this constancy we owe all the greatest and noblest efforts of intellect. To this constancy we owe the immortal mind of a Newton.|$|E

The immunizing dose of live T. parva sporozoites used in this method is usually determined by in vivo titration. An alternative in vitro method of quantification of sporozoites in whole tick-derived stabilates is proposed. The method consists of incubating serially diluted T. parva stabilates with bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes, the host cell that is infected naturally. Allowing the cultures to incubate undisturbed for the <b>full</b> <b>cultivation</b> period (10 days) reduced the variability among replicate titrations. Fungal contaminations were avoided by centrifuging stabilates at 400 g prior to the incubation, which did not precipitate sporozoites significantly. Fungistatics, Nystatin and Flucytosine, did not appear to interfere with the in vitro development of T. parva but their effect on fungal growth was limited. In vitro titration data were compared to in vivo infection data for 2 stabilates. In vitro titration of T. parva sporozoites should allow more ethical and efficient research on the preparation and storage of T. parva tick-derived stabilates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{nature and}} timing of rice {{domestication}} {{and the development of}} rice cultivation in South Asia is much debated. In northern South Asia there is presently a significant gap (c. 4200 years) between earliest evidence for the exploitation of wild rice (Lahuradewa c. 6000 BCE) and earliest dated evidence for the utilisation of fully domesticated rice (Mahagara c. 1800 BCE). The Indus Civilisation (c. 3000 – 1500 BCE) developed and declined during the intervening period, and there has been debate about whether rice was adopted and exploited by Indus populations during this ‘gap’. This paper presents new analysis of spikelet bases and weeds collected from three Indus Civilisation settlements in north-west India, which provide insight into the way that rice was exploited. This analysis suggests that starting in the period before the Indus urban phase (Early Harappan) and continuing through the urban (Mature Harappan/Harappan), post-urban (Late Harappan) and on into the post-Indus Painted Grey Ware (PGW) period, there was a progressive increase in the proportion of domesticated-type spikelet bases and a decrease in wild-types. This pattern fits with a model of the slow development of rice exploitation from wild foraging to agriculture involving <b>full</b> <b>cultivation.</b> Importantly, the accompanying weeds show no increased proportions of wetland species during this period. Instead a mix of wetland and dryland species was identified, and although these data are preliminary, they suggest that the development of an independent rice tradition may have been intertwined with the practices of the eastern most Indus peoples. These data also suggest that when fully domesticated Oryza sativa ssp. japonica was introduced around 2000 BCE, it arrived in an area that was already familiar with domesticated rice cultivation and a range of cultivation techniques...|$|E
40|$|The time of sowing {{chickpea}} (Cicer arietinum L.) in the High Barind Tract of north-west Bangladesh {{is critical}} to crop success. To ensure adequate emergence and subsequent crop growth, chickpea relies on residual soil moisture stored in the profile after rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivated in the preceding rainy season. With the development of mechanised, one-pass minimum tillage sowing, the time between rice harvest and chickpea sowing is decreased, and temperature constraints that limit biomass and/or pod formation and filling may be avoided. Minimum tillage may also limit evaporation from the soil surface compared with traditional, <b>full</b> <b>cultivation</b> procedures. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the optimum sowing time to achieve adequate crop establishment and limit exposure of the chickpea crop to terminal drought and heat stress later in the growing season. Over three experimental seasons, chickpea sowing dates were spread from 22 November to 22 December. Soil water content, crop growth and temperature were monitored to determine the optimum sowing time. Over all seasons and sowing dates, the volumetric soil water content in the seedbed under minimum tillage remained within 17 - 34 %, a range non-limiting for chickpea establishment in glasshouse and field experiments. Late planting (after 10 December) exposed seedlings to low temperatures (35 °C), resulting in unfilled pods and depressed grain yield. The preferred sowing time was determined to be 30 November to 10 December to reduce the risk of high temperatures and low soil water content during chickpea reproductive growth causing terminal heat and drought stress, respectively. Mechanised sowing in one operation allows farmers to optimise their time of sowing to match seed requirements for soil water at emergence and may assist farmers to avoid temperature stresses (both low and high) that constrain chickpea vegetative and reproductive growth...|$|E

40|$|The intellect is beset with {{numerous}} problems and shortcomings {{some of which}} have been historically noted by Plato, Bacon, Locke and others. A particularly challenging problem in reasoning, is the problem of (colored) ‘lenses’ whose source is culture, broadly construed. While the vital role of culture in reasoning may have been alluded to by philosophers, it has not been closely analyzed or theorized. Through two empirical case studies drawn from the field of educational anthropology, I demonstrate how cultural lenses block reasoning altogether or severely constrain it. This poses a particular challenge for the cultivation of the intellect in education—a goal universally advocated by historical and contemporary philosophers of education. Current educational programs aiming towards the cultivation of the intellect, namely, through critical thinking and through an initiation into the disciplines, while they have their merits in helping students think more effectively, are insufficient in helping students to overcome the barrier of lenses (as theorized herein). And they fail because current educational programs focus on argument identification and evaluation. But problems of reason are not limited to problems of argument and reason is not limited to argument evaluation. Hence, what is required is a philosophy of education for the <b>full</b> <b>cultivation</b> of the intellect based on a broader conception of reason; a conception of reason which I demonstrate through empirical case studies. To achieve the goal of the fuller cultivation of the intellect in education, I indicate a pedagogical direction for a possible educational program. I also recommend a focused research program in (i) the philosophical study of reason in a broader sense than just evaluation of arguments, (ii) a multidisciplinary study of various problems facing reason and (iii) an empirical study of educational methods for overcoming problems of reason. The implications of the present work are not just limited to students’ reasonings but have relevance to teachers’ and policy makers’ reasonings and indeed to the reasonings of philosophers of education as well...|$|E

40|$|Italy is {{the leading}} {{producer}} of rice in Europe with over half of total production, almost totally concentrated in a large traditional paddy rice area between the Lombardy and Piedmont regions, in the north-western part of the country. In this area irrigation of rice has been traditionally carried out by flooding. The introduction of new combined irrigation and agronomic management practices (dry seeding followed by field flooding and in a <b>full</b> aerobic <b>cultivation</b> with intermittent irrigations), aiming to reduce the water consumption, can determine considerable effect on the landscape and the water cycle. With the aim to study in depth the water fluxes during the whole crop season, three experimental plots at the Ente Nazionale Risi-Rice Research Centre’s Experimental Station of Castello d’Agogna (PV) were instrumented. In each plot the following instruments have been installed: 1) a long throated flume and a double shaped (V-notch and rectangular) thin plate for superficial inputs and outputs, 3) a set of piezometers for groundwater levels, 4) one stage level gauge in each submerged field, 5) four tensiometers and moisture sensors clusters, 6) one eddy covariance station for vapour fluxes estimation.

40|$|In {{the last}} years rice {{cultivation}} methods have been the object of an intense research activity aiming to implement new irrigation methods in addition to traditional flooding, {{in order to reduce}} water use. This change has concerned also the traditional paddy-rice territories of the north-west of Italy, where rice has been traditionally cultivated as flooded and where paddy fields are a strong landscape landmark and represent a central feature in the Italian and European network for nature protection. The new techniques introduced in these territories consist in a dry seeding followed by field flooding after about one month (third-fourth leaf), and in a <b>full</b> aerobic <b>cultivation</b> with intermittent irrigations, similarly to standard irrigated crops. This paper presents the results obtained after the first year of a monitoring activity carried out at the Ente Nazionale Risi Experimental Station of Castello d’Agogna-Mortara (PV, Italy), where the main terms of water balance have been measured or estimated during the whole crop season. Because there is a substantial lack of data concerning the water balance related to the new water management techniques, the data are of wide interest despite this study covered only one season. The results here presented show that dry seeding-delayed flooding method required a rather similar amount of water respect to the traditional flooding method (2200 mm and 2491 mm, respectively), whereas the aerobic technique required one order of magnitude less water (298 mm), also due to the very shallow depth of the surface aquifer. Since evapotranspiration was nearly the same for the three methods (578 mm, 555 mm, and 464 mm, respectively for traditional flooded, dry seeding-delayed flooding and aerobic methods), percolation was very high {{in the case of the}} two flooded methods and very limited in the case of the aerobic cultivation with intermittent irrigations. These results suggest that, if the aerobic cultivation of rice represents a highly effective water-saving technique at the field scale, at the same time if applied on a large scale in traditional paddy areas, as the north-west of Italy, it could be a potential threat for groundwater dynamics, due to the dramatic decrease of groundwater recharge, and in general for traditional landscape conservation and nature protection...|$|R

Kitchen gardens, market gardens and orchards also provide training grounds where people can learn to manage plants and exploit the land for the future benefit of the community. Fruit and vegetable growing is an indispensable economic activity that ensures a livelihood for the family as well as adequate food supplies to towns and rural areas. African Gardens: Growing Vegetables and Fruit is a new title in the series Land and Life (Terres et Vie) published by Macmillan, in association with CTA. The series is aimed at students and practitioners of agriculture and rural development in the Third World. The cost of translation from the French has been financed by CTA. African Gardens illustrates how the series treats a topic according to appropriate, small-scale and affordable technology, whilst at the same time taking into account both traditional practices and relevant modern improvements. The book covers the principles and practices of growing vegetables and fruit in the tropics and sub-tropics, and describes the requirements of these crops and the techniques of <b>cultivation.</b> <b>Full</b> details {{of a wide range of}} local and exotic fruit and vegetables are given. The book is divided into two parts, of which the first deals mainly with methods and practices. it aims to stimulate thought among growers about what they are doing, and to encourage them to experiment with different plants to improve yield, and thereby achieve a more balanced diet. It suggests ways of controlling pests, fertilizing the soil and choosing good seed. The second part describes 85 plants, many of which can often be found in the market-place, but which tend to be overlooked in other books on the subject. The text is easy to follow: technical words are printed in bold, and so also are key words and ideas. There is a general index which gives the first and subsequent pages on which these words occur. In addition there is a glossary, which defines the botanical terms used in Part II, an index of scientific names and some common plant names in languages and dialects other than English. This book can be seen as a contribution towards making more scientific and technical information available to growers and towards improving the quality of indigenous produce by experimentation and research.

40|$|The GAEC {{standard}} land levelling under {{authorization of}} cross compliance prohibits farmers from levelling land through bulldozing without a specific permission {{issued by the}} proper territorial authority. The aim of the standard is to ensure the protection of soil from accelerated erosion that almost always occurs when land is levelled without conservative criteria. Land levelling prior to planting or replanting specialized crops, especially orchards, is indicated by agronomists as essential to the <b>full</b> mechanization of <b>cultivation</b> and harvesting operations {{and the success of}} economic investment. Land levelling leads to a deep modification of the hill slopes, so it may produce serious damage to the environment if carried out {{in the absence of a}} carefully planned design. In other words, a design that takes the aspects of soil conservation into account, especially for steep hill slopes where the insite and offsite environmental impacts of soil erosion may be more pronounced. With regard to the areas involved, land levelling plays a key role on a national scale, one only needs to think of the vineyards planted on the country’s hill slopes, which in 1970 covered an area of 793, 000 hectares. Moreover, despite the continued reduction in areas planted with vines, from 1990 to 2002 the area devoted to DOC and DOCG wines increased by about 29 % and the average size of vineyards has also increased. This is a clear sign of the current trend, with the transition from the family model to the industrial model of orchard management, with extensive use of machinery and thus the use of bulldozers for levelling. The authorization topic, on which the standard of compliance is based, is analysed in detail. In summary we can say that, according to law, the permit required by the GAEC standard is currently mandatory only for those areas subject to the Hydrogeological constraint (Royal decree 30 December 1923 No. 3267) and for parks or other areas for which the regional regulations are more rigorous. Land levelling in other agricultural areas is excluded from the requirement to obtain prior authorization. Owners are only required to submit a DIA (statement of commencement of activity) to the Public Authority. However, permission is granted by law, in the event of lack of ruling by the Authority (implicit consent principle). This GAEC standard assumes that permission (where due) granted by the local authorities responsible for territorial governance is sufficient to avoid the damage that could be caused by land levelling. In other words, the standard does not dictate the agronomic rules to be followed in carrying out land levelling, but refers to already existing local rules and assumes that the authorization is granted on the basis of a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). At the present time, only a few local governments take land levelling into consideration in their territorial governance legislation. In general, there is no rule requiring that the application for authorization be accompanied by a project containing the items considered necessary, in the present study, to enable the authorities to express well-pondered judgment. In addition, local territorial rules do not require the execution of land levelling and subsequent approval of the finished work to be carried out under the supervision of a geologist or a pedologist. At present, the GAEC standard is very weak, due to the lack of coordination between the provisions of cross compliance and territorial governance legislation focused on land levelling. It is common practice for the landowner, after obtaining permission, to assign the work to an earthmoving company with no expertise in soil protection and which possibly also has an interest in moving large volumes of earth. This may contribute to an increase in severe environmental damage. Land levelling, undertaken by virtue of a simple DIA and lacking environmental expertise, is very risky and can cause severe damage to soil resources and the landscape. This is particularly true in areas prone to hydrogeological risk or where the soil is thin or fragile in relation to some of its qualities or environmental functions. The results of some researchers on Italian case studies have shown the extent to which land levelling undertaken disregarding the rules of environmental protection can cause serious disturbance to the soil resource, resulting in impressive truncation or burial of the original soil profile, with severe reduction in land capability, even to the extent of desertification. Results showed that there was a drop in production, especially in excavation areas. Furthermore, changes in the quality of products and a general decay in the vegetative state of plants and water stress were observed. In one case study, land levelling performed before planting a vineyard determined excavation and accumulation thicknesses respectively up to 19 and 16 metres. In another case study soil erosion after land levelling reached values of over 300 Mg ha- 1 (classified as catastrophic erosion). This value is far from the limits of a tolerable erosion of 6 - 11 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 currently internationally accepted. The proposals to update the GAEC standard are as follows: i) extension of the land levelling under authorization rule to include also land remodelling (light bulldozing following the removal of an old plantation, to prepare the land for a new plantation); ii) obligation to submit a geological and pedological feasibility study in order to obtain authorization...|$|R
