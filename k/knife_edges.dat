The ejector is a rectangular rod that pushes the completed slug from the mold aperture in the mold disk. As it emerges from the mold disk, the slug passes a set of <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> in the knife block, which trims off any small irregularities in the casting and produces a slug of exactly the desired width and height.

25|$|Generally, Noongar made {{a living}} by hunting and {{trapping}} a variety of game, including kangaroos, possums and wallabies; for {{people close to the}} coastal zone or riverine systems, spear-fishing or culling fish in traps was customary. An extensive range of edible wild plants were also available, including yams and wattle seeds. Nuts of the zamia palm, eaten during the Djeran season (April–May) required extensive treatment to remove its toxicity, and for women may have had a contraceptive effect. The forebears of the Noongar, as early as 10,000 BP, utilised quartz, replacing chert flint for spear and <b>knife</b> <b>edges,</b> when the chert deposit was submerged by sea level rise during the Flandrian transgression.|$|E

2500|$|Repsold-Bessel pendulum: It was {{time-consuming}} and error-prone to repeatedly swing the Kater's pendulum {{and adjust the}} weights until the periods were equal. [...] Friedrich Bessel showed in 1835 that this was unnecessary. [...] As long as the periods were close together, the gravity could be calculated from the two periods {{and the center of}} gravity of the pendulum. [...] So the reversible pendulum didn't need to be adjustable, it could just be a bar with two pivots. Bessel also showed that if the pendulum was made symmetrical in form about its center, but was weighted internally at one end, the errors due to air drag would cancel out. Further, another error due to the finite diameter of the <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> could be made to cancel out if they were interchanged between measurements. Bessel didn't construct such a pendulum, but in 1864 Adolf Repsold, under contract by the Swiss Geodetic Commission made a pendulum along these lines. [...] The Repsold pendulum was about 56cm long and had a period of about [...] second. It was used extensively by European geodetic agencies, and with the Kater pendulum in the Survey of India. Similar pendulums of this type were designed by Charles Pierce and C. Defforges.|$|E

40|$|Gamma-ray collimators {{in nuclear}} waste {{scanners}} {{are used for}} selecting a narrow vertical segment in activity measurements of waste vessels. The system {{that is used by}} NRG uses tapered slit collimators of both the single and double <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> type. The properties of these collimators were investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We found that single <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> collimators are highly preferable for a conservative estimate of the activity of the waste vessels. These collimators show much less dependence on the angle of incidence of the radiation than double <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> collimators. This conclusion also applies to cylindrical collimators of the single <b>knife</b> <b>edge</b> type, that are generally used in medical imaging spectroscopy...|$|R

50|$|While glass {{looks like}} an easy surface to keep clean, glass cutting boards can damage knives {{because of the high}} {{hardness}} of the material. Cutting on glass tends to dent, roll or even chip <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> in a rapid manner. Additionally, if used for chopping instead of slicing, glass can shatter or chip itself, contaminating food. They last for around 6 years.|$|E
50|$|Variations on {{the optical}} schlieren method include the {{replacement}} of the knife-edge by a coloured target, resulting in rainbow schlieren which can assist in visualising the flow. Different edge configurations such as concentric rings can also give sensitivity to variable gradient directions, and programmable digital edge generation has been demonstrated as well using digital displays and modulators. The adaptive optics pyramid wavefront sensor is a modified form of schlieren (having two perpendicular <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> formed by the vertices of a refracting square pyramid).|$|E

The S series uses a Zero-Resistance (ZR) double locking tremolo system from 2003 till 2014. The ZR tremolo system uses ball-bearings as opposed to <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> for pivot points and a built-in counter-tension system called the Zero Point System. The Zero Point System can be removed to change the tremolo to full-floating operation.The current line (2014) uses mainly Edge Zero ii systems, which are knife edge based.|$|E
5000|$|Glass knives can be {{produced}} by hand using pliers with two raised bumps on one jaw and a single bump between the two bumps on the opposing jaw, but special machines called [...] "knife-makers" [...] are used in most electron microscopy laboratories to ensure repeatable results. The glass used typically starts out as 1 in strips of 1/4 in plate glass, which is cut into 1 in squares. The glass square is then scored across the diagonal with a steel or tungsten carbide glass-cutting wheel to determine where the square will break, and pressure is then applied gradually across the opposite diagonal until the square breaks. This technique provides two usable <b>knife</b> <b>edges,</b> one {{on each of the}} two resulting triangles. The better the break is aligned with the diagonal, the better the cutting edge.|$|E

50|$|The {{smaller the}} angle between the blade and stone, the sharper the knife will be, but the less side force {{is needed to}} bend the edge over or chip it off. The angle between the blade and the stone is the edge angle - the angle from the {{vertical}} {{to one of the}} <b>knife</b> <b>edges,</b> and equals the angle at which the blade is held. The total angle {{from one side to the}} other is called the included angle - on a symmetric double-ground edge (a wedge shape), the angle from one edge to the other is thus twice the edge angle. Typical edge angles are about 20° (making the included angle 40° on a double-ground edge). The edge angle for very sharp knives can be as little as 10 degrees (for a 20° included angle). Knives that require a tough edge (such as those that chop) may sharpen at 25° or more.|$|E
5000|$|In the Riefler escapement, {{the energy}} {{required}} to keep the pendulum swinging is instead supplied by bending the short straight spring strip which suspends the pendulum. [...] The {{upper end of the}} suspension spring is not attached to a fixed support as in most clocks, but instead is attached to a heavy metal bearer, which pivots on two aligned knife-edges on its underside which rest on flat agate plates. The bending point of the suspension spring is in alignment with the line of contact of the knife-edges. When the pendulum passes its bottom point, the escape wheel is unlocked and pushes the bearer, and the bearer pivots suddenly on its <b>knife</b> <b>edges</b> by a small angle, flexing the spring. The spring is bent by a small amount in addition to that caused by the swing of the pendulum, and thus provides the impulse for the next swing. So the suspension spring is used for two functions: suspending the pendulum and giving it impulse.|$|E
