Whilst the First Minister usually undertakes a number of foreign and international visits to promote Scotland, international relations, European and Commonwealth relations are also included within the portfolios of both the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs (responsible for international development) and the Minister for International Development and Europe (responsible for European Union relations and international relations).|$|E

30|$|As a {{continuous}} variable, firm age was operationalized {{as the number}} of years the firm has been in existence (e.g., Rothaermel et al. 2006). A firm’s foreign market knowledge was measured through nine items drawn from Hadley and Wilson (2003) to manifest two dimensions: foreign institutional knowledge and <b>foreign</b> <b>business</b> knowledge. <b>Foreign</b> institutional knowledge was determined using four items, concerning the firm’s <b>foreign</b> language, <b>foreign</b> <b>business</b> laws, <b>foreign</b> <b>business</b> norms, and <b>foreign</b> <b>business</b> standards, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.86. <b>Foreign</b> <b>business</b> knowledge was derived from the five items: foreign competitors, <b>foreign</b> distribution channels, <b>business</b> contacts in <b>foreign</b> markets, foreign consumer needs and preference, and foreign sales developments. This dimension had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.85. To reflect the retail industry, <b>foreign</b> <b>business</b> standards and <b>foreign</b> sales development items were modified into <b>foreign</b> <b>business</b> regulations in retail industry and effective marketing in foreign markets. Nine items were measured by a 7 -point Likert-type scale with endpoints defined by “very low” (1) and “very high” (7). Three market commitment items with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.915 were adopted from Navarro et al. (2010): “The level of time and effort our firm’s management commits to international activity is,” “The level of financial resources committed to the international activity is,” and “The level of human resources committed to the international activity is” (1  = “very low” and 7  = “very high”).|$|R

The regional revolts of the late 1950s complicated events in Sumatra as many former rebels were forced to affiliate themselves with Communist organisations to prove their loyalty to the Indonesian Republic. The quelling of the 1950s revolts and 1965 killings were seen by most Sumatrans as a [...] "Javanese occupation".

2500|$|When Tubman was {{appointed}} to the Supreme Court in the 1930s, Liberia was seriously underdeveloped, lacking basic infrastructure of roads, railways, and sanitation systems. Tubman said that Liberia had never received the [...] "benefits of colonization," [...] which he meant to be the investment by a wealthy major power to develop the infrastructure of the country. He established an economic policy, known as the [...] "porte ouverte" [...] ("open door"), to attract foreign investment. Working to facilitate and encourage <b>foreign</b> <b>businesses</b> to locate in Liberia, he encouraged development. Between 1944 and 1970, the value of foreign investments, mainly from the United States, increased by 200%. From 1950 to 1960, Liberia experienced an average annual growth of 11.5%.|$|E

[...] Many of the hotels are operated or co-owned by <b>foreign</b> <b>businesses</b> like Meliá, Barceló, TRYP, etc. (France's Club Med {{used to have a}} property but has since left Varadero.) As international tourism was opened up, the local population expanded with the arrival of people, some in key economic positions, from other parts of Cuba. As a consequence, Varadero has lost much of its social and cultural life and its traditions. The central park, the cinema and various cultural meeting places were neglected in favor of a hotel-centred all-inclusive-tourism and finally closed. The International Carnival, an initiative of Cubans and foreigners started in the 1980s, also ceased.|$|E

In this study, we test hypotheses related to the {{composition of}} firms' <b>foreign</b> <b>business</b> relationships. First, we suggest that firms' characteristics matter for building a network of ties the foreign agents. Then, we consider the moderating effect {{of the degree of}} institutional development of the home country to assess to extent to which firms' <b>foreign</b> <b>business</b> relationships in transition economies are affected by the institutional development. We conduct a set of logistic regressions and one OLS regression to investigate the composition of firms' business relationships using firm-level data from 24 transition economies. The results indicate that firm size and membership in trade associations are good predictors of <b>foreign</b> <b>business</b> relationships – specifically, relationships with foreign investors, customers, and suppliers - and also of the diversity of foreign relationships. The country's institutional development radically changes which firms' characteristics matter in forming business relationships...|$|R

With Haile Giyorgis' removal from office by then-Regent Ras Tafari Makonnen in 1917, the post of negadras of Addis Ababa lost most of its powers to the office of Kantiba, the head of the municipal government, which had been created in 1910, with other towns later following suit.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994 the Cuban Government made {{it legal}} for its people to possess {{and use the}} US dollar. From then until 2004, the dollar came into {{widespread}} use in the country. To capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and remittances – estimated at $500–800 million annually – the government set up state-run [...] "dollar stores" [...] throughout Cuba that sold [...] "luxury" [...] food, household and clothing items, compared with basic necessities, which could be bought using the Cuban peso. As such, {{the standard of living}} diverged between those who had access to dollars and those without. Jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from <b>foreign</b> <b>businesses</b> and tourists became highly desirable. It was common to meet doctors, engineers, scientists and other professionals working in restaurants or as taxicab drivers.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, {{there were several}} serious {{barriers}} for <b>foreign</b> <b>businesses</b> attempting to operate in Cuba. Three separate pieces of legislation—the Joint Resolution of 1898, the Teller Amendment, and the Foraker Amendment—threatened foreign investment. The Joint Resolution of 1898 stated that the Cuban people are by right free and independent, while the Teller Amendment further declared that the United States could not annex Cuba. These two pieces of legislation were crucial in appeasing anti-imperialists as the United States intervened {{in the war in}} Cuba. Similarly, the Foraker Amendment, which prohibited the U.S. military government from granting concessions to American companies, was passed to appease anti-imperialists during the occupational period. Although these three statutes enabled the United States to gain a foothold in Cuba, they presented obstacles for American businesses to acquire land and permits. Eventually, Cornelius Van Horne of the Cuba Company, an early railroad company in Cuba, found a loophole in [...] "revocable permits" [...] justified by preexisting Spanish legislation that effectively allowed railroads to be built in Cuba. General Leonard Wood, the governor of Cuba and a noted annexationist, used this loophole to grant hundreds of franchises, permits, and other concessions to American businesses.|$|E

2500|$|During the Russian–Japanese talks, the Japanese {{historian}} Hirono Yoshihiko {{noted that}} [...] "once negotiations commenced between Japan and Russia, Russia scaled back it demands and claims regarding Korea bit by bit, making {{a series of}} concessions that Japan regarded as serious compromises on Russia's part". The might have been avoided had not the issues of Korea and Manchuria became linked. The Korean and Manchurian issues had become linked as the Prime Minister Katsura Tarō decided if war did come, that Japan {{was more likely to}} have the support of the United States and Great Britain if the war could be presented as a struggle for free trade against the highly protectionist Russian empire, in which case, Manchuria which was the larger market than Korea, was more likely to engage Anglo–American sympathies. Throughout the war, a recurring theme of Japanese propaganda was Japan was a [...] "civilized" [...] power that supported free trade and would implicitly [...] allow <b>foreign</b> <b>businesses</b> into the resource-rich region of Manchuria vs. Russia the [...] "uncivilized" [...] power that was protectionist and wanted to keep the riches of Manchuria all to itself. Emperor Gojong of Korea came to believe that the issue dividing Japan and Russia was Manchuria, and chose to pursue a policy of neutrality as the best way of preserving Korean independence as the crisis mounted. Hu Weide, the Chinese minister in St. Petersburg in a series of reports to Beijing looked closely at whatever a Russian or a Japanese victory would be favorable to China, and argued that the latter was more preferable, as he maintained a Japanese victory presented the better chance for China to regain sovereignty over Manchuria. In December 1903, China decided to remain neutral if war came, because though Japan was the only power capable of evicting Russia from Manchuria, the extent of Japanese ambitions in Manchuria was not clear in Beijing.|$|E
