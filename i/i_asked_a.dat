25|$|When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> {{friend who}} worked for Fat where they think the leak came from, they pinpointed it to one {{specific}} person from a specific magazine (again, not AP) who had been begging them to hear the record. Upon hearing this person's name, I realized that same person had been emailing and IMing me incessantly {{for the past few}} weeks about trying to write for AP...Once I found out the label was holding him responsible for the leak, I promptly wrote him and let him know that AP doesn't use writers who leak records, so I would not need his services.|$|E
2500|$|At 11:40p.m., on April 14, {{one of the}} ship's lookouts rang a bell {{to signal}} that an object lay {{directly}} in the ship's path. The vessel turned to avoid a collision, but the submerged portion of an iceberg gouged its bulkhead and bilges. In the confusion that followed, Wick was last seen {{on the deck of}} the sinking ocean liner, waving to relatives as they were helped into lifeboats. Caroline Bonnell, who boarded one of the first lifeboats dispatched from the ship, told reporters what happened later: [...] "There was a big wave. The sea was calm, otherwise, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> sailor what it was. He said, 'the Titanic has sunk!'" [...] Wick's body was never recovered.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me. [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went to my room, and found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying that as I had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
5000|$|Ex: [...] "I don't mean {{to bother}} you, but can <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> quick question?" ...|$|R
60|$|D.--I {{take the}} opinion of a person {{interested}} in the question: <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> fool.|$|R
5000|$|Sadistic Mika Band (1974), [...] "Time Machine ni Onegai" [...] (May <b>I</b> <b>Ask</b> <b>a</b> Favor, Time Machine).|$|R
6000|$|... "Where {{have you}} been?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked,</b> <b>a</b> strange misgiving {{stealing}} into my mind. [...] "Have you {{been talking to}} Mr. Ansell like this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|We reapproached each other, {{and when}} we were again under the lamp <b>I</b> <b>asked,</b> <b>a</b> little awkwardly, [...] "Are you in need of money, Tedham?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This last remark {{reminded}} me of the reports about the mother's [...] miserly nature, so <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> question that made the poor girl reply [...] quickly-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> question, doctor? <b>Is</b> she pining in {{this close}} place, too? When her sister comes, will her sister take her away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never {{mind what}} you suppose,' {{said the old}} man impatiently. 'Whenever <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> {{question}} of {{you tell me what you}} know, and no more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see very}} little to criticise," [...] I said, [...] "from your point of view; but I hope you won't think it indiscreet if <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> few questions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so very sorry," [...] she said, after a moment's startled silence. [...] "I {{am afraid}} that <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> tactless question, but how could I know?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> smart-looking {{sergeant}} of the Dublin Fusiliers, who was limping {{along with}} a broken foot, whether the regiment had been again heavily engaged. Of course they had.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, {{your whole}} party is safe?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked,</b> <b>a</b> little doubtingly; for I had {{actually}} given up all {{who had been}} in Herman Mordaunt's sleigh for lost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall I offend you," [...] she said, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> strange {{question}} before I go? I {{have a better}} motive, mind, than mere curiosity. Are you married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>ask?</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> loan? Frank, by this hand, {{under no}} {{circumstances}} would I accept a loan, though without asking pressed on me. The experience of China Aster might warn me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dr. Seward, may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> favour? <b>I</b> want to {{see your}} patient, Mr. Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary {{interests}} me so much!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was my turn}} to come to a {{standstill}} now. I tried vainly, in the gathering darkness, to see his face. In the surprise of the moment, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> little impatiently what he meant.|$|E
6000|$|At dinner <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> Negro waiter {{if there}} was {{anything}} doing in town. He pondered gravely for a minute, and then replied: [...] "Well, boss, I don't really reckon there's anything at all doin' after sundown." ...|$|E
6000|$|I thrust it hurriedly into my pocket, and ran back. As I {{passed through}} the gateway <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> peon to send Enriquez to me. The man stared. Did I not know that Don Enriquez had ridden away two minutes ago? ...|$|E
60|$|A slight {{exclamation from}} Kitty was {{followed}} by a blush, and a change of expression, that showed she was thinking, just at that moment, of anything but uncle Oloff. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>an</b> explanation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{that you}} need repent of," [...] I answered; [...] "nothing which is not {{easy for you to}} grant. May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> bold question? Suppose this house was mine instead of yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Winters, if my {{refusal to}} sign such a paper {{as you have}} demanded must entail upon me all that your {{language}} in this room fairly implies, then <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> few minutes for prayer." ...|$|R
6000|$|Marian looked incredulously at him. [...] "I am {{sure you}} are joking," [...] she said. [...] "Lord Carbury says you know ever {{so much more than}} he does. I suppose <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> stupid question. What are those reels of green silk for?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{bought two}} post cards and wrote {{them out of}} doors in the cold, livid twilight. Then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> soldier where was the post-office. He {{directed}} me. It was something like sending post cards from Skegness or Bognor, there in the post-office.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you not {{forgotten}} that evening yet?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked.</b> <b>A</b> transitory expression I {{did not quite}} comprehend became visible in the girl's face when she answered my smile. It was pleasant to think she recalled the evening of which I had {{not forgotten}} the smallest incident.|$|E
6000|$|And now <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> {{distinct}} {{answer to}} the question, Is it your purpose not to go into action again until the men now being drafted in the States are incorporated into the old regiments? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There--you wrote them! I {{have found}} it out! By God, I {{did not know it}} before, and <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> million pardons! That one there, the 'Old Times on the Mississippi,' is the best book you ever wrote!" ...|$|R
60|$|Steph. Hold! <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> truce; <b>I</b> and my viceroys (finding no food, and {{but a small}} {{remainder}} of brandy,) are come to treat a peace betwixt us, which may be {{for the good of}} both armies; therefore, Trincalo, disband.|$|R
60|$|But {{the canvas}} of my imagination, {{when it came}} to limning the Man About Town, was blank. I fancied that he had a {{detachable}} sneer (like the smile of the Cheshire cat) and attached cuffs; and that was all. Whereupon <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> newspaper reporter about him.|$|E
6000|$|... "What income," [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> {{resident}} in Alexandria, [...] "what income should an Englishman {{have to live}} here comfortably?" [...] "To live here comfortably, you should say ten thousand a year, and then let him cut his throat first!" [...] Such was my friend's reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "Doesn't it hurt," [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>a</b> {{lady who}} had been there, [...] "having oranges thrown at you? Which sort do they use, {{speaking}} generally, those fine juicy ones--Javas I think you call them--or the little hard brand with skins like a nutmeg-grater? And if both sorts are used indiscriminately, which do you personally prefer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{your own}} way, Dora, but in return oblige me by being {{agreeable}} to such persons as I may introduce to you; and some day, when <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> favor, remember how much I {{hope to do}} for you, and grant it cheerfully." ...|$|R
5000|$|... :Donâ€™t worry; {{when the}} time comes for farewells:I shall not cup your face within my hands:And kiss you until the stars fade in a glowing dawn:Nor will <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> fond embrace from you:To appease the solitary hours:Upon this earth when you are gone.|$|R
60|$|Troops were {{pouring in}} from the west and south, and pouring out toward the east. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>an</b> old slave who was {{sweeping}} the dirt into little piles in the gutters of the street where the soldiers were going. He looked at me in surprise.|$|R
