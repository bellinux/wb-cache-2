Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of her throws: and she inquired {{a great deal about}} you, how you were amused, and who were your partners. 'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to {{tell you all about it}} herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.'

I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling you of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus--so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!--Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since--Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?

These days farmers and farming communities affected by HIV/AIDS need to think not just about what their crops need but what the human body needs to cope with the stress of infection from serious diseases. Helen Khunga works with the Consortium for Agricultural and Nutrition, AIDS Reliance and Markets in Zambia. As she explained to Chris Kakunta, there is a lot that farmers can do to provide their families ? and their customers ? with {{a balanced}} diet. IN:	?When you talk of a? OUT:	?deterioration of the person. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 02 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Helen Khunga ending that report from Zambia. To prevent malnutrition, she recommends eating high energy foods such as pumpkins, body-building foods such as cowpeas and protective foods like spinach. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Khunga	When you talk of {{a balanced diet}} in the first place you should be mindful that you are looking at the three key elements in terms of the food crops. That is the energy-giving foods, the body-building foods and the protective foods, these are very key. We try and look at the combination of crops that we tell the farmers to grow that can be grown on smallscale and also large scale. Kakunta	Maybe we narrow down to those that are affected by HIV and AIDS, how can they ensure that they have a balanced diet? Khunga	We {{try to make sure that}} in the first place we will look at, do they have manpower in the household? If they have manpower we do try and help them by starting small and by starting small we mean can they afford to grow something in the backyard? If they are not able to even start small we start by giving them targeted food assistance and this is the package where we gave carbohydrate and protein to try and help them get at least the basic needs for the body. But for those that are completely incapacitated we try and see if they can be linked into other members of the community that can do food for work on behalf of those families that are completely incapacitated so that they can also afford to grow the crops that we recommend for people that are HIV positive or those that have HIV and AIDS. Kakunta	What about those that are ill but have the capacity, what type of foods <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> for them and maybe could you cite some examples so that as we go on we will be very clear as to what is required? Khunga	Ok for those that have the capacity normally we do recommend crops like cassava as energy-giving foods for example sorghum, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, they are easy to grow and normally they do not require fertilisers because we are looking at a group that might not have the resources to back up. And then also we would encourage them to grow body-building foods and in this category we are looking at groundnuts, soya beans and bambara nuts which they can grow easily again without the add on of artificial fertilisers. And among the protective foods we would encourage them to grow vegetables like spinach for example or any dark green vegetables that they have and also consumption of cassava leaves. Kakunta	And do you think this is a very balanced diet? Khunga	That is the energy-giving foods, the body-building foods and the protective foods. All the three critical food groups that are important for a balanced diet. Kakunta	Have you made some strides in as far as ensuring that your target audience have a balanced diet? Kunga	For example if I am going to give an example of a farmer who is incapacitated financially and they might not be able to have fertilisers I would recommend for example sorghum or pumpkins for their energy building foods which can easily grow without fertilisers. And for the body-building foods I would recommend them to grow cowpeas for example which is very easy to grow, the leaves can be used as protective foods while the peas can be used as body-building foods. So that combination even for a farmer that is incapacitated helps provide the family with a basic balanced diet that they need. Kakunta	How important is a balanced diet? Khunga	The balanced diet is very critical for somebody who is living with HIV and AIDS because one it will help them delay the onset of the disease. Kakunta	And without a balanced diet what will happen? Khunga	Definitely you are likely to go into micronutrient deficiency and eventually you might have malnutrition which causes a speedy deterioration of the person.
