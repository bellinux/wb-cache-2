50|$|The E1 protein {{helps the}} virus {{attach to the}} {{membrane}} of the targeted cell. In other <b>envelope</b> <b>virus</b> the E1 protein has a similar role in helping the virus get into the cell. As a heterodimer with E2 it has been discovered that {{it is essential for}} HCV entry. When the heterodimer is formed the hepatitis C virus is then able to bind to the receptor of the cell. As a heterodimer the E1 protein alone with the E2 protein worked together to enter the cell. Also cleavage at the core-E1 junction is a prerequisite for SPP-catalyzed cleavage. This helps the virus relocate to the surface of lipid droplets. Once the virus gets {{to the surface of the}} lipid droplets it recruits the virus no-structural proteins and replication complex. The SP-catalyzed cleavage at the core-E1 junction is required for the formation of infectious particles and for the release of any HCV particles. Also E1 has no function with budding at the ER membrane. It also had no effect on the intracellular formation of capsid-containing particles. Instead when E1 was not allowed to form this tended to facilitate the budding process.|$|E

This study describes an epidemiological assessment in Italians of antibodies against the intracellular mature virus (IMV) and extracellular <b>envelope</b> <b>virus</b> (EEV) forms of Vaccinia virus. Serum samples (n= 642) were taken in 1993 and 2003 from people between 11 and 102 years old. Most citizens> 27 years old were positive for antibodies to IMV and EEV.

40|$|Previous work {{indicated}} that vaccinia intracellular mature virus (IMV) utilizes microtubules {{to move from}} the viral factory to the site of intracellular envelopment and that expression of the viral A 27 protein is required for this transport. To investigate further the role of A 27 in IMV intracellular transport, a recombinant vaccinia virus was constructed that had the A 27 L gene deleted and expressed a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) -A 4 chimera in place of the normal A 4 protein. The resulting recombinant, vYFP-A 4 /ΔA 27, produced relatively normal quantities of virus in a one-step growth curve but had a small plaque phenotype. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that vYFP-A 4 /ΔA 27 was severely defective in <b>envelope</b> <b>virus</b> production. Despite the absence of A 27, live digital video fluorescent microscopy visualized YFP-labeled IMV movement in cells infected with the recombinant. Virion movement approached 3 μm/s and was sensitive to the microtubule depolymerizing drug nocodazole. In addition, IMV could be discerned transiting away from and back towards viral factories. Immunofluorescent staining determined that the distance traveled by A 27 -deficient virions was sufficient for transport to the site of envelopment. These results indicate that IMVs are capable of bidirectional movement on microtubules, suggesting that they are able to interact with both kinesin and dynein microtubule motors in the absence of A 27 and that the distance traveled is sufficient to deliver IMV to the site of wrapping...|$|E

The airn of the thesis was to analyze the rnorphogenetic stages and the virusinduced rnorphological changes in infected hurnan cells with three attenuated W rnutants (MVA, M 65 and MIOI), in cornparison with cells infected with the wild type virus, strain WR. A detail transrnission electron rnicroscopy (EM) analysis of hurnan HeLa cells showed irnportant differences in fine uitraestructure and arnounts of the viral intermediates cornpared to wild type WR-infected cells. The EM studies revealed that there are distinct changes in the rnorphogenetic process for al 1 of the attenuated rnutants. New intermediate viral forms {{were found between the}} IV (irnrnature virus) and the IMV (intracellular rnature virus) forms, representing transition stages with the core still in the assernbling process. The rnorphogenesis of MVA was largely blocked at the IV stage, but few rnature forms were obsewed and the IMVs produced acquired a more munded shape than WR. These "IMVs" have an abnormal interna 1 structure (referred as "atypical viruses") with potential alterations in the interactions core-envelope, and are unable to significantly acquire the additional double envelope to render intracellular <b>envelope</b> <b>virus</b> (IEVs). In the case of rnutants M 65 an MlOl, virus rnorphogenesis was interrupted at later stages, forming lMVs that accurnulate within the cell but do not progress to form extracellular enveloped virus (EEV). Analyses of viral proteins in the rnutants showed alterations in sorne of the structural proteins with roles in the rnorphogenetic pathway. Confocal rnicroscopy revealed that the rnutants produced a srnall plaque-size phenotype with rnicrocornets and absence of cell lysis. While WR induces actin polyrnerization forming characteristic coiled tails, the rnutants do not produce actin tails and do not exit the cell. Moreover, the rnutants produced rnorphological and biochernical changes to the cells, compatible with an epithelial to rnesenchyrnal transition (EMT), possibly to facilitate spreading of the virus between cells.

A premature translation termination codon was introduced in the gH gene by linker insertion mutagenesis, and a mutant virus was rescued by using a cell line that expresses the wild-type protein. Mutant virus isolated from complementing cells was unable to form plaques on noncomplementing cells, indicating that gH is essential in the life cycle of the virus. Immunological staining and electron microscopy showed that the mutant virus produced noninfectious progeny and was unable to spread from infected to uninfected cells by cell-cell fusion. Thus, similar to gH of herpes simplex virus, gH of pseudorabies virus is required for entry and cell-to-cell spread. Entry of herpesviruses into host cells results from fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular plasma membrane. This process is mediated by a number of glycoproteins that are located in the <b>virus</b> <b>envelope</b> (33).
