40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether metabolic syndrome (MetS) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> in the general Korean population. A total of 16, 554 participants were included in this study. MetS was defined using the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 or a dipstick proteinuria result of ≥ 1 +. The <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> were measured at 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz. Low-frequency (Freq) was defined as pure-tone averages at 0. 5 and 1 kHz, while Mid-Freq and High-Freq were defined as the average thresholds at mid-frequency (2 and 3 kHz) and high frequency (4 and 6 kHz), respectively. In men, the <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> were 15. 1 ± 14. 5 dB, 22. 2 ± 21. 3 dB, and 37. 3 ± 26. 5 dB for Low-, Mid-, and High-Freq, respectively. In women, the <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> were 14. 9 ± 15. 3 dB, 16. 6 ± 18. 0 dB, and 26. 1 ± 21. 5 dB for Low-, Mid-, and High-Freq, respectively. The <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> for men were significantly higher than the <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> for women in all 3 threshold categories. Male and female subjects with MetS or CKD had higher <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> than the subjects that did not have these disorders. In the multivariate analysis, MetS was associated with increased <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> in women, and CKD was associated with increased <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> in men and women.

40|$|Purpose: The vast {{majority}} of previous studies {{suggest that there is}} no relationship between the acceptable noise level (ANL) and pure-tone <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> reported as the average pure-tone <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> (pure-tone average).

This study investigated the relationship between behavioral <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> in children with a history of jaundice and the maximum level of bilirubin concentration in the blood.   Materials and Methods: This study was performed on 18 children with a mean age of 5. 6 years and with a history of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Behavioral <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds,</b> transient evoked emissions and brainstem evoked responses were evaluated in all children.   Results: Six children (33. 3 %) had normal <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> and the remaining (66. 7 %) had some degree of hearing loss.

In this study, our goal was to estimate the prevalence of hearing loss in the Korean population and to investigate the factors related to <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> in adolescents. A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) between 2010 and 2012. We enrolled a total of 1, 658 participants, ages 13 to 18 years. We investigated the prevalence of hearing loss and the factors associated with <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> at various frequencies (0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 KHz). Weighted prevalence of unilateral and bilateral hearing loss in Korean adolescents was 2. 2 % and 0. 4 %, respectively. Weighted prevalence of <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> ≥ 20 dB at speech and high frequencies were 3. 1 % and 5. 0 %, respectively, for unilateral hearing loss and 0. 7 % and 1. 9 %, respectively, for bilateral.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{the distribution of}} pure-tone <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> of a Caucasian population living {{in the south of}} France aged 70 years and older. To establish age- and sex-adjusted normative <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> based on results of subjects free of noise and ototoxic drug exposure and to compare them with <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> of exposed (E) subjects. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a longitudinal epidemiologic cohort study. SETTING: Montpellier suburb, south of France. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 778 subjects 70 years old and older were examined. Noise exposure, ototoxic medication use, and medical history were collected. <b>Hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> were obtained via pure-tone audiometry. After excluding patients with ear-related disease, 659 subjects were further analyzed (270 men and 389 women). Noise or ototoxic medication exposure was found in 364 subjects (E subjects), whereas 295 had no exposure (nonexposed [NE] subjects). METHODS: Median pure-tone thresholds, lower deviation, and upper deviation were calculated for the NE subjects with a statistical method similar to the ISO 7029 norm and were compared with thresholds of E subjects. RESULTS: <b>Hearing</b> <b>thresholds,</b> especially in high frequencies, increased with age more for women than for men.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the hearing profile of a group of gold miners with and without TB to determine the effect of TB and its associated risk profile on hearing. Workers in AngloGold Ashanti mine in South Africa were recruited due to the fact that they present with these two health threats namely NIHL and TB. The audiological and medical surveillance data of 2698 subjects (between the years 2001 and 2009) were used in analyses. <b>Hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the air conduction frequencies (0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 KHz) in both ears were analysed in conjunction with biographic and occupational data. Subjects were divided into three groups, two experimental groups (Single TB treatment, n= 911 and Multiple TB treatment, n= 376) and one control group (n= 1411). A highly significant difference (p< 0. 01) was noted between the control group and both TB treatment groups across most frequencies and hearing parameters analysed, although the higher frequencies were more affected. Pair wise comparisons revealed the largest differences in <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> throughout between the control group and the multiple TB treatment groups. The smallest differences in <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> were evident between the two TB groups with the multiple TB treatment group presenting with the poorest thresholds. TB and its related risk profile had a pronounced influence on the decline of <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Thresholds for the multiple TB treatment group indicated more deterioration than the <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> of the single TB treatment group.

40|$|OBJECTIVES : To {{compare the}} hearing of gold miners {{with and without}} {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{to determine the effect}} of TB and its associated risk profile on hearing. METHODS : Audiological and medical surveillance data of 2698 South African gold miners for 2001 - 2009 were analysed in a retrospective cohort design. <b>Hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the air conduction frequencies (0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 kHz) in both ears were analysed together with biographical and occupational data. Subjects were divided into two experimental (single TB treatment, n= 911 and multiple TB treatment, n= 376) and one control group (n= 1411). Comparisons between groups included (1) change from baseline to most recent audiogram, (2) most recent <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> and (3) most recent thresholds in a subset of noise exposed and unexposed groups. RESULTS : <b>Hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the TB groups were significantly (p< 0. 01) elevated compared to the control group, after correcting for time between baseline and most recent audiogram, threshold at baseline and age at test. Pair-wise comparisons demonstrated the largest threshold differences between the control and multiple TB group. Changes in mean thresholds across TB treatment groups were independent of noise exposure. <b>Hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> over time also deteriorated significantly more (p< 0. 01) in workers with TB (single and multiple treatment) than in workers without TB. CONCLUSION : Gold miners with TB, especially with more than one episode of TB, demonstrate significantly poorer <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> and more pronounced decline in hearing over time independent of noise exposure.

40|$|Background Hearing loss (HL) is a {{well-known}} feature of Fabry disease (FD). Its presence and characteristics have mainly been studied in adult patients, while only limited data {{are available on the}} presence and degree of HL in children with FD. This prompted us to study hearing sensitivity in pediatric FD patients. Methods All available audiograms of the Dutch and Norwegian children with FD were retrospectively collected. First, hearing sensitivity was determined by studying <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> at low, high, and ultra-high frequencies in children with FD and comparing them to zero dB HL, i. e., healthy children. In addition, the presence and type of slight/mild HL (defined as <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> at low frequencies of 25 - 40 dB HL) and moderate to severe HL (<b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> > 40 dB HL) at first visit were analyzed. If available, follow-up data were used to estimate the natural course of hearing sensitivity and HL in children with FD. Results One-hundred-thirteen audiograms of 47 children with FD (20 boys, median age at first audiogram 12. 0 (range 5. 1 - 18. 0) years) were analyzed. At baseline, slight/mild or moderate to severe HL was present in three children (6. 4 %, 2 boys). Follow-up measurements showed that three additional children developed HL before the age of 18. Of these six children, five had sensorineural HL, most likely caused by FD. Compared to healthy children (zero dB HL), FD children showed increased <b>hearing</b> <b>thresholds</b> at all frequencies (p 8 kHz).
