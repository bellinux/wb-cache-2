5000|$|The term fine <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> {{typically}} {{refers to}} screws with threads from 40-100 TPI (Threads Per Inch) (0.5mm to 0.2mm pitch) and ultra fine <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> {{has been used}} to refer to 100-508 TPI (0.2 mm to 0.05 mm pitch). Even though these are non-standard threads, both ISO metric screw thread designations and UNC designations have been used to call out thread dimensions and fit (class). A typical use for a fine <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> is in an optical mirror mount as an adjuster. Typically 80 TPI screws are used in mirror mounts. [...] Ultra fine adjuster screws are used in applications requiring extremely fine motion like laser alignment, fiber coupling.|$|R

50|$|The user is able {{to adjust}} {{pressure}} easily and rapidly to the exact degree needed for any given plate. One would bring the upper roll down to the plate by turning a single <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw.</b> The roll automatically reaches a perfect parallel position with the plate (blanket) surface. Then two end <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws</b> would be turned down to meet {{the top of the}} roll's bearing blocks. If the user needed to add pressure {{on one end of the}} roll, he could simply turn the appropriate <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw.</b> The user {{is able to}} release or reapply pressure at any time (without changing pressure adjustment) by merely raising or lowering a lever. This eliminates problems such as starting or removing paper or felts that do not run out completely from between the rolls.|$|R

50|$|A six-DOF NSM {{isolator}} typically uses three isolators {{stacked in}} series: a tilt-motion isolator {{on top of}} a horizontal-motion isolator {{on top of a}} vertical-motion isolator. Figure 3 shows a schematic of a vibration isolation system consisting of a weighted platform supported by a single six-DOF isolator incorporating the isolators of Figures 1 and 2. Flexures are used in place of the hinged bars shown in Figure 1. A tilt flexure serves as the tilt-motion isolator. A vertical-stiffness <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> is used to adjust the compression force on the negative-stiffness flexures thereby changing the vertical stiffness. A vertical load <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> is used to adjust for varying weight loads by raising or lowering the base of the support spring to keep the flexures in their straight, unbent operating positions.|$|R

50|$|Some mass-market {{car engines}} from the 1960s {{replaced}} the rocker-end <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> with a non-adjustable rocker pivoted on a central stud with a hemispherical nut. Tappet adjustment {{was made by}} moving the pivot nut up and down. Some of these designs also required the tappet clearance to be set with the engine running. As this rapidly wore out feeler gauges, long rolls of disposable feeler strip were needed instead.|$|R
5000|$|An {{issue with}} the unit was the bridge itself, which Leo Fender over-engineered. The six {{individual}} bridge saddles were multi-grooved [...] "barrels". The individual barrels were not grooved deeply enough for secure holding of the strings in heavy pick attack, and each barrel had a tiny <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> at each end. Adding the intonation <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws,</b> and the screws {{at each end of}} the bridge saddle to raise or lower the bridge as a whole, gave the bridge twenty separate adjustment possibilities. The great majority of players found this much too [...] "fiddly", and, adding the tendency of the strings to jump out of their individual saddles in aggressive playing, the overall reception was rather lukewarm for what was essentially an excellent [...] - [...] but over-engineered [...] - [...] design. Later, many players of the Jazzmaster and Jaguar found that the bridge on these instruments could be replaced with no retrofitting by the standard bridge from the Fender Mustang (below), which eliminated several of the worst problems with the original bridge.|$|R

50|$|The Gyromax is {{the trade}} name for an {{adjustable}} mass (or adjustable inertia) balance wheel used in Patek Philippe wristwatches. Instead of weight <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws</b> {{on the outside}} of the rim, as in traditional balances, the Gyromax has turnable weights recessed into the top of the rim. The advantages claimed for this design are that, without projecting weight screws, the diameter of the balance can be increased, giving it a larger moment of inertia, and that it has less air resistance.|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a welding nozzle position manipulator. The manipulator consists of an angle support to which the remaining components of the device are attached either directly or indirectly. A pair of pivotal connections attach a weld nozzle holding link to the angle support and provide a two axis freedom of movement of the holding link {{with respect to the}} support angle. The manipulator is actuated by a pair of adjusting screws angularly mounted to the angle support. These screws contact a pair of tapered friction surfaces formed on the upper portion of the welding nozzle holding link. A spring positioned between the upper portions of the support angle and the holding link provides a constant bias engagement between the friction surfaces of the holding link and the <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws,</b> so as to firmly hold the link in position and to eliminate any free play in the adjustment mechanism. The angular relationships between the <b>adjustment</b> <b>screws,</b> the angle support and the tapered friction surfaces of the weld nozzle holding link provide a geometric arrangement which permits precision adjustment of the holding link with respect to the angle support and also provides a solid holding link mount which is resistant to movement from outside forces...|$|R
50|$|When {{the wind}} turbine nacelle is {{positioned}} on {{the tower and}} the yaw bearing assembly is completed {{it is necessary to}} adjust the pressure on the individual gliding pads of the bearing. This is necessary in order to avoid un-even wear of the gliding pads and excessive loading on some sectors of the yaw bearing. In order to achieve that, an adjustment mechanism is necessary, which enables the technicians to adjust the contact pressure of each individual gliding element in a controllable and secure way. The most common solution is the utilization of bottom bearing plates equipped with large opening, which accommodate the adjustable gliding bearing systems. These adjustable gliding bearings comprise a gliding unit (i.e. gliding pad) and an adjustable pressure distribution plate. In between the gliding pad and the pressure plate several spring (pre-tension) elements are located. The vertical position of the pressure plates is usually controlled by an <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw.</b> This <b>adjustment</b> <b>screw</b> presses against the pressure plate while being retained by a counter-pressure support plate, fixed on the bearing assembly with strong bolts. In this way it is possible to apply various levels of contact pressure among the different gliding pads and therefore to ensure that each gliding component of the yaw bearing arrangement is performing as anticipated.|$|R
