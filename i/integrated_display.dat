25|$|Much of this {{equipment}} {{can be controlled}} from the wheelhouse or bridge. Smaller trawlers have wheelhouses, where electronic equipment for navigation, communications, fish detection and trawl sensors are typically arranged about the skipper's chair. Larger vessels have a bridge, with a command console at the centre and a further co-pilot chair. Modern consoles display all the key information on an <b>integrated</b> <b>display.</b> Less frequently used sensors and monitors may be mounted on the deckhead.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Lynx's {{components}} {{had been}} derived from earlier Westland helicopters {{such as the}} Scout and Wasp. The Lynx has been substantially upgraded since originally entering service in the 1970s; improvements made to in-service aircraft have typically included strengthened airframes, new avionics and engines, improved rotor blades, additional surveillance and communications systems. Various subsystems from overseas suppliers have been incorporated into some Lynx variants; during a South Korean procurement, hulls produced in the United Kingdom were equipped with Korean-built systems, such as ISTAR, electro-optical, electronic warfare, fire-control systems, flight control actuators, and undercarriages. A glass cockpit was adopted on the Super Lynx 300, featuring fully integrated flight and mission display systems, a variety of <b>integrated</b> <b>display</b> units including head-up displays, and dual controls; AgustaWestland has commented that the new cockpit reduces aircrew workload and increases aircraft effectiveness. The head-up display installed could {{be replaced by a}} helmet-mounted sight system on customer demand.|$|E

Subjects controlled a simulated system using a conventional display console or one of two <b>integrated</b> <b>displays.</b> The effects of display type on operator performance were considered. <b>Integrated</b> <b>displays</b> tended to degrade performance unless the display preprocessed information, synthesizing and presenting it in a form more compatible with an operator's high-level information needs...|$|R
25|$|Various {{avionics}} and onboard {{systems are}} integrated on the Lynx {{in order to}} perform differing mission profiles. Several operators have equipped their Lynx with BAE Systems' Sea Spray surveillance radar to provide for a surface search capability, which is used in maritime patrol, search and rescue, and other mission profiles. British Army models are equipped with a Marconi Elliot automatic flight control system capable of performing automatic three axes stabilisation. The integration of both avionics and weapons systems is customized upon each Lynx batch to customer specifications and requirements. Most of the installed sensors and avionics are typically integrated with the aircraft's avionics management system (AMS), from {{where they can be}} managed by either pilot; sensors such the optional nose-mounted FLIR can be set up to directly cue the weapon systems. Functions such as navigation and communications are also tied into the AMS, information from these systems are displayed directly to the pilots on interchangeable <b>integrated</b> <b>display</b> units in the cockpit. The Lynx is considerably easier to service and maintain than the AgustaWestland Apache.|$|E

25|$|Early {{oscilloscopes}} used {{cathode ray}} tubes (CRTs) as their display element (hence they were {{commonly referred to}} as CROs) and linear amplifiers for signal processing. Storage oscilloscopes used special storage CRTs to maintain a steady display of a single brief signal. CROs were later largely superseded by digital storage oscilloscopes (DSOs) with thin panel displays, fast analog-to-digital converters and digital signal processors. DSOs without <b>integrated</b> <b>displays</b> (sometimes known as digitisers) are available at lower cost and use a general-purpose digital computer to process and display waveforms.|$|R
