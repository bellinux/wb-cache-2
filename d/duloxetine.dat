5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is useful to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a mood stabilizer in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit. Bupropion has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may be useful in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of <b>duloxetine</b> (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Duloxetine</b> was {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of major depression in 2004. While <b>duloxetine</b> has demonstrated improvement in depression-related symptoms compared to placebo, comparisons of <b>duloxetine</b> to other antidepressant medications have been less successful. A 2012 Cochrane Review did not find greater efficacy of <b>duloxetine</b> compared to SSRIs and newer antidepressants. Additionally, the review found evidence that <b>duloxetine</b> has increased side effects and reduced tolerability compared to other antidepressants. It thus did not recommend <b>duloxetine</b> as a first line treatment for major depressive disorder, given the (then) high cost of <b>duloxetine</b> compared to inexpensive off-patent antidepressants and lack of increased efficacy. Generic <b>duloxetine</b> became available in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Hypersensitivity: <b>duloxetine</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with a known hypersensitivity to <b>duloxetine</b> {{or any of the}} inactive ingredients.|$|E
25|$|The {{comparative}} {{efficacy of}} <b>duloxetine</b> and established pain-relief medications for DPN is unclear. A systematic review noted that tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine and amitriptyline), traditional anticonvulsants and opioids have better efficacy than <b>duloxetine.</b> <b>Duloxetine,</b> tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants have similar tolerability while the opioids caused more side effects. Another review in Prescrire International considered the moderate pain relief achieved with <b>duloxetine</b> to be clinically insignificant {{and the results}} of the clinical trials unconvincing. The reviewer saw no reason to prescribe <b>duloxetine</b> in practice. The comparative data collected by reviewers in BMC Neurology indicated that amitriptyline, other tricyclic antidepressants and venlafaxine may be more effective. However, the authors noted that the evidence in favor of <b>duloxetine</b> is much more solid. A Cochrane review concluded that the evidence in support of duloxetine's efficacy in treating painful diabetic neuropathy was adequate, and that further trials should focus on comparisons with other medications.|$|E
25|$|After the {{manufacturing}} issues were resolved, the liver toxicity warning {{included in the}} prescribing information, and the follow-up studies showed that <b>duloxetine</b> does not cause QTc interval prolongation, <b>duloxetine</b> {{was approved by the}} FDA for depression and diabetic neuropathy in 2004. In 2007, Health Canada approved <b>duloxetine</b> for the treatment of depression and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Duloxetine</b> is more {{effective}} than placebo in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Major guidelines such as Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines, and Canadian Psychiatric Association Guidelines do not list <b>duloxetine</b> among the recommended treatment options. However, a review from the Annals of Internal Medicine lists <b>duloxetine</b> among the first line drug treatments, along with citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, and venlafaxine.|$|E
25|$|Elimination: <b>Duloxetine</b> has an {{elimination}} half-life {{of about}} 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state is usually achieved after 3 days. Only trace amounts (<1%) of unchanged <b>duloxetine</b> {{are present in}} the urine and most of the dose (approx. 70%) appears in the urine as metabolites of <b>duloxetine</b> with about 20% excreted in the feces.|$|E
25|$|Absorption: <b>Duloxetine</b> is acid labile, and is {{formulated}} with {{enteric coating}} to prevent degradation in the stomach. <b>Duloxetine</b> has good oral bioavailability, averaging 50% after one 60mg dose. There is an average 2-hour lag until absorption begins with maximum plasma concentrations occurring about 6 hours post dose. Food {{does not affect}} the Cmax of <b>duloxetine,</b> but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours.|$|E
25|$|Major {{depressive}} {{disorder is}} believed to be due in part to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines within the central nervous system. Antidepressants including ones with a similar mechanism of action as <b>duloxetine,</b> i.e. serotonin metabolism inhibition, cause a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine activity and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines; this mechanism may apply to <b>duloxetine</b> in its effect on depression but research on cytokines specific to <b>duloxetine</b> therapy is lacking.|$|E
25|$|<b>Duloxetine</b> and {{thioridazine}} {{should not}} be co-administered.|$|E
25|$|The first generic <b>duloxetine</b> was marketed by Dr. Reddy.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} on SSRIs and SNRIs {{that look}} at partial response (defined {{as at least}} a 50% reduction in depression score from baseline) found that sertraline, paroxetine and <b>duloxetine</b> were better than placebo. With respect to safety <b>duloxetine</b> and venlafaxine increased worsened dizziness, however not much safety data was reported.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 Cochrane review {{concluded}} that <b>duloxetine</b> is beneficial {{in the treatment}} of diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia but that more comparative studies with other medicines are needed. The French medical journal Prescrire {{concluded that}} <b>duloxetine</b> is no better than other available agents and has a greater risk of side effects. Thus they recommend against its general use.|$|E
25|$|The FDA {{approved}} <b>duloxetine</b> for {{the treatment}} of generalized anxiety disorder in February 2007.|$|E
25|$|Metabolism: <b>Duloxetine</b> {{undergoes}} predominately hepatic metabolism via two cytochrome P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Circulating metabolites are pharmacologically inactive.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} <b>duloxetine</b> {{found that it}} reduced pain and fatigue, and {{improved}} physical and mental performance compared to placebo.|$|E
25|$|The main uses of <b>duloxetine</b> are {{in major}} {{depressive}} disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, neuropathic pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and fibromyalgia.|$|E
25|$|Distribution: <b>Duloxetine</b> {{is highly}} bound (>90%) to {{proteins}} in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. Volume of distribution is 1640L.|$|E
25|$|The {{safety and}} utility of <b>duloxetine</b> in the {{treatment}} of incontinence has been evaluated in a series of meta analyses and practice guidelines.|$|E
25|$|Some doctors may {{prescribe}} venlafaxine {{off label}} {{for the treatment}} of diabetic neuropathy (in a similar manner to <b>duloxetine)</b> and migraine prophylaxis (in some people, however, venlafaxine can exacerbate or cause migraines). Studies have shown venlafaxine's effectiveness for these conditions, although agents that are marketed for this purpose (like pregabalin or <b>duloxetine)</b> are likely preferred. It has also been found to reduce the severity of 'hot flashes' in menopausal women and men on hormonal therapy {{for the treatment of}} prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Duloxetine,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Cymbalta among others, is a {{medication}} mostly used for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|On November 4, 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} <b>duloxetine</b> {{to treat}} chronic musculoskeletal pain, including discomfort from osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the other}} SNRIs listed here <b>duloxetine</b> {{does not cause}} dose-dependent {{hypertension}} as a common adverse effect. Used to relieve neuropathic pain too. More hepatotoxic than most other antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|The {{analgesic}} {{properties of}} <b>duloxetine</b> {{in the treatment}} of diabetic neuropathy and central pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia are believed to be due to sodium ion channel blockade.|$|E
25|$|Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have {{approved}} pregabalin and <b>duloxetine,</b> {{for the management}} of fibromyalgia. The FDA also approved milnacipran, but the European Medicines Agency refused marketing authority.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of Cymbalta (<b>duloxetine)</b> and Lyrica (pregabalin) has also {{proven to be}} useful in controlling pain, but many EM patients have found this combination has side effects that {{they are unable to}} tolerate.|$|E
25|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) acting drugs: given the primary CNS effects of <b>duloxetine,</b> {{it should be}} used with caution when it is taken in {{combination}} with or substituted for other centrally acting drugs, including those with a similar mechanism of action.|$|E
25|$|<b>Duloxetine</b> {{failed to}} receive US {{approval}} for {{stress urinary incontinence}} amid concerns over liver toxicity and suicidal events; however, it was approved for this use in the UK, where it is recommended as an add-on medication in stress urinary incontinence instead of surgery.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{meta-analysis}} {{concluded that}} <b>duloxetine</b> decreased incontinence episodes more than placebo with people about 56% {{more likely than}} placebo to experience a 50% decrease in episodes. Adverse effects were experienced by 83% of duloxetine-treated subjects and by 45% of placebo-treated subjects.|$|E
25|$|Methylene blue is a {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), and if infused intravenously at doses exceeding 5mg/kg, may precipitate serious serotonin toxicity, serotonin syndrome, if combined with any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., <b>duloxetine,</b> sibutramine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, imipramine).|$|E
25|$|Dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as <b>duloxetine,</b> venlafaxine, and milnacipran, {{as well as}} {{tricyclic}} antidepressants such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine {{are considered}} first-line medications for this condition. While amitriptyline and desipramine {{have been used as}} first-line treatments, the quality of evidence to support their use is poor.|$|E
25|$|It {{can take}} up to three months to derive benefit from the {{antidepressant}} amitriptyline and between three and six months to gain the maximal response from <b>duloxetine,</b> milnacipran, and pregabalin. Some medications have the potential to cause withdrawal symptoms when stopping so gradual discontinuation may be warranted particularly for antidepressants and pregabalin.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{review and}} {{practice}} guideline {{published by the}} European Association of Urology concluded that the clinical trial data provides Grade 1a evidence that <b>duloxetine</b> improves but does not cure urinary incontinence, and that it causes {{a high rate of}} gastrointestinal side effects (mainly nausea and vomiting) leading to a high rate of treatment discontinuation.|$|E
25|$|When discontinuing {{treatment}} with <b>duloxetine,</b> the manufacturer recommends a gradual {{reduction in the}} dose, rather than abrupt cessation, whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following {{a decrease in the}} dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.|$|E
25|$|Reported {{adverse events}} which were {{temporally}} correlated to <b>duloxetine</b> therapy include rash, reported rarely, {{and the following}} adverse events, reported very rarely: alanine aminotransferase increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, anaphylactic reaction, angioneurotic edema, aspartate aminotransferase increased, bilirubin increased, glaucoma, hepatotoxicity, hyponatremia, jaundice, orthostatic hypotension (especially at the initiation of treatment), Stevens–Johnson syndrome, syncope (especially at initiation of treatment), and urticaria.|$|E
25|$|During {{marketing}} of other SSRIs and SNRIs, {{there have been}} spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as brain zap electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. The withdrawal syndrome from <b>duloxetine</b> resembles the SSRI discontinuation syndrome.|$|E
