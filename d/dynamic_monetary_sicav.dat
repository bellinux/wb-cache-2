30|$|Finally, let us {{note that}} in the literature, {{traditionally}} the dynamic risk measures are monotone decreasing. On the other hand, the measures of performance are monotone increasing. In view of condition 2) in Definition 1, whenever our LM-measure corresponds to a dynamic risk measure, {{it needs to be}} understood as the negative of that risk measure. In such cases, in order to avoid confusion, we refer to the respective LM-measure as to <b>dynamic</b> (<b>monetary)</b> utility measure rather than as <b>dynamic</b> (<b>monetary)</b> risk measure. See Appendix “Dynamic LM-measures” for details.|$|R

Sufficient conditions for the Bellman principle {{and the existence of}} optimal stopping times are provided. Particular attention is payed to representations which allow for a numerical treatment in real situations. To this aim, generalizations of standard evaluation methods like policy iteration, dual and consumption based approaches are developed in the context of general <b>dynamic</b> <b>monetary</b> utility functionals. As a result, {{it turns out that the}} possibility of a particular generalization depends on specific properties of the utility functional under consideration. monetary utility functionals, optimal stopping, duality, policy iteration...|$|R

40|$|We study <b>dynamic</b> <b>monetary</b> risk {{measures}} {{that depend on}} bounded discrete-time processes describing the evolution of financial values. The time horizon can be finite or infinite. We call a dynamic risk measure time-consistent if it assigns to a process of financial values the same risk irrespective of whether it is calculated directly or in two steps backwards in time. We show that this condition translates into a decomposition property for the corresponding acceptance sets, and we demonstrate how time-consistent <b>dynamic</b> <b>monetary</b> risk measures can be constructed by pasting together one-period risk measures. For conditional coherent and convex monetary risk measures, we provide dual representations of Legendre–Fenchel type based on linear functionals induced by adapted increasing processes of integrable variation. Then we give dual characterizations of time-consistency for dynamic coherent and convex monetary risk measures. To this end, we introduce a concatenation operation for adapted increasing processes of integrable variation, which generalizes the pasting of probability measures. In the coherent case, time-consistency corresponds to stability under concatenation in the dual. For <b>dynamic</b> convex <b>monetary</b> risk measures, the dual characterization of time-consistency generalizes to a condition on the family of convex conjugates of the conditional risk measures at different times. The theoretical results are applied by discussing the time-consistency of various specific examples of <b>dynamic</b> <b>monetary</b> risk {{measures that}} depend on bounded discrete-time processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a category that represents varying risk {{as well as}} ambiguity. We give a generalized conditional expectation as a presheaf for this category, which not only works as a traditional conditional expectation given a σ-field but also is compatible with change of measure. Then, we reformulate <b>dynamic</b> <b>monetary</b> value measures as a presheaf for the category. We show how some axioms of <b>dynamic</b> <b>monetary</b> value measures in the classical setting are deduced as theorems in the new formulation, which {{is evidence that the}} axioms are correct.

The third was the recent developments in <b>dynamic</b> <b>monetary</b> general-equilibrium models.
