500|$|The box set {{received}} mixed critical reception; R.L. Shaffer of IGN {{was critical}} {{in his review}} of it, calling the release was [...] "a complete waste" [...] and the bonus disc [...] "roughly 80 minutes of mediocre entertainment". He recommended fans purchase [...] "the shows you like instead, and start in the proper place, with the first season." [...] He ultimately gave the release an eight out of ten, however, stating [...] "while this set is certainly well rated" [...] in its content, he could not [...] "find a reason to recommend it". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club expressed confusion over the selection of material, suggesting to the network to release a [...] "straight-up Adult Swim best-of set with rarities". DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire felt the set was not [...] "good enough to warrant you re-buying them all", should buyers already own all six season volume releases. He gave the release an 85 out of 100, remarking the pilots as showing [...] "just <b>how</b> <b>tough</b> <b>it</b> must be to create a pilot, one that not only introduces characters and settings, but also promises a potential for weeks and perhaps years of additional stories." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn {{was solid}} on defense, and won five Gold Gloves in a six-year span. He stole 318 bases in his career, {{with a high}} of 56 and a {{four-year}} stretch when he averaged 40. Only four players in MLB history had 300 steals and a career batting average of at least [...]338; Gwynn {{was the only one}} of the four to have played since 1928. He was also just the 10th player to retire with over 3,000 hits and 300 steals. Gwynn in 1999 was the first National League player to reach 3,000 hits since Lou Brock in August 1979. Seven American Leaguers reached the mark after Brock and before Gwynn; all but one played at least 400 games as a designated hitter. An NL player could not be a DH until 1997, when it was allowed for the few interleague games that were played in AL parks. Just six of Gwynn's first 3,000 hits came as a designated hitter. [...] "If you want to do it in the National League, you have to play a position", he said. [...] "It's been 20 years since anybody has been able to do it. That tells you <b>how</b> <b>tough</b> <b>it</b> is to do it in this league." ...|$|E

Every one of the wood folks seemed to think that something more than suspending him from the club should be done to the member who had spoken out in meeting as Jimmy had, and while they were telling Mr. Crow what he ought to do I slipped off, for I knew that Mrs. Bunny was probably getting a bit angry because I'd been away from home so long.|$|E

5000|$|The {{interior}} {{splendor of}} the Chicago Club is as private as a stately home in England, which it much resembles in décor. Indeed, few pedestrians passing by the eight-story red-granite clubhouse at Van Buren and Michigan {{even know what the}} place is. Club members - with such names as Field, Pullman, Lincoln, McCormick, and Blair - may have shaped Chicago history. But they also have developed a sense of privacy that politely but firmly excludes: 1) The entire world, except for the club's 1,200 carefully selected members; 2) Until recently, women; and 3) Reporters and photographers.

Historians might argue that the Chicago Club no longer has the power it wielded in the days when its [...] "millionaires' table" [...] was the lunchtime gathering place of Marshall Field, George Pullman, N.
