2500|$|The Shark, {{which was}} {{formally}} announced at AERO Friedrichshafen in April 2007, {{was designed to}} fit into both European UL and US LSA categories.

The wing main spar is a dismountable two piece carbon fibre beam which joins under the front seat; an auxiliary spar carries the aileron and flap mountings. In plan the leading edge is elliptical and there is slight taper on the outer trailing edge where the ailerons are mounted. Single slotted, electrically operated flaps occupy the rest of the trailing edge. Like the wings, the slightly swept tailplanes are easily detached for storage of transport.

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{coefficients of}} polystyrene <b>foam</b> <b>filling</b> of thin-walled aluminum cylindrical tubes were investigated experimentally through compression testing of partially foam-filled tubes {{with and without}} adhesive. The experimental load-displacement curves and observation of the crushed sections of filled tubes have shown that partial <b>foam</b> <b>filling</b> reduced the fold length and hence increased the average crushing loads of tubes, proving the interaction effect between tube wall and filler.

40|$|The energy {{absorption}} in a foam-filled thin-walled circular Al tube was investigated {{based on the}} experimentally determined strengthening coefficient of filling using Al and polystyrene closed-cell foams with three different densities. <b>Foam</b> <b>filling</b> was found to change the deformation mode of tube from diamond (empty tube) into concertina, regardless the foam type and density used. Although <b>foam</b> <b>filling</b> resulted in higher {{energy absorption}} {{than the sum of}} the energy absorptions of the tube alone and foam alone, it was not effective in increasing the specific energy than simply thickening the tube wall. It was shown that for efficient <b>foam</b> <b>filling</b> an appropriate foam-tube combination must be selected by taking into account the magnitude of strengthening coefficient of <b>foam</b> <b>filling</b> and the <b>foam</b> filler plateau load.

The <b>foam</b> <b>filling</b> {{was found to}} shift the deformation mode of empty single tube and empty multi-tube designs from diamond into concertina. In multi-tube designs the constraint effects and the frictional forces were found to increase the average crushing loads over those of single tubes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Al {{closed-cell}} <b>foam</b> <b>filling</b> on the quasi-static crushing behavior of an E-glass woven fabric polyester composite tube and thin-walled Al/polyester composite hybrid tube was experimentally investigated. For comparison, empty Al, empty composite and empty hybrid tubes were also tested. Empty composite and empty hybrid tubes crushed predominantly in progressive crushing mode, without applying any triggering mechanism. <b>Foam</b> <b>filling</b> {{was found to}} be ineffective in increasing the crushing loads of the composite tubes over the sum of the crushing loads of empty composite tube and <b>foam.</b> However, <b>foam</b> <b>filling</b> stabilized the composite progressive crushing mode. In empty hybrid tubes, the deformation mode of the inner Al tube {{was found to be}} a more complex form of the diamond mode of deformation of empty Al tube, leading to higher crushing load values than the sum of the crushing load values of empty composite tube and empty metal tube. The <b>foam</b> <b>filling</b> of hybrid tubes however resulted in axial splitting of the outer composite tube due to the resistance imposed by the foam filler to Al tube inward folding and hence it was ineffective in increasing crushing load and SAE values over those of empty hybrid tubes.

40|$|In this paper, the low {{velocity}} impact {{characteristics and}} impact damage of sandwich composites, produced at four different core thicknesses from 3 -dimensional (3 D) integrated sandwich fabrics, {{with and without}} <b>foam</b> <b>filling,</b> have been examined. The 3 D sandwich fabrics have been produced using the same yarn and weaving densities. Thus, the impact characteristics are only affected by the core thickness and whether <b>foam</b> <b>filling</b> is used or not. Low velocity impact tests have been conducted at 32 and 48 J energy levels. The impact behavior has been determined {{as a function of}} the peak load, the energy to peak load, the time to peak load and the absorbed energy. The impact damage and the change in the compressive strength after impact have been analyzed. The findings obtained indicate that core-skin delamination on 3 D sandwich composites has been fully prevented. Impact tests carried out on integrated 3 D sandwich structures have shown that impact damage is limited to the vicinity of the point of impact and does not affect the integrity of the structure. This indicates that such damage can be easily repaired and the service life of the product can be sustained. status: publishe...|$|R
