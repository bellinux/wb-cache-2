5|$|A non-chemical {{vector control}} {{strategy}} involves <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulation</b> of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|An Auschwitz {{survivor}} {{with the}} mutant {{ability to generate}} powerful magnetic fields and manipulate metal, who was once friends with Xavier (with whom he helped to build Cerebro) until his belief that humans and mutants could never co-exist led to their separation, leaving him to develop a sophisticated knowledge in matters of <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulation,</b> which he uses {{in an attempt to}} mutate the world leaders in order to allow mutant prosperity.|$|E
5|$|A Mutant who {{was once}} Xavier's ally and close-friend, Magneto now {{believes}} mutants are superior to humans. Magneto wields the ability to manipulate metal magnetically, {{as well as the}} ability to create magnetic fields. He wears a helmet that renders him immune to Xavier's and all telepathic-based abilities. Imprisoned after his scheme in the first film, he is drugged by William Stryker for information on Cerebro, before making his escape and forming an alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker.

5|$|The {{members of}} SG-1 and General Hank Landry (Beau Bridges) are {{travelling}} on the Earth ship Odyssey to the Asgard home world, Orilla, when the Asgard Thor beams aboard. He reveals that after millennia of <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulation,</b> a disease has brought his race {{very close to}} extinction, and SG-1 accepts his offer to upload {{the sum of all}} Asgard's knowledge into Odyssey as a way to preserve the Asgard legacy after their mass suicide. However, Orilla and Odyssey are soon attacked by Ori warships. Orilla erupts with huge explosions, and after Odyssey escapes to the next planet with a Stargate and beams the bulk of its crew down, the Ori fire a final energy beam upon the ship. Lieutenant-Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) activates a localized time dilation field that makes time look frozen outside the field to give SG-1 and Landry time to find a defense.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of rats and mice used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulation</b> is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{computational}} {{methods have been}} shown to be well suited to unraveling the complex web of metabolic reactions in biological systems. Methods based on flux–balance analysis (FBA) and bi-level optimization have been used to great effect in aiding metabolic engineering. These methods predict the result of <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulations</b> and allow for the best set of manipulations to be found computationally. Bi-level FBA is, however, limited in applicability because the required computational time and resources scale poorly as the size of the metabolic system and the number of <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulations</b> increase. To overcome these limitations, we have developed Genetic Design through Local Search (GDLS), a scalable, heuristic, algorithmic method that employs an approach based on local search with multiple search paths, which results in effective, low-complexity search of the space of <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulations.</b> Thus, GDLS is able to find genetic designs with greater in silico production of desired metabolites than can feasibly be found using a globally optimal search and performs favorably in comparison with heuristic searches based on evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing.

25|$|Human-directed <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulation</b> of food {{began with}} the {{domestication}} {{of plants and animals}} through artificial selection at about 10,500 to 10,100 BC. The process of selective breeding, in which organisms with desired traits (and thus with the desired genes) are used to breed the next generation and organisms lacking the trait are not bred, is a precursor to the modern concept of genetic modification (GM). With the discovery of DNA in the early 1900s and various advancements in genetic techniques through the 1970s it became possible to directly alter the DNA and genes within food.|$|E

Studying signal transduction along with <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulation</b> within the early human embryo has the potential to provide answers to many developmental diseases and defects. Many human-specific signaling pathways have been discovered by studying human embryonic stem cells. Studying developmental pathways in humans has given developmental biologists more evidence toward the hypothesis that developmental pathways are conserved throughout species.|$|E

Ongoing research in hCG birth control vaccines has focused on improving immunogenicity. A vaccine in which the beta subunit of hCG is fused to the B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin has been effective in laboratory mice.

25|$|Animal models such as rodents, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans, {{have been}} used to observe the origins and/or extent of sex bias in the brain versus the hormone-producing gonads of an animal. With the rodents, studies on <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulation</b> of sex {{chromosomes}} resulted in an effect on one sex that was completely opposite of the effect in the other sex. For example, a knockout of a particular gene only resulted in anxiety-like effects in males. With studies on D. menlanogaster it was found that a large brain sex bias of expression occurred even after the gonads were removed, suggesting that sex bias could be independent of hormonal control in certain aspects.|$|E

50|$|After solving for the fluxes of {{reactions}} in the network, {{it is necessary}} to determine which reactions may be altered in order to maximize the yield of the desired product. To determine what specific <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulations</b> to perform, {{it is necessary to}} use computational algorithms, such as OptGene or OptFlux. They provide recommendations for which genes should be overexpressed, knocked out, or introduced in a cell to allow increased production of the desired product. For example, if a given reaction has particularly low flux and is limiting the amount of product, the software may recommend that the enzyme catalyzing this reaction should be overexpressed in the cell to increase the reaction flux. The necessary <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulations</b> can be performed using standard molecular biology techniques. Genes may be overexpressed or knocked out from an organism, depending on their effect on the pathway and the ultimate goal.|$|R
40|$|Mitochondrial {{dysfunction}} {{has been}} implicated {{in the development of}} insulin resistance (IR); however, a large variety of association and intervention studies as well as <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulations</b> in rodents have reported contrasting results. Indeed, even 39 years after the first publication describing a relationship between IR and diminished mitochondrial function, it is still unclear whether a direct relationship exists, and more importantly if changes in mitochondrial capacity are a cause or consequence of IR. This review will take a journey through the past and summarise the debate about the occurrence of mitochondrial dysfunction and its possible role in causing decreased insulin action in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Evidence is presented from studies in various human populations, as well as rodents with <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulations</b> of pathways known to affect mitochondrial function and insulin action. Finally, we have discussed whether mitochondria are a potential target for the treatment of IR...|$|R
25|$|Genetic engineering, {{recombinant}} DNA technology, genetic modification/manipulation (GM) {{and gene}} splicing are terms {{that apply to}} the direct manipulation of an organism's genes. Unlike traditional breeding, an indirect method of <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulation,</b> genetic engineering utilizes modern tools such as molecular cloning and transformation to directly alter the structure and characteristics of target genes. Genetic engineering techniques have found success in numerous applications. Some examples include the improvement of crop technology (not a medical application, but see biological systems engineering), the manufacture of synthetic human insulin {{through the use of}} modified bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse (cancer mouse) for research.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian {{cells with}} mutant ERCC1–XPF are {{moderately}} {{more sensitive than}} normal cells to agents (such as ionizing radiation) that cause double-stranded breaks in DNA. Particular pathways of both homologous recombination repair and non-homologous end-joining rely on ERCC1-XPF function. The relevant activity of ERCC1–XPF for both types of double-strand break repair {{is the ability to}} remove non-homologous 3′ single-stranded tails from DNA ends before rejoining. This activity is needed during a single-strand annealing subpathway of homologous recombination. Trimming of 3’ single-stranded tails is also needed in a mechanistically distinct subpathway of non-homologous end-joining, independent of the Ku proteins Homologous integration of DNA, an important technique for <b>genetic</b> <b>manipulation,</b> is dependent on the function of ERCC1-XPF in the host cell.|$|E
