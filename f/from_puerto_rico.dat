The Puerto Rican dollars that were collected by the government, were burned between January 16–24, 1925, drastically {{reducing the amount of}} surviving notes from the Bank of Puerto Rico. The Great Depression reduced their numbers further, since necessity prevented the collection of pesos in large denominations. Thus less than five exemplars are known to exist of the 100 and 200 peso banknotes issued by El Banco Español de Puerto Rico and the 5 and 10 dollars Series F bills published by the Bank of Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Cristobal was a {{moderately}} strong Atlantic tropical cyclone that affected multiple landmasses <b>from</b> <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rico</b> to Iceland in late August and early September2014. Slow to develop, and plagued by unfavorable wind shear {{for most of}} its life, the storm formed on August23 near the Caicos Islands from a long-tracked tropical wave. Moving generally northward, Cristobal gradually intensified despite a ragged appearance on satellite imagery, and passed midway between Bermuda and North Carolina on August 27. While accelerating toward the northeast the next day, Cristobal achieved its peak strength as a Category 1hurricane. A colder environment converted Cristobal into an extratropical cyclone on August29, but it retained much of its strength as it sped across the northern Atlantic and struck Iceland on September1.|$|E
