50|$|Owing {{to their}} high {{compression}} ratios and their high bmep, diesel engines place a high tensile stress on their cylinder block. Light alloy cylinder blocks have their usual weight advantages, but these must also withstand the high forces. Some designs, {{such as the}} US Hercules, achieve this by using long through bolts. In the Hercules design these are long studs with a nut at both top and bottom; they are prevented from rotating by an <b>eccentric</b> <b>collar</b> in the middle.|$|E
40|$|Lateral {{vibrations}} of stabilized bottomhole assemblies (BHA) of drill-strings often exhibit quite complicated patterns. Previous {{work has}} {{taken into account}} nonlinearities due to fluid damping, wall contact, <b>eccentric</b> <b>collars,</b> and initial curvature of the collar. This thesis addresses {{the effect of these}} forces, along with linear and parametric excitation of the lateral motion due to an applied static or dynamic weight on bit (WOB). The model is described by four state-space nonlinear ordinary differential equations in two-dimensional space. A static value of WOB along with a time variant zero-mean axial force are considered. The force is described either as a periodic deterministic function or as a stationary random process. Random and chaotic whirling characteristics of drill-strings are investigated using the minimum phase-volume deconvolution technique...|$|R
50|$|It is {{most often}} {{employed}} in steam engines and used to convert rotary into linear reciprocating motion in order to drive a sliding valve or a pump ram. In order to do so an eccentric usually has a groove at its circumference around which is closely fitted a circular <b>collar</b> (<b>eccentric</b> strap) attached to which an eccentric rod is suspended {{in such a way}} that its other end can impart the required reciprocating motion. A return crank fulfils the same function except that it can only work at the end of an axle or on the outside of a wheel whereas an eccentric can also be fitted to the body of the axle between the wheels. Unlike a cam, which also converts rotary into linear motion at almost any rate of acceleration and deceleration, an eccentric or return crank can only impart simple harmonic motion.|$|R
