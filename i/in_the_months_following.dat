5|$|In June 2013, Megadeth {{released}} its fourteenth studio album, Super Collider, to mixed critical reaction. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> the album's release, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine {{revealed that he}} {{and the rest of the}} band had already begun to discuss a follow-up, an urgency somewhat influenced by the then-recent death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman, which had reportedly given Mustaine a sense of mortality.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> the storm, Congress {{appointed}} a bipartisan committee {{to investigate the}} response to Hurricane Katrina and the preparations prior to its landfall. The committee concluded that the forecasts given by the National Weather Service were timely, were not responsible for failures in other agencies, and were likely responsible for saving thousands of lives that would have otherwise {{been lost in the}} raging hurricane.|$|E

5|$|A large {{broadcasting}} {{tower was}} {{needed in the}} Kantō region after NHK, Japan's public broadcasting station, began television broadcasting in 1953. Private broadcasting companies began operating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> the construction of NHK's own transmission tower. This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would soon be built all over Tokyo, eventually overrunning the city. The proposed solution was the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting to the entire region. Furthermore, because of the country's postwar boom in the 1950s, Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse.|$|E
5|$|As combat {{operations}} quickly revealed, {{the two sides}} were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been increased by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men. Later, given the press of tactical operations {{and the need to}} replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, however, {{substantial}} {{efforts to}} prevent further such occurrences had not materialized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> the accident. Labour activists, trade unions and workers were lobbying {{for the creation of}} an independent occupational health and safety institute. Social critics pointed out that the accident, along with several prior disasters such as the Kader toy factory fire, was part of a trend in which the country's rapid industrialization resulted in increasing health and environmental hazards due to poor regulations and lack of official willingness to tackle the issue.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> {{the first}} edition of Leaves of Grass, {{critical}} responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it. In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems, in August 1856. Leaves of Grass was revised and re-released in 1860 again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.|$|E
5|$|News of the Spartan defeat, accordingly, was a {{profound}} shock to Agesilaus, who soon {{returned home to}} Sparta. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> Agesilaus' departure, Iphicrates reversed many of the gains that the Spartans had made near Corinth, recapturing three of the forts that the Spartans had previously seized and garrisoned. He also launched several successful raids against Spartan allies in the region. Although the Spartans and their oligarchic allies continued to hold Lechaeum {{for the duration of}} the war, they curtailed their operations around Corinth, and no further major fighting occurred in the region.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Western Wall came under Israeli control in 1967, a tefillin stand was erected with {{permission}} from Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz, the first rabbi of the Kotel. The stand offers visitors the chance to put on Tefillin, a daily Jewish ritual. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> the Six-Day War an estimated 400,000 Jews observed this ritual at the stand. The stand is staffed by multilingual volunteers and an estimated 100,000 visitors put on tefillin there annually.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the ancient}} sources detail plots that Galerius made on Constantine's life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> Diocletian's abdication. They assert that Galerius {{assigned}} Constantine to lead an advance unit in a cavalry charge through a swamp on the middle Danube, made him enter into single combat with a lion, and attempted to kill him in hunts and wars. Constantine always emerged victorious: the lion emerged from the contest in a poorer condition than Constantine; Constantine returned to Nicomedia from the Danube with a Sarmatian captive to drop at Galerius' feet. It is uncertain how much these tales can be trusted.|$|E
5|$|Speaking at {{the string}} theory {{conference at the}} University of Southern California in 1995, Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study made the {{surprising}} suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality {{and the appearance of}} two- and five-dimensional branes in string theory. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in an important way. Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for developing and enforcing regulations for pipeline operation transportation having been created in 2004 within the United States Department of Transportation. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> the spill, {{they found that the}} in-line inspection tool used by Plains in Line 901 and Line 903 had miscalculated the degree of corrosion. The company also withheld in-line inspection data so “it could enhance its interpretation of the data,” according to a corrective order issued by PHMSA. In October, PHMSA proposed new rules to assist in preventing such inspection discrepancies.|$|E

5|$|The Port Chicago {{disaster}} highlighted systemic racial {{inequality in}} the Navy. A {{year before the}} disaster, in mid-1943, the U.S. Navy had over 100,000 African Americans in service but not one black officer. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> the disaster, the Pittsburgh Courier, a newspaper with a large nationwide subscription primarily of African Americans, related the incident and the subsequent mutiny trial in their Double V campaign, a push for victory over not just the Axis powers but also over racial inequality at home. The mutiny trial was seen as underscoring the tense race relations {{in the armed forces}} at the time.|$|E
5|$|The border fortifications were {{progressively}} {{torn down}} and eventually abandoned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> its opening. Dozens of new crossings were opened by February 1990, and the guards no longer carried weapons nor made much effort to check travellers' passports. The guards' numbers were rapidly reduced; half were dismissed within {{five months of}} the opening. On 1July 1990 the border was abandoned and the Grenztruppen were officially abolished; all but 2,000 of them were dismissed or transferred to other jobs.|$|E
5|$|To {{help the}} Apalachicola Bay {{shellfish}} industry recover, special regulations {{were put in}} place to monitor harvests, and $2 million was designated toward rehabilitation efforts. Using a portion of the funds, out-of-work oyster catchers were employed to repopulate crucial reefs. The state of Florida also issued a grant to help individuals in the crippled seafood industry make necessary payments. Efforts to help newly unemployed individuals in the shellfish industry continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> the storm; local Tallahassee musicians organized a benefit concert in January 1986 to raise money for families of oystermen in Franklin County.|$|E

5|$|With {{a budget}} of $2 million and 350,000 lines of C++ and UnrealScript, Unreal Tournament took almost {{a year and a}} half to develop. When Unreal (the first {{installment}} of the Unreal series) was released in May 1998, it was well received by the press. However, it soon became apparent that the quality of the network code used for multiplayer matches was hampering the game's further success. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> Unreals release, improving the game's multiplayer part became the top priority of the development team. Epic Games started considering an official expansion pack intended to improve the network code while also featuring new maps and other gameplay elements.|$|E
5|$|During the Act's early history, Section 3(c) {{was little}} used; no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were bailed in, {{including}} 16 {{local governments and}} the states of Arkansas and New Mexico. Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4(b) coverage formula unconstitutional in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), it did not hold Section 3(c) unconstitutional. Therefore, jurisdictions may continue to be bailed-in and subjected to Section 3(c) preclearance. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following</b> Shelby County, courts began to consider requests by the Attorney General and other plaintiffs to bail in the states of Texas and North Carolina, and in January 2014 a federal court bailed in Evergreen, Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} {{returned to}} prominence in late 2013 with {{the propagation of}} CryptoLocker—using the Bitcoin digital currency platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on Bitcoin transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, the operators of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>following,</b> including CryptoLocker 2.0 (though not {{to be related to}} CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major design flaw that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location, due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting network-attached storage devices produced by Synology. In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled attacks have occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through ransomware designed to target Linux-based web servers.|$|E
