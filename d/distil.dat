5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to <b>distil</b> alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E

50|$|A <b>distilled</b> {{drink or}} liquor is an {{alcoholic}} drink produced by <b>distilling</b> (i.e., concentrating by distillation) ethanol produced {{by means of}} fermenting grain, fruit, or vegetables. Unsweetened, <b>distilled,</b> alcoholic drinks that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits. For the most common <b>distilled</b> drinks, such as whiskey and vodka, the alcohol content is around 40%. The term hard liquor is used in North America to distinguish <b>distilled</b> drinks from undistilled ones (implicitly weaker). Vodka, gin, baijiu, tequila, whiskey, brandy, and soju are examples of <b>distilled</b> drinks. <b>Distilling</b> concentrates the alcohol and eliminates some of the congeners. Freeze distillation concentrates ethanol along with methanol and fusel alcohols (fermentation by-products partially removed by distillation) in applejack.|$|R
25|$|The V-2 {{consumed}} a {{third of}} Germany's fuel alcohol production and major portions of other critical technologies: to <b>distil</b> the fuel alcohol for one V-2 launch required 30 tonnes of potatoes {{at a time when}} food was becoming scarce. Due to a lack of explosives, concrete was used and sometimes the warhead contained photographic propaganda of German citizens who had died in Allied bombing.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{variation}} was to distill in {{the presence}} of sulphuric acid. Although the acid itself does not <b>distil,</b> it imparts the additional aroma of diethyl ether to the resulting gin. Sulphuric acid subtracts one water molecule from two ethanol molecules to create diethyl ether, which also forms an azeotrope with ethanol, and therefore distils with it. The result is a sweeter spirit, and one that may have possessed additional analgesic or even intoxicating effects – see Paracelsus.|$|E

A network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air, driven by electric fans, around the ship, and First Class cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters.|$|E

The effect of the condensation cover on the two <b>distilled</b> productivity by using a glassy and a plastic covers has been studied. From the laboratory experiments, the <b>distilled</b> with the glass cover had a good productivity compared with the other one. After this step, the researcher tried to increase and improve the <b>distilled</b> productivity by adding the coal powder to the <b>distilled</b> base after mixing the powder with the black dye and compares it with a <b>distilled</b> paints with the black dye only. Adding the coal powder to the black dye increased the <b>distilled</b> efficiency approximately with a percentage of (8. 2 %). The highest efficiency of the solar <b>distilled</b> with the glassy cover and the base dyed with the black dye was (57. 2 %), while the highest efficiency of the solar <b>distilled</b> with the glassy cover and the base dyed with the black dye that mixed with the coal powder was (65. 4 %) ...|$|R

500|$|In his {{introduction}} to the 1997 Penguin edition, Robert Murray Davis suggests that in part, the book reflected Waugh's reconsideration of his position as a Catholic writer, {{in the light of}} the recent Oldmeadow furore over Black Mischief. He may have developed a more serious tone to pre-empt further criticism from that quarter, although Stannard maintains that Waugh's beginnings as a serious writer date back to 1929, when he was completing Vile Bodies. [...] Waugh's own comment, in 1946, was that he was not, according to his own understanding of the term, a [...] "satirical" [...] writer, and that in writing the book he was merely [...] "trying to <b>distil</b> comedy and sometimes tragedy from the knockabout farce of people's outward behaviour".|$|E
500|$|Film scholar Stephen Teo {{posits that}} Mughal-e-Azam is a [...] "national allegory", a stylistic way of appropriating history and {{heritage}} to emphasise the national identity. He believes {{the arrogance of}} Bahar represents {{the power of the}} state and that Anarkali's emotion, which is highly personal, represents the private individual. Teo states that the theme of romantic love defeating social class difference and power hierarchy, as well as the grandeur of the filming, contribute to the film's attractiveness. Author Ashis Nandy has commented on the poetic quality of the dialogue, saying that [...] "the characters of Mughal-e-Azam do not just speak– they refine communication, they <b>distil</b> it, they crystallize it into many faceted glittering gems, they make poetry of ordinary language." [...] Gowri Ramnarayan of The Hindu has also emphasised the power of the dialogues in the film in that they [...] "create not only the ambiance of this period drama, but also etch character and situation. Every syllable breathes power and emotion." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, the St. Petersburg Free Economic Society started to search for {{information}} about combustible minerals which as fuels would replace the decreasing stock of trees in the European part of Russia. As a result of these inquiries, the Society received information about a combustible mineral found at the Kohala Manor near Rakvere. According to the landlord of the Kohala estate, Baron Fabian Reinhold Ungern-Sternberg, the 'burning rock' was discovered at a depth of about ten meters when a spring was opened on the slope of a sandy hump, as it was during the digging of a well some years earlier on the same slope. [...] This discovery was briefly mentioned in a paper prepared by the German chemist Johann Gottlieb Georgi and presented by the Actual State Councillor Anton-Johann Engelhardt at the meeting of the Society in 1789. [...] The first scientific research into the rock's oil yield, using samples from the Vanamõisa village of the Kohala Manor, was published by Georgi at the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1791. In 1838 and 1839, the Baltic German geologist Gregor von Helmersen published a detailed description of the deposits of kukersite in Vanamõisa and graptolitic argillite in Keila-Joa. In 1838 he made a thorough experiment to <b>distil</b> oil from the Vanamõisa oil shale deposit.|$|E

Some Canadian provinces also experimented with prohibition as well, but alcohol manufacturers in Canada were still allowed to <b>distil</b> liquor for export. A French law forbidding the importation of foreign liquor was repealed in 1922, drastically increasing the alcohol smuggling operations. Canadian whisky, Caribbean rum and legally imported French wines and spirits were the main products smuggled into and then reshipped from the islands.|$|E
