50|$|Connected {{with the}} energy states of the atom's {{electrons}} are four quantum numbers: n, ℓ, mℓ, and ms. These specify the complete, unique quantum state of a single electron in an atom, and make up its wavefunction or orbital. The wavefunction of the Schrödinger equation reduces to three equations that when solved, lead to the <b>first</b> three <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers.</b> Therefore, the equations for the <b>first</b> three <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> are all interrelated. The azimuthal <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> arose in {{the solution of the}} polar part of the wave equation as shown below. To aid understanding of this concept of the azimuth, it may also prove helpful to review spherical coordinate systems, and/or other alternative mathematical coordinate systems besides the Cartesian coordinate system. Generally, the spherical coordinate system works best with spherical models, the cylindrical system with cylinders, the cartesian with general volumes, etc.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the hadron vector {{resonances}} are described by fields transforming according to different inequivalent representations of the Lorentz group: (1 / 2, 1 / 2) and (1, 0) + (0, 1). The vector representation (1 / 2, 1 / 2) is well studied and corresponds to the gauge fields. On the other hand, the chiral representations (1, 0) and (0, 1) are described by the second rank antisymmetric tensor fields, for which interaction theory {{has not yet been}} constructed. In the framework of the phenomenological Nambu– Jona-Lasinio approach we have introduced and used all these fields for a description of the vector resonances. A new mass relation between low-lying hadron vector and axial-vector resonances is obtained. This relation is in agreement with the present The bound states of a quark and an antiquark are characterized by the <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> JPC, where J is the total angular momentum, P is the parity and C is the charge conjugation.

Two types of systems are discussed in detail: ``gluelumps'' which have a heavy adjoint color charge at the origin and glueballs which are composed entirely of glue. Both systems are discussed using the bag model and the flux tube model. For glueballs the model spectra are compared with the resulst of Teper.

50|$|The {{azimuthal}} <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> is a <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> for {{an atomic}} orbital that determines its {{orbital angular momentum}} and describes {{the shape of the}} orbital.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{controlled}} microscopic study of mobile {{holes in the}} spatially anisotropic (Abelian) gapped phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model. We address the properties of (i) a single hole [its internal degrees of freedom {{as well as its}} hopping properties]; (ii) a pair of holes [their (relative) particle statistics and interactions]; (iii) the collective state for a finite density of holes. We find that each hole in the doped model has an eight-dimensional internal space, characterized by three internal <b>quantum</b> numbers: the <b>first</b> two "fractional" <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> describe the binding to the hole of the fractional excitations (fluxes and fermions) of the undoped model, while the third "spin" <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> determines the local magnetization around the hole. The fractional <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> also encode fundamentally distinct particle properties, topologically robust against small local perturbations: some holes are free to hop in two dimensions, while others are confined to hop in one dimension only; distinct hole types have different particle statistics, and in particular, some of them exhibit non-trivial (anyonic) relative statistics. These particle properties in turn determine the physical properties of the multi-hole ground state at finite doping, and we identify two distinct ground states with different hole types that are stable for different model parameters. The respective hopping dimensionalities manifest themselves in an electrical conductivity approximately isotropic in one ground state and extremely anisotropic in the other one. We also compare our microscopic study with related mean-field treatments, and discuss the main discrepancies between the two approaches, which in particular involve the possibility of binding fractional excitations as well as the particle statistics of the holes.

50|$|The {{question}} of how many <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> are needed to describe any given system has no universal answer. Hence for each system one must find the answer for a full analysis of the system.

There is one <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> of the system corresponding to the energy, i.e., the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian. There is also one <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> for each operator O that commutes with the Hamiltonian. These are all the <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> that the system can have. Note that the operators O defining the <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> should be independent of each other. Often, {{there is more than}} one way to choose a set of independent operators.

The magnetic <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> distinguishes the orbitals available within a subshell, and is used to calculate the azimuthal component of the orientation of orbital in space. Electrons in a particular subshell (such as s, p, d, or f) are defined by values of ℓ (0, 1, 2, or 3). The value of m can range from -ℓ to +ℓ, inclusive of zero. Thus the s, p, d, and f subshells contain 1, 3, 5, and 7 orbitals each, with values of m within the ranges ±0, ±1, ±2, ±3 respectively. Each of these orbitals can accommodate up to two electrons (with opposite spins), forming the basis of the periodic table.|$|R
