5|$|The novel's {{reception}} amongst literary reviewers was mixed; while {{writers such}} as George Eliot professed profound admiration, others such as Thomas Carlyle were harshly critical. Although no longer widely read as a literary work, it remains significant <b>in</b> <b>intellectual</b> history for its accounts of Victorian scepticism and the Oxford Movement.|$|E
5|$|Yeats's mystical inclinations, {{informed}} by Hindu Theosophical beliefs and the occult, provided {{much of the}} basis of his late poetry, which some critics have judged as lacking <b>in</b> <b>intellectual</b> credibility. The metaphysics of Yeats's late works must be read in relation to his system of esoteric fundamentals in A Vision (1925).|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} {{concentration}} of se-rum homocysteine <b>in</b> <b>intellectuals</b> and the re-lated influential factors. Methods: The concen-trations serum homocysteine and saliva cortisol were measured <b>in</b> 138 <b>intellectuals</b> from three cities, Tianjin, Guangzhou and Chengdu in China. All the subjects had senior titles of tech-nical post, aged 40 - 69 years. Results: The mean value of serum homocysteine concentration <b>in</b> <b>intellectuals</b> was 20. 6 ± 0. 8 μmol/L, higher than the reference value. With the increase of cortisol levels the homocysteine concentrations rise (P < 0. 05). The mean value of homocysteine con-centration was highest in 40 - 49 years old group. Men had higher homocysteine level than women in this investigation. According to the mean value of homocysteine concentration among different cities, Tianjin was highest, Chengdu medium, Guangzhou lowest. Conclusion: The serum homocysteine concentration of intellec-tuals {{is higher than the}} reference value. The stress level, gender and resident cities might contribute to the differences in serum homo-cysteine concentration <b>in</b> Chinese <b>intellectuals...</b>|$|R

5|$|Cope {{had three}} children, Elizabeth, Martha Ann, and Daniel. Martha Ann died {{shortly after her}} birth. His son, Daniel, was born with severe autism; he has lived {{most of his life}} at the Allegheny Valley School, an {{institution}} specializing <b>in</b> <b>intellectual</b> developmental disabilities. Cope devoted much of his time and energy to Pittsburgh causes addressing autism, and spoke candidly about his experiences as the parent of a child with autism and his efforts to better educate the public at large about autism.|$|E
5|$|During their {{relatively}} short tenure, the Ayyubids ushered {{in an era}} of economic prosperity in the lands they ruled, and the facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence <b>in</b> <b>intellectual</b> activity in the Islamic world. This period was also marked by an Ayyubid process of vigorously strengthening Sunni Muslim dominance in the region by constructing numerous madrasas (Islamic schools of law) in their major cities.|$|E
5|$|For ten centuries {{after the}} fall of the Roman Empire, {{lesbianism}} disappeared from literature. Foster points to the particularly strict view that Eve—representative of all women—caused the downfall of mankind; original sin among women was a particular concern, especially because women were perceived as creating life. During this time, women were largely illiterate and not encouraged to engage <b>in</b> <b>intellectual</b> pursuit, so men were responsible for shaping ideas about sexuality.|$|E

5|$|In September 1913, an International Commission of the European Powers convened to {{determine}} the boundary between Greece and Albania. The delegates of the commission aligned themselves into two camps: those of Italy and Austro-Hungary insisted that the Northern Epirus districts were Albanian, while those of the Triple Entente (the United Kingdom, France, and Russia) took the view that although the older generations in some villages spoke Albanian, the younger generation was Greek <b>in</b> <b>intellectual</b> outlook, sentiment, and aspirations. Under Italian and Austro-Hungarian pressure, the commission determined that the region of Northern Epirus would be ceded to Albania.|$|E
5|$|Intellectual Disability – Athletes with a {{significant}} impairment <b>in</b> <b>intellectual</b> functioning and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour. The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities, but the disability group Intellectual Disability {{has been added to}} some Paralympic Games. This includes only elite athletes with intellectual disabilities diagnosed before the age of 18. However, the IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games are open to all people with intellectual disabilities.|$|E
5|$|People {{who engage}} <b>in</b> <b>intellectual</b> {{activities}} such as reading, playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing musical instruments, or regular social interaction show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease. This {{is compatible with the}} cognitive reserve theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations. Education delays the onset of AD syndrome without changing the duration of the disease. Learning a second language even later in life seems to delay getting Alzheimer disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{facilities}} and patronage {{provided by the}} Ayyubids led to a resurgence <b>in</b> <b>intellectual</b> activity in different branches of knowledge and learning throughout the territories they controlled. They took special interest {{in the fields of}} medicine, pharmacology, and botany. Saladin built and maintained two hospitals in Cairo emulating the well-known Nuri Hospital in Damascus which not only treated patients, but also provided medical schooling. Many scientists and physicians flourished in this period in Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. Among them were Maimonides, Ibn Jami, Abdul Latif al-Baghdadi, al-Dakhwar, Rashidun al-Suri, and Ibn al-Baitar. Some of these scholars served the Ayyubid household directly, becoming the personal physicians of sultans.|$|E
