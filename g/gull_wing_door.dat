25|$|It is {{a version}} of Corvette coupe {{designed}} by Giorgetto and Fabrizio Giugiaro of Italdesign, commemorating 50 years of the Chevrolet Corvette. It included 6.0 litre V8 engine, door window half dome, <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>door</b> hinged to the rear pillar.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1984 by Danny Maher, {{marketing}} a four-seat homebuilt aircraft based on the Long-EZ design. The first prototype flew in 1985. The company was sold to Scott and Duane Swing in 1992. In 1995, the cockpit design was changed, adding a <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>door</b> design.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of the Z9 is the <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>door,</b> though unusually conventional doors are also fitted into the gull wings, allowing the doors to function in both ways. The full-length gull wing doors can be opened automatically at the press of a button on the electronic key. Depressing the button on the remote control will both open and close a door.|$|E

50|$|The Mk IV was a kit car, {{offered as}} a coupe with <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors</b> and as an open sports car. Over 200 were {{produced}} between 1962 and 1964.|$|R
5000|$|The IPD C30 {{includes}} a supercharged 5-cylinder engine with belt-driven supercharger with [...] of boost, a nitrous tank, <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors,</b> and Alcantara seats, Alpine and Apple audio system.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the shape}} of the vehicle and the flat roof that {{continued}} {{to the rear of the}} vehicle, opening the rear hatch had some drawbacks in low clearance environments. The lower part of the hatch was not like one used on a station wagon that went all the way down to the rear bumper, so loading cargo into the back wasn't as convenient as a conventional station wagon with a one piece hatchback. The rear hatch also wrapped into the rear roof, similar to a <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>door</b> so that the rear glass was in two pieces, one for the back window, and another partially on the rear roof. When open, the hatch rose above the roof at a right angle, providing additional overhead clearance when the hatch was open.|$|E
50|$|The Shalako was {{featured}} {{on the cover of}} seven national car magazines where it caught the attention of Malcolm Bricklin. Bricklin contracted Dean to develop his sports car concept into a full production vehicle named the Bricklin in the early 1970s. The Bricklin carried an impact-absorbing bumper, longer nose, and the signature <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The design {{features}} a cantilever mid-wing, two seats in side-by-side configuration, retractable {{tricycle landing gear}} made from titanium and a single [...] Rotax 912ULS four cylinder, liquid and air-cooled, four stroke engine in tractor configuration. Cockpit access is by two <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors</b> hinged at the top. The aircraft was designed to meet aerobatic category requirements, including +9 and -4.5 g.|$|R
50|$|Based on the short-wheelbase (6-foot 3 inch) Austin Seven chassis, {{with its}} 747 cc engine (hence the model name). Later a long-wheelbase (6-foot 9 inch) version was offered. The price of both was the same: £78 for the shell and £25 {{for the hard}} top. The early hardtops had <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors</b> but it is {{believed}} that none have survived. When Pellandine left, he took the rights to build the short-wheelbase version, while Ashley just manufactured the long version.|$|R
50|$|The DA-200 is a two place {{side-by-side}} configuration, {{low wing}} aircraft with {{tricycle landing gear}} and <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors.</b> It features a double tapered wing, similar to a Mooney 201, and a swept tail with dorsal fin similar to a Cessna 172. The aircraft uses all aluminum construction. It was the first demonstrated {{in a line of}} aircraft intended to be built in Fargo, North Dakota. The producers hoped to capitalize on the lack of prior manufacturing liability.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} 1960s, Dean built many dune buggies on {{shortened}} Volkswagen Beetle chassis with fiberglass Meyers Manx bodies. Capitalizing on this premise, in 1968-69 Dean created {{his own body}} for a shortened Volkswagen chassis, the Shalako. The first car had an aluminum skin, but production models were built with fiberglass bodies. The low-slung two seater featured <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors</b> and a low, flat windshield. A later model, the Shala-Vette, had a longer nose and conventional doors. Model car manufacturer MPC produced 1/20 scale models of the Shalako and Shala-Vette.|$|R
5000|$|The Mangusta was {{designed}} by Giorgetto Giugiaro, which is easily recognised by its <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors</b> over the engine and luggage compartment. The European version was fitted with a mid-mounted [...] Ford 289 V8 engine, driven through a 5-speed ZF transaxle; in North America a [...] Ford 302 V8 was used. All round disc brakes and independent suspension, rack & pinion steering, air conditioning, and power windows were fitted, ahead of other manufacturers of the time. Journalist Paul Frère claimed he achieved {{a top speed of}} 250 km/h (155 mph).|$|R
50|$|The Che-25 has a flat sided, {{two step}} hull formed from a vacuum moulded {{fibreglass}} sandwich. The integral fin forms a cruciform tail with a swept, tapered, straight edged fin initially carried a balanced rudder, though the Che-25M variant with its higher tailplane abandoned the balance. The underwing cabin has dual controls and is entered via <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors.</b> There is a water rudder attached just aft {{of the rear}} step. The optional land undercarriage has mainwheels on mid-fuselage mounted legs, which rotate forward through 90° to allow water landings, and a tailwheel fixed to the water rudder.|$|R
50|$|The Gullwing in turn {{evolved into}} the GT Fastback, {{also known as the}} 'Breadvan'. All 18 fastbacks made in 1963 went into racing, and like the Xylon and Gullwing they were FIA homologated in the GT category. However, without the <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors</b> the fastback's were awkward {{to get in and out}} of. Drivers {{included}} Jackie Oliver, Terry Sanger, and Derek Bell, and Jem Marsh of course. The sales brochure for the Fastback included options for 5 speed gearbox (Hewland), dry sump, 997cc (84 to 88 bhp) and 1148cc (102 to 104 bhp) full race engines, light alloy bellhousing, 72 litre fuel tank (for endurance racing), light weight alloy oil cooler, perspex windscreen (saving 15 lbs).|$|R
5000|$|Today, the 300 SL {{with its}} <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors,</b> {{technological}} firsts, and low production numbers {{is considered one}} of the most collectible Mercedes-Benz models, with prices generally in the US$1,000,000-2,500,000 range. [...] Sports Car International magazine ranked the 300 SL as the number 5 sports car of all time. A pair of 300 SLs for sale in 2009 were offered at over $1.3M USD from the Foxwood Collection. In 2012, an ultra rare 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300 SL with an all-aluminum body was sold for US$4.62 million at the Scottsdale Auctions in Arizona. Given the stratospheric prices that a 300 SL commands, many car enthusiast have turned towards the smaller 190 SL, often referred as the [...] "poor man's 300 SL" [...] as its acquisition costs are a tenth that of the 300 SL's.|$|R
5000|$|... === Z9 concept === The BMW Z9 (or Z9 Gran Turismo, Z9 GT) is {{a concept}} coupe {{introduced}} in 1999 by BMW at the Frankfurt Auto Show. During the 2000 Paris Auto Show a convertible variant of the Z9 was debuted. The Z9 featured a carbon fiber skin over an aluminum space frame. Much of the styling found on the current E63 6 series {{is derived from the}} Z9. The vehicle also featured unique <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors</b> that also opened like a conventional hinged door. The Z9 did not make it into production, but many of its innovations did. The interior included an early concept of BMW's iDrive system, called the Intuitive Interaction Concept. The Z9 featured the world's first V8 turbo diesel that's not used by trucks and SUVs, later produced for the BMW 7 Series 740d model.|$|R
5000|$|Set in a 1980s {{technological}} future, {{the video}} opens {{with the band}} walking into a theater hall through an automated door. A RoboCop-like figure points, saying [...] "sign in please", a direct reference to the album on which the song appears. In an occurrence of product placement, a ray of light reveals a PaperMate Sharpwriter mechanical pencil, which had been released earlier that year. Using the pencil, the band members provide their signatures next to their names (listed along with their respective musical instruments) on a paper during which the pencil's name is prominently featured. Drummer Keni Richards writes an X, which sets off an error alarm; Keni then erases it and signs properly. The band is then seen performing the song to a crowd. The video ends with Autograph boarding a limousine resembling a DeLorean DMC-12 by its <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors.</b> Lead vocalist Steve Plunkett throws the pencil {{to one of the}} female fans before leaving. The cyborg hand at the steering wheel {{turns out to be the}} robot from the start of the video, and the final shot reveals the robot's head as the door closes.|$|R
5000|$|Designed in 1975 {{and first}} flown in 1981, the Orion {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} kitbuilt aircraft to be constructed from composite materials. [...] It is a low wing cantilever monoplane with a T-tail, of conventional layout except for its pusher configuration; this places the cabin well ahead of the leading edge and provides an excellent downward view. The Orion is built from Kevlar reinforced glassfibre shells, with foam filling in the wings. The latter, which have 4.5° of dihedral, are straight edged and only slightly tapered, with blunt tips. They carry electrically driven split flaps. [...] Its cabin seats four in two side-by-side rows and is entered by centrally hinged <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> <b>doors.</b> The engine, a Lycoming O-360 variant of either 180 hp or 200 hp (134/149 kW) is mounted over the wing trailing edge line and drives a three-bladed propeller, mounted at the extreme tail, via a long shaft. [...] Behind the wing the fuselage tapers on its underside; it carries a broad fin with a straight, swept leading edge and rudder, on top of which is the straight, tapered tailplane and horn balanced elevators. Below the fuselage is a long, shallow ventral strake. The tricycle undercarriage is electrically retractable. The main legs fold inwards; when deployed, they splay out strongly.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> {{was first}} {{seen on a}} glider when the Weltensegler flew in 1921. Its wings were {{externally}} braced and featured swept-back wingtips. After the aircraft broke up, killing its pilot, the design feature stayed out of popular use. The <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> made a resurgence in 1930 with Alexander Lippisch's record-breaking Fafnir. Lippisch used the configuration for its increased wingtip clearance and the ill-founded belief it improved stability in turns. However, {{studies have shown that}} normal <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> configurations have significantly less severe and more easily recoverable stalls. Inverted <b>gull</b> <b>wings</b> show the opposite stall behaviour, but both normal and inverted <b>gull</b> <b>wings</b> impede lift/drag ratio and climb performance. [...] The true success of the Fafnir's <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> lay primarily in its aesthetic value; the <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> would be a staple of the high-performance sailplanes of the time, until the 1950s.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> design {{found its}} way into {{seaplanes}} by the early 1930s. As engine power increased, so did the need for large propellers that could effectively convert power to thrust. The <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> allowed designers to ensure adequate propeller tip clearance over the water by placing the engines on the highest point of the wing. The alternative was placing the engine on a pylon. Possibly the first flying boat to utilize the <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> configuration was the Short Knuckleduster, which flew in 1933. The Dornier Do 26, a high-speed airliner and transport platform, of which 6 aircraft were built, flew in 1938. The configuration was also used on the US Navy's PBM Mariner and P5M Marlin maritime patrol aircraft. The emergence of long range, land-based jets in the 1950s and the subsequent demise of the seaplane prevented widespread use of the <b>gull</b> <b>wing,</b> although it was still used in some post-war designs, like Beriev Be-12 Chaika (the name means 'the gull' in Russian).|$|R
