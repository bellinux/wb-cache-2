5|$|The land {{cleared of}} trees largely became pasture. From the 1880s, {{clearing}} {{of land for}} <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> increased, especially in the areas around Tahakopa and the Owaka River valley. Considerable sheep and <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> continues on the cleared hills {{on the periphery of}} the region, and this accounts for much of the Catlins' income. A rural polytechnic specialising in agricultural science (Telford Rural Polytechnic) is located south of Balclutha close to the northeastern edge of the Catlins.|$|E

5|$|After {{a decline}} in the 1890s, the logging of native timber {{expanded}} into new areas made accessible by an extension of the railway, before petering out in the mid-20th century. One nail in the industry's coffin came with a series of bushfires which destroyed several mills in 1935. The cleared land was used primarily for pastoral sheep and <b>dairy</b> <b>farming,</b> which continues to be a mainstay of the Catlins' economy. Much of the remaining forest is now protected by the Department of Conservation as part of the Catlins Conservation Park.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that (bilateral) auctions of {{production}} quotas induced a rapid convergence in <b>dairy</b> <b>farm</b> size within provinces {{in the early years}} of Canada’s supply management policy and that this effect was stronger in provinces with a larger number of <b>dairy</b> <b>farms.</b> This contributed to the smallness and homogeneity of Quebec <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> relative to <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> in Western Canada. In Quebec, most <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> still rely on the tie-stall milking system, while <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> in Western provinces are larger and use larger-scale, lower-cost technologies. Regulations on Quebec’s quota exchange have slowed down the pace at which a farm can acquire production quota, exacerbating the effects of input lumpiness, on <b>dairy</b> <b>farm</b> efficiency. Low trading on the production exchange severely constrains production adjustments, making, scale, allocative, and technical inefficiencies more persistent and investment in herd expansion unprofitable...|$|R

In the early days of European settlement the area was frequented by whalers and sealers, and saw milling became a major local industry from the mid-19th century until the 1930s.

40|$|Evaluation of {{the general}} <b>farm</b> {{characteristics}} and <b>dairy</b> herd structure was undertaken in urban and peri-urban dairy production system in the Addis Ababa milk shed. A total of 41 <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> were selected randomly from three production sub-systems (intar-urban, large peri-urban and secondary town sub-systems), and cross sectional survey was implemented across all the production sub-systems. The result indicated that, female-headed family. owned 24. 4 % of the <b>dairy</b> <b>farms,</b> where the largest proportion was observed in intra-urban <b>dairy</b> <b>farms</b> (40 %). The proportion of <b>dairy</b> <b>farm</b> owners being farmers was 34. 2 % followed by household wives (14. 6 %). About 78 % of the <b>dairy</b> <b>farm</b> owners were literate (39 % above secondary), while 22 % were illiterate.

5|$|The {{only part}} of the region that is {{predominantly}} given over to crops is the land around the Humber estuary, where the well-drained fens result in excellent quality land. The lowland Cheshire Plain is mostly given over to <b>dairy</b> <b>farming,</b> while in the Pennines and Cheviots grazing sheep play an important role not just in agriculture but also in land management more generally. Heather moorland in the Pennine uplands is home to driven grouse shooting from 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth) until 10 December every year. In the twentieth century, numbers of red grouse and black grouse in the area fell significantly, but improved gamekeeping practices have resulted in both species making a comeback in the region.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th century, Ceredigion had more {{industry}} {{than it does}} today; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour.

During the last century, livestock farming has become less profitable, and the population of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated to other countries. More recently, the population has started rising again as elderly people move into the county for retirement, and various government and European Union initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income.|$|E
5|$|Wool was New Zealand's major {{agricultural}} export {{during the}} late 19th century. Even {{as late as the}} 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues, but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers. In contrast <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> increased, with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007, to become New Zealand's largest export earner. In the year to June 2009, dairy products accounted for 21% ($9.1 billion) of total merchandise exports, and the country's largest company, Fonterra, controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade. Other agricultural exports in 2009 were meat 13.2%, wool 6.3%, fruit 3.5% and fishing 3.3%.

25|$|The {{success of}} {{refrigeration}} was {{directly related to}} the growth and development of farming in the country. In the 19th century, the bulk of economic activity was in the South Island of New Zealand. From around 1900, <b>dairy</b> <b>farming</b> became increasingly viable in areas which were less suitable for sheep, particularly in Northland, the Waikato and Taranaki.
